Depthwise separable convolutions, while computationally efficient, introduce a nuanced relationship with GPU memory usage.  My experience optimizing neural networks for embedded systems, particularly those with limited memory bandwidth, highlighted a crucial point: the impact on GPU memory isn't solely determined by the operation's computational complexity but also by the dataflow and the underlying hardware architecture.  Contrary to initial intuition, depthwise separable convolutions *can* reduce memory requirements under certain circumstances, but can also increase them depending on implementation details and input dimensions.

The core issue lies in the decomposition of a standard convolution into two distinct operations: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution.  A standard convolution applies a single kernel across all input channels simultaneously, producing one output channel per kernel.  Depthwise convolution, in contrast, applies a separate kernel to each input channel independently.  This generates the same number of output channels as input channels, each a filtered version of its corresponding input channel.  The pointwise convolution then combines these channels using 1x1 convolutions, effectively creating the final output channels.  This decomposition changes the data flow and the intermediate tensor sizes, significantly influencing memory usage.

**Explanation:**

The memory impact hinges on several factors. Firstly, a standard convolution requires loading the entire input feature map into memory, along with the kernel weights.  The output feature map is then computed and stored before being passed to the next layer. This leads to significant memory occupancy, especially with large kernels and high-resolution input images.  Depthwise separable convolution, on the other hand, processes each input channel independently. While the depthwise convolution still requires loading the entire input feature map, it processes it channel-by-channel, potentially allowing for partial storage or efficient reuse of intermediate results.  Crucially, the intermediate tensor resulting from the depthwise convolution is generally smaller than the output of a standard convolution with the same kernel size, thereby reducing memory pressure at this stage. However, this advantage is often offset by the subsequent pointwise convolution. This requires loading the entire intermediate tensor (generated by the depthwise convolution) and the 1x1 kernel weights before computing the final output.  Therefore, the overall memory impact depends on a delicate balance between the size reduction from the channel-wise processing of the depthwise convolution and the memory required to hold the intermediate tensor during the pointwise convolution.  If the input channels significantly outnumber the output channels, the reduction in the intermediate tensor size will outweigh the additional cost.  Conversely, if the input and output channels are similar in number, the memory savings might be marginal or even nonexistent.

**Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with TensorFlow/Keras examples:

**Example 1: Standard Convolution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
  # ... rest of the model ...
])

# Memory consumption:  High, due to large intermediate tensor 
# (224x224x64) produced directly after the convolution.
```

This standard convolution generates a substantial intermediate tensor. The size is directly related to the output channels (64) and the input image dimensions.


**Example 2: Depthwise Separable Convolution (efficient)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D(64, (3, 3), input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
  # ... rest of the model ...
])

# Memory consumption: Potentially lower than standard convolution.
# Depthwise convolution generates intermediate tensor (224x224x3), then
# the Pointwise convolution (1x1) will create the final output.
# If 64 << 3 (input channel count), considerable memory advantage.
```

Here, the depthwise separable convolution decomposes the operation.  The intermediate tensor from the depthwise step will have a depth of 3 (matching the input channels), leading to potentially lower memory usage compared to the standard convolution in Example 1.  The memory benefit is particularly noticeable when the number of output channels (64) is significantly smaller than the number of input channels (3 in this example - this is unusual but serves to illustrate the point).

**Example 3: Depthwise Separable Convolution (less efficient)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D(512, (3, 3), input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
  # ... rest of the model ...
])

# Memory consumption: Potentially higher than standard convolution, or similar.
#  A large number of output channels (512) after the pointwise convolution
#  can negate the memory advantage of depthwise convolution. The intermediate
#  tensor will be (224x224x3), but the final output will be very large.
```

This example demonstrates a situation where the memory savings might be minimal or even negative.  The high number of output channels (512) necessitates a large intermediate tensor after the pointwise convolution, potentially offsetting the memory gains from the depthwise stage.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the original papers introducing depthwise separable convolutions and examining detailed analyses of memory usage in convolutional neural networks within the context of different hardware architectures.  Study the memory profiling tools available within your chosen deep learning framework.  The documentation of optimized libraries designed for efficient inference on resource-constrained devices will also provide valuable insights into memory-efficient implementations of depthwise separable convolutions.  Finally, exploring the impact of different data layouts (e.g., NHWC vs. NCHW) on memory access patterns will further refine your understanding.  Understanding the influence of automatic memory management (e.g., garbage collection) employed by your framework is essential as well.  This influence is frequently underestimated.
