The `semmni` kernel parameter dictates the maximum number of semaphore sets the system can manage.  Its value directly impacts the ability to install and subsequently operate Oracle 11gR2 on Oracle Linux 7, primarily due to the database's reliance on semaphores for inter-process communication and resource management.  Insufficiently configured `semmni` will lead to installation failure or unpredictable operational behavior.  My experience supporting Oracle databases across various Linux distributions, including extensive work on Oracle Linux 7 deployments, has consistently highlighted this parameter as a critical pre-installation check.

**1.  Explanation of `semmni` and its Relevance to Oracle 11gR2:**

The System V Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism utilizes semaphores for synchronization and resource sharing between processes.  Oracle 11gR2, being a multi-process database system, heavily leverages semaphores for various functions, including managing background processes like the Database Writer (DBWR) and the Log Writer (LGWR), coordinating shared memory access, and controlling resource allocation.  The `semmni` parameter defines the upper limit on the number of semaphore sets the system can simultaneously create.  If this limit is too low, Oracle's numerous processes might struggle to create the necessary semaphores, resulting in failures during installation or runtime errors later on.

Oracle's installation process thoroughly checks system resource limits, and a low `semmni` value will definitively trigger an installation error.  It's important to note that the minimum acceptable value isn't static; it depends on factors including the expected database workload, the number of background processes configured, and the overall system architecture.  However, a significantly higher value than the default is typically necessary to prevent future issues.  Simply meeting the bare minimum may lead to performance bottlenecks and instability under moderate to high loads.  During my involvement in a large-scale Oracle 11gR2 migration project, underestimating the `semmni` requirement resulted in a system-wide freeze, emphasizing the criticality of proper configuration.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to check, modify, and verify the `semmni` parameter.  Remember that modifying kernel parameters necessitates a system reboot to take effect.  Always back up your system configuration before making any changes.

**Example 1: Checking the current `semmni` value:**

```bash
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem
```

This command outputs several kernel semaphore parameters, including `semmni`.  Look for the `semmni` value; a low number, such as 256, is often insufficient for Oracle 11gR2.  This command accesses the runtime parameter value.  The value set in `/etc/sysctl.conf` might differ until a reboot.

**Example 2: Modifying the `semmni` value (temporarily):**

```bash
# sysctl -w kernel.sem=semmni=512,semmsl=256,semmns=32,semopm=128
```

This command temporarily changes the semaphore parameters.  `semmni` is set to 512 (a significantly more generous value than the default often found), while other parameters are set to values that are generally suitable but should be tailored based on specific needs and environment.  Remember that this change is only effective for the current session.  A reboot will revert the setting to the value configured in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

**Example 3:  Permanently modifying the `semmni` value:**

```bash
# echo "kernel.sem = semmni=512,semmsl=256,semmns=32,semopm=128" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# sysctl -p
```

This approach permanently changes the parameters. The first command appends the desired settings to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. The second command (`sysctl -p`) reloads the configuration file, applying the changes. A system reboot is necessary for these changes to become fully effective. This method is preferred for permanent settings, ensuring the changes persist across reboots.  I've personally found this to be the most reliable and maintainable approach in production environments.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further in-depth information, consult the official Oracle 11gR2 installation guide.  Additionally, refer to the Oracle Linux 7 documentation concerning kernel parameter tuning and System V IPC configuration.  Reviewing the `sysctl` man page is also highly recommended to fully understand the implications of modifying these parameters. Finally, consulting with experienced database administrators is invaluable for assessing your specific requirements.

In conclusion, the `semmni` kernel parameter is a critical pre-installation requirement for Oracle 11gR2 on Oracle Linux 7.  Failure to configure it adequately will almost certainly result in installation or runtime failures. Carefully assess your environment's needs, consult relevant documentation, and adopt a robust configuration management strategy to ensure the database operates reliably.  Avoid the temptation of using minimal values; erring on the side of a larger value is generally a safer approach.  Systematic testing after configuration changes is crucial for verifying stability and performance.  Ignoring this critical aspect during installation can lead to significant operational difficulties and extensive troubleshooting efforts later.  Careful planning and rigorous verification are essential for successful Oracle database deployments.
