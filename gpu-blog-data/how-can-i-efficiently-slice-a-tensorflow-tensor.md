TensorFlow, unlike NumPy, does not directly support slicing a tensor with a tensor of indices representing *partial* indices across all dimensions. Instead, operations are required to construct a full set of indices that account for all dimensions, including those being selected by the partial index. This often involves combining the partial index with implicit indexing across non-selected dimensions. My experience creating complex deep learning architectures has repeatedly highlighted the need for such operations, necessitating efficient and robust solutions for dynamic indexing.

The core challenge stems from how TensorFlow represents tensors and how its indexing mechanisms function. Basic slicing, like `my_tensor[1:5, :, 2]`, uses static numerical or slice objects to specify ranges or single points. When we introduce another tensor to select indices, that tensor only captures dimensions for which we *explicitly* want variable selection. The remaining dimensions must be addressed implicitly by generating indices spanning their entire extent. We can achieve this using a combination of `tf.range`, `tf.meshgrid`, `tf.stack`, and potentially `tf.gather_nd` or, if simpler, `tf.gather`. This approach provides a versatile toolset for building dynamic selection operations.

Let’s explore how we can accomplish this using a three-dimensional tensor as an example, aiming to use a tensor index to select across the first dimension. I have frequently needed this to batch-select different feature maps across a convolutional layer's output, where the batch index serves as our partial index.

**Example 1: Partial Index on the First Dimension**

Imagine a tensor `my_tensor` of shape `(10, 20, 30)`, and another tensor `index_tensor` of shape `(4,)` where `index_tensor` holds integer values specifying rows we want to select from the first dimension of `my_tensor`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Setup sample tensors
my_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 20, 30))
index_tensor = tf.constant([2, 5, 1, 8])

# Get the shape of the target tensor
target_shape = tf.shape(my_tensor)

# Construct full indices
batch_size = tf.shape(index_tensor)[0]
col_indices = tf.range(target_shape[1])
row_indices = tf.range(target_shape[2])
col_grid, row_grid = tf.meshgrid(col_indices, row_indices)

col_grid_flat = tf.reshape(col_grid, [-1])
row_grid_flat = tf.reshape(row_grid, [-1])

all_indices = tf.stack([tf.repeat(index_tensor, target_shape[1]* target_shape[2]),
                       tf.tile(col_grid_flat, [batch_size]),
                       tf.tile(row_grid_flat, [batch_size])], axis=1)

# Gather the slices
result = tf.gather_nd(my_tensor, all_indices)

# Reshape the output
output_shape = tf.concat([tf.shape(index_tensor), target_shape[1:]], axis = 0)
result = tf.reshape(result, output_shape)

print("Original tensor shape:", my_tensor.shape)
print("Index tensor shape:", index_tensor.shape)
print("Result tensor shape:", result.shape)
```

This code snippet initially establishes sample tensors and then extracts the original tensor's shape for later use. It generates a full set of indices. The `tf.meshgrid` operation creates 2D matrices representing coordinates across the second and third dimensions. These matrices are flattened and then replicated. Crucially, `tf.repeat` generates an expanded version of our `index_tensor`, repeating each element the required number of times. These replicated and tiled indices are stacked together, forming the complete set of indices required to perform `tf.gather_nd`. The extracted tensors are then reshaped, aligning output dimensions to be compatible with the index tensor and the slice shapes. This is critical as  `gather_nd` produces a flattened output that must be reshaped to regain the original tensor's dimensional structure. The final step outputs the shapes, demonstrating how the selection has altered the overall shape.

**Example 2: Partial Index on the Second Dimension**

Let’s consider a different scenario, slicing the second dimension using a tensor. Here, `my_tensor` is of the same initial shape and `index_tensor` now specifies column indices.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Setup sample tensors
my_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 20, 30))
index_tensor = tf.constant([3, 7, 15, 2])

# Get the shape of the target tensor
target_shape = tf.shape(my_tensor)

# Construct full indices
batch_size = tf.shape(index_tensor)[0]
row_indices = tf.range(target_shape[0])
col_indices = tf.range(target_shape[2])
row_grid, col_grid = tf.meshgrid(row_indices, col_indices)

row_grid_flat = tf.reshape(row_grid, [-1])
col_grid_flat = tf.reshape(col_grid, [-1])


all_indices = tf.stack([tf.tile(row_grid_flat, [batch_size]),
                       tf.repeat(index_tensor, target_shape[0] * target_shape[2] ),
                       tf.tile(col_grid_flat, [batch_size])], axis=1)


# Gather the slices
result = tf.gather_nd(my_tensor, all_indices)

# Reshape the output
output_shape = tf.concat([target_shape[0:1], tf.shape(index_tensor),target_shape[2:]], axis = 0)
result = tf.reshape(result, output_shape)



print("Original tensor shape:", my_tensor.shape)
print("Index tensor shape:", index_tensor.shape)
print("Result tensor shape:", result.shape)
```

The approach mirrors the first example but with a critical change in index generation. The `tf.repeat` now applies to the partial index tensor selecting columns. Again, `tf.meshgrid` creates coordinate tensors, and the `tf.stack` function merges all indices to construct the multi-dimensional index array. The output is reshaped again to maintain logical dimensions. This showcases the adaptability of the technique to slice on different axes using different index tensors.

**Example 3: Partial Index on Multiple Dimensions**

It’s also common to require indices across multiple dimensions. Assume both the first and third dimensions are to be partially indexed.  Here, `my_tensor` maintains the same initial shape but `row_index` now specifies row indices and `col_index` specifies column indices from the third dimension.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Setup sample tensors
my_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 20, 30))
row_index = tf.constant([2, 5, 1])
col_index = tf.constant([7, 12, 4])


# Get the shape of the target tensor
target_shape = tf.shape(my_tensor)

# Construct full indices
batch_size = tf.shape(row_index)[0]
mid_indices = tf.range(target_shape[1])

all_indices = tf.stack([tf.repeat(row_index,  target_shape[1]),
                     tf.tile(mid_indices, [batch_size]),
                     tf.repeat(col_index, target_shape[1])], axis=1)

# Gather the slices
result = tf.gather_nd(my_tensor, all_indices)

# Reshape the output
output_shape = tf.concat([tf.shape(row_index),  target_shape[1:2],  tf.shape(col_index)], axis=0)

result = tf.reshape(result, output_shape)



print("Original tensor shape:", my_tensor.shape)
print("Row index tensor shape:", row_index.shape)
print("Col index tensor shape:", col_index.shape)
print("Result tensor shape:", result.shape)
```
This example demonstrates selecting slices using two partial index tensors along the first and third dimensions.  The code now repeats the index tensors and tiles the intermediate index, as needed. Here, a critical adjustment ensures correct pairing of selections. We avoid using `tf.meshgrid` here, simplifying the generation of indices needed along the middle dimension and simplifying operations further.  The output shape is modified to reflect index tensor shapes, highlighting the generalizability of this approach.

These examples highlight the core technique: creating explicit indices to fill all tensor dimensions for use with `tf.gather_nd`. This requires careful consideration of `tf.repeat` and `tf.tile` to ensure indices are appropriately combined. An alternative, less flexible approach, is to use `tf.gather` with a combination of flattening and unflattening tensors; however, the `gather_nd` method has proven more robust for complex partial index operations in my experience.

**Resource Recommendations**

To further develop expertise in TensorFlow tensor manipulations, I would recommend exploring:

1. The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on tensor creation, manipulation, and advanced indexing. Pay particular attention to `tf.range`, `tf.reshape`, `tf.meshgrid`, `tf.stack`, `tf.gather`, and `tf.gather_nd`. Careful reading and practice of examples contained in these sections are invaluable.

2. The TensorFlow tutorial section provides comprehensive, hands-on guides. Look for tutorials related to tensor operations, especially those involving advanced manipulations or those geared towards more complex network implementations. These provide a strong foundation for understanding more intricate techniques, like the one detailed above.

3. Seek examples from the TensorFlow GitHub repository, analyzing how tensor manipulations are implemented in more advanced deep learning models. This will provide experience dealing with a wide range of tensor manipulation scenarios. Focusing on models which require advanced slicing or gather operations can be very illuminating.

By practicing these examples, and systematically using these resources, one can become adept at tensor manipulations within TensorFlow, even when dealing with complex dynamic indexing requirements. The process requires a clear understanding of how tensor dimensions are interpreted, and the available tools to construct indices as needed for complex operations.
