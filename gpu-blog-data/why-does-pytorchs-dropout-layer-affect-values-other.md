The seemingly paradoxical behavior of PyTorch's `nn.Dropout` layer, where the output values of *non-zeroed* neurons appear altered, stems from the scaling applied after the random zeroing of activations.  This scaling, often overlooked, is crucial to maintaining the expected output magnitude during training and preventing the vanishing gradient problem, especially as dropout probability increases.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image classification models has highlighted the subtle interplay between dropout's masking process and the subsequent normalization.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `nn.Dropout` doesn't simply zero out a fraction of neurons; it performs a crucial renormalization step.  The process can be broken down as follows:

1. **Masking:** A binary mask is generated, randomly assigning a probability `p` (dropout probability) to each neuron being set to zero.

2. **Zeroing:** Neurons selected by the mask are set to zero.

3. **Scaling:** The remaining active neurons are scaled by a factor of `1 / (1 - p)`.

This final scaling step is the key to understanding why the non-zeroed neurons' values change.  Without it, the expected output magnitude of the layer would decrease proportionally to the dropout rate. During training, this would lead to a significant reduction in the gradient signal, hindering learning and potentially causing vanishing gradients. The scaling operation compensates for this reduction, ensuring that the expected output magnitude remains consistent regardless of the dropout rate.  This scaling implicitly affects the magnitude of the remaining activations; they are effectively amplified to maintain the average output signal.

The impact is most pronounced when the dropout probability (`p`) is high.  With a high `p`, a larger fraction of neurons is zeroed, requiring a more substantial scaling factor to maintain the output magnitude. This results in a more noticeable change in the values of the non-zeroed neurons.  Conversely, with a low `p`, the scaling factor is close to 1, resulting in minimal changes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Demonstrating Basic Dropout Behavior:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

# Dropout layer with p=0.5
dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.5)

# Apply dropout
y = dropout(x)

# Print the output (Note the random zeroing and scaling)
print(f"Input: {x}")
print(f"Output: {y}")

#Demonstrates Gradient Calculation
loss = torch.mean(y**2) #Example loss function
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradients: {x.grad}")
```

This example shows the random zeroing and the impact of the scaling factor. The gradients also reflect the effect of the dropout and scaling on the backpropagation process. The output values will differ slightly in subsequent runs due to the stochastic nature of dropout.

**Example 2: Highlighting Scaling Effect:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor
x = torch.ones(1000)

# Dropout layers with different probabilities
dropout_high = nn.Dropout(p=0.9)
dropout_low = nn.Dropout(p=0.1)

# Apply dropout
y_high = dropout_high(x)
y_low = dropout_low(x)

#Calculate mean values
print(f"Mean with high dropout: {torch.mean(y_high).item():.4f}")
print(f"Mean with low dropout: {torch.mean(y_low).item():.4f}")
```

This code emphasizes the impact of the dropout probability on the scaling and the resultant average output value.  Observe how the mean of the output tensor remains close to 1 even with high dropout, showcasing the effect of scaling in maintaining the expected output magnitude.  This behavior is consistent across multiple runs due to the averaging over a large number of samples.

**Example 3:  Investigating Gradient Propagation:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Simple linear layer with dropout
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(p=0.5),
    nn.Linear(5, 1)
)

# Input and target
x = torch.randn(1, 10)
y = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (single iteration for demonstration)
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(x)
loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, y)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

#Print weights and gradients to show impact
print("Layer weights before update:")
for param in model.parameters():
    print(param.data)
print("\nLayer gradients:")
for param in model.parameters():
    print(param.grad)
```

This example shows how dropout and its scaling affect gradient propagation.  Observe how the gradients are modified by the dropout layer.  The gradients themselves demonstrate that the network learns to adapt to the stochasticity introduced by dropout, adjusting its weights to account for the random masking and scaling.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The PyTorch documentation on `nn.Dropout`.  Carefully study the description of the layer's behavior.
*   A reputable textbook on deep learning covering regularization techniques.
*   Research papers on dropout regularization, specifically those focusing on its implementation and impact on model training.  Pay close attention to the mathematical derivations justifying the scaling factor.  Understanding the theoretical underpinnings provides a deeper appreciation for the practical observed behavior.

This thorough examination of PyTorch's `nn.Dropout` clarifies its functioning, emphasizing the often-unappreciated scaling mechanism responsible for the apparent alteration of non-zeroed neuron values.  The provided code examples illustrate this behavior under different conditions, highlighting the importance of understanding this aspect for effective model development and debugging.  The recommended resources offer opportunities for deeper exploration and a more robust understanding of this crucial technique in neural network training.
