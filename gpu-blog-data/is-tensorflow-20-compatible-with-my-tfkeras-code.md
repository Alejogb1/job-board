TensorFlow 2.0's adoption of Keras as its high-level API represents a significant shift, impacting the compatibility of pre-existing `tf.keras` code.  My experience porting large-scale models from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x highlighted the necessity of understanding this transition's nuances. While the intent was seamless integration, substantial modifications might be required depending on the complexity and dependencies within your `tf.keras` codebase.  The key lies in recognizing that while `tf.keras` remains, its underlying mechanisms and preferred coding styles have evolved.


**1. Explanation of Compatibility Issues and Migration Strategies:**

The core compatibility issue stems from the change in TensorFlow's backend.  In TensorFlow 1.x, the `tf.keras` API often relied on lower-level TensorFlow operations, resulting in code tightly coupled to the specific implementation details. TensorFlow 2.x emphasizes the Keras API as the primary interface, streamlining the process and promoting a more declarative approach.  This means direct calls to TensorFlow 1.x-style operations within `tf.keras` models are frequently deprecated or simply behave differently.

Migration strategies hinge on carefully reviewing your code for several critical aspects:

* **`tf.compat.v1` Usage:**  Extensive use of `tf.compat.v1` modules (often imported as `tf` in older TensorFlow 1.x code) signals a higher likelihood of incompatibility.  These modules are largely wrappers designed for backward compatibility but are discouraged in TensorFlow 2.x.  Replacing these calls with their TensorFlow 2.x equivalents is crucial.

* **Custom Layers and Models:**  Custom layers and models require particularly careful examination.  Ensure that any custom components adhere to the newer Keras API guidelines.  Changes may be needed in how weights are initialized, how custom loss functions are defined, and how metrics are handled.  Specifically, reliance on `__call__` for custom layer construction might necessitate adjustments.

* **Session Management:** The TensorFlow 2.x eager execution paradigm eliminates the need for explicit session management.  Code relying on `tf.Session` or similar functionalities for creating and managing graphs requires significant rewriting. This includes eliminating explicit `sess.run()` calls.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Migrating from `tf.Session` to Eager Execution**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (Incompatible)
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.Session()
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])
y = tf.constant([[3.0]])
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))

y_pred = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess.run(init)
result = sess.run(y_pred)
sess.close()
print(result)


# TensorFlow 2.x (Compatible)
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])
y = tf.constant([[3.0]])
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))

y_pred = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
print(y_pred.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the elimination of `tf.Session` and the use of `numpy()` to obtain numerical results directly, thanks to eager execution.

**Example 2:  Converting a Custom Layer**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (Incompatible) - uses deprecated tf.layers
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.W = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("W", [2,1])

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.W)

# TensorFlow 2.x (Compatible) - uses tf.keras.layers and tf.Variable
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 1]), name='W')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.W)
```

This showcases the migration from `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` to `tf.Variable` within a custom layer definition.  The `tf.keras.layers` structure is consistent across both versions but benefits from improved design consistency in the TensorFlow 2.x implementation.

**Example 3: Modifying a Custom Loss Function**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (Potentially Incompatible)
import tensorflow as tf

def my_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# TensorFlow 2.x (Compatible) - explicit use of tf.keras.backend
import tensorflow as tf

import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def my_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred))

```

This illustrates the preference for leveraging `tf.keras.backend` functions in TensorFlow 2.x for defining custom loss functions, ensuring better compatibility across different backends. The older method might function, but the `tf.keras.backend` approach is more robust.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 2.x migration guide, the TensorFlow API documentation (specifically the sections on Keras and the differences between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x), and a well-structured Keras tutorial are invaluable resources.  These documents comprehensively address the changes in the API and provide practical examples demonstrating the best practices for model migration and development within the TensorFlow 2.x environment.  Moreover, reviewing example code within the TensorFlow Github repository can offer further insights into the intricacies of best practices.  Consulting community forums and seeking assistance from experienced TensorFlow users can prove immensely beneficial in overcoming specific migration challenges.  Finally, unit testing your migrated code rigorously is crucial to ensure that the functional behavior remains consistent before deployment.
