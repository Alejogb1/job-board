Segmentation faults during TensorFlow C++ API usage with multi-row tensors often stem from mishandling memory allocations associated with tensor operations. The C++ API, offering direct control over memory management, necessitates careful resource management to avoid accessing invalid memory locations. This contrasts with higher-level APIs, such as Python's, which abstract many of these complexities.

In my experience, debugging these issues frequently involves scrutinizing the following areas: tensor creation, data population, and the feeding mechanism within the TensorFlow graph. When dealing with tensors, particularly those containing multiple rows, the underlying memory layout and its compatibility with the tensor's shape become crucial. Let’s unpack this further with examples.

**1. Incorrect Tensor Construction and Memory Allocation**

A common error arises from incorrectly specifying the shape and data type during tensor construction. The C++ API requires you to explicitly allocate memory to store the tensor's data. If this allocation is insufficient or if the data layout doesn't match the declared tensor shape, segmentation faults are practically inevitable.

Consider this first code example:

```cpp
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
#include <tensorflow/core/protobuf/tensor.pb.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  tensorflow::Session* session;
  tensorflow::SessionOptions options;
  tensorflow::Status status = tensorflow::NewSession(options, &session);
  if (!status.ok()) {
    std::cerr << "Error creating session: " << status.ToString() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // Define the shape (2 rows, 3 columns)
  tensorflow::TensorShape shape({2, 3});

  // Incorrect: Allocating a 1D vector for a 2D tensor
  std::vector<float> data = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f};
  tensorflow::Tensor input_tensor(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, shape);

  // Attempt to copy the data - incorrect layout assumed
  for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); ++i) {
       input_tensor.flat<float>()(i) = data[i];
  }


  // Run a very simple placeholder op - for illustration only
  std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
  status = session->Run({{ "input", input_tensor }}, {"output"}, {}, &outputs);
  if (!status.ok()) {
        std::cerr << "Error running session: " << status.ToString() << std::endl;
        return 1;
  }

    session->Close();
  return 0;
}
```

Here, a tensor intended for 2 rows and 3 columns is initialized. The error lies in the attempt to access the tensor's memory using `input_tensor.flat<float>()(i)`. This assumes that the tensor data is stored as a contiguous 1D array, which is not how TensorFlow stores multi-dimensional data internally; it uses a column-major layout. Although the `data` vector contains enough elements, the flat indexing doesn't correspond to the 2D tensor layout leading to incorrect memory access within the tensor's internal buffer, frequently resulting in a segmentation fault when TensorFlow performs computations.

**2. Data Layout Mismatches and Memory Boundaries**

The second common problem is the failure to correctly populate the tensor with data in a manner that matches its defined shape. As hinted above, Tensor's memory is not necessarily row-major. Assuming it always is can cause errors. Let's rectify this with an improved example.

```cpp
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
#include <tensorflow/core/protobuf/tensor.pb.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  tensorflow::Session* session;
  tensorflow::SessionOptions options;
  tensorflow::Status status = tensorflow::NewSession(options, &session);
  if (!status.ok()) {
    std::cerr << "Error creating session: " << status.ToString() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // Define the shape (2 rows, 3 columns)
  tensorflow::TensorShape shape({2, 3});

    // Correct data population
    std::vector<float> data = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f};
    tensorflow::Tensor input_tensor(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, shape);
    auto input_tensor_matrix = input_tensor.matrix<float>();
    
    int k=0;
    for(int i=0; i<shape.dim_size(0); ++i) {
        for(int j=0; j<shape.dim_size(1); ++j) {
            input_tensor_matrix(i,j) = data[k++];
        }
    }


  // Run a very simple placeholder op - for illustration only
  std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
  status = session->Run({{ "input", input_tensor }}, {"output"}, {}, &outputs);
  if (!status.ok()) {
        std::cerr << "Error running session: " << status.ToString() << std::endl;
        return 1;
  }

    session->Close();
  return 0;
}
```

This revised code employs the `input_tensor.matrix<float>()` method, providing access to a matrix-view of the underlying tensor data. Consequently, the loop iterates correctly over the rows and columns of the tensor, populating it with data in the anticipated layout. Using a matrix or tensor specific `accessor`, such as `matrix<float>`, `tensor<float, 3>`, or their integer equivalents is crucial. Using `flat<float>()` on anything other than a 1-D tensor is incorrect. Failure to use the correct `accessor` may result in an incorrect offset calculation internally.

**3. Memory Management During Tensor Creation**

Finally, memory management issues can arise not only during the data-copying stage but also during the initial tensor creation process. While TensorFlow does internally manage its memory allocation, improper usage can lead to errors, specifically if you are passing a raw pointer from your memory allocation rather than allowing Tensor to handle the allocation.

```cpp
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
#include <tensorflow/core/protobuf/tensor.pb.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

int main() {
  tensorflow::Session* session;
  tensorflow::SessionOptions options;
  tensorflow::Status status = tensorflow::NewSession(options, &session);
  if (!status.ok()) {
    std::cerr << "Error creating session: " << status.ToString() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }


  // Define the shape (2 rows, 3 columns)
  tensorflow::TensorShape shape({2, 3});

  // Incorrect use of externally allocated memory without taking ownership
  size_t tensor_size = shape.num_elements() * sizeof(float);
  std::unique_ptr<float[]> external_data(new float[shape.num_elements()]);
  for(size_t i = 0; i < shape.num_elements(); ++i) {
      external_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i+1);
  }

  // INCORRECT: passing raw pointer without taking ownership with Tensor
  tensorflow::Tensor input_tensor(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, shape, external_data.get());


  // Run a very simple placeholder op - for illustration only
  std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
  status = session->Run({{ "input", input_tensor }}, {"output"}, {}, &outputs);
  if (!status.ok()) {
      std::cerr << "Error running session: " << status.ToString() << std::endl;
      return 1;
  }

    session->Close();
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the code uses an external buffer managed via `std::unique_ptr`, which is passed as the raw buffer to the Tensor constructor. The problem is that Tensor doesn't take ownership of the underlying memory; it uses the pointer internally, which is problematic because, once the smart pointer goes out of scope, the allocated memory will be deallocated. When TensorFlow then attempts to access that same memory, it will be a dangling pointer causing a crash.

To correct this, either let TensorFlow allocate the memory by passing only the shape and dtype, then writing into it as shown in the previous example, or use Tensor constructor that takes an Allocator object, indicating that you want Tensor to manage the memory you're passing in.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen understanding, I would recommend studying the TensorFlow C++ API documentation, with special attention to the following sections: Tensor creation, tensor data access using methods such as matrix<>, and memory management principles involved within TensorFlow’s C++ framework. Additionally, examining the source code of the official TensorFlow examples that utilize the C++ API can provide practical insights into best practices. Focus on those specific to tensor processing and manipulation. Furthermore, familiarizing yourself with common memory management patterns in C++ will aid in avoiding typical errors. Finally, understanding the concept of column-major versus row-major storage is extremely helpful when you're working with multi-dimensional data.
