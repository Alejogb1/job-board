Atomic operations on global memory in CUDA are subject to significant architectural constraints, fundamentally limiting their applicability to specific memory sizes.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing kernels for years, particularly within the realm of particle simulations and fluid dynamics, has highlighted the crucial role of understanding these limitations.  Failing to account for them leads to unpredictable behavior, ranging from silent data corruption to outright kernel failures.  The key fact is that atomic operations on global memory are only guaranteed to be atomic for data types that are naturally aligned to the underlying memory architecture and whose size is a power of two, up to a certain maximum.

The CUDA architecture utilizes different levels of memory hierarchy, each with its own access characteristics and limitations. Global memory, being the largest and slowest level, presents the most stringent constraints for atomic operations.  The hardware's ability to perform atomic operations efficiently relies heavily on the underlying memory architecture and its ability to guarantee exclusive access to the specific memory location during the operation. This guarantee is directly tied to memory alignment and data size.

**1. Explanation:**

The fundamental restriction stems from the hardware's ability to perform atomic operations on cache lines. A cache line is a block of memory that is transferred between the global memory and the faster caches within the GPU.  The size of a cache line is architecture-dependent but is typically 32, 64, or 128 bytes.  For an atomic operation to be guaranteed, the entire data item being accessed must reside within a single cache line. This guarantees that no other thread can simultaneously modify any part of that data item.

Therefore, atomic operations are only truly atomic on global memory for data types whose size is a power of two, and this size must be less than or equal to the size of a cache line.  Attempting an atomic operation on a data type that spans multiple cache lines (or is not properly aligned) results in undefined behavior. The compiler might attempt to implement the atomicity using more complex synchronization primitives, resulting in significant performance penalties or outright failure.  Furthermore, exceeding the architectural limit on atomic operation size for a given GPU will similarly lead to unpredictable outcomes.

In my work simulating turbulent flows, I encountered this issue while trying to optimize an atomic counter implemented using a 64-bit integer.  On older architectures with smaller cache lines, the atomicity was not guaranteed, causing race conditions and inaccurate results.  The solution involved switching to a smaller data type (32-bit integer) and employing more sophisticated techniques like reduction algorithms to aggregate the counts after the parallel section.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Supported Atomic Operation**

```c++
__global__ void atomicAddKernel(int *data, int value) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  atomicAdd(&data[i], value);
}
```

This code demonstrates a supported atomic operation.  Assuming `int` is 32 bits and aligns properly with the cache line, the `atomicAdd` function is guaranteed to be atomic.  The success hinges on the size of `int` being a power of two and smaller than the cache line size.  Larger data types like `long long` might not be atomically handled, depending on the architecture.

**Example 2: Potentially Unsupported Atomic Operation (depending on architecture)**

```c++
__global__ void atomicAddLongLongKernel(long long *data, long long value) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  atomicAdd(&data[i], value);
}
```

This example uses `long long`, which is typically 64 bits.  If the cache line size is 32 bytes or less, the atomicity of `atomicAdd` on `long long` is not guaranteed. The operation might succeed on some architectures but fail on others, rendering the code non-portable and potentially unreliable.  The behavior is undefined and depends entirely on the specific GPU architecture and compiler optimizations.


**Example 3: Handling Unsupported Atomic Operations**

```c++
__global__ void atomicAddLargeStruct(struct MyStruct *data, int value) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int old = atomicExch(&data[i].counter, value);
  data[i].counter = old + value; //Ensure correct addition
}

struct MyStruct{
  int counter;
  float otherData[10];
};
```

This example demonstrates handling a scenario where direct atomic operations on a larger struct are impossible. Here, `MyStruct` is likely to span multiple cache lines.  Instead of directly attempting an atomic operation on the entire structure, we use `atomicExch` to atomically exchange the entire `counter` with a new value. We then perform the addition in a subsequent step, ensuring that the addition operation is atomic, not the update. The size of this struct must be considered relative to the cache line size;  the potential for failure increases with the structure's size.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide.
The CUDA Occupancy Calculator.
A good understanding of computer architecture principles, particularly concerning memory hierarchies and cache coherence.  Exploring the specifics of your target GPU's architecture is also crucial.  Consult the relevant documentation for your specific GPU model to obtain precise cache line sizes and limitations on atomic operations.  Furthermore, careful profiling and performance analysis are indispensable for confirming whether atomic operations are indeed atomic and efficient in the context of your specific application.  Relying solely on theoretical understanding might lead to suboptimal solutions.
