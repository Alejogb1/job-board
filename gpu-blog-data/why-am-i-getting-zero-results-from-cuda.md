The absence of error messages in CUDA kernel execution, coupled with zero results in a seemingly straightforward operation like vector addition, often points to a data transfer or memory access issue, rather than a fundamental flaw in the kernel code itself.  My experience debugging similar problems over the years has highlighted the crucial role of proper memory management and data synchronization within the CUDA programming model.  Specifically, I've found that neglecting to synchronize streams or incorrectly handling pinned memory can silently lead to incorrect or absent results.

**1. Explanation:**

The CUDA programming model relies on the efficient transfer of data between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU).  A common pitfall is assuming automatic synchronization between host and device operations.  The kernel launch, even if syntactically correct, doesn't inherently guarantee that the input data has reached the GPU or that the output data has returned to the host.  Furthermore, if you're using multiple streams or employing asynchronous operations without appropriate synchronization, data races can occur, potentially leading to undefined behavior and the silent production of incorrect or null results.  Finally, errors in memory allocation, specifically the use of uninitialized or incorrectly sized arrays, can lead to the program running without overt errors but yielding incorrect outputs.

Another critical aspect overlooked is the careful consideration of memory access patterns within the kernel.  Non-coalesced memory accesses, where threads in a warp access different memory banks simultaneously, significantly degrade performance.  While this doesn't inherently cause the program to crash or produce error messages, it can lead to unexpected behavior and, in extreme cases, apparent zero results if the access patterns impede data retrieval.

Specifically concerning vector addition, the problem likely stems from either the input vectors not being correctly copied to the GPU's global memory, the kernel failing to perform the addition correctly due to memory access issues, or the output vector not being correctly copied back to the host's memory.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Memory Transfer**

This example demonstrates a common error: forgetting to copy data to and from the device.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *a, *b, *c;
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // Allocate host memory
    a = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    b = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    c = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize host memory (omitted for brevity, but crucial)

    // Allocate device memory -  This is where the error often lies.  Must check for errors.
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

    // Kernel launch (without data transfer)
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n); // The kernel executes, but with garbage data!

    //Missing crucial step: cudaMemcpy from device to host

    // Free memory
    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(c);
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This code omits the crucial `cudaMemcpy` calls to transfer data between host and device. The kernel operates on uninitialized data residing in the device memory, leading to unpredictable results, including all zeros.  Always check return values from CUDA runtime functions for error codes.


**Example 2: Incorrect Kernel Configuration**

This example highlights the importance of correctly configuring the kernel launch.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = threadIdx.x; // Incorrect indexing - only processes one block!
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

// ... (rest of the code, including correct memory transfers)
```

**Commentary:** This version uses only `threadIdx.x` for indexing, ignoring `blockIdx.x`.  This means only threads within a single block will perform calculations. If `n` is larger than the block size, significant portions of the vectors remain unprocessed.  Correct indexing requires utilizing both `blockIdx.x` and `threadIdx.x` to access the entire input.


**Example 3:  Unhandled Exceptions and Asynchronous Operations**

This example illustrates the potential problems with asynchronous operations and exception handling.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// ... (vectorAdd kernel remains the same)

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation and initialization)

  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_a, a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);
  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_b, b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n); //Asynchronous launch

  //Missing synchronization
  cudaMemcpyAsync(c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream); //Asynchronous copy back

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); //Crucial synchronization point - prevents race conditions

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
  // ... (memory deallocation)
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example uses asynchronous operations.  Without `cudaStreamSynchronize()`, the host may try to access `c` before the GPU completes the computation and the data transfer.  This can lead to `c` containing seemingly random or zero data.  Always synchronize streams when necessary, particularly before accessing data transferred asynchronously.  Also, robust error handling should be incorporated for all CUDA API calls.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C++ Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and several introductory texts on parallel programming and GPU computing offer comprehensive guidance.  Familiarizing oneself with the CUDA Toolkit documentation is essential for resolving various issues.  Practice using debugging tools provided by your IDE and the CUDA debugger to isolate the root cause of errors within your CUDA kernels.  Thoroughly review memory allocation and access patterns to ensure efficiency and correctness.
