The calculation of a weighted average in PyTorch, while seemingly straightforward, presents nuances when applied within the context of tensor operations and gradient backpropagation. My experience in building custom loss functions for image segmentation, where varying pixel importance is crucial, has highlighted the necessity for precise and efficient implementation.

At its core, a weighted average is calculated by multiplying each element of a dataset by its corresponding weight, summing these products, and then dividing by the sum of the weights. In PyTorch, this translates to element-wise multiplication of tensors, summation across specified dimensions, and a final division. However, the critical aspect lies in ensuring that these operations are compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, enabling end-to-end training of models that utilize weighted averages as part of their loss or intermediate calculations.

The naive approach of iterating through elements with Python loops becomes inefficient, particularly when dealing with large tensors commonly encountered in deep learning. Thus, leverage of PyTorch's built-in tensor operations is imperative. Furthermore, the shape of the weights tensor must align appropriately with the input tensor's dimensions, a detail frequently overlooked leading to unexpected errors. Specifically, if the weights are intended to be applied along a particular dimension of the input tensor, the weights tensor must have a compatible shape that can be broadcast to the input tensor.

Let's explore three distinct code examples demonstrating how to perform weighted average calculations, each addressing a different scenario:

**Example 1: Weighted Average of a 1D Tensor**

In this scenario, I had to evaluate the performance of a regression model and found some data points were inherently less reliable than others. I needed to apply a weighted average to the predictions vector where a 1D tensor of weights mirrored the predicted values:

```python
import torch

def weighted_average_1d(values, weights):
    """
    Calculates the weighted average of a 1D tensor.

    Args:
        values (torch.Tensor): A 1D tensor of values.
        weights (torch.Tensor): A 1D tensor of weights, same length as values.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The weighted average (a scalar).
    """
    weighted_sum = torch.sum(values * weights)
    sum_of_weights = torch.sum(weights)
    return weighted_sum / sum_of_weights

# Example usage
values = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
weights = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1])
weighted_avg = weighted_average_1d(values, weights)
print(f"Weighted Average: {weighted_avg}")

# backpropagation example
loss = weighted_avg**2
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradient of values: {values.grad}")
```

In this example, the `weighted_average_1d` function directly implements the weighted average formula. `torch.sum` is used to perform the necessary summations. Critically, the `values` tensor is defined with `requires_grad=True` to enable gradient calculation. The output demonstrates both the resulting weighted average and the computed gradient with respect to the input `values`, showcasing the automatic differentiation capability. The weights in this example are treated as constants without a gradient. The shapes of values and weights must match exactly.

**Example 2: Weighted Average along a specific dimension of a 2D Tensor**

During an anomaly detection project, I had sensor readings arranged in a 2D tensor, where I wanted to compute weighted average of the features (columns) but with different weights for each sample (rows).  This use case demanded calculating a weighted average along rows of the data matrix by having the weights aligned to rows:

```python
import torch

def weighted_average_2d_dim1(values, weights):
    """
    Calculates the weighted average of a 2D tensor along dimension 1.

    Args:
        values (torch.Tensor): A 2D tensor of values (N x M).
        weights (torch.Tensor): A 2D tensor of weights (N x 1), applicable to dimension 1.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A 1D tensor containing weighted averages (N).
    """
    weighted_sum = torch.sum(values * weights, dim=1)
    sum_of_weights = torch.sum(weights, dim=1)
    return weighted_sum / sum_of_weights

# Example usage
values = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                      [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], requires_grad=True)
weights = torch.tensor([[0.1],
                      [0.9]])
weighted_avg = weighted_average_2d_dim1(values, weights)
print(f"Weighted Averages: {weighted_avg}")
# backpropagation
loss = weighted_avg.sum()
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradient of values: {values.grad}")
```

In `weighted_average_2d_dim1`, the weights tensor (`weights`) has a shape of `(N x 1)`, allowing it to broadcast along the rows of the values tensor. `dim=1` specifies the summation is performed across columns of the input `values`. Each row's average is calculated using its corresponding weight, which is constant for every row entry. The returned output is a 1D tensor with the calculated weighted averages. The backpropagation calculates the gradients of values again with respect to the weighted average output. This example highlights using a weighting tensor of a different rank in order to achieve a broadcasted multiplication.

**Example 3: Weighted Average with Weights as probabilities (batch-wise)**

Another use case I encountered frequently was when the weights were probabilities assigned to the classes present in each training example. In that case the weights tensor needed to have the same shape as the logits so that the probability is applied appropriately to each class for every training example within the batch. This scenario involves the use of `torch.softmax` to compute probabilities and how to perform a weighted average for each batch element:

```python
import torch

def weighted_average_softmax(values, weights):
  """
    Calculates a weighted average along the class dimension (dim=1)
    where weights represent probabilities calculated from softmax.
    This handles multiple batches and applies a weighting for each class.

    Args:
        values (torch.Tensor): A 3D tensor of shape (B, C, X) where B is batch, C classes, and X length.
        weights (torch.Tensor): A 2D tensor of logits shaped (B, C) used to compute softmax probabilities.

    Returns:
       torch.Tensor: A 2D tensor of shape (B, X) containing the weighted average for each item in the batch.
  """

  probs = torch.softmax(weights, dim=1) # convert logits to probabilities.

  weighted_sum = torch.sum(values * probs.unsqueeze(2), dim=1) # expand probs and apply weighting to C dimension.
  return weighted_sum

# Example usage
batch_size = 2
num_classes = 3
seq_length = 5
values = torch.randn(batch_size, num_classes, seq_length, requires_grad=True)
weights = torch.randn(batch_size, num_classes)
weighted_avg = weighted_average_softmax(values, weights)
print(f"Weighted averages (batch-wise): {weighted_avg}")

#backpropagation example
loss = weighted_avg.sum()
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradient of values: {values.grad}")
```

In this final example, `weighted_average_softmax` function, the weights tensor is a collection of logits that are converted into probabilities using `torch.softmax` along the class axis. The probabilities are then expanded using `unsqueeze` to be compatible with the 3D tensor and are applied as weights to the values along the class dimension. The output `weighted_avg` produces a 2D tensor of the weighted values for every sample in the batch. The output shape is (batch_size x seq_length). This demonstrates a more realistic scenario when the weights are not constants but probabilities that are also learned as part of the training.

These examples illustrate the crucial aspects of calculating weighted averages within PyTorch, emphasizing the usage of tensor operations, broadcasted multiplication, and integration with automatic differentiation.

For further exploration, I recommend researching advanced topics such as:

*   **Masking:** Implementing weighted averages that exclude certain elements based on a mask. This is frequently used to exclude padding values in sequence data.
*   **Custom Weight Generation:** Methods for generating weights based on the properties of the input data, often used in attention mechanisms.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Techniques to minimize memory usage and computational time, particularly when working with large tensors or high-dimensional data.
*   **Advanced Loss Functions:** Integrating weighted averages within the definitions of custom loss functions.

Consulting the official PyTorch documentation and code repositories for relevant projects will provide additional practical guidance for those developing machine learning applications using weighted averaging.
