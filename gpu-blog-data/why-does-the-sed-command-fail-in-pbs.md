The root cause of `sed` command failures within Portable Batch System (PBS) scripts, particularly when substitutions or in-place editing are involved, often stems from unexpected file handling and the way PBS interacts with the job execution environment, specifically concerning the current working directory and the potential for file locking. This frequently manifests as a seemingly successful execution (exit code 0) but without the intended modifications being applied.

Specifically, PBS jobs are not executed in the same directory from which the job is submitted unless explicitly configured to do so. By default, a PBS job’s initial current working directory is the root directory of the file system that contains the job script. This contrasts sharply with interactive shell sessions where the current directory is usually the location from which the command was invoked. When a `sed` command within a PBS script is designed to modify a file using relative paths, such as `sed -i 's/old/new/g' my_file.txt`, it’s highly likely that the command will not find the file as `my_file.txt` will not be present within the job’s default root directory, resulting in no changes. The `-i` option for in-place editing further complicates matters as it creates a temporary backup file, which if unsuccessful, leaves the original unchanged.

Furthermore, PBS does not inherently provide robust file-locking mechanisms. In a multi-user environment where multiple scripts may attempt concurrent modifications of a single file, this lack of explicit file locking becomes highly problematic. If one script opens a file for writing while another attempts an in-place edit using `sed -i`, conflicts arise that can lead to data corruption or lost changes. Such a scenario is not usually caught by simple exit codes, masking the problem’s root.

Another critical factor is the way in which PBS transfers input files to the compute node. PBS can move or copy these files, which may lead to paths being incorrect. It isn't safe to rely on relative paths when input or output files are involved within a PBS job, unless explicitly using `cd` before `sed` or explicitly providing absolute paths.

To illustrate these challenges, consider a basic scenario. Let’s assume I've written a Python script, `process_data.py`, which depends on configuration stored in `config.txt` and `sed` is used to adjust configuration within the `config.txt` before each run by a PBS script.

**Example 1: Failure due to incorrect working directory**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N config_edit
#PBS -l walltime=0:01:00
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1

sed -i 's/VALUE1/VALUE2/g' config.txt
python process_data.py
```

Commentary: In this example, the `sed` command attempts to modify `config.txt` in-place. The PBS script is assumed to be in the same directory as the `config.txt` file when submitted. However, when executed on a compute node, the current working directory will likely be the root directory, and no `config.txt` file would exist in that path. The `sed` command will fail silently since the file is not found, resulting in no changes and an exit code 0. This has been a consistent source of failures for me over multiple projects. The subsequent `process_data.py` will then run on the old configuration leading to unexpected behavior.

To address the previous issue we must use a change directory command before invoking `sed`:

**Example 2: Correcting the working directory using `cd`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N config_edit
#PBS -l walltime=0:01:00
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
sed -i 's/VALUE1/VALUE2/g' config.txt
python process_data.py
```

Commentary: Here, the `cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR` command explicitly changes the current working directory to the original submission directory before the `sed` command is executed. The environment variable `$PBS_O_WORKDIR` stores the directory from which the job was submitted. This is an improved approach, however, does not solve the potential for file locking issues. If the script is executed multiple times concurrently, there will still be issues. Also, it's still risky to use the `-i` option within a PBS script, especially as it makes it harder to debug.

To eliminate the risks with in place editing and ensure atomicity, I typically utilize redirection and temporary files:

**Example 3: Using temporary files for atomic writes**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N config_edit
#PBS -l walltime=0:01:00
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

temp_config=$(mktemp)
cp config.txt "$temp_config"

sed 's/VALUE1/VALUE2/g' "$temp_config" > config.txt.new
mv config.txt.new config.txt

python process_data.py
rm "$temp_config"
```

Commentary: In this improved example, instead of using the `-i` option, we make a copy of the config file using `cp`. We then perform the `sed` operation on this copy and direct the output to a new file, `config.txt.new`. Finally, the temporary file is moved to replace the original file using `mv`. This effectively guarantees atomicity, as the modification occurs within a temporary file, making the change almost instantaneous from the view of the other running scripts. In addition, we clean up the temporary file with `rm`. This prevents possible disk space filling issues. The original file will either be replaced or remain unmodified. This prevents file locking issues, is more easily debugged, and makes the intent clear.

Based on my experience, when working with `sed` inside PBS scripts, the following recommendations are essential:

1.  **Always use absolute paths** instead of relative paths when working with files within the script, or always use `cd` to set the proper directory. The use of  `$PBS_O_WORKDIR` to access the submit directory is crucial for file manipulations within the job.

2.  **Avoid the `-i` option for in-place file modifications.** Instead, redirect the output of `sed` to a temporary file and move it to overwrite the original file. This provides a form of atomic write operation which minimizes file corruption risks associated with in-place editing and allows for simple recovery by removing the temporary file if necessary.

3.  **Consider file locking mechanisms.** If data integrity is paramount and the files can be modified from other scripts, then use a locking mechanism in place using utilities that allow for it.

4.  **Leverage temporary files with `mktemp`.** Using this avoids name conflicts, simplifying concurrent script operation.

5.  **Always check exit codes.** While a `sed` command can succeed by not finding anything to change, it's crucial to check whether the intended substitutions occurred or if any errors were encountered.

6. **Use a version control system.** Storing configuration files within a version control system simplifies recovering accidental changes to files.

7. **Avoid overly complex `sed` commands.** A complex command may hide logical errors which makes debugging harder. When faced with a complex substitution, split it into simpler parts, which are easier to understand.

By understanding the PBS job execution environment and carefully crafting the `sed` command with considerations for file handling, I have been able to mitigate these common issues and make my PBS scripts more robust.
