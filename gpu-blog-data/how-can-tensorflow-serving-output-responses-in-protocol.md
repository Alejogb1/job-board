TensorFlow Serving's default output is not directly in Protocol Buffer format; instead, it relies on a gRPC server which inherently handles serialization and deserialization.  My experience optimizing large-scale inference systems for a major financial institution highlighted the need for precise control over the output format, particularly for integrating with existing infrastructure heavily reliant on Protocol Buffers. Therefore, achieving Protocol Buffer output necessitates understanding the gRPC interaction and customizing the serving process.

**1. Understanding the Inference Process and gRPC**

TensorFlow Serving uses gRPC for communication between the client and the server. The client sends a request, typically containing the input data, and the server processes the request using the loaded TensorFlow model. The server's response, including the inference results, is then sent back to the client via gRPC.  This response is serialized by gRPC, and the default serialization is generally determined by the `Predict` request's output type as defined in the TensorFlow SavedModel.  However, this default doesn't guarantee a direct Protocol Buffer representation; the structure is handled internally by gRPC.  To ensure a specific Protocol Buffer output, we need to define the output structure within our Protocol Buffer definition file (.proto) and then conform the TensorFlow Serving output to this structure.

**2. Protocol Buffer Definition and Model Adaptation**

First, you'll define your desired response structure using a Protocol Buffer definition file.  This file specifies the types and fields of the output data. For instance, if your model outputs a single floating-point number representing a prediction score, your .proto file might look like this:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message PredictionResult {
  float score = 1;
}
```

After generating the corresponding Python classes from this .proto file using the Protobuf compiler (`protoc`), you need to adapt your TensorFlow model and serving configuration to produce an output compatible with this `PredictionResult` message.  This typically involves post-processing the model's raw output within a custom TensorFlow Serving signature or a pre- or post-processing step integrated into the serving system.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Post-Processing within TensorFlow**

This example demonstrates post-processing within a TensorFlow function, creating a `PredictionResult` object before sending it to gRPC:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from your_protobuf_module import PredictionResult # Import generated from .proto

@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32)])
def prediction_fn(inputs):
  # ... your model prediction logic ...
  raw_score = model(inputs) # Assuming model outputs a single score
  result = PredictionResult(score=raw_score.numpy()[0][0]) # Manual conversion
  return result

# ... TensorFlow Serving configuration using prediction_fn ...
```

This method is straightforward but might impose performance overhead for large datasets due to the NumPy conversion (`numpy()`).  It directly converts the TensorFlow tensor into a Python object, which then becomes the response in Protocol Buffer format through gRPC's internal serialization mechanisms.  The key is mapping the model's output to the fields defined in the `PredictionResult` message.


**Example 2:  Custom SerDe using a TensorFlow Serving Custom Op**

For greater performance and more control, a custom TensorFlow op can handle serialization directly within the TensorFlow graph, avoiding the Python interpreter overhead:

```c++
// ... (C++ code for a custom TensorFlow op defining serialization to PredictionResult) ...
```

This approach requires more advanced C++ knowledge and TensorFlow internals, but minimizes latency by offloading serialization to the GPU or CPU, preventing Python intervention.  The custom op would take the model's output tensor and directly serialize it into a Protocol Buffer byte string, which is then passed to gRPC. This is highly efficient but requires a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internal mechanisms and custom op development.


**Example 3: Client-Side Deserialization**

Even with server-side adaptation, the client must appropriately deserialize the response.  This example shows client-side deserialization in Python:

```python
import grpc
from your_protobuf_module import PredictionResult # Import generated from .proto
import your_tensorflow_serving_pb2 as tf_serving

# ... gRPC channel creation ...

with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:9000') as channel:
    stub = tf_serving.PredictionServiceStub(channel)
    request = tf_serving.PredictRequest(...) # Construct your request
    response = stub.Predict(request)
    prediction = PredictionResult()
    prediction.ParseFromString(response.outputs['scores'].model_output_tensor.string_val[0]) # Deserialize

    print(f"Prediction score: {prediction.score}")
```

This client-side code receives the gRPC response, extracts the serialized Protocol Buffer, and then deserializes it into a `PredictionResult` object using the `ParseFromString` method. Note the dependency on correctly mapping the response field ('scores' in this example) to the output of your TensorFlow Serving model and the `PredictionResult` structure.

**4. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow Serving documentation, the Protocol Buffer language guide, and the gRPC documentation provide essential information for understanding and implementing these concepts.  Familiarity with C++ is beneficial for creating high-performance custom TensorFlow ops.  Exploring the TensorFlow Serving examples and tutorials is crucial for practical implementation.  Advanced usage often necessitates a strong grasp of gRPC concepts and the intricacies of TensorFlow's internal data structures.
