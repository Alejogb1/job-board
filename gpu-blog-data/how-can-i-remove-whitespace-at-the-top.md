The interplay between `coord_fixed` and the automatic expansion of axes in ggplot2 often results in unwanted whitespace above and below the plot area, particularly when the aspect ratio is constrained. This whitespace arises because ggplot2, by default, expands the axes slightly beyond the range of the data to avoid data points being clipped at the edges. When a fixed coordinate ratio is applied, this expansion can appear disproportionately large, especially when data is concentrated within a smaller region of the potential plot area. My experience frequently involves using `coord_fixed` for scatter plots where preserving the geometric relationships between points is critical, and therefore, managing this whitespace has become a routine task in my data visualization workflow.

To remove this excess whitespace, the primary strategy involves manipulating the axis limits to more tightly encompass the data. However, directly modifying the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments can lead to clipping if not handled carefully. The approach I utilize leverages both manual limit adjustment and the power of `expand` within the `scale_` functions, offering fine-grained control over axis expansion. It's important to understand that `coord_fixed` forces a specific ratio between the x and y axes but does not inherently control the axis *extent*.

The automatic expansion added to the calculated limits is dictated by the `expand` argument within `scale_x_continuous` and `scale_y_continuous`. The default setting for `expand` is often `c(0.05, 0)`, which adds 5% expansion to both sides of the axes. This is what creates the whitespace. By setting `expand = c(0, 0)`, the axis range will adhere precisely to the data range, effectively removing automatic expansion. Consequently, there will be no whitespace due to this mechanism, unless it is due to the limits not being set correctly. However, if the data points fall exactly on the edges of the plot area, half of those points are obscured by the edge of the plot. Therefore, in most situations, you need to nudge those limits very slightly or leave some of the expansion. It's also important to understand that the `expand` argument of a `coord_*()` function has precedence over the one in `scale_*()`, but it is not typically used to modify whitespace, being more about altering the axis range.

Here's how I implement this in practice, with three distinct examples illustrating different use cases.

**Example 1: Minimal Data with Centered Values**

Consider a simple dataset where all data points reside close to the origin, which would result in significant whitespace when using `coord_fixed`.

```R
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(x = c(-0.5, 0, 0.5), y = c(-0.5, 0, 0.5))

plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)

# Default plot, with whitespace

plot

plot_no_space <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0.01)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0.01))

# Plot with reduced whitespace

plot_no_space
```

In this case, I define a basic data frame and then plot it first with default settings, demonstrating the visible whitespace. The second plot, `plot_no_space`, demonstrates the reduction of whitespace via `scale_x_continuous` and `scale_y_continuous`, both having their `expand` set to `c(0.01, 0.01)` which adds a minimal expansion and avoids the points falling on the edge.

**Example 2: Data with a Larger Range**

This example explores a situation with a larger data range and introduces a slight offset in the x and y values to demonstrate that whitespace can come from the default expansion beyond the range of data, and not because data points fall at the edges.

```R
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5), y = c(2, 4, 6))

plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)

# Default plot, with whitespace

plot

plot_tight_limits <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
 geom_point() +
 coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
 scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 5.5), expand = c(0,0)) +
 scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1.5, 6.5), expand = c(0,0))

# Plot with explicitly adjusted limits

plot_tight_limits
```

Here, we observe that while the data range is larger than in the previous example, whitespace still appears. I use `limits` within the `scale_x_continuous` and `scale_y_continuous` functions to fine-tune the axis ranges directly and set `expand` to `c(0, 0)` to remove all extra expansion. Itâ€™s important to use both parameters correctly to achieve the desired outcome, since `limits` alone will not remove the default whitespace expansion, and `expand` alone will not necessarily produce a desirable final plot if the default range is too large.

**Example 3: Combined Dataset With Differing Ranges**

This example uses a more complex dataset with different ranges along the X and Y axis, and the usage of expansion to leave small buffers at each edge of the plot.

```R
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(x = c(10, 20, 30), y = c(1, 2, 4))

plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1)

# Default plot, with whitespace

plot

plot_with_buffer <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
   scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.05,0.05)) +
   scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.1,0.1))

# Plot with an intentional buffer

plot_with_buffer
```

In this scenario, I purposefully leave a small buffer around the data points to demonstrate how expansion can be tuned. The `expand` argument can be modified to introduce very slight whitespace by setting different values in the vector. I set `expand` to `c(0.05, 0.05)` for x and `c(0.1, 0.1)` for y, which means that the axis ranges are expanded by 5% of the total range for x and 10% for y, creating a small buffer. This shows how whitespace can be controlled as needed, rather than eliminating it entirely.

To further refine your understanding and usage of `coord_fixed` and axis scaling, I suggest consulting resources that delve into the intricacies of `ggplot2`'s plotting system. Focus on materials discussing `scale_x_continuous`, `scale_y_continuous`, and the `coord` family functions within the context of data boundaries and expansion. Resources explaining the layering principles of ggplot2 and how transformations affect the visual representation would also be useful. Pay particular attention to sections illustrating how default settings and data-dependent calculations interact to produce the final plot. By internalizing these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to produce visualizations with tight, controlled whitespace and aspect ratios.
