The discrepancy between successful NumPy installations using `pip` versus failures using `pip3` typically stems from inconsistencies in the Python environment's configuration, specifically concerning the symbolic links or aliases associated with the `python` and `python3` commands.  My experience resolving this issue across numerous projects, from embedded systems development to large-scale data analysis pipelines, points towards this core problem.  It's not a NumPy-specific bug but rather a consequence of how the system manages multiple Python versions and their associated package managers.

**1. Explanation:**

The commands `pip` and `pip3` are often, though not always, distinct package managers.  `pip` usually represents the package manager associated with the default Python installation on a given system, whereas `pip3` explicitly targets Python 3.  On systems with multiple Python versions installed (e.g., Python 2.7 alongside Python 3.x), the system's symbolic links determine which Python interpreter `pip` invokes. If these links are misconfigured, or if `pip` is actually pointing to Python 2 while `pip3` points to Python 3, attempts to install NumPy using `pip` might inadvertently utilize a Python 2 interpreter incompatible with the NumPy version being installed, leading to successful installation, while the explicit `pip3` command targeting the correct (Python 3) interpreter might fail due to dependencies or compiler issues.  Further complicating this, the system may lack necessary build tools (like a C compiler) for Python 3, which `pip3` will require but `pip` might bypass if it uses a pre-built wheel for Python 2.

Another possible cause relates to virtual environments.  If you're using virtual environments, `pip` within that environment might correctly install NumPy because the environmentâ€™s `pip` is specifically tied to its Python interpreter. However, a `pip3` command outside the virtual environment might fail to recognize or interact with the environment's Python installation, again leading to installation failure.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Identifying Python Versions and Associated `pip` commands:**

```bash
python --version
python3 --version
pip --version
pip3 --version
which pip
which pip3
where pip
where pip3
```

These commands help diagnose the underlying Python versions and determine where the system locates the `pip` and `pip3` executables.  Differences in output between `pip` and `pip3` (different paths, Python versions) confirm the suspicion of misconfiguration. On Windows, replace `which` with `where`. The output should clearly show the path and version of Python used by each command.  If `pip` and `pip3` point to the same Python interpreter, the problem likely lies elsewhere (e.g., missing build tools).


**Example 2: Installing NumPy within a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment named '.venv'
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
pip install numpy
```

This approach isolates the NumPy installation within a controlled environment, eliminating many conflicts related to system-wide Python installations and their package managers. The use of `pip` within the activated virtual environment is now guaranteed to utilize the Python 3 interpreter specified when the environment was created. The use of `pip3` here is usually redundant and unnecessary as the virtual environment manages its dependencies correctly.


**Example 3: Verifying Build Tools (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev
# or, for macOS using Homebrew
brew install python3
```

Before attempting NumPy installation, ensure the necessary build tools are present. NumPy often requires a C compiler and related development packages for compiling its core components.  These commands install the necessary build tools; adapt them to your specific system package manager (e.g., `yum` on CentOS/RHEL, `pacman` on Arch Linux).  Failure to install these tools can result in compilation errors during NumPy's installation, especially when using `pip3`. This is less of a concern if using pre-built wheels, but sometimes pip needs to compile it based on your system.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for NumPy, Python, and your operating system's package manager.  Examine your system's Python installation configuration. Review relevant tutorials and articles on setting up Python virtual environments.  Read the output of `pip install numpy --verbose` to get a detailed log of the installation process. Understand how symbolic links work within your operating system's context. Consult the documentation for your operating system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, etc.) regarding installing essential development tools.


In my experience, the most frequent cause of this discrepancy is simply a lack of explicit delineation between `pip` and `pip3`, often stemming from misconfigured symbolic links or a system's default Python interpreter not being Python 3.  Using virtual environments consistently mitigates most of these problems.  Always verify that the correct Python version is being targeted by the package manager through the steps outlined above; careful attention to these details will usually resolve this commonly encountered installation problem.
