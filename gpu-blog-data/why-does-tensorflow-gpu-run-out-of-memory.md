TensorFlow's GPU memory exhaustion after multiple training epochs typically stems from a combination of factors, most significantly the accumulation of intermediate tensors and the persistent allocation of resources not explicitly released.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale projects, involving both custom models and pre-trained networks, has highlighted this as a central problem.  Effective memory management within the TensorFlow framework requires a nuanced understanding of its memory allocation strategies and the careful application of specific optimization techniques.

**1. Understanding TensorFlow's Memory Management:**

TensorFlow's GPU memory management isn't a simple garbage collection system like those found in interpreted languages.  Instead, it utilizes a more complex allocation scheme involving persistent memory allocations and potentially overlapping resource usage. During each epoch, TensorFlow allocates memory for various operations, including the forward pass, backward pass, and gradient updates. While some memory is released after each operation, particularly temporary tensors, a significant portion remains allocated, even after completion of the training step. This is because TensorFlow strives for performance optimization by reusing allocated memory blocks whenever possible.  However, this strategy can backfire if not properly managed, leading to eventual memory overflow as the cumulative allocation exceeds the available GPU memory. The issue is further exacerbated by the growing size of intermediate tensors during complex computations, especially in deep learning models with numerous layers and large batch sizes.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate common scenarios and solutions related to GPU memory exhaustion in TensorFlow.

**Example 1:  Unintentional Tensor Retention:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(batch['inputs'])
            loss = loss_function(predictions, batch['labels'])
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        # Missing crucial memory management here!

```

This code snippet demonstrates a common mistake. While gradients are calculated and applied, there is no explicit mechanism for releasing the intermediate tensors involved in the forward and backward passes.  This lack of explicit management leads to a progressive increase in GPU memory consumption across epochs.  To address this, one should leverage TensorFlow's `tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)` for debugging and manually delete tensors when they are no longer needed using `del` and subsequently `tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()` when necessary for complex models.   This practice however should be approached carefully, as premature deletion could interrupt the computational graph and lead to incorrect results.

**Example 2:  Efficient Batch Processing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data).batch(batch_size).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(batch[0])
            loss = loss_function(predictions, batch[1])
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This improved example utilizes `tf.data.Dataset` with `batch` and `prefetch` to streamline data loading and minimize the memory footprint. The `prefetch` buffer allows TensorFlow to prepare batches asynchronously, improving throughput and reducing potential bottlenecks due to data loading.  Careful selection of the `batch_size` is critical; a smaller batch size reduces memory consumption per step but might slow down training.  Experimentation to find the optimal balance between memory usage and training speed is essential.  The use of `AUTOTUNE` lets TensorFlow determine the optimal prefetch buffer size dynamically, maximizing efficiency.


**Example 3: Mixed Precision Training:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

mixed_precision = tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy('mixed_float16')
tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy(mixed_precision)

# ... training loop ...
```

Employing mixed precision training drastically reduces the memory footprint by performing computations using lower-precision floating-point numbers (FP16) instead of the default FP32. This reduces the memory required for storing intermediate tensors and activations without significantly affecting model accuracy in most scenarios.  However, careful monitoring is still crucial, as some models may experience instability or accuracy degradation with FP16.  Monitoring training metrics is therefore paramount.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is an invaluable resource, providing comprehensive information on memory management, mixed precision training, and dataset optimization.  Furthermore, exploring advanced techniques such as gradient accumulation and model parallelism, where parts of the model are distributed across multiple GPUs, should be considered for exceptionally large models.  Finally, regularly monitoring GPU memory usage during training through the TensorFlow profiler or similar tools is crucial for identifying memory bottlenecks and improving resource allocation strategies.  Consult research articles on optimizing deep learning models for large datasets for more specialized approaches.
