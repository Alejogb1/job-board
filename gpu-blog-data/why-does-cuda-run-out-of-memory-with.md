The fundamental reason CUDA applications encounter out-of-memory (OOM) errors with larger datasets, despite maintaining a constant batch size, lies in the interplay between the memory requirements of various components within the application and the fixed memory capacity of the GPU. It’s not solely about the amount of data processed in a single pass (the batch), but the total memory footprint generated during the execution of the computational graph. My experience debugging deep learning models on CUDA, particularly large language models, has consistently highlighted that increased dataset size often correlates with expanded intermediary data structures, such as activation maps, gradients, and optimizer state, which cumulatively consume GPU memory beyond the direct input tensors.

Let’s unpack this. While batch size dictates the memory consumed by the input and output tensors during a forward and backward pass, several other factors contribute to GPU memory exhaustion. When processing larger datasets, it’s common for the number of training iterations to increase proportionally, especially if we aim for comparable performance levels. More iterations lead to a longer accumulation of intermediary data, even with a consistent batch size, causing memory usage to climb steadily.

Furthermore, deep learning architectures frequently employ intermediate feature maps and latent representations that also reside on the GPU. These internal tensors are often significantly larger than the batch input itself, and their dimensions can be indirectly influenced by the dataset size, or rather, the scale of the network trained against it, especially as models evolve during training. For example, consider a convolutional network. While the input image size in a batch might be consistent, the number of feature maps created at each convolutional layer and pooling layer remains dependent on the network architecture. Training larger models with larger datasets can lead to those feature maps consuming a growing fraction of device memory.

Moreover, the backpropagation process contributes substantially to memory overhead. Gradient calculations are stored in device memory and are necessary for updating network parameters. These gradients, typically the same shape as the network’s weights and biases, increase in number and size alongside model complexity, and therefore, are influenced by the overall training scale related to total dataset processed. Memory also needs to be allocated for optimizer states. Adam, for example, maintains moving averages of gradients and squared gradients for each parameter, which further exacerbates memory usage. When training with a large number of training examples it is not uncommon to hit a wall because the training set has made the optimizer and gradient state allocation too large.

The combined effects of these additional tensors can overwhelm the GPU memory, regardless of how small each individual batch is. Imagine trying to move a mountain: each bucket load might be manageable, but the sheer volume requires more space than one has available to pile it all up.

To illustrate, consider a simple training loop. In the following example using PyTorch, I will simulate the key operations. I am not executing these on a GPU to show it independent of device limitations, but the concepts are the same as CUDA.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 50
output_size = 2
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 10

model = SimpleModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulate data with larger and smaller datasets
def generate_data(num_samples):
    X = torch.randn(num_samples, input_size)
    y = torch.randint(0, output_size, (num_samples,))
    return torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(X,y)

small_dataset = generate_data(1000)
large_dataset = generate_data(10000)

def train(dataset, num_epochs):
    dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for X_batch, y_batch in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            y_pred = model(X_batch)
            loss = criterion(y_pred, y_batch)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
    return model
```

In the above code, `small_dataset` and `large_dataset` represent datasets of different sizes, while the batch size is fixed at 32. When executing the training loop over these datasets, if the hardware was limited, it is the `train` function which will cause a device memory issue. The larger dataset does not change the batch size, but it means many more iterations of the training loop, and in each iteration the intermediate memory allocation adds up.

The next example demonstrates a common technique to handle potentially memory intensive operations during training by using gradient accumulation. Accumulation reduces memory pressure by updating weights every few batches instead of every batch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class AnotherModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(AnotherModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 50
output_size = 2
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 10
accumulation_steps = 4

model = AnotherModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulate data
def generate_data(num_samples):
    X = torch.randn(num_samples, input_size)
    y = torch.randint(0, output_size, (num_samples,))
    return torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(X,y)

large_dataset = generate_data(10000)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(large_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)


for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    for i, (X_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataloader):
        y_pred = model(X_batch)
        loss = criterion(y_pred, y_batch)
        loss = loss / accumulation_steps
        loss.backward()

        if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
    
```

Here, `accumulation_steps` controls how many gradients are accumulated before an optimizer step. This allows us to effectively increase the batch size, without increasing the actual batch size. We can effectively increase the batch size and reduce memory pressure by deferring the update to every `accumulation_steps` instead of every batch. Accumulating gradients means that only the gradient tensors for each batch needs to be preserved during backpropagation. In cases where we are constrained by memory instead of compute, this is very effective.

Finally, it's important to consider the impact of higher-precision floating-point arithmetic (e.g., `float64` vs. `float32` or `float16`). If the application, during the process of dealing with the larger dataset, allocates more variables with higher precision, the memory requirements also increase. This may not be immediately obvious when changing dataset sizes, but becomes noticeable when memory usage spikes. This final example shows this effect by increasing the precision of all the floating-point tensors in the model.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class PrecisionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(PrecisionModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 50
output_size = 2
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 10

model_float32 = PrecisionModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
model_float64 = PrecisionModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size).double() # make model double precision.


criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer_float32 = optim.Adam(model_float32.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer_float64 = optim.Adam(model_float64.parameters(), lr=0.001) # also make the optimizer double precision.

# Simulate data
def generate_data(num_samples):
    X = torch.randn(num_samples, input_size)
    y = torch.randint(0, output_size, (num_samples,))
    return torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(X,y)

large_dataset = generate_data(10000)

def train(model, optimizer, dataset, num_epochs):
    dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for X_batch, y_batch in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            y_pred = model(X_batch)
            loss = criterion(y_pred, y_batch)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

train(model_float32, optimizer_float32, large_dataset, num_epochs)
train(model_float64, optimizer_float64, large_dataset, num_epochs) # use the double precision version.
```

The change from `float32` to `float64` doubles the memory used by the weights and gradients. This increases the overall memory overhead of the training loop and demonstrates the impact of floating point precision on memory usage.

To effectively manage GPU memory, various strategies can be employed. Firstly, monitor GPU memory usage during training. Tools like `nvidia-smi` are invaluable for this purpose. If OOM errors occur, consider reducing the batch size, as smaller batch sizes often reduce the memory pressure, but may not allow optimal utilization of the GPU. If batch size reduction is ineffective then use gradient accumulation to effectively increase the batch size without increasing memory pressure. Employing mixed-precision training, using lower precision like `float16` wherever possible, can dramatically reduce the memory footprint and potentially speed up computations. Finally, check your optimizer setup, often, optimizers such as Adam use a fair amount of memory, so switching to a simpler optimizer could potentially save memory, if necessary.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring resources focusing on deep learning memory management. Study profiling techniques for GPU code and pay close attention to how model parameters, gradients and optimizer states are managed. Research model checkpointing and sharding strategies, which involve saving and reloading model state as necessary to fit model training into limited GPU memory. These areas will provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and techniques in managing GPU memory effectively during training and inference.
