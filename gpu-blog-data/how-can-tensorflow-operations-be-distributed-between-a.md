TensorFlow's ability to distribute computation across heterogeneous hardware, specifically leveraging both GPU and CPU resources, hinges on the strategic placement of operations within the computation graph.  My experience optimizing large-scale natural language processing models has highlighted the critical role of understanding data locality and the inherent computational strengths of each hardware component.  Simply assigning operations to a GPU doesn't guarantee optimal performance; a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's execution model and the characteristics of the operations themselves is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Effective GPU/CPU distribution in TensorFlow relies on several key strategies. Firstly, computationally intensive operations, particularly those involving large matrix multiplications or convolutions, are best suited for the GPU.  These operations benefit significantly from the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU.  Conversely, operations with high data transfer overhead or those that are inherently sequential in nature are often better handled by the CPU.  Excessive data transfer between GPU and CPU can negate any performance gains from GPU acceleration.

Secondly, the choice of TensorFlow's execution strategy plays a significant role.  The default eager execution offers flexibility but can lack optimization compared to graph execution.  In graph execution, TensorFlow compiles the computation graph before execution, allowing for optimizations such as operation fusion and kernel selection.  These optimizations significantly impact the ability to efficiently distribute computations across CPU and GPU.  Furthermore, the use of `tf.device` context managers allows for explicit placement of individual operations or sections of the graph onto specific devices (CPU or GPU).

Thirdly, data pre-processing and post-processing steps are generally best handled on the CPU.  These steps often involve less computationally intensive tasks such as data loading, feature engineering, and result interpretation.   Performing these steps on the GPU adds unnecessary overhead and can lead to bottlenecks.  The strategy should be to minimize data transfer between the CPU and GPU.  This often involves buffering data on the CPU before feeding it to the GPU in larger batches.  Similarly, results should be transferred back to the CPU only when necessary.

Finally, profiling the execution time of various operations is essential for identifying bottlenecks.  TensorFlow's profiling tools allow for detailed analysis of execution time, memory usage, and data transfer overhead, enabling informed decisions about operation placement.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Explicit Device Placement using `tf.device`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    # Place matrix multiplication on the GPU
    matrix_a = tf.random.normal((1024, 1024))
    matrix_b = tf.random.normal((1024, 1024))
    product = tf.matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    # Perform post-processing on the CPU
    result = tf.reduce_sum(product)

print(result)
```

This example explicitly places the computationally intensive `tf.matmul` operation on the GPU and the less intensive `tf.reduce_sum` operation on the CPU. This leverages the GPU for matrix multiplication while keeping CPU overhead to a minimum.


**Example 2:  Data Transfer Optimization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load data on CPU
data = np.random.rand(10000, 100).astype(np.float32)

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data).batch(1024) #Batching for efficient transfer

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])
    for batch in dataset:
        with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # ensure model execution is on GPU
            predictions = model(batch)
        with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
            # Process predictions on CPU
            # ...further processing...
            pass


```

This illustrates batch processing to minimize data transfer between CPU and GPU.  Loading the entire dataset into the GPU at once would be inefficient. Batching reduces the amount of data transferred in each iteration, improving efficiency. The code also explicitly places model execution on the GPU to ensure utilization of GPU capabilities.

**Example 3: Utilizing `tf.function` for graph compilation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_computation(input_tensor):
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        intermediate = tf.math.square(input_tensor)
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
        result = tf.math.reduce_mean(intermediate)
    return result

input_data = tf.random.normal((1000,1000))
output = my_computation(input_data)
print(output)
```

This example uses `tf.function` to compile the function into a TensorFlow graph, enabling further optimizations.  The graph execution strategy allows TensorFlow to better schedule operations across devices, improving overall performance. This approach is particularly beneficial for repeated execution of the same operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  TensorFlow's performance profiling tools;  Books and articles on high-performance computing and parallel programming;  Advanced tutorials on TensorFlow's distributed strategies.  Understanding linear algebra and parallel algorithms will greatly aid in effectively distributing TensorFlow computations across different hardware.  Familiarity with the underlying hardware architecture is equally crucial.
