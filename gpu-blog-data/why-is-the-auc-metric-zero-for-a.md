The root cause of a zero Area Under the Curve (AUC) score for a Keras model trained on data with fractional labels lies in the inherent incompatibility between the probabilistic nature of fractional labels and the binary classification assumptions underlying the standard AUC calculation.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale medical image analysis projects consistently pointed to this fundamental mismatch.  AUC, in its standard form, assumes a clear binary separation between positive and negative classes, represented by 0 and 1 respectively.  Fractional labels, by definition, represent a degree of belonging to the positive class, falling somewhere between these two extremes.  This ambiguity fundamentally breaks the assumptions upon which the AUC calculation relies, leading to unpredictable and often zero results.  This is not a failure of the Keras model *per se*, but a consequence of misapplying a metric designed for binary classification to a problem with inherently probabilistic labels.

Let's clarify this with a detailed explanation.  The AUC metric is typically calculated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.  The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. To generate this curve, the model outputs probability scores for each instance, and these scores are then compared to a series of thresholds to determine binary classifications (above threshold: positive; below threshold: negative).  The TPR and FPR are calculated for each threshold, generating the ROC curve. The AUC is then the area under this curve. The crucial point is that the calculation implicitly assumes that the true labels are either 0 or 1.

With fractional labels, the comparison against thresholds becomes problematic.  A fractional label, say 0.7, inherently represents uncertainty.  Is it truly a positive instance? Is a threshold of 0.5 sufficient to classify it as positive?  There is no single definitive answer.  When a standard AUC calculation encounters such fractional labels, it struggles to define true positives and false positives consistently across thresholds. This often results in a collapsed ROC curve, leading to a zero AUC.  This is especially true with standard binary classification loss functions used during training, which are not designed for fractional labels and are likely to overfit or misinterpret the data.

The solution requires a reassessment of both the model and the evaluation metric.  We must address the inherent ambiguity introduced by fractional labels.  Instead of directly attempting to compute the standard AUC, one needs to either adapt the labels or use a different evaluation metric.  One approach involves treating the fractional labels as probabilistic ground truth.  Another employs a metric suited to evaluating models predicting probabilities directly, rather than hard classifications.

Here are three illustrative code examples demonstrating the issue and offering alternative approaches.  These examples utilize TensorFlow/Keras for demonstration purposes.

**Example 1: Standard Binary Classification (Illustrating the Problem):**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
import tensorflow as tf

# Fractional labels (replace with your actual data)
y_true = np.array([0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.9, 0.5])

# Model predictions (replace with your model's output)
y_pred = np.array([0.1, 0.7, 0.0, 0.95, 0.4])

# Attempting to calculate AUC using standard binary classification metric
auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"AUC: {auc}")  # Likely to be 0 or near 0

# Using a binary classification loss function during training will amplify the issue.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(X_train, y_true, epochs=10)  # X_train is placeholder for features
```

This example highlights the core problem: attempting to directly apply `roc_auc_score` to fractional labels will often result in a near-zero or zero AUC.

**Example 2:  Using a Regression Approach:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import tensorflow as tf

# Fractional labels
y_true = np.array([0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.9, 0.5])

# Model predictions (replace with your model's output)
y_pred = np.array([0.15, 0.78, 0.08, 0.92, 0.45])


# Regression-based evaluation (Mean Squared Error)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

#Adapting the model to a regression task
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) #no sigmoid activation
])
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(X_train, y_true, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates using a regression approach, framing the problem as predicting the probability directly.  Mean Squared Error (MSE) becomes a suitable evaluation metric here.  The model architecture also changes; we remove the sigmoid activation since we're aiming for a raw probability output.

**Example 3:  Threshold Optimization and Area Under the PR Curve:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, auc
import tensorflow as tf


# Fractional labels
y_true = np.array([0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.9, 0.5])

# Model predictions
y_pred = np.array([0.15, 0.78, 0.08, 0.92, 0.45])

#Precision Recall Curve
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_pred)
auprc = auc(recall, precision)
print(f"Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): {auprc}")

# Model will still need adaptations as above
```
This example uses the Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) and its AUC (AUPRC). The PRC is often more informative than the ROC curve when dealing with imbalanced datasets or situations where the focus is on precision.  The AUPRC is less sensitive to the issue of threshold selection in the context of fractional labels.

In conclusion, the zero AUC for a Keras model with fractional labels is not a model error but a consequence of applying an inappropriate evaluation metric.  Addressing this requires a careful consideration of the nature of the data and a shift towards either regression-based modelling or alternative evaluation metrics like MSE or AUPRC, depending on the research question.  Furthermore, exploring specialized loss functions designed for probabilistic labels could further improve model performance and accuracy.  Consulting relevant statistical literature on evaluating probabilistic predictions will significantly aid in choosing the most appropriate solution.  Consider exploring works on probabilistic classification and ranking metrics for a deeper understanding.
