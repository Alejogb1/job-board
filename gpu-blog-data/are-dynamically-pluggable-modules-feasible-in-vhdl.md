Yes, dynamically pluggable modules are not directly feasible in standard VHDL as you might envision in software contexts. My experience working on reconfigurable hardware platforms has shown that VHDL, at its core, is a hardware description language focusing on static hardware structures. We define how connections and modules are wired before synthesis. The nature of VHDL implies that all interconnections and module instantiation are decided at compile/synthesis time. We are creating digital circuits, not software processes; we're dealing with physical wires and gates, not virtual addresses and dynamic linking. That’s the fundamental constraint.

**1. Explanation of Limitations and Approaches**

The primary reason dynamic module loading isn't possible in VHDL stems from the fundamental difference between hardware and software execution. Software, typically, utilizes memory management, dynamic linking, and operating system services to load and execute code at runtime. These mechanisms do not exist within synthesized hardware. When we describe a design in VHDL, the synthesis process converts that description into a netlist, which specifies how various hardware primitives (logic gates, flip-flops, memory blocks) should be connected. This netlist is essentially a fixed blueprint of the hardware.

To achieve any semblance of “dynamic” behavior, we must approach the problem differently than we would in software. Instead of directly loading modules at runtime, we rely on techniques that allow us to reconfigure the hardware itself or activate specific pre-synthesized parts of the design based on runtime conditions. We're not 'plugging in' modules; we're selecting or routing signals through different paths that effectively create the appearance of changed functionality.

The most relevant methods I’ve encountered include:

*   **Parameterization:** Using generics and parameters within VHDL code allows for some level of dynamic adaptability. During instantiation, different parameter values can be passed, altering the behavior or even structure of the module within the confines of its static specification. For example, you might change the data width of a module, but you can’t instantiate a completely different type of module at runtime.

*   **Conditional Compilation:** Using `generate` statements in VHDL, you can include or exclude certain parts of your design during synthesis based on constant parameters. This provides another method to adapt the hardware at build time but doesn’t offer runtime dynamism.

*   **Reconfigurable Architectures:** More advanced designs employ partial reconfiguration technologies, often with FPGA devices. These allow us to dynamically change regions of the FPGA fabric, effectively modifying hardware functionality post-deployment. However, even with partial reconfiguration, the underlying reconfiguration controller and infrastructure needs to be pre-designed and synthesized. It isn't a true dynamic loading of arbitrary VHDL modules but controlled, localized reconfiguration of pre-defined hardware regions.

*   **Multiplexing and State Machines:** Multiplexing and state machines form the basis of most dynamic selection in hardware. These mechanisms allow for runtime choice of signal paths and control of data processing steps that mimic dynamic behavior. We pre-design all possible paths and use control logic to select one at a given time.

In essence, rather than dynamic loading, what we do in VHDL is configure. All the building blocks are statically instantiated, but we change the signal paths through them or switch between different functional units, giving the illusion of dynamic behavior. We're choosing between several pre-defined options. The key difference from software is that the 'modules' are wired together physically and can only have their activity controlled, not introduced or removed arbitrarily during run-time.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Here are three examples showing different aspects of “dynamic” functionality in VHDL:

**Example 1: Parameterized Module for Adaptable Bit-Width**

This example illustrates how a parameterized module can change its data width at instantiation time, a form of design flexibility.

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity adder is
  generic(
    DATA_WIDTH : integer := 8
  );
  port(
    a   : in  std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    b   : in  std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    sum : out std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0)
  );
end entity adder;

architecture behavioral of adder is
begin
  sum <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));
end architecture behavioral;


-- Example Instantiation in a higher level module:
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity top_module is
  port (
    input1: in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    input2: in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    output1: out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);

    input3: in std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
    input4: in std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
    output2: out std_logic_vector(15 downto 0)
    );
end entity top_module;

architecture arch_top_module of top_module is

  component adder is
     generic(
    DATA_WIDTH : integer := 8
  );
  port(
    a   : in  std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    b   : in  std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    sum : out std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0)
  );
  end component;

begin
  adder_8bit: adder
    generic map (DATA_WIDTH => 8)
    port map (a => input1, b => input2, sum => output1);

  adder_16bit: adder
    generic map (DATA_WIDTH => 16)
    port map (a => input3, b=> input4, sum => output2);

end architecture arch_top_module;
```
**Commentary:** The `adder` entity is defined with a generic `DATA_WIDTH`. When `adder` is instantiated multiple times within the `top_module`, the different `DATA_WIDTH` generics specify the bit width of each respective instance. This demonstrates how parameters allow variations within the same module definition. The width is fixed during compilation and cannot be altered at run-time.

**Example 2: Conditional Module Inclusion using `Generate`**

This code example employs a `generate` statement to include or exclude a sub-module based on a constant generic.

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity conditional_module is
  generic(
    USE_ADDER : boolean := true
  );
  port(
    a   : in  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    b   : in  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    out_data : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
  );
end entity conditional_module;

architecture behavioral of conditional_module is

  component adder is
    port(
      a   : in  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
      b   : in  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
      sum : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
    );
  end component;

begin
  adder_inst: if USE_ADDER generate
    add_unit: adder
      port map (a => a, b => b, sum => out_data);
  end generate;

  bypass_logic: if not USE_ADDER generate
    out_data <= a;
  end generate;

end architecture behavioral;

```

**Commentary:** The `USE_ADDER` generic determines at synthesis time whether an adder unit is included in the hardware. When `USE_ADDER` is `true`, the adder is synthesized; when `false`, a simple bypass is implemented. `Generate` statements do not offer run-time dynamic selection as the selection is during the synthesis step.

**Example 3: Multiplexing to emulate Dynamic Selection**

This example uses a multiplexer to select between two different processing modules based on a control input. This is closer to the concept of dynamic module selection, but all modules must be synthesized.

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity multiplexed_module is
    port (
        input_a: in std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
        input_b: in std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
        select_module: in std_logic;
        output_data: out std_logic_vector (7 downto 0)
    );
end entity multiplexed_module;

architecture behavioral of multiplexed_module is

    component adder is
        port (
            a: in std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
            b: in std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
            sum: out std_logic_vector (7 downto 0)
        );
    end component;

    component multiplier is
         port (
             a : in std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
             b : in std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
             product: out std_logic_vector (15 downto 0)
             );
    end component;
    signal add_out: std_logic_vector (7 downto 0);
    signal mult_out: std_logic_vector (15 downto 0);

begin

    add_instance: adder
        port map (a => input_a, b=> input_b, sum => add_out);

    mult_instance: multiplier
        port map (a => input_a, b => input_b, product => mult_out);

    output_data <= add_out when select_module = '0' else mult_out(7 downto 0);

end architecture behavioral;
```

**Commentary:** The `multiplexed_module` includes both an adder and a multiplier. A `select_module` input determines which output is passed to `output_data`, emulating a switch between two modules. Importantly, both the adder and multiplier are synthesized regardless of the selection value; they are always wired up as physical circuit components.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of VHDL and hardware design concepts:

*   **Textbooks on digital design**: Look for resources covering topics such as combinational logic, sequential logic, state machines, and FPGA architecture. These provide the necessary foundational knowledge for working with VHDL and understanding its inherent limitations.

*   **FPGA vendor documentation**: Xilinx and Intel (formerly Altera) provide extensive documentation for their FPGA families. This material is invaluable when exploring reconfigurable computing and partial reconfiguration techniques if your application demands dynamic behavior.

*   **Online forums and communities**: While dynamic loading isn't a primary topic in VHDL, exploring forums dedicated to hardware design or FPGAs can often shed light on alternative design techniques that achieve similar results.

*   **Practical Projects**: The best way to truly understand the hardware aspect of VHDL is to design and implement complete hardware projects on FPGAs.

In summary, while not feasible in the way software modules are dynamically linked, VHDL offers various techniques to achieve adaptable hardware structures. You leverage parameterization, conditional compilation, and multiplexing strategies to achieve flexibility, always within the context of a statically defined architecture during synthesis. If true runtime reconfiguration is needed, we need to look into partial reconfiguration capabilities offered by specific hardware platforms like modern FPGAs, but that requires a different workflow outside of standard VHDL itself.
