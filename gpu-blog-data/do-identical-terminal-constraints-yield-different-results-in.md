In my extensive experience optimizing Gekko model 1b simulations, I've observed that seemingly identical terminal constraints can, under specific conditions, produce subtly different results. This isn't due to a bug in Gekko itself, but rather a consequence of the numerical methods employed in solving optimization problems, particularly the interplay between constraint tolerances and the solver's internal convergence criteria.  The key factor is the sensitivity of the objective function to the specific values attained at the terminal time.  Highly sensitive objective functions, coupled with tight tolerances, can exhibit this behaviour.

**1.  Explanation:**

Gekko, like most numerical optimization solvers, employs iterative algorithms.  These algorithms iteratively refine a solution until a convergence criterion is met. This criterion involves checking the change in the objective function and the constraint violations between successive iterations.  When terminal constraints are involved,  the solver aims to satisfy these constraints within a specified tolerance.  Even with seemingly identical constraints defined using identical syntax, slight variations in the floating-point representation of the constraint values, compounded by the iterative nature of the solver, can lead to different optimal solutions.

This effect is amplified in models characterized by non-convex objective functions or tightly constrained regions of the feasible space. In these scenarios, the solver might converge to different local optima, appearing to produce disparate results even with what appears to be identical input.  Additionally, the choice of solver algorithm within Gekko (IPOPT, APOPT, etc.) can also influence the final result due to variations in their convergence properties and handling of constraints.  The internal workings of these solvers are complex, and small numerical discrepancies can accumulate during the iterative process.

Furthermore, the initial guess provided to the solver can impact the final solution, particularly in non-convex problems.  While the terminal constraints remain nominally identical, the path taken by the solver to satisfy them will depend on the starting point. If the initial guess is significantly different across multiple runs, it might steer the solver towards different feasible regions, leading to distinct optimal solutions even with consistent constraint specifications.  This highlights the importance of consistent initialization in Gekko simulations, especially when dealing with sensitive terminal constraints.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how seemingly identical terminal constraints can yield different outcomes in Gekko model 1b. These examples are simplified for illustrative purposes but capture the essence of the problem.  In reality, the differences are often subtle and require careful analysis of the solution trajectories.

**Example 1: Sensitivity to Floating-Point Representation:**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
m.time = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)

x = m.Var(value=0)
y = m.Var(value=0)

m.Equation(x.dt() == y)
m.Equation(y.dt() == -x)

# Seemingly identical terminal constraints
m.fix(x, pos=1, val=1.0)  # Constraint A
#m.fix(x, pos=1, val=1.0000000000000002) # Constraint B - slight variation

m.options.IMODE = 6 # Steady state optimization
m.solve()

print('x:', x.value[-1])
print('y:', y.value[-1])
```

In this example, the minor floating-point difference between '1.0' and a slightly larger value (commented out) in the terminal constraint can lead to different solutions, although the visual difference might be insignificant. The key here is the magnified effect of this minor variation when the solver is operating near a boundary defined by a sensitive objective function.

**Example 2: Impact of Solver Algorithm:**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
m.time = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)

x = m.Var(value=0)

m.Equation(x.dt() == x**2 - x)
m.fix(x, pos=1, val=1.0) # Terminal constraint

# Switching solvers
m.options.SOLVER = 1  # APOPT (default)
m.solve(disp=False)
print('APOPT Solution:', x.value[-1])

m.options.SOLVER = 3  # IPOPT
m.solve(disp=False)
print('IPOPT Solution:', x.value[-1])
```

Here, the same terminal constraint is used with two different Gekko solvers. Even though the constraint is identical, the different algorithms might converge to slightly different final values due to their distinct numerical strategies for handling the constraint.

**Example 3: Influence of Initial Guess:**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
m.time = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)

x = m.Var(value=0)
y = m.Var(value=0)

m.Equation(x.dt() == y)
m.Equation(y.dt() == -x + x**3)

m.fix(x, pos=1, val=0.1) # Terminal Constraint

# Different initial guesses
x.value = [0.0]
y.value = [0.0]
m.options.IMODE = 6
m.solve(disp=False)
print('Initial Guess [0,0]: x',x.value[-1], 'y', y.value[-1])

x.value = [0.5]
y.value = [0.5]
m.solve(disp=False)
print('Initial Guess [0.5,0.5]: x',x.value[-1], 'y', y.value[-1])

```

This example showcases the impact of different initial guesses on the final solution, even with a seemingly straightforward terminal constraint.  The non-linear differential equations amplify the influence of the initial conditions, leading to variations in how the solver converges to satisfy the constraint.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official Gekko documentation, focusing on the solver options and numerical aspects of the optimization algorithms.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of numerical analysis principles, especially concerning iterative methods and convergence criteria, is essential.  Finally, exploration of relevant publications on numerical optimization and constraint satisfaction will prove invaluable.
