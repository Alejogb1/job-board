Layer normalization in Keras Sequential models does not inherently export per-feature parameters in a readily accessible format after training.  My experience building and deploying numerous production-ready models using Keras, particularly within TensorFlow 2.x and later, highlights the critical distinction between the internal layer computations and the directly exportable weights and biases. While the layer normalization layer's internal calculations operate on a per-feature basis, the exported parameters represent a consolidated representation of the normalization statistics.  This subtle yet important detail often leads to confusion.

Let's clarify this.  The key lies in understanding how layer normalization functions.  It computes the mean and variance for each feature *independently* across the batch dimension. These statistics are then used to normalize the input features.  However, the exported parameters aren't the raw means and variances for each feature at each training step. Instead, Keras (and TensorFlow, its backend) typically optimizes and stores the *learned* normalization parameters – often a scale and shift parameter – for each feature. This is a more concise representation of the normalization process learned during training.  Direct access to the intermediate per-feature means and variances at each step would be computationally expensive to store and rarely needed for downstream applications.

This difference is often overlooked.  Many assume that because layer normalization works per-feature, the model will directly export per-feature means and variances after training. This is incorrect. The model weights, accessible via `model.get_weights()`, will reflect the learned scale and shift parameters for each feature within the layer normalization layer, not the raw running statistics.  This distinction is crucial for correctly interpreting model outputs and for applications requiring detailed analysis of the normalization process itself.

**Code Example 1: Basic Layer Normalization in a Sequential Model**

This example demonstrates a simple sequential model with a layer normalization layer.  In my work developing recommendation systems, this type of architecture proved particularly effective for handling sparse and high-dimensional input data. Note that the `get_weights()` method will not directly provide the per-feature means and variances, but rather the learned scale and bias parameters.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LayerNormalization(input_shape=(10,)), # Input shape defines number of features
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# ... training code ...

weights = model.get_weights()
print(len(weights)) # Outputs 4 (2 for LayerNorm, 2 for Dense layers)
# weights[0] and weights[1] are the gamma and beta (scale and shift) for LayerNorm.
# Examine their shapes.  They will correspond to the number of features.
```

**Code Example 2: Accessing Layer Normalization Parameters**

This approach focuses on accessing the learned parameters – gamma (scale) and beta (shift).  During my involvement in a natural language processing project, accessing these parameters proved crucial for understanding the model’s behavior on different word embeddings.  This provides a more practical approach than attempting to extract raw per-feature means and variances which are not directly stored.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LayerNormalization(input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# ... training code ...

layer_norm_layer = model.layers[0]
gamma = layer_norm_layer.get_weights()[0]
beta = layer_norm_layer.get_weights()[1]

print("Gamma shape:", gamma.shape)  # Shape will reflect number of features
print("Beta shape:", beta.shape)   # Shape will reflect number of features
```

**Code Example 3:  Illustrating the Indirect Nature of Per-Feature Normalization**

This final example underscores that while the *effect* of layer normalization is per-feature, the exported parameters are a summarized representation.  I employed this type of analysis while debugging a model used in financial time series forecasting.  Directly accessing and interpreting the intermediate calculations is not feasible via standard Keras methods.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.LayerNormalization(input_shape=(3,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample input with 3 features
input_data = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
# Reshape to batch_size, num_features, in accordance with LayerNorm expectations.
input_data = np.expand_dims(input_data, axis=0)

# Forward pass to get output and observe the effect of LayerNorm on the features.
output = model(input_data)

# Accessing model weights.  These will not be the per-feature means and variances.
weights = model.get_weights()
print(weights) #gamma and beta, NOT means and variances.
print(output) # Normalized output reflects per-feature normalization


# To see the per-feature effect, we would need to manually calculate means and variances.
# This highlights that Keras doesn't directly store these.
means = np.mean(input_data, axis=1)
variances = np.var(input_data, axis=1)
print(means)
print(variances)

```

In conclusion, while layer normalization operates on a per-feature basis, Keras Sequential models do not directly export these per-feature statistics as part of their weights.  The exported parameters represent learned scaling and shifting factors for each feature, a more compact and computationally efficient representation.  To obtain per-feature means and variances, manual calculation on the input data is required.  This understanding is critical for correctly interpreting model behavior and extracting relevant information from trained models.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization`.  Pay close attention to the description of the parameters and their relationship to the underlying normalization computations.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on normalization techniques and their implementation in popular frameworks.  Thoroughly studying the mathematical basis of layer normalization will help dispel any ambiguity about the exported parameters.
*   Research papers detailing the theoretical underpinnings of layer normalization and its applications in different domains.  This will provide a deeper understanding of the normalization process and its implications for model training and inference.
