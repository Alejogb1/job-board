The root cause of a "No such container" error in Docker after a reboot is almost always attributable to the ephemeral nature of containers and the lack of persistent storage for their state by default.  Containers, unlike virtual machines, do not inherently survive a host system restart.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous production and development environments has highlighted this consistently.  The solution hinges on understanding that Docker containers are designed for disposability; their state is not automatically preserved unless explicitly configured.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Docker containers are essentially processes running within isolated environments. When you run a `docker run` command, Docker creates a new container based on a specified image, assigns it resources, and starts it.  However, this entire environment—the process, its filesystems, and network configuration—exists solely within the host's memory and kernel namespace. Upon reboot, the host system's kernel and associated resources are reset.  Docker itself restarts as a service, but the containers it managed before the reboot are not automatically reconstituted. Their state, including any modifications made within the container's filesystem, is lost unless persistent storage mechanisms are employed.

Several aspects contribute to this behavior:

* **Container Lifecycle:**  Containers are designed with a short lifespan in mind. They're intended to be started, run, and stopped on demand. This facilitates efficient resource management and scalability.
* **Storage Management:** The default Docker storage driver often utilizes overlay filesystems that aren't persistent across reboots.  Data within the container's filesystem is generally only stored in the container's writable layer. This layer is discarded when the container is removed or the system restarts.
* **Service Management:** While Docker can be configured to automatically restart containers upon service restarts, this only addresses the container's process.  Underlying filesystem changes within the container require a different approach to be persistent.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate strategies for ensuring container persistence across reboots.

**Example 1: Using Docker Compose with Volumes**

Docker Compose provides a convenient way to define and manage multi-container applications.  Crucially, it allows for the explicit definition of named volumes, providing persistent storage independent of the container's lifecycle.

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes:
      - my_web_data:/usr/share/nginx/html
    ports:
      - "80:80"

volumes:
  my_web_data:
```

**Commentary:** This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `web` based on the `nginx:latest` image. The `volumes` section links a named volume, `my_web_data`, to the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory within the container.  This directory persists even if the container is removed or the system reboots.  The `volumes` section at the top level defines the persistent volume itself. To use this, one would execute `docker-compose up -d` and then `docker-compose down` to gracefully stop and remove the containers but preserve the volume.


**Example 2: Using Docker Run with Volumes and Data Binding**

This approach demonstrates direct volume creation and mapping using the `docker run` command.

```bash
docker volume create my_data_volume
docker run -d -v my_data_volume:/app/data -p 8080:8080 my_app_image
```

**Commentary:**  The first command creates a named volume, `my_data_volume`. The second command runs a container (`my_app_image`) and mounts this volume at `/app/data` within the container.  Any data written to `/app/data` will persist even after the container is removed or the system restarts.  The port mapping (`-p 8080:8080`) exposes the application’s port for external access. This approach is more granular than using docker-compose, useful for single container deployments.


**Example 3: Implementing a Custom Entrypoint Script for Data Migration**

This is a more advanced approach suitable for scenarios requiring data migrations or initialization.

```bash
# entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the data directory exists
if [ ! -d /app/data ]; then
  echo "Data directory not found, creating..."
  mkdir -p /app/data
  # Perform any initial data population or migration here
fi

# Start the main application
exec "$@"
```

**Commentary:** This script is used as a custom entrypoint for the container. This script checks for the existence of a data directory. If it doesn’t exist (e.g., on a first run or after a reboot when the container restarts), it creates it and performs any necessary data initialization or migration steps.  The `exec "$@"` line then runs the application command specified in the `docker run` command. This approach adds resilience to unexpected circumstances, handling cases where data directories might be missing due to system failures. This script would need to be included in a custom Docker image, making the data persistence handled within the application.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Docker documentation, the Docker Compose documentation, and a comprehensive guide on persistent storage within Docker are essential resources.  Additionally, understanding different Docker storage drivers and their respective persistence characteristics is crucial for efficient troubleshooting.  Finally, mastering the concept of Docker volumes and their interactions with containers is vital.  Familiarizing yourself with these resources will greatly enhance your ability to address and prevent future "No such container" errors.
