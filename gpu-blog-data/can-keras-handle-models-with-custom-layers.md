TensorFlow's Keras API, contrary to some initial perceptions, is exceptionally flexible regarding custom layer creation and integration. I've personally used Keras for several years in research, encountering scenarios where off-the-shelf layers were insufficient. This involved implementing novel activation functions, specialized normalization techniques, and custom attention mechanisms not present within the core library. Keras allows for this by providing a clear framework for defining custom layers as classes inheriting from the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` base class, a characteristic that drastically expands the library’s utility beyond standard architectures.

The fundamental process involves overriding specific methods of the `Layer` class, most notably the `__init__`, `build`, and `call` methods. `__init__` is used for initializing the layer’s parameters, like dimension configurations or hyperparameters; the `build` method is called the first time the layer is exposed to input data, a crucial step for instantiating trainable variables based on the shape of that input. The `call` method is where the core logic of the layer is executed, defining the computation that transforms the input tensor into the output tensor. Importantly, it is within these methods that Keras' internal mechanisms can understand and track the variables and gradients, allowing the full benefits of automatic differentiation and optimized execution via TensorFlow.

The `build` method’s existence might seem redundant, especially since `__init__` is called first. However, it is critical for deferred weight initialization. In many deep learning scenarios, you don't know the precise input shape until the first mini-batch is processed. Initializing variables without knowing these shapes risks misalignment or errors within TensorFlow. `build`, by using the shape of an example input tensor received during training, ensures the variables and weights are perfectly dimensioned according to the actual data flow, a small detail that can be easily overlooked, but crucial for proper model convergence.

Let’s illustrate with code examples. Assume you want to implement a custom layer that applies a scaled exponential function to each input.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ScaledExponential(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, scale_factor=1.0, **kwargs):
        super(ScaledExponential, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.scale_factor = scale_factor
        self.exponent = None  # Initialize to None, will be set in build method

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.exponent = self.add_weight(
            name='exponent',
            shape=(input_shape[-1],),  # Scale for each feature
            initializer='ones',
            trainable=True
        )
        super(ScaledExponential, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.scale_factor * tf.exp(inputs * self.exponent)

    def get_config(self): # needed for saving model with custom layer
        config = super(ScaledExponential, self).get_config()
        config.update({
            'scale_factor': self.scale_factor
        })
        return config

```

Here, `ScaledExponential` takes an arbitrary scaling factor as a parameter in `__init__`. The `build` method instantiates the trainable parameter `exponent`, an array with the same last dimension size as the input. The `call` method then performs element-wise exponentiation, scaling and applying that per input, taking the exponent as an additional learned parameter. The inclusion of `get_config` method is important as it dictates the layer parameters that are serialized when saving a model that utilizes the custom layer, ensuring the model can be re-instantiated and utilized later on.

This example illustrates a simple custom parameterization. More complex layers can be realized just as readily. Suppose I need a custom layer that does some pre-processing on input tensors by applying element-wise clipping followed by a custom weighted sum of a linear transformation to the data. This shows how a Keras layer can have multiple parameters, both trainable and non-trainable.

```python
class ClippingWeightedSum(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, clip_min=-1.0, clip_max=1.0, num_filters=32, **kwargs):
      super(ClippingWeightedSum, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.clip_min = clip_min
      self.clip_max = clip_max
      self.num_filters = num_filters
      self.weight_matrix = None
      self.bias = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.weight_matrix = self.add_weight(
          name='weight_matrix',
          shape=(input_shape[-1], self.num_filters),
          initializer='glorot_uniform',
          trainable=True
      )
      self.bias = self.add_weight(
          name='bias',
          shape=(self.num_filters,),
          initializer='zeros',
          trainable=True
      )
      super(ClippingWeightedSum, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
      clipped = tf.clip_by_value(inputs, self.clip_min, self.clip_max)
      linear_transform = tf.matmul(clipped, self.weight_matrix) + self.bias
      return tf.reduce_sum(linear_transform, axis=-1, keepdims=True)


    def get_config(self):
        config = super(ClippingWeightedSum, self).get_config()
        config.update({
            'clip_min': self.clip_min,
            'clip_max': self.clip_max,
            'num_filters': self.num_filters
        })
        return config
```

Here, the `ClippingWeightedSum` layer performs three distinct operations: clipping the input within specific bounds defined during initialization, performing a linear transformation using a trainable matrix and bias, then a final sum across the last dimension, adding another dimension to the tensor.  The `build` method here instantiates both the matrix `weight_matrix` and the `bias` vector, based on the provided input shape and parameters. The flexibility in defining each component allows the layer to operate differently on tensors, and can introduce complex relations not readily found in standard layer operations.

Finally, consider a more complex scenario: a custom attention mechanism.  This would be useful, for example, when dealing with sequential data where context needs to be selectively aggregated.

```python
class CustomAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, attention_size, **kwargs):
      super(CustomAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.attention_size = attention_size
      self.query_projection = None
      self.key_projection = None
      self.value_projection = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1]
        self.query_projection = self.add_weight(
           shape=(input_dim, self.attention_size),
           initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name='query_projection'
        )
        self.key_projection = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_dim, self.attention_size),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name='key_projection'
        )
        self.value_projection = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_dim, self.attention_size),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name='value_projection'
        )
        super(CustomAttention, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
       query = tf.matmul(inputs, self.query_projection)
       key = tf.matmul(inputs, self.key_projection)
       value = tf.matmul(inputs, self.value_projection)

       attention_scores = tf.matmul(query, key, transpose_b=True)
       attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(attention_scores, axis=-1)
       weighted_value = tf.matmul(attention_weights, value)
       return weighted_value

    def get_config(self):
        config = super(CustomAttention, self).get_config()
        config.update({
            'attention_size': self.attention_size
        })
        return config
```

This example showcases a more elaborate custom attention mechanism. It includes linear projections to generate the query, key, and value matrices, performs a scaled dot-product calculation for attention scores, then uses these weights to aggregate the value matrix. The critical point is that each operation, despite involving numerous matrix multiplications, is treated seamlessly as a singular layer within the Keras framework.

In conclusion, Keras absolutely can handle models with custom layers, offering an easily implementable pathway for sophisticated model development. These capabilities stem from the extensibility provided by the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class. The key to successful custom layer implementations involves correctly overriding the `__init__`, `build`, and `call` methods along with `get_config` and properly structuring the code to make use of TensorFlow's underlying tensor manipulations. Resources like the TensorFlow official documentation, specifically the 'Layers' section within the Keras API guide, and various online tutorials that demonstrate building custom layers with Keras are recommended for a deeper exploration of this topic.
