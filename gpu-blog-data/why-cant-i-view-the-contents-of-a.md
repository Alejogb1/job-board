The inability to view TensorFlow tensor contents often stems from a misunderstanding of tensor execution and the distinction between TensorFlow's computational graph and the actual values held within tensors.  TensorFlow, fundamentally, operates by constructing a computational graph, defining operations, and only executing this graph when explicitly requested.  This deferred execution model is key to understanding why a simple `print()` statement might not reveal the expected values.  In my experience debugging complex models with hundreds of operations, this distinction has often been the source of confusion, leading to hours spent chasing phantom errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow tensors are not like standard Python variables that hold immediately accessible data. Instead, they represent symbolic handles to data that will be processed within the TensorFlow execution context. When you create a tensor, you're not instantly populating memory with values; you're defining a node within the graph that *will* eventually produce a value upon execution.  This is particularly important when dealing with operations dependent on placeholder tensors or those defined within functions or control flow structures.  The values are only computed when the graph is executed, typically through a `Session` (in TensorFlow 1.x) or `tf.function` (in TensorFlow 2.x and beyond).  Failing to execute the graph, or attempting to access tensor values outside of the execution context, will result in an error or a meaningless representation, often showing the tensor's shape and data type rather than its actual contents.  This is further complicated by eager execution, introduced in TensorFlow 2.x, which by default executes operations immediately; however, even with eager execution, nested operations or custom functions may still require specific execution steps.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the need for explicit execution (TensorFlow 1.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x approach
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
    b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])
    c = a + b

    # Incorrect: This will not print the values of 'c'
    print(c)  # Outputs: Tensor("add:0", shape=(3,), dtype=int32)

    # Correct: Execute the graph and then print the result.
    c_value = sess.run(c)
    print(c_value) # Outputs: [5 7 9]
```

This example showcases a common mistake.  `print(c)` attempts to display the tensor `c` before its value has been computed. The output reflects the tensor's metadata (shape and type) rather than the result of the addition.  Only `sess.run(c)` evaluates the addition operation within the session and retrieves the actual numerical values.  Note that `tf.compat.v1` is used for compatibility with older code examples.

**Example 2:  Utilizing `tf.function` and eager execution (TensorFlow 2.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 2.x approach using tf.function
@tf.function
def add_tensors(a, b):
  return a + b

a = tf.constant([10, 20, 30])
b = tf.constant([40, 50, 60])

# Even with eager execution, the result isn't directly accessible from within the function.
# c = add_tensors(a, b) # Still needs execution
c = add_tensors(a, b).numpy() # Converts tensor to NumPy array for printing
print(c) # Outputs: [50 70 90]

# Alternative - direct eager execution
d = a + b
print(d.numpy()) # Outputs: [50 70 90]
```

Here, we use `tf.function` to define a function that adds two tensors.  While TensorFlow 2.x defaults to eager execution, the values within `add_tensors` are not immediately accessible outside the function without converting them explicitly to a NumPy array using `.numpy()`. The second part shows that direct addition in eager execution still benefits from a conversion for printing.


**Example 3: Debugging within a complex model (TensorFlow 2.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Simulate some input data
x = tf.random.normal((1,784))

# Get intermediate layer activations
layer_output = model.layers[0](x)

# Accessing intermediate values for debugging during model training or inference:
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x) #Important for calculating gradients
    predictions = model(x)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy([1], predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    
print("Layer Output:\n", layer_output.numpy()) # Numpy conversion is essential
print("Predictions:\n", predictions.numpy()) # Again, use NumPy for viewing tensors

print("Gradients:\n", gradients) # Often, gradients will be displayed without explicit conversion
```


This example demonstrates accessing tensor values within a Keras model during training or inference.  The crucial point here is the use of `.numpy()` to convert the TensorFlow tensors into NumPy arrays which allows for inspection.  Accessing intermediate activations helps in diagnosing issues within deep learning models.  Gradient inspection, a common debugging practice, often displays gradients without needing conversion.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on tensor manipulation and execution.  Familiarize yourself with the sections covering eager execution, `tf.function`, sessions (for TensorFlow 1.x), and tensor manipulation techniques.  Deep learning textbooks focusing on TensorFlow are valuable for gaining a holistic understanding of the framework's design principles and debugging methodologies.  Finally, reviewing tutorials and example code snippets from reputable sources is beneficial for practical application and troubleshooting.  Mastering debugging tools within your chosen IDE, particularly those integrating with TensorFlow, is paramount for efficient problem-solving.
