Let's delve into how Deep Graph Library (DGL) leverages the concept of information graphs, often referred to as infoGraphS, for enhanced graph representation and manipulation. My experience building several knowledge graph-based applications with DGL has shown me that the library doesn’t directly treat infoGraphS as a standalone data structure or method; instead, it absorbs the principles behind information enrichment into its core functionalities. The essence of infoGraphS – incorporating additional information beyond the bare structural graph – is achieved through techniques that DGL readily supports.

At the fundamental level, an information graph extends a conventional graph by attaching extra attributes to nodes and edges. These attributes can encapsulate rich textual descriptions, numerical measurements, or any form of data that augments the inherent connectivity structure. DGL facilitates the incorporation of such information through its flexible node and edge feature handling. Instead of solely considering a graph as a set of nodes and edges with simple identifiers, DGL allows us to associate tensors or other custom data with each component. This is where the notion of an infoGraph converges with DGL's design. We're not creating a separate "infoGraphS" class, but rather utilizing the library’s ability to represent richly attributed graphs, thereby embodying the infoGraphS concept.

A key mechanism through which DGL simulates the effects of infoGraphS is via its `node_attr` and `edge_attr` capabilities. These attributes are essentially tensors that can capture node or edge characteristics. In practical implementations, I've frequently encountered scenarios where nodes represent concepts in a knowledge base, and the associated feature tensors encode, for instance, pre-trained word embeddings of their names or descriptions, or structured data such as properties with corresponding values. Similarly, edge features might represent the strength or nature of the relationships between nodes, again captured as a tensor.

The processing of an enriched information graph within DGL is then seamless. Instead of requiring modifications to standard graph neural network models, we augment the feature extraction phase. The DGL graph objects already contain references to the feature tensors. When performing a message passing operation or during forward propagation, these feature tensors are automatically included in the calculations. Thus, you're essentially utilizing an infoGraphS by using DGL's built-in features and handling of tensors on nodes and edges.

Here are a few examples demonstrating this process in Python using DGL:

**Example 1: Node Features as Text Embeddings**

```python
import dgl
import torch

# Create a simple graph with 4 nodes and some edges.
g = dgl.graph(([0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 0]))

# Assume you have pre-computed text embeddings for each node.
# These could be output from models like BERT or Word2Vec.
node_embeddings = torch.randn(4, 128) # 4 nodes, 128-dimensional embeddings

# Assign the node embeddings as node features.
g.ndata['feat'] = node_embeddings

# Now during message passing, these embeddings can be used.
# Here's an example of a simple GCN message passing (for illustrative purposes only)
def message_func(edges):
  return {'msg': edges.src['feat']}

def reduce_func(nodes):
  return {'h': torch.mean(nodes.mailbox['msg'], dim=1)}

g.update_all(message_func, reduce_func)

# Access the resulting node representations after processing
updated_node_representations = g.ndata['h']
print(updated_node_representations)
```

In this first example, the node features, held in a 2D tensor named `node_embeddings`, represent each node's semantic content via a pre-calculated embedding. The DGL graph stores this tensor under the key ‘feat’ for later consumption in message passing. I've used a simplified GCN message function for demonstration. The key takeaway is that by storing such enhanced node features, we transform the underlying graph into an information-rich version, aligning with the infoGraphS concept.

**Example 2: Edge Features as Relationship Types**

```python
import dgl
import torch

# Create a graph with 3 nodes and 3 edges with different relationships
g = dgl.graph(([0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0]))

# Define edge features representing relationship types with one-hot vectors.
edge_features = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 0],  # Edge 0: 'relates_to'
                              [0, 1, 0],  # Edge 1: 'supports'
                              [0, 0, 1]], dtype=torch.float32)  # Edge 2: 'opposes'


# Assign edge features
g.edata['rel_type'] = edge_features

# Example of using edge features during messaging. (Simplified for demonstration)
def edge_message_func(edges):
    return {'msg' : edges.src['feat'] * edges.data['rel_type']}

def reduce_func_edge(nodes):
    return {'h_with_rel' : torch.sum(nodes.mailbox['msg'], dim=1)}

# Dummy Node features for the example to work
g.ndata['feat'] = torch.randn(3, 10)
g.update_all(edge_message_func, reduce_func_edge)


final_node_output_with_edge_feat = g.ndata['h_with_rel']
print(final_node_output_with_edge_feat)
```

Here, I illustrate an example where edge features represent relationship types through a one-hot vector. This kind of feature injection is helpful in knowledge graphs where the relationship between two concepts could be varied and of semantic importance. My experience showed that explicitly accounting for different relationships improves performance by allowing the model to differentiate between different types of associations between nodes in a graph.  Again, DGL’s design allows the message function to take into account the `rel_type` edge features.

**Example 3: Combined Node and Edge Features**

```python
import dgl
import torch

# Create a simple graph with 4 nodes and 4 edges
g = dgl.graph(([0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 0]))

# Node features (e.g., word embeddings).
node_features = torch.randn(4, 64)

# Edge features (e.g., weights or relationship indicators)
edge_features = torch.rand(4, 1)

# Assign the node and edge features to the graph
g.ndata['feat'] = node_features
g.edata['weight'] = edge_features

# Function showcasing usage during messaging. Simplified for demonstration.
def combined_message_func(edges):
  return {'msg': edges.src['feat'] * edges.data['weight']}

def combine_reduce_func(nodes):
  return {'h_combined': torch.mean(nodes.mailbox['msg'], dim=1)}

g.update_all(combined_message_func, combine_reduce_func)

combined_node_outputs = g.ndata['h_combined']
print(combined_node_outputs)
```

In this final example, I present a scenario where both node and edge features are incorporated. This combination is typical in many complex knowledge graph applications where the message passing process benefits from understanding not only the node properties but also the nature of the relationships between nodes. DGL’s capacity for handling distinct features in nodes and edges is what makes it so suitable for handling infoGraphS as a modeling concept, not as a separate structure.

In summary, while DGL doesn't have a distinct "infoGraphS" object, its capability to associate custom data (using `ndata` and `edata`) with nodes and edges is precisely how the library manages and makes use of information-enriched graphs. This allows DGL to utilize the additional data effectively in message passing operations and neural network models, thus aligning to what we expect of an information graph approach.

For readers seeking to further explore this topic, I would recommend investigating resources on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph attention networks (GATs), and specifically those materials that detail how feature incorporation is integrated during their message passing steps. It's also worthwhile reviewing DGL's official documentation extensively to become proficient in how it handles node and edge features for graph representation and computation. Studies focusing on knowledge graph embedding techniques offer also good insights into the variety of feature augmentation strategies. Finally, looking into the use of pre-trained language models in conjunction with graph neural networks would provide a very good practical approach.
