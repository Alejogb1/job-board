The core function of `tf.GradientTape.gradients` when dealing with multi-dimensional tensors as targets hinges on backpropagation's vector-Jacobian product. It doesn't compute the full Jacobian matrix, which would be impractical for high-dimensional outputs. Instead, it calculates the product of the Jacobian matrix with an incoming gradient, often called the "upstream gradient." This optimized approach allows TensorFlow to efficiently compute gradients for complex models, even those with outputs that are themselves tensors.

When a target within a `tf.GradientTape` context is a multi-dimensional tensor, `gradients` computes the derivative of a scalar-valued loss function *with respect to* the variables, where the loss function’s scalar output is derived from the target tensor. This is crucial. The tensor itself isn't directly differentiated, but rather the scalar result of an operation performed on it, like a sum, mean, or a specific element's selection.  The upstream gradient with which the Jacobian is multiplied is often, but not exclusively, a tensor of ones equal to the shape of the multi-dimensional target. When it is not ones, it is defined by a prior chain rule calculation which effectively dictates the "direction" of gradient flow.

My experience developing a simulation framework for fluid dynamics with TensorFlow highlighted this mechanism. We had pressure fields represented as rank-3 tensors, and during each timestep we needed to compute the gradient of a constraint violation function, which was a scalar, with respect to the pressure field.

Let's examine three concrete scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Scalar Loss from Tensor Summation**

Imagine you have a 2x2 tensor as a model output, representing, perhaps, the velocity field of a 2D space. The scalar loss is simply the sum of all its elements.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2), mean=2, stddev=0.5)) # Initial velocity field

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(x)  # Scalar loss is the sum of the tensor elements

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, x)

print("Input Variable x:\n", x)
print("\nGradients of loss with respect to x:\n", gradients)
```

In this case, `gradients` returns a 2x2 tensor filled with ones. Why? `tf.reduce_sum` effectively reduces each element into a single value by addition.  The gradient of a sum is the sum of the gradients, and the derivative of *xᵢ* with respect to *xᵢ* is 1. The gradient thus mirrors the shape of our variable `x` because the effect of changing *any* cell in `x` has equal impact (magnitude of 1) on the scalar loss. This is the result of the vector-Jacobian product between the shape of the loss, 1, and the Jacobian. The Jacobian matrix, if it had been explicitly created, would be 4x4 matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off diagonal and the upstream gradient is 1.

**Scenario 2: Scalar Loss from Tensor Mean**

Building upon the previous example, suppose our loss is now the mean of the tensor's elements.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2), mean=2, stddev=0.5)) # Initial velocity field

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(x)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, x)

print("Input Variable x:\n", x)
print("\nGradients of loss with respect to x:\n", gradients)
```

Now the gradient is a 2x2 tensor filled with values of 0.25 (1/4).  `tf.reduce_mean` calculates the average. The derivative of the mean of *n* elements *xᵢ* with respect to any *xᵢ* is *1/n*.  Since our tensor has four elements, the gradient with respect to any single element is 0.25. Again, the gradient mirrors the shape of our variable. This demonstrates how TensorFlow implicitly handles the scaling introduced by the mean operation during backpropagation.

**Scenario 3: Targeted Backpropagation through Tensor Indexing**

Let's introduce a twist. Instead of the entire tensor affecting the loss, what if only a specific element does? This is often useful in complex loss functions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2), mean=2, stddev=0.5)) # Initial velocity field

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = x[0, 1] # Loss depends only on single element x[0,1]

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, x)

print("Input Variable x:\n", x)
print("\nGradients of loss with respect to x:\n", gradients)
```

Here, `gradients` is a 2x2 tensor, but it has a value of 1 at the index corresponding to the element *x[0, 1]* and zeros everywhere else. The upstream gradient is essentially a "selector" that isolates the influence of this particular element on the loss.  The gradient for any *xᵢ* not selected in the slice operation is 0, since it has no impact on the scalar loss. This method demonstrates the use of indexing to achieve focused backpropagation.

**Key Insights and Considerations**

1.  **Upstream Gradient:**  The incoming gradient, whether it’s a tensor of ones implicitly defined, or some other tensor calculated from previous steps in the network, provides a vital mechanism for correctly backpropagating error through layers. This gradient is the "multiplier" in the vector-Jacobian product.

2.  **Shape Preservation:** The resulting gradient tensor always matches the shape of the variable it is the derivative of. TensorFlow ensures this property because it performs the vector-Jacobian product that results in an output with the same shape as the variables.

3.  **Scalarization:**  The target of the differentiation *must* lead to a scalar loss. If the user does not define a specific scalar loss, and instead passes a tensor, `gradients` uses an implicit sum operation which results in the same behavior as `tf.reduce_sum`. Operations like reduce mean, or custom element selections, are critical when defining how a multi-dimensional output impacts the overall loss. The scalar nature of the loss defines the shape of the upstream gradient.

4. **Efficiency:** The Jacobian matrix is never explicitly constructed, which allows for efficient training of large models with high-dimensional tensors. The vector-Jacobian product approach is at the core of backpropagation.

5.  **Error Handling**: If the loss calculation results in an undefined gradient, or if the tape does not contain the variables of interest, then the gradient output may be `None` (or it will raise an exception if variables are required). This can occur if no operations involving a particular variable were recorded on the tape.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deep dive into the mathematical underpinnings of automatic differentiation, research resources that discuss the concepts of "vector-Jacobian product" and "backpropagation." Texts on deep learning theory, particularly those that explore the computational aspects of neural networks, are invaluable.  Additionally, the TensorFlow documentation itself provides detailed information on the usage of `tf.GradientTape` and related functions.

Exploring research papers on automatic differentiation will further elucidate how these concepts are practically implemented in computational libraries like TensorFlow. Practical experience using `tf.GradientTape` will solidify this knowledge by letting you directly experiment with gradients and various output tensors.
