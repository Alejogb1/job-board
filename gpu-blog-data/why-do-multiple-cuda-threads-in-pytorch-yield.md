The core issue behind lower per-process GPU utilization when using multiple CUDA threads in PyTorch often stems from the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations within Python itself, alongside inefficiencies in PyTorch's multi-threaded execution model when directly working with CUDA operations. I've observed this firsthand across numerous deep learning projects, where a naive assumption of linear scaling with increased threads routinely fails to materialize.

Let me clarify that while PyTorch leverages CUDA for hardware acceleration on the GPU, the process of launching and managing CUDA kernels is often initiated from the CPU side using Python. The GIL, a mutex that protects access to Python objects, ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at any given moment. This effectively serializes the interaction between multiple Python threads and the PyTorch CUDA backend, even if the underlying GPU kernel launch is asynchronous.

When using multiple threads to trigger GPU operations in PyTorch, each thread contends for the GIL when making calls into the PyTorch C++ layer that interfaces with the CUDA driver. Consider a scenario where threads are attempting to generate random tensor data, then perform calculations via PyTorch's CUDA backend. If multiple threads are each repeatedly generating tensor data on the CPU and then kicking off a GPU operation, they quickly become bottlenecked by contention for the GIL. This effectively transforms a multi-threaded operation into a series of mostly sequential Python calls. Even if the GPU itself isn't saturated during any of these calls, the latency introduced by the GIL, along with CPU overhead in managing Python threads, results in a decrease in overall per-process utilization. This isn't a GPU problem per se, but rather a CPU-bound issue manifesting in lower-than-expected GPU throughput.

Furthermore, while PyTorch is engineered to provide asynchronous kernel execution, it doesn't completely eliminate thread synchronization on the CPU side. Certain operations, such as synchronizing all GPU threads, or retrieving data from the GPU to the host, necessitate brief synchronous blocks. The time these synchronous blocks spend is compounded with the overhead of the GIL if multiple Python threads are concurrently making such calls. This creates further bottlenecks when multiple threads are used incorrectly.

Another crucial element is the scheduling of threads by the operating system. OS threads arenâ€™t necessarily mapped to CPU cores one-to-one, and the operating system may switch thread contexts frequently, adding CPU overhead and further contention for the GIL. This isn't unique to PyTorch or CUDA; it's inherent to multi-threading in any Python program that performs CPU-bound tasks that are managed by the GIL. However, in PyTorch, it's crucial to understand how these limitations restrict the potential gains from using multiple threads to push work onto the GPU. The goal is to keep the GPU saturated with computations with minimal GIL and CPU contention.

Let me provide a few illustrative examples, emphasizing how to circumvent these issues:

**Example 1: Naive Multi-threading with GIL Bottleneck**

```python
import torch
import threading
import time

def gpu_computation(size):
    a = torch.rand(size, size, device="cuda")
    b = torch.rand(size, size, device="cuda")
    c = torch.matmul(a, b)
    c.cpu() # Pull back to the CPU - potentially creates a sync

def run_threads(num_threads, size):
    threads = []
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(num_threads):
        t = threading.Thread(target=gpu_computation, args=(size,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()

    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Time taken with {num_threads} threads: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    size = 1024
    run_threads(1, size)   # Baseline, Single Thread
    run_threads(4, size) # Multi-Threaded, high chance of GIL bottleneck
```

This code demonstrates the core problem. When `run_threads` is executed with one thread, the GPU is fairly well utilized by the single process. However, using more threads as in the second `run_threads` call, results in little reduction in runtime, indicating that the GIL prevents the GPU from being concurrently utilized. The CPU is bottlenecked, negating the benefits of multi-threading for this type of computation. We will observe a marginal speed up at best with multiple threads, while the per process utilization goes down due to overhead. The data is explicitly pulled back to the CPU, which creates a synchronisation point. This synchronization point further compounds the GIL problem when run in a multi-threaded fashion.

**Example 2: Utilizing `torch.multiprocessing` and Process Isolation**

```python
import torch
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
import time

def gpu_computation(size):
    a = torch.rand(size, size, device="cuda")
    b = torch.rand(size, size, device="cuda")
    c = torch.matmul(a, b)
    c.cpu() # Still pulling the data back to CPU but its isolated

def run_processes(num_processes, size):
    processes = []
    start_time = time.time()
    mp.set_start_method('spawn') # Necessary for CUDA
    for _ in range(num_processes):
        p = mp.Process(target=gpu_computation, args=(size,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Time taken with {num_processes} processes: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    size = 1024
    run_processes(1, size) # Baseline single process
    run_processes(4, size) # Multi-processed - improved utilization
```

By switching to `torch.multiprocessing` and leveraging Python's process-based concurrency, we circumvent the GIL issue. Each process gets its own Python interpreter and its own GIL. The CUDA contexts are isolated, which prevents contention for the GIL and allows for better distribution of work on the GPU between each process. `mp.set_start_method('spawn')` is crucial to ensure the CUDA driver functions properly. This approach will often lead to much improved performance when compared with the multi-threaded version. The CPU overhead here is much lower than with threads due to improved scheduling and lack of GIL contention.

**Example 3: Batch Processing to Minimize Kernel Launches**

```python
import torch
import time

def gpu_computation_batch(size, batch_size):
    a = torch.rand(batch_size, size, size, device="cuda")
    b = torch.rand(batch_size, size, size, device="cuda")
    c = torch.matmul(a, b)
    c.cpu()

if __name__ == "__main__":
   size = 1024
   batch_size_1 = 1
   start_time = time.time()
   for _ in range(100):
      gpu_computation_batch(size, batch_size_1)
   end_time = time.time()
   print(f"Time taken with batch size {batch_size_1}: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

   batch_size_2 = 100
   start_time = time.time()
   gpu_computation_batch(size, batch_size_2)
   end_time = time.time()
   print(f"Time taken with batch size {batch_size_2}: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

This example focuses on efficient kernel invocation rather than concurrency. The first loop launches 100 separate matmul kernels with a batch size of one, while the second performs the equivalent workload with a single call and a batch size of 100. The time taken is substantially reduced by batching the work and minimizing the overhead of repeated launches. This demonstrates the importance of performing calculations in batched manner to take advantage of the full capabilities of a GPU. Repeated smaller launches cause high overhead.

Recommendations for further study involve exploring advanced techniques in PyTorch documentation for data-parallel training. Understanding the intricacies of CUDA stream management using PyTorch's C++ extensions is crucial to maximize GPU throughput. Additionally, profiling tools, specific to CUDA and Python, are recommended to identify bottlenecks specific to the user's code. In essence, the most effective mitigation strategy involves avoiding small, frequently launched kernels, and embracing larger batched operations to better utilize the GPU, alongside the appropriate type of parallelism (processes over threads).
