The specific behavior of `train_test_split_edges` in PyTorch Geometric (PyG), particularly with regard to positive and negative edges, is crucial for building robust graph neural network (GNN) models, especially those used in link prediction tasks. The function's core task is not simply splitting the edges of a graph into train, validation, and test sets; it also intelligently handles the creation and segregation of negative edges, which represent relationships that *do not* exist in the graph. My experience building a large-scale knowledge graph for a pharmaceutical company highlighted how subtle differences in how these negative edges are constructed and split can profoundly impact model performance.

The fundamental principle behind `train_test_split_edges` is to divide a graph's edge set while maintaining a realistic distribution of positive and negative interactions. The function achieves this by first designating a certain proportion of existing (positive) edges as the testing or validation sets. Following that, it generates an equivalent number of *negative edges* for each subset. These negative edges are created by randomly pairing nodes within the graph that do *not* currently share a direct connection. The resulting data object has several new attributes to facilitate modeling, notably `edge_index_train`, `edge_index_valid`, and `edge_index_test` which store the indices of positive edges. It also creates a number of related attributes storing negative edges, like `edge_index_neg_train`, `edge_index_neg_valid`, and `edge_index_neg_test`.

The implication of this separation lies in providing a suitable environment for the GNN to learn and validate its ability to predict existing connections accurately without overfitting to the training set. If negative edges are not considered explicitly, the model can easily fall into a trap of merely confirming the existing edges rather than generalizing the underlying relationship. This means that without using explicitly generated negative edges during training, we are only training our model to identify positive relations. In a scenario where new relations should be predicted, the model will simply learn to output ‘no relationship’ for everything outside of the training set.

There is another significant implication of negative edges in `train_test_split_edges`. The creation of negative edges is not merely random; it’s performed while preserving the degree distribution of the nodes as much as possible. That is, nodes with high degree have proportionally more negative edges assigned to them than nodes with low degree. This ensures that the model doesn't have an unbalanced training signal that is skewed to nodes that have a large number of existing relations. The splitting of negative edges also mirrors the split of positive edges, so we obtain an equal number of negative and positive edges in each training, validation, and testing set. This is essential for evaluating link prediction tasks with metrics such as AUC or accuracy that expect a comparable number of positive and negative samples. Without an even distribution, the model might exhibit spurious high performance and, when evaluated on a real-world dataset, fail spectacularly.

Let's demonstrate with a few code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Usage**

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from torch_geometric.utils import train_test_split_edges

# Create a dummy graph with 10 nodes and some edges
edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3],
                           [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6]], dtype=torch.long)
x = torch.randn(10, 16) # Node features
data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index)

# Split the edges into train/validation/test sets (default ratios)
data = train_test_split_edges(data)

# Print the sizes of the split edge sets and an example of an edge
print(f"Training positive edges: {data.edge_index_train.shape[1]}")
print(f"Validation positive edges: {data.edge_index_valid.shape[1]}")
print(f"Testing positive edges: {data.edge_index_test.shape[1]}")
print(f"Training negative edges: {data.edge_index_neg_train.shape[1]}")
print(f"Example positive training edge: {data.edge_index_train[:,0]}")
```

This code first creates a simple graph structure with a node feature matrix `x` and a connectivity matrix `edge_index`. Then it uses `train_test_split_edges` without passing arguments to split using the default proportions (85/5/10 split) and to create negative edges. The sizes of the positive and negative edge sets are then printed, demonstrating that they are equal within each split. We also print an example of a positive training edge to see the specific tensor representing the connection between two nodes.

**Example 2: Custom Split Ratios**

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from torch_geometric.utils import train_test_split_edges

# Create a dummy graph with 10 nodes and some edges
edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3],
                           [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6]], dtype=torch.long)
x = torch.randn(10, 16) # Node features
data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index)

# Split the edges with custom ratios (60/20/20)
data = train_test_split_edges(data, train_ratio=0.6, val_ratio=0.2)

# Print the sizes of the split edge sets
print(f"Training positive edges: {data.edge_index_train.shape[1]}")
print(f"Validation positive edges: {data.edge_index_valid.shape[1]}")
print(f"Testing positive edges: {data.edge_index_test.shape[1]}")
print(f"Training negative edges: {data.edge_index_neg_train.shape[1]}")
```

This example builds upon the first example by using the `train_ratio` and `val_ratio` parameters to explicitly control the split of edges into training, validation, and test sets. These proportions are applied not only to the positive edges but also to the automatically generated negative edges. This demonstration illustrates how the split can be customized to specific requirements. Notice that now the proportions have been changed to 60/20/20. This split can be important in order to achieve optimal validation on the data.

**Example 3: Using Negative Edges for Model Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
from torch_geometric.utils import train_test_split_edges

# Create a dummy graph with 10 nodes and some edges
edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3],
                           [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6]], dtype=torch.long)
x = torch.randn(10, 16) # Node features
data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index)

# Split the edges
data = train_test_split_edges(data)

# Define a simple GNN model
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, hidden_channels):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(num_features, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, 1)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x.squeeze()

model = Net(num_features=16, hidden_channels=32)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss() # Use a binary cross entropy loss with logits

# Training loop using the training positive and negative edge data
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Gather positive and negative edge indices for training
    pos_edge_index = data.edge_index_train
    neg_edge_index = data.edge_index_neg_train

    # Generate node embeddings from the GNN
    z = model(data.x, data.edge_index)

    # Create embeddings for positive and negative edges
    pos_score = (z[pos_edge_index[0]] * z[pos_edge_index[1]]).sum(dim=-1)
    neg_score = (z[neg_edge_index[0]] * z[neg_edge_index[1]]).sum(dim=-1)

    # Create labels and predictions for positive and negative edges
    y_pos = torch.ones(pos_score.size(0))
    y_neg = torch.zeros(neg_score.size(0))
    y = torch.cat([y_pos, y_neg], dim=0)
    score = torch.cat([pos_score, neg_score], dim=0)

    loss = criterion(score, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch {epoch} - Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example illustrates how to integrate the separated positive and negative edges into the training process. The GNN model computes node embeddings, and these embeddings are then used to score the likelihood of each edge by computing the inner product of connected nodes. The loss function, binary cross entropy with logits, uses the created labels from positive edges (1) and negative edges (0). This is a simplification, and in practice, one might need more involved sampling techniques. The training loop uses both positive and negative edge data during the loss computation, which allows it to learn how a real connection is distinguished from a lack of connection.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing literature on link prediction specifically focusing on graph neural networks. Publications by the researchers who initially developed PyTorch Geometric also offer significant insights. Additionally, studying standard graph theory books which discuss the construction of such datasets might be of use. Finally, exploring related resources that discuss the impact of negative sampling techniques in other fields of machine learning can provide a more well-rounded understanding of these methods.
