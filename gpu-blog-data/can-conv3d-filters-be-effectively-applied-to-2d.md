The direct application of a 3D convolutional (Conv3D) filter to 2D image data, while technically feasible, is inherently inefficient and often ineffective without strategic modifications. This stems from the fundamental dimensionality mismatch between the filter’s expected input and the actual data. Conv3D filters, by design, operate on volumetric data, such as video sequences or 3D medical scans, where three spatial dimensions are present. Therefore, attempting to use them directly on 2D images leads to either a loss of information or the unintended learning of features that are irrelevant to the image's spatial structure.

Let's consider the mechanics of a Conv3D operation. A Conv3D filter is a tensor with dimensions (depth, height, width, input_channels, output_channels). When applied to a 3D input tensor (depth, height, width, channels), the filter slides across all three spatial dimensions, performing a dot product at each location. Crucially, the depth dimension is integral to this process. Now, imagine inputting a 2D image. To make this compatible with Conv3D, one must treat it as a 3D tensor with a depth of one (1, height, width, channels). This is the most common implicit conversion when using Conv3D on 2D data directly.

The problem arises because the Conv3D filter, having a non-unity depth dimension, expects to convolve across multiple slices, or frames. When the depth of the input is explicitly one, and the filter's depth is greater than one, only the first depth slice of the filter is effectively used in each convolution. The filter's depth parameters will often learn to be close to zero, rendering that part of the filter redundant. Essentially, the Conv3D is forced to simulate a Conv2D operation on the initial slice of the input, while the filter weights corresponding to subsequent "depth" slices are largely unused. This is wasteful computationally and does not leverage the potential of the 3D filter effectively.

Further, even if a Conv3D filter’s depth was set to unity (e.g., (1, kernel_size, kernel_size, in_channels, out_channels)) to match the single "slice" input, it's still less computationally efficient than using an equivalent Conv2D filter with dimension (kernel_size, kernel_size, in_channels, out_channels). The Conv3D implementation still maintains the additional depth dimension, incurring unnecessary overhead.

However, there are legitimate scenarios where adapting Conv3D to 2D data proves useful with careful modification. These involve leveraging the 3D filter’s capacity for learning relationships along what would typically be the 'depth' dimension, if we re-interpret it strategically. One common example is using temporal sequence data represented as a sequence of 2D frames, akin to a video snippet. We can “stack” these images along the pseudo-depth axis of a 3D tensor. Then, a Conv3D filter can capture temporal patterns in the sequence of 2D images, something a traditional Conv2D filter cannot do.

Let’s now look at some examples, demonstrating both direct, less-effective application and proper usage.

**Example 1: Ineffective Direct Application**

This example demonstrates the most basic, and often inefficient, usage of a Conv3D on 2D data, treating an image as a single slice.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume a 2D image with 3 channels (RGB)
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)  # (batch, channels, height, width)

# Conv3D with a depth greater than one
conv3d_layer = nn.Conv3d(3, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), padding='same')

# Reshape image to be treated as a 3D tensor (add a single depth dimension)
image_3d = image.unsqueeze(2)  # (batch, channels, depth=1, height, width)

# Apply the Conv3D
output = conv3d_layer(image_3d)

print(output.shape) # Output shape will be (1, 16, 1, 64, 64)
```

In this scenario, the `image` is reshaped to include a depth dimension with a size of 1. The `Conv3d` layer, despite having a kernel depth of 3, effectively only convolves the initial frame/slice at each spatial location. The remaining two filter depth layers will be largely ignored during optimization.

**Example 2: Temporal Feature Extraction with Stacked Images**

Here, we demonstrate how Conv3D filters become meaningful when used with a sequence of 2D images.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume a sequence of 5 frames, each with 3 channels
frames = torch.randn(1, 5, 3, 64, 64)  # (batch, time_frames, channels, height, width)

# Transpose dimensions to the expected (batch, channels, depth, height, width) for Conv3D
frames_3d = frames.permute(0, 2, 1, 3, 4) # (batch, channels, time_frames=depth, height, width)

# Conv3D to capture temporal changes across the frame sequence
conv3d_layer_temporal = nn.Conv3d(3, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), padding='same')

# Apply the Conv3D
output_temporal = conv3d_layer_temporal(frames_3d)

print(output_temporal.shape) # Output shape will be (1, 16, 5, 64, 64)
```

In this instance, the images, representing a sequence in the "time_frames" dimension, are first permuted to be in (batch, channels, depth, height, width) format and then fed into the `Conv3d` layer. Now, the 3D kernel's depth is used to analyze the evolution of features across the sequence.

**Example 3: Modification for 2D Equivalent Behavior**

If we need to use the infrastructure or architecture for 3D but wish to replicate 2D functionality, we can use a Conv3D with specific configurations.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume a 2D image
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)

# Reshape image
image_3d = image.unsqueeze(2) # Add a single depth dimension (1,3,1,64,64)

# Conv3D with a depth of 1; will be similar to a Conv2D
conv3d_layer_2d_sim = nn.Conv3d(3, 16, kernel_size=(1, 3, 3), padding='same')

# Apply the modified Conv3D
output_2d_sim = conv3d_layer_2d_sim(image_3d)

print(output_2d_sim.shape) # Output shape will be (1, 16, 1, 64, 64)
```

Here, although we use `nn.Conv3d`, we set the filter kernel's depth to 1. In effect, this will operate similarly to a Conv2D; however, it remains less efficient than using a `nn.Conv2d` layer because of overhead from depth.

For deeper study of this topic, I recommend referring to materials on convolutional neural networks, paying particular attention to the differences between 2D and 3D convolutions. Look for documentation and tutorials relating to libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow for their implementations of convolution layers. Textbooks specializing in computer vision and deep learning can provide a theoretical underpinning. Further investigation into video processing and 3D signal processing may help better understand contexts where 3D convolutional layers are more appropriate. Also, practical examples found in repositories focusing on spatio-temporal learning will demonstrate the nuances. Research papers focused on specific application areas of 3D convolutions can be beneficial in further understanding their use and limitations.
