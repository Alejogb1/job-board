The most frequent cause of stagnant weights in PyTorch training stems from an incorrect configuration of the optimizer's learning rate scheduler or an oversight in the optimizer's instantiation itself.  Over the years of building and debugging deep learning models, I’ve encountered this issue countless times, often masked by seemingly unrelated errors.  The problem rarely lies in the model architecture itself, unless there are fundamental design flaws (like a vanishing gradient problem stemming from inappropriate activation functions or excessively deep layers – but that's a different troubleshooting path entirely).  Focusing on the optimizer and its parameters is typically the most efficient diagnostic approach.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core mechanism of backpropagation relies on the optimizer to adjust model parameters (weights and biases) based on the calculated gradients. The optimizer uses the learning rate to scale these gradients before applying the update.  If the learning rate is too small, the updates become negligible, effectively freezing the weights. Conversely, an excessively large learning rate can lead to oscillations or divergence, preventing convergence and appearing as if the weights aren't updating.  Beyond the learning rate itself, issues can arise from incorrect optimizer setup, particularly concerning weight decay (L2 regularization), momentum, and other hyperparameters specific to individual optimizers like AdamW or SGD.

Furthermore, ensure that your model's parameters are actually being computed during the forward pass.  A subtle bug, even a simple typo in accessing layers or incorrectly defined forward propagation, can prevent gradient calculation, resulting in zero gradients and thus no weight updates.   Inspecting the gradients directly after the backward pass can quickly reveal this issue.  Finally, ensure that `requires_grad=True` is set for all parameters you intend to train.  This is often overlooked when constructing custom layers or loading pre-trained models.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Learning Rate**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition (simplified for clarity)
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Data (placeholder)
X = torch.randn(100, 10)
y = torch.randn(100, 1)

# Model instantiation
model = SimpleModel()

# Incorrect learning rate – too small to observe updates
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-10)  # Extremely small learning rate

# Training loop (simplified)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Inspect weights after training - minimal change due to small learning rate
for param in model.parameters():
    print(param.data)
```

This example demonstrates the impact of an excessively small learning rate. The `lr=1e-10` prevents significant weight updates, resulting in minimal loss reduction over many epochs.  Replacing this with a more suitable learning rate (e.g., 0.01 or 0.1, depending on the dataset and model complexity) will yield noticeable improvements.


**Example 2:  `requires_grad=False` inadvertently set:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(5, 5)
        #This line is crucially wrong, preventing weight updates
        self.linear.requires_grad = False

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


model = nn.Sequential(MyLayer(), nn.Linear(5,1))
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
# ... rest of the training loop (similar to Example 1)
```

This illustrates a common pitfall: unintentionally disabling gradient calculation for specific layers.  The `requires_grad=False` setting prevents the optimizer from updating the weights of `self.linear` within `MyLayer`.  Inspecting the gradients or explicitly setting `requires_grad=True` for all trainable parameters resolves this.  In larger models, using `model.apply(lambda m: setattr(m, 'requires_grad', True))` might be prudent for comprehensive control.


**Example 3:  Optimizer Misconfiguration (Weight Decay):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model and data definition from Example 1) ...

# Incorrect weight decay – excessively large, preventing effective updates
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=10.0)  # High weight decay

# Training loop (similar to Example 1)

# Inspection after training will show minimal change or even weight decay to zero
for param in model.parameters():
  print(param.data)
```

This example showcases the effect of an overly large weight decay parameter in `optim.AdamW`. Weight decay (L2 regularization) adds a penalty to the loss function, proportional to the square of the weights.  An excessively high weight decay effectively shrinks the weights towards zero, counteracting the learning process and hindering weight updates.  Adjusting the `weight_decay` value to a smaller, more appropriate value (e.g., 0.01 or 0.001) is crucial for proper training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections on optimizers and automatic differentiation, are invaluable.  Furthermore, consult textbooks on deep learning fundamentals for a deeper theoretical understanding of backpropagation and optimization algorithms.  Reviewing open-source PyTorch projects on platforms like GitHub for examples of correctly implemented training loops can also be highly beneficial.  Finally, consider exploring the literature on debugging and troubleshooting deep learning models.  Numerous articles and papers address common challenges encountered during model training. Remember to carefully read the documentation of every function and module you are using.  Many errors can be avoided by paying close attention to the detail provided by PyTorch's API.
