The transient nature of Docker node status transitions from "Ready" to "Down" on macOS following restarts or sleep events fundamentally stems from the ephemeral nature of the virtualized networking provided by Docker Desktop.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous projects – specifically involving distributed applications and orchestration with Kubernetes – highlights the critical role of the Docker daemon's interaction with the host operating system's network stack.  The issue isn't necessarily a Docker bug per se, but rather a consequence of how Docker interacts with macOS's virtualization layer and its handling of network interfaces during system sleep and wake cycles.

**1. Explanation:**

Docker Desktop on macOS utilizes a hypervisor (typically HyperKit) to create a virtual machine environment. This virtual machine hosts the Docker daemon and its associated containers. Network connectivity between the host macOS system and the containers within this virtual machine relies on virtual network interfaces managed by the hypervisor. When the macOS system restarts or enters sleep mode, these virtual interfaces can be disrupted.  The Docker daemon, unable to properly communicate over these disrupted interfaces, loses its connectivity to the host and reports the node as "Down".  This isn't an immediate failure within the Docker daemon itself; rather it's a consequence of the network stack failing to reestablish correctly following the system's transition.

Several factors can exacerbate this issue:

* **Hypervisor instability:**  Occasional instability within HyperKit can lead to incomplete restoration of the virtual network on wake-up.
* **Network configuration conflicts:** Conflicting network configurations on the host system, including static IP addresses or VPN configurations, might interfere with the automatic reconfiguration of the Docker virtual network.
* **Resource limitations:** Insufficient system resources (RAM, CPU) during the boot or wake-up process might delay or prevent the Docker daemon from properly initializing and connecting to its virtual network.
* **Docker Desktop version:** Older versions of Docker Desktop had more pronounced issues in this regard, with improvements implemented across several releases.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The solution often involves ensuring the Docker daemon and its associated network components are fully initialized and functioning correctly after a restart or wake-up.  While there isn't specific code to "fix" the macOS sleep/restart issue directly within Docker, focusing on monitoring and restarting the daemon can mitigate the problem.

**Example 1: Monitoring Docker Daemon Status with `docker info`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  docker info | grep "Server Version" > /dev/null 2>&1
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") - Docker daemon is down. Attempting restart..."
    sudo systemctl restart docker # or appropriate method for your system
  else
    echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") - Docker daemon is running."
  fi
  sleep 60 # Check every 60 seconds
done
```

This script continuously monitors the Docker daemon's status using `docker info`. If the command fails (indicating the daemon is not running), it attempts to restart the Docker daemon using `sudo systemctl restart docker`.  Replace this command with the appropriate one if your system doesn't use systemd. This script is rudimentary but demonstrates the principle of automated monitoring and recovery.  Robust solutions would involve error handling and logging for improved reliability.

**Example 2:  Using `docker system prune` for cleanup:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

docker system prune -f
echo "Docker system pruned."
```

Before restarting the Docker daemon or after a system wake-up, running `docker system prune -f` can remove dangling images, networks, and containers, which can sometimes interfere with the daemon’s initialization.  The `-f` flag forces the removal without prompting for confirmation.  Use caution with this command, ensuring you understand its implications before employing it in a production environment.


**Example 3:  Checking Network Interfaces Post-Restart (macOS-Specific):**

This example requires knowledge of the macOS network configuration and Docker's virtual networking within the HyperKit VM.  It's not directly executable code in the typical sense. Instead, it outlines a process:

1. **Identify the virtual network interface:** After a restart or wake-up, use the `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` command (depending on your preference) to list all active network interfaces on your macOS system. Identify the interface created by Docker (often related to the HyperKit VM).
2. **Verify connectivity:** Ping the Docker daemon's address using the identified interface.  If connectivity is absent, investigate potential network conflicts or further diagnose HyperKit functionality.  This requires an understanding of your macOS networking configuration and the specifics of the Docker Desktop installation.

This process highlights the need to check the lower-level network aspects to understand the root cause of the connectivity issue.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further investigation and understanding, I strongly advise consulting the official Docker Desktop documentation for macOS, specifically the troubleshooting section addressing network issues. The Docker documentation offers explanations of the underlying technology and provides solutions to more specialized problems.  Additionally, examining system logs (including macOS system logs and Docker daemon logs) provides valuable insights into the events occurring during the sleep/wake cycles or restarts. Lastly, review the HyperKit documentation if you wish to gain a deeper understanding of the virtualization layer used by Docker Desktop.  Thorough examination of these resources often reveals the precise cause of the “Ready” to “Down” transitions.
