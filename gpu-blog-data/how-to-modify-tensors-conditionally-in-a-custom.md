TensorFlow's flexibility extends to defining custom loss functions, a crucial aspect of model training.  However, conditionally modifying tensors within these functions requires careful consideration of TensorFlow's computational graph and its automatic differentiation mechanisms.  My experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models highlighted the importance of efficient conditional tensor manipulation to avoid performance bottlenecks and gradient instability. The key is leveraging TensorFlow's conditional operations and ensuring these operations remain differentiable to allow for proper backpropagation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Modifying tensors conditionally within a custom TensorFlow loss function involves selectively applying transformations based on tensor values or external conditions.  This necessitates using TensorFlow's control flow operations, primarily `tf.cond` and `tf.where`, within the context of a function designed to calculate the loss.  A critical element is maintaining differentiability; otherwise, the automatic gradient calculation will fail, preventing model training.  Standard conditional statements from Python (e.g., `if-else`) cannot be directly used within TensorFlow graphs because they disrupt the automatic differentiation process.  Instead, TensorFlow provides operations specifically designed for conditional computations within the computational graph.

The general approach involves defining a function that takes the predicted tensor and the target tensor as input.  Inside this function, the conditional logic is implemented using `tf.cond` or `tf.where`.  `tf.cond` evaluates a predicate (a boolean tensor) and executes one of two branches based on its value.  `tf.where` selects elements from two input tensors based on a boolean mask.  Both are crucial for creating differentiable conditional logic.  Crucially, any operations performed within these conditional blocks must also be differentiable to ensure proper gradient flow during backpropagation.

Furthermore, consider the potential impact on computational efficiency.  Inefficient conditional operations can dramatically slow down training, especially with large tensors.  Therefore, it is often beneficial to vectorize conditional logic as much as possible, avoiding explicit loops whenever feasible.  This usually involves utilizing TensorFlow's broadcasting and vectorized operations to perform the same conditional operation on multiple tensor elements simultaneously.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.cond` for threshold-based modification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  """Custom loss function with conditional tensor modification.

  Applies a different penalty based on the magnitude of the prediction error.
  """
  error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)

  def high_error_penalty():
    return tf.square(error) * 2.0  # Higher penalty for large errors

  def low_error_penalty():
    return tf.square(error)  # Standard penalty for small errors

  # Apply conditional penalty based on error magnitude
  penalty = tf.cond(tf.reduce_mean(error) > 0.5, high_error_penalty, low_error_penalty)

  return tf.reduce_mean(penalty)

# Example usage
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([1.2, 1.8, 4.0])
loss = custom_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)
```

This example demonstrates the use of `tf.cond` to apply a different penalty based on the average prediction error.  If the average error is above 0.5, a larger penalty is applied; otherwise, the standard squared error is used. The `high_error_penalty` and `low_error_penalty` functions ensure differentiability.


**Example 2: Utilizing `tf.where` for element-wise modification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_where(y_true, y_pred):
  """Custom loss with element-wise conditional modification using tf.where."""
  error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
  # Apply a modified penalty only to elements where the error exceeds a threshold
  modified_error = tf.where(error > 0.3, error * 1.5, error)  # Increased penalty for larger errors
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(modified_error))

# Example usage
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([1.2, 1.8, 4.0, 3.2])
loss = custom_loss_where(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)
```

Here, `tf.where` selectively applies a larger penalty (1.5 times the error) to elements where the absolute error exceeds 0.3.  This provides a more granular control over penalty application compared to the previous example.  The vectorized nature of `tf.where` ensures efficiency for large tensors.

**Example 3:  Handling NaN values with conditional logic:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_nan(y_true, y_pred):
  """Handles NaN values in predictions with tf.where."""
  error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
  # Replace NaN values with a default value (e.g., 0) before calculating the loss.
  processed_error = tf.where(tf.math.is_nan(error), tf.zeros_like(error), error)
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(processed_error))

# Example usage (introducing NaN values for demonstration)
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([1.2, tf.constant(float('nan')), 4.0])
loss = custom_loss_nan(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)
```

This example showcases how to handle potential `NaN` values within the predictions.  `tf.math.is_nan` identifies NaN values, and `tf.where` replaces them with zeros before the loss calculation.  This prevents errors and ensures the loss function remains numerically stable.  This is especially crucial in scenarios involving complex models where numerical instability can easily occur.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is an invaluable resource.  Thoroughly reviewing sections on custom training loops, automatic differentiation, and the detailed descriptions of `tf.cond` and `tf.where` is crucial.  Additionally, exploring advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on building and optimizing custom loss functions will significantly enhance understanding.  Finally, consulting research papers on differentiable programming and advanced loss functions can provide insights into best practices and potential pitfalls.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and calculus is also essential for effective manipulation and understanding of gradients within the custom loss function.
