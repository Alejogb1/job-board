The relationship between sequence length and LSTM performance is not straightforward; it's a complex interplay of computational cost, vanishing/exploding gradients, and the inherent nature of the task.  My experience working on natural language processing tasks, specifically machine translation and sentiment analysis, has highlighted the non-linearity of this relationship.  Simply increasing sequence length doesn't guarantee improved performance; in fact, it often leads to degradation unless appropriate mitigation strategies are employed.

**1.  Explanation:**

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that is updated at each time step.  This hidden state allows the network to retain information from previous steps, crucial for understanding long-range dependencies within the sequence. However, this very mechanism is the source of the challenges posed by varying sequence lengths.

The primary issue stems from the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm used to train LSTMs.  During BPTT, gradients are propagated backward through the unfolded computational graph, representing the entire sequence.  As sequence length increases, the gradient can suffer from either vanishing or exploding gradients.  Vanishing gradients occur when gradients become increasingly small during backpropagation, leading to slow or ineffective learning of long-range dependencies.  Conversely, exploding gradients result in excessively large gradients, potentially causing instability during training, often manifesting as NaN (Not a Number) values in the weight matrices.

Furthermore, longer sequences inherently demand more computational resources.  The memory and processing power required for both training and inference scale linearly with sequence length.  This becomes a significant bottleneck when dealing with very long sequences, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Finally, the optimal sequence length is also task-dependent.  For tasks with short-range dependencies, like predicting the next word in a sentence based on the immediately preceding few words, shorter sequences might suffice.  Conversely, tasks requiring long-range dependencies, such as machine translation, necessitate longer sequences to capture the complete context.  An inappropriately chosen sequence length, irrespective of its absolute value, will hinder performance, even if sufficient computational resources are available.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate how sequence length impacts LSTM performance using Python with TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples are simplified for clarity and illustrative purposes.  Real-world applications would require more sophisticated preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.

**Example 1:  Impact of Padding on Short Sequences:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sample data (short sequences)
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
labels = [0, 1, 0]

# Pad sequences to the maximum length
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post')

# LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(max_len, 1)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels, epochs=10)
```

This example highlights the necessity of padding shorter sequences to a uniform length before feeding them into the LSTM.  Incorrect padding or handling of variable-length sequences can lead to performance degradation.

**Example 2:  Performance with Increasing Sequence Lengths:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Generate synthetic data with varying sequence lengths
def generate_data(num_samples, max_length):
    data = []
    labels = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        length = np.random.randint(1, max_length + 1)
        seq = np.random.rand(length, 10)  # 10 features
        label = np.random.randint(0, 2)  # Binary classification
        data.append(seq)
        labels.append(label)
    return pad_sequences(data, maxlen=max_length, padding='post'), np.array(labels)

# Train models with different sequence lengths
max_lengths = [10, 50, 100]
for max_len in max_lengths:
    X, y = generate_data(1000, max_len)
    model = Sequential([
        LSTM(64, input_shape=(max_len, 10)),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, verbose=0)
    print(f"Max Length: {max_len}, Accuracy: {history.history['accuracy'][-1]}")
```

This example demonstrates how performance changes as the maximum sequence length increases.  Note that the accuracy might not monotonically improve; it often plateaus or even decreases beyond a certain length due to vanishing/exploding gradients.

**Example 3:  Truncation and Handling Extremely Long Sequences:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data with very long sequences
long_sequences = [list(range(1000)) for _ in range(100)] # simplified representation
labels = [0] * 50 + [1] * 50 # example binary labels

# Truncation
truncated_sequences = [seq[:200] for seq in long_sequences] # truncate to 200 timesteps

# LSTM model with truncation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(200, 1)), # input shape reflects truncated length
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(np.array(truncated_sequences).reshape(-1, 200, 1), np.array(labels), epochs=10)

```

This example illustrates a practical solution for managing excessively long sequences: truncation.  Instead of processing the entire sequence, only a relevant portion (e.g., the most recent part) is used.  This is particularly useful when dealing with streaming data or when computational constraints are stringent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville's "Deep Learning" textbook.
*   Hochreiter and Schmidhuber's original LSTM paper.
*   Several research papers on LSTM architectures and their applications to sequence modeling tasks.  Focus on works exploring gradient clipping and alternative recurrent neural network architectures designed to mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients.  Specific titles and authors can be found through relevant academic search engines.


In summary, effective management of sequence length in LSTM models necessitates careful consideration of computational constraints, the inherent properties of the task, and techniques to mitigate the impact of vanishing/exploding gradients.  Simply increasing sequence length is rarely the optimal solution; a balanced approach that considers these factors is crucial for achieving optimal performance.
