Highly imbalanced datasets present a significant challenge in machine learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class.  My experience working on fraud detection systems, where fraudulent transactions represent a tiny fraction of the total transactions, highlighted the critical need for robust data splitting techniques tailored to this specific problem.  Simply using a random split, as one might with a balanced dataset, is insufficient and will almost certainly result in a model trained on a dataset that is insufficiently representative of the minority class.  Effective strategies focus on preserving the class distribution in both training and testing sets, ensuring that the model is adequately exposed to both majority and minority instances.  This response will detail several approaches, focusing on their implementation using TensorFlow and Spark.


**1. Stratified Sampling:**

This is the most straightforward approach to handling imbalanced datasets. Stratified sampling ensures that the class proportions in the training and testing sets mirror the proportions in the original dataset.  In TensorFlow, this can be efficiently achieved using the `tf.data.Dataset` API's stratification capabilities.  Spark, on the other hand, provides the `RandomSplit` function with a weighting scheme capable of achieving similar results.

**Code Example 1: TensorFlow Stratified Splitting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a TensorFlow dataset with features and labels.
# 'labels' is a tensor of class labels.

# Calculate class weights based on class frequencies
label_counts = tf.math.bincount(labels)
class_weights = tf.divide(tf.reduce_sum(label_counts), label_counts)

# Stratify the dataset based on labels, preserving class distribution in train/test.
train_data, test_data = tf.data.Dataset.zip((data, labels)).apply(tf.data.experimental.group_by_window(
    key_func=lambda features, label: label,
    reduce_func=lambda key, ds: ds.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(batch_size),
    window_size=1
)).unbatch()

#Split based on desired proportions.
train_size = int(0.8 * tf.data.experimental.cardinality(train_data).numpy())
train_data = train_data.take(train_size)
test_data = train_data.skip(train_size)

#Now train_data and test_data are stratified

```

This code first calculates class weights to understand the imbalance. Then,  `tf.data.experimental.group_by_window` groups data points by their labels.  This grouping allows for individual shuffling and batching within each class, maintaining class proportions during the split. The split is performed on the shuffled data ensuring a representative split. Note the use of `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` which requires datasets of known size to work efficiently; for extremely large datasets that could cause issues.

**Code Example 2: Spark Stratified Splitting**

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("StratifiedSplit").getOrCreate()

// Assume 'data' is a Spark DataFrame with a column 'label' indicating class.

val Array(trainData, testData) = data.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 123) //Weights define ratio

// Verify class distribution in both trainData and testData (optional)

trainData.groupBy("label").count().show()
testData.groupBy("label").count().show()

spark.stop()
```

This Spark code leverages the `randomSplit` function, specifying the desired proportions (80/20 in this case) for training and testing.  The `seed` ensures reproducibility. Following the split, it is advisable to verify the class distribution in both datasets using `groupBy` and `count` to confirm the stratification worked as expected.  This provides a simple and efficient method for stratified sampling within the Spark environment.


**2. Oversampling and Undersampling:**

These techniques directly manipulate the class distribution to create a more balanced dataset. Oversampling duplicates instances from the minority class, while undersampling removes instances from the majority class. Both approaches have limitations. Oversampling can lead to overfitting, as the model might memorize the duplicated instances. Undersampling, on the other hand, might discard valuable information contained in the majority class.

**Code Example 3: Oversampling with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) in Python**

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assume 'X' is the feature matrix and 'y' is the label vector.

# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Now split the balanced dataset using a standard split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

```

This Python code uses the `imblearn` library's `SMOTE` to synthesize new minority class instances.  SMOTE creates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class instances, thereby increasing the minority class representation without simply duplicating existing data. It's crucial to note that this needs to occur *before* the train-test split to prevent data leakage, which would introduce bias in the evaluation metrics.  This methodology applies to both TensorFlow and Spark scenarios, as the data manipulation happens before feeding into the respective frameworks.  Undersampling techniques are similar, using tools like `RandomUnderSampler` from `imblearn` but are applied in an identical manner prior to the dataset split.



**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of imbalanced data handling, I recommend consulting books on machine learning focused on practical aspects of model building and evaluation.  A strong foundation in statistical sampling methods is beneficial for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the discussed techniques.  Additionally, reviewing documentation for the specific machine learning libraries used—TensorFlow, Spark, and scikit-learn in this case—is invaluable for staying up-to-date on best practices and available functionalities.  Finally, research papers on handling class imbalance in specific domains (e.g., fraud detection, medical diagnosis) can offer valuable insights relevant to the particular problem at hand.


**Conclusion:**

The choice of data splitting technique for highly imbalanced datasets depends on the specific context and the characteristics of the data. Stratified sampling provides a simple and effective baseline. Oversampling and undersampling methods can improve model performance by mitigating the effects of class imbalance, but they should be used carefully to avoid overfitting or information loss.  Careful consideration of the chosen method, and rigorous evaluation of the resulting model, are critical steps in building robust and accurate machine learning models from imbalanced datasets.  Remember always to validate your chosen approach by assessing the performance on unseen data, specifically focusing on metrics relevant to the minority class to ensure that your model adequately addresses the inherent challenge of imbalance.
