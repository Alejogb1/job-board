Data parallelism across multiple GPUs necessitates a deep understanding of GPU architecture and communication overhead.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations for computational fluid dynamics revealed a crucial insight: efficient data parallelism hinges not just on distributing the data, but meticulously managing the communication between GPUs.  Neglecting this aspect leads to significant performance bottlenecks, often outweighing the benefits of increased computational resources.

The core principle involves dividing the input dataset into independent chunks, each processed by a separate GPU.  The challenge lies in minimizing inter-GPU communication during intermediate steps and efficiently aggregating results.  This necessitates careful consideration of the algorithm's inherent structure and the communication capabilities of the chosen platform (e.g., NVLink, Infiniband).  I've observed significant performance variations based on these factors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Effective data parallelism across multiple GPUs requires a multi-faceted approach.  Firstly, the algorithm must be inherently parallelizable.  Secondly, data partitioning should be balanced to ensure even workload distribution.  Thirdly, a robust communication strategy is crucial, minimizing data transfer between devices.  Finally, appropriate synchronization mechanisms are necessary to guarantee data consistency.

Data partitioning strategies vary based on the algorithm. For instance, in a matrix multiplication, we can partition the matrices by rows or columns, distributing the sub-matrices across GPUs. Similarly, image processing tasks might partition the image into tiles, with each GPU handling a specific subset.  However, some algorithms, those with strong data dependencies, might not benefit from straightforward data parallelism and other techniques like model parallelism may be more suitable.

Communication latency significantly impacts performance.  The ideal scenario involves minimal data exchange between GPUs.  This often involves careful design of the algorithm to reduce the need for intermediate results to be shared.  Where inter-GPU communication is unavoidable, utilizing high-bandwidth interconnects and employing efficient communication primitives (e.g., CUDA's `cudaMemcpyPeer`) is paramount.  Ignoring this often results in significant performance degradation, which I've personally observed in early attempts at parallelizing my CFD simulations.

Synchronization is equally critical.  After individual GPUs complete their computations on their assigned data chunks, results must be aggregated.  This process necessitates synchronization to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions.  Choosing the appropriate synchronization mechanism (e.g., CUDA streams, events) depends on the application's specifics and the desired level of granularity.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate data parallelism using Python with CUDA.  For brevity, error handling and comprehensive input validation are omitted, but are crucial in production-ready code.  These examples focus on illustrating the core concepts.

**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

def parallel_matrix_multiply(A, B, num_gpus):
    # Assume A and B are NumPy arrays, and num_gpus is the number of GPUs available.

    # Partition matrices
    A_chunks = cp.array_split(cp.asarray(A), num_gpus, axis=0)
    B_chunks = cp.array_split(cp.asarray(B), num_gpus, axis=1)

    # Perform multiplication on each GPU
    results = []
    with cp.cuda.Device(i) as dev:
        A_chunk = cp.asarray(A_chunks[i], device=dev)
        B_chunk = cp.asarray(B_chunks[i], device=dev)
        results.append(cp.matmul(A_chunk, B_chunk))

    # Aggregate results. This step needs careful synchronization management in real-world applications.
    final_result = cp.concatenate(results, axis=0)
    return cp.asnumpy(final_result)

# Example usage:
A = np.random.rand(1024, 1024)
B = np.random.rand(1024, 1024)
num_gpus = 2  # Replace with the actual number of GPUs
result = parallel_matrix_multiply(A, B, num_gpus)
```

This example demonstrates a basic approach to distributing matrix multiplication across multiple GPUs.  The matrices are partitioned, and each GPU computes a portion of the result. The `cupy` library provides a NumPy-like interface for GPU computation.  The crucial aspects here are the partitioning strategy and the use of `cp.cuda.Device` to ensure each GPU is utilized efficiently. The concatenation step represents the result aggregation that necessitates efficient strategies in real-world scenarios.


**Example 2: Image Processing (Filtering)**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def parallel_image_filter(image_path, filter_kernel, num_gpus):
    # Load image and convert to NumPy array
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img_array = np.array(img)

    # Partition image into tiles
    height, width, channels = img_array.shape
    tile_height = height // num_gpus
    img_chunks = np.array_split(img_array, num_gpus, axis=0)


    results = []
    for i in range(num_gpus):
        with cp.cuda.Device(i) as dev:
            chunk = cp.asarray(img_chunks[i], device=dev)
            filtered_chunk = cp.convolve(chunk, filter_kernel, mode='same') #Note this assumes a suitable convolution implementation.
            results.append(filtered_chunk)

    final_result = cp.concatenate(results, axis=0)
    return cp.asnumpy(final_result)


#Example usage:
image_path = "input.png"
filter_kernel = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]) / 9 #Simple averaging filter.
num_gpus = 2
result = parallel_image_filter(image_path, filter_kernel, num_gpus)

#Convert back to image format if needed.
filtered_image = Image.fromarray(result.astype(np.uint8))
filtered_image.save("output.png")
```

This example highlights image processing, demonstrating tile-based partitioning.  Each GPU processes a tile of the image independently. The use of `cp.convolve` suggests a suitable convolution function; in a production setting,  optimized CUDA kernels would be used for better performance. The aggregation here is straightforward due to the nature of the image processing task, but more sophisticated approaches may be needed in different scenarios.

**Example 3:  Simple Reduction (Summation)**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

def parallel_sum(data, num_gpus):
    # Partition data
    data_chunks = cp.array_split(cp.asarray(data), num_gpus)

    # Compute partial sums on each GPU
    partial_sums = []
    for i in range(num_gpus):
        with cp.cuda.Device(i) as dev:
            chunk = cp.asarray(data_chunks[i], device=dev)
            partial_sums.append(cp.sum(chunk))

    # Aggregate partial sums on CPU (for simplicity; inter-GPU reduction is generally more efficient)
    total_sum = np.sum(cp.asnumpy(cp.asarray(partial_sums)))
    return total_sum

# Example Usage
data = np.random.rand(1000000)
num_gpus = 2
total = parallel_sum(data, num_gpus)
```

This example demonstrates a parallel reduction operation.  Each GPU computes the sum of its data chunk, and the results are then aggregated on the CPU.  In a highly optimized scenario, inter-GPU reduction using efficient algorithms and communication primitives would be implemented to minimize data transfer to the CPU.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend studying the CUDA programming model in detail, focusing on memory management, kernel optimization, and efficient inter-GPU communication techniques.  Familiarizing oneself with the specific hardware architecture of the target GPUs is essential for optimal performance.  Exploring advanced topics such as stream synchronization and asynchronous operations will significantly aid in constructing truly efficient data-parallel applications.  Finally, performance profiling tools, intrinsic to CUDA development environments, are vital for identifying bottlenecks and guiding optimization efforts.
