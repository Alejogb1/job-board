PyTorch's `autograd` engine, while highly flexible, exhibits nuanced behavior regarding operations that alter tensor dimensions, specifically concatenation using `torch.cat`.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for large-scale image processing has highlighted the importance of understanding this behavior to avoid unexpected gradients and computational inefficiencies.  Directly put, `torch.cat` itself doesn't inherently break automatic differentiation; however, the manner in which it's utilized within a computational graph significantly impacts gradient propagation.  The crucial aspect is the differentiability of the inputs *to* the `torch.cat` operation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`torch.cat` is a differentiable operation, meaning its gradient can be computed. However, this differentiability is contingent upon the differentiability of the tensors being concatenated.  If the input tensors are the result of non-differentiable operations (e.g., indexing with non-contiguous memory using advanced indexing, certain custom operations lacking gradient definitions), the gradient flowing *through* the `torch.cat` operation will be problematic.  The gradient will still exist for `torch.cat` itself – it's simply a matter of summing gradients along the concatenation axis – but the upstream gradients will be effectively halted or might contain unexpected values due to the prior non-differentiable operation.

Consider a scenario where tensors are created from a non-differentiable operation like `numpy.asarray`, then converted to PyTorch tensors before concatenation.  While `torch.cat` remains differentiable, the gradients will not propagate correctly back through the `numpy` operations, leading to issues during backpropagation.

Furthermore, the efficiency of gradient computation following `torch.cat` is directly linked to the contiguousness of the input tensors' memory.  If the input tensors are non-contiguous, PyTorch may need to perform memory copying operations, slowing down the gradient computation significantly, an issue I encountered while processing high-resolution medical scans.  Contiguous tensors ensure optimal performance in both forward and backward passes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Gradient Propagation**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)

z = torch.cat((x, y), dim=1)  # Concatenate along dimension 1
loss = z.mean()
loss.backward()

print(x.grad)
print(y.grad)
```

This example demonstrates correct gradient flow. Both `x` and `y` receive gradients because they are directly created with `requires_grad=True`, meaning their history is tracked.  The `torch.cat` operation seamlessly integrates with the autograd system, propagating gradients through the concatenation. The gradient will be split correctly based on the dim argument.

**Example 2: Non-Differentiable Input Leading to Gradient Issues**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

x_np = np.random.randn(2, 3)
y_np = np.random.randn(2, 3)

x = torch.from_numpy(x_np).requires_grad_(True)
y = torch.from_numpy(y_np).requires_grad_(True)

z = torch.cat((x, y), dim=1)
loss = z.mean()
loss.backward()

print(x.grad) # Might contain unexpected values or be None
print(y.grad) # Might contain unexpected values or be None
```

Here, `numpy` arrays are converted to PyTorch tensors.  While `requires_grad_(True)` is set, the initial creation using `numpy` isn't differentiable within the PyTorch autograd context. The gradients `x.grad` and `y.grad` might be `None` or hold unexpected values, signifying a broken gradient path.  This is a common error I've seen in projects where data preprocessing happens outside the PyTorch ecosystem.

**Example 3:  Non-Contiguous Tensors and Performance Degradation**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)

# Introduce non-contiguity (this is an illustrative way; other operations could cause this)
x = x[:, ::2]
x = torch.cat((x, x[:,1:]), dim=1) # Reconstruct a 2,3 shape to maintain structure.

z = torch.cat((x, y), dim=1)
loss = z.mean()
loss.backward()

print(x.grad)
print(y.grad)
print(x.is_contiguous()) # Will return False.
```

In this example, the slicing operation (`x[:, ::2]`) creates a non-contiguous tensor.  Although the gradient will likely propagate, the computation will be slower due to memory management operations performed by PyTorch to ensure correct gradient calculations. Always ensure that your tensors are contiguous for optimal performance in large-scale applications to avoid unforeseen slowdowns. I've personally observed significant performance drops in my image processing pipeline when this was overlooked.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on `autograd` and tensor manipulation is invaluable.  Thorough understanding of memory management and tensor operations within PyTorch is crucial.  Books focused on advanced deep learning concepts and the intricacies of computational graphs will significantly improve your ability to debug such issues.  Finally, review materials concerning vectorization and optimization strategies within PyTorch can highlight efficient alternatives to potentially problematic operations.
