Defining custom loss functions in TensorFlow 2.0 requires a deep understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and automatic differentiation capabilities.  Crucially, the flexibility offered by TensorFlow's `tf.function` decorator and eager execution mode allows for highly nuanced and efficient implementations. My experience implementing complex loss functions for large-scale image recognition models has highlighted the importance of leveraging these features for both performance and maintainability.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.keras.losses` module provides a suite of pre-built loss functions.  However, the inherent variability in machine learning problem formulations often necessitates bespoke loss functions tailored to specific application needs.  To define a custom loss, one must create a Python function that takes two arguments: `y_true` (the ground truth labels) and `y_pred` (the model's predictions). This function should compute a scalar representing the loss.  The crucial aspect is that this computation must be differentiable with respect to the model's parameters, enabling backpropagation and model training.  This differentiability is ensured by using TensorFlow operations within the function.  Standard Python operations will often fail to propagate gradients.

Furthermore, the function should operate on tensors, utilizing TensorFlow's vectorized operations for efficiency.  Looping constructs should generally be avoided in favor of vectorized alternatives where possible, given the inherent overhead associated with iterative processing in TensorFlow. For complex losses involving conditional logic or multiple loss components, careful consideration should be given to efficient tensor manipulation to prevent performance bottlenecks.  Finally, any custom loss function should be tested thoroughly, comparing its output against expected values for a range of inputs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

MAPE is a useful metric when working with time series forecasting or other scenarios where the magnitude of errors is important relative to the target value.  However, it has a limitation: it's undefined when the ground truth is zero.  A robust implementation addresses this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def mape(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

  Args:
    y_true: Ground truth values.
    y_pred: Predicted values.

  Returns:
    MAPE value.  Returns a large value if y_true is zero to avoid division by zero.
  """
  y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32)  # Ensure data types are consistent
  y_pred = tf.cast(y_pred, tf.float32)
  epsilon = 1e-7 #Small value to avoid division by zero
  absolute_percentage_error = tf.abs((y_true - y_pred) / tf.maximum(epsilon, tf.abs(y_true)))
  return tf.reduce_mean(absolute_percentage_error)

#Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([10.0, 20.0, 0.0, 30.0], dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred = tf.constant([12.0, 18.0, 1.0, 33.0], dtype=tf.float32)
loss = mape(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"MAPE: {loss}")

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=mape) #Integration within a Keras model
```

This example showcases proper type handling and robust error handling.  The `tf.maximum` function elegantly prevents division by zero errors.


**Example 2:  Huber Loss with Adjustable Delta**

The Huber loss is a robust alternative to the mean squared error (MSE) that is less sensitive to outliers.  The following example allows for dynamic adjustment of the delta parameter:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0):
  """Calculates the Huber loss.

  Args:
    y_true: Ground truth values.
    y_pred: Predicted values.
    delta: Parameter controlling the transition point between L1 and L2 loss.

  Returns:
    Huber loss value.
  """
  error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
  quadratic_part = tf.minimum(error, delta)
  linear_part = error - quadratic_part
  loss = 0.5 * quadratic_part**2 + delta * linear_part
  return tf.reduce_mean(loss)

#Example usage
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 100.0]) #Includes an outlier
y_pred = tf.constant([1.1, 1.9, 3.2, 90.0])
loss_delta1 = huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0)
loss_delta5 = huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=5.0)
print(f"Huber Loss (delta=1.0): {loss_delta1}")
print(f"Huber Loss (delta=5.0): {loss_delta5}")
```

This illustrates the use of conditional logic within the TensorFlow framework, demonstrating how to control the behaviour of the loss function using additional parameters.

**Example 3:  Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy**

In imbalanced classification problems, weighting the contribution of each class to the overall loss is crucial.  This example demonstrates a weighted binary cross-entropy loss:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, class_weights):
  """Calculates weighted binary cross-entropy.

  Args:
      y_true: Ground truth labels (0 or 1).
      y_pred: Predicted probabilities.
      class_weights: A list or tensor containing weights for each class (0 and 1).

  Returns:
      Weighted binary cross-entropy loss.
  """

  weights = tf.gather(class_weights, tf.cast(y_true, tf.int32)) # Efficient class weight assignment
  bce = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
  weighted_bce = bce * weights
  return tf.reduce_mean(weighted_bce)

#Example Usage
y_true = tf.constant([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])
y_pred = tf.constant([0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7, 0.3])
class_weights = tf.constant([0.2, 0.8]) #Class 0 weight = 0.2, Class 1 weight = 0.8
loss = weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, class_weights)
print(f"Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy: {loss}")
```

This example uses a `tf.gather` operation for efficient weight assignment, avoiding explicit looping for improved performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on practical aspects of model building.  Research papers on loss functions relevant to your specific application domain.  Thorough testing and validation strategies for custom loss functions are also critical for reliability. Remember to consult the documentation for the latest best practices and API changes within TensorFlow.
