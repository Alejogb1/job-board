The issue of `GradientTape` returning `None` for gradients of a trainable variable when it depends on a variable from another model stems from a critical misunderstanding regarding the scope of gradient tracking within TensorFlow's automatic differentiation mechanism.  My experience debugging similar scenarios in large-scale neural network architectures, specifically those involving multi-model training and transfer learning, highlighted the importance of explicitly defining the variables for which gradients are computed.  `GradientTape` does not magically infer dependencies across model boundaries; it strictly operates within the scope of the variables it is explicitly told to watch.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.GradientTape`'s `watch` method is paramount.  It dictates which TensorFlow `Variable` objects will be tracked for gradient computations. When you construct a computation graph involving variables from multiple models, simply declaring the `GradientTape` context is insufficient.  If the variable you expect to receive a gradient for (let's call it `target_variable`) is part of model A, and its value is influenced by a variable from model B (let's call it `source_variable`),  `GradientTape` will only compute gradients for `target_variable` if *both* `target_variable` and `source_variable` (or any `Variable` within model B directly affecting `target_variable`) are explicitly watched.  Failure to do so results in `None` being returned for the gradient of `target_variable`.  The tape does not traverse the dependency graph across model boundaries unless it's explicitly instructed to do so.  This is not a bug; it's a deliberate design choice to improve performance and manage memory efficiently.  The tape only tracks gradients for variables it has been explicitly told to observe.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Tracking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model_a = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model_b = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)])

#Incorrect: only watching model_a's variable
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = model_a(model_b(x))
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(y**2)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model_a.trainable_variables)
print(grads) # Potentially None or incorrect gradients if model_b's variables influence gradients of model_a's variables

```

This example demonstrates the common pitfall.  Only `model_a.trainable_variables` are watched.  Even though the output of `model_a` depends on `model_b`,  the tape does not inherently know to track the gradients flowing from `model_b` through `model_a`. This often results in `None` or inaccurate gradients.


**Example 2: Correct Gradient Tracking (Persistent Tape)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model_a = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model_b = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)])

#Correct: using persistent=True and explicitly watching relevant variables
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])
with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
  tape.watch(model_a.trainable_variables)
  tape.watch(model_b.trainable_variables)
  y = model_a(model_b(x))
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(y**2)

grads_a = tape.gradient(loss, model_a.trainable_variables)
grads_b = tape.gradient(loss, model_b.trainable_variables)
print(grads_a)  # Should return gradients
print(grads_b) # Should return gradients
del tape

```

This corrected example utilizes a `persistent=True` tape. This allows for multiple gradient computations from a single tape recording. Crucially, it explicitly watches all trainable variables in *both* models.  This ensures that the gradient flow across the models is accurately captured. Remember to delete the tape afterwards to free memory.


**Example 3: Correct Gradient Tracking (Non-Persistent Tape, Separate Computations)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model_a = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.Layers.Dense(10)])
model_b = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.Layers.Dense(5)])

#Correct: separate tapes, efficient for independent gradient updates
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape_a:
    tape_a.watch(model_a.trainable_variables)
    y = model_a(model_b(x))
    loss_a = tf.reduce_mean(y**2)
grads_a = tape_a.gradient(loss_a, model_a.trainable_variables)


with tf.GradientTape() as tape_b:
    tape_b.watch(model_b.trainable_variables)
    y = model_a(model_b(x))
    loss_b = tf.reduce_mean(y**2)
grads_b = tape_b.gradient(loss_b, model_b.trainable_variables)


print(grads_a) # Should return gradients for model_a
print(grads_b) # Should return gradients for model_b
```

This approach demonstrates a more efficient strategy when the gradients are not interdependent. Separate tapes are used for each model, avoiding the overhead of a persistent tape and simplifying the gradient computation process.  This approach is particularly advantageous for complex architectures with numerous independent sub-models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation should be your primary resource.  Furthermore,  thorough exploration of the TensorFlow API documentation on `tf.keras.Model` and its training methods will prove invaluable in understanding model construction and gradient calculation within the Keras framework.  Consulting relevant chapters in established deep learning textbooks focusing on automatic differentiation and backpropagation will solidify your theoretical understanding of the underlying principles.  Finally, carefully reviewing example code provided in TensorFlow tutorials and community contributions focusing on multi-model training and transfer learning will aid in practical application and debugging.
