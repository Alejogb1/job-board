The core issue stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how asynchronous operations, specifically those employing the `Task` construct, interact with shared mutable state.  My experience debugging similar problems across several large-scale data processing applications has highlighted the critical role of proper synchronization mechanisms in preventing race conditions when multiple tasks concurrently modify collections.  The problem isn't inherent to `Task` itself, but rather a consequence of neglecting thread safety.

**1. Explanation:**

When multiple tasks operate concurrently on the same collection, data corruption can easily occur.  Each task runs independently, potentially accessing and modifying the collection simultaneously. Without proper synchronization, unpredictable behavior arises because the order of operations between tasks is non-deterministic.  Imagine two tasks, Task A and Task B, both attempting to add items to a `List<T>`. Task A adds an item at index 0, and concurrently, Task B adds an item at index 1.  If the underlying list implementation isn't thread-safe, the second addition could overwrite the first, leading to data loss.  This is a classic race condition.  This isn't limited to `List<T>`; other non-thread-safe collection types, such as `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, are susceptible to the same issues.

Furthermore, the timing of task completion is unpredictable.  If the main thread attempts to access the collection before all tasks have finished populating it, it might encounter an incomplete or inconsistent state.  This can manifest as an empty or partially populated collection, explaining the observed failure in the original problem statement.

Therefore, to guarantee correct population, thread safety must be enforced.  This is achieved through various synchronization primitives, the most common being locks (mutexes), semaphores, or thread-safe collections.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect – Race Condition**

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class IncorrectPopulation
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>(); // Not thread-safe

        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(() =>
            {
                numbers.Add(i * 10); // Race condition here!
            }));
        }

        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Number of elements: {numbers.Count}"); // Count might be less than 10
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers)); // Order might be unexpected
    }
}
```

In this example, multiple tasks concurrently access and modify `numbers`, a non-thread-safe list.  This introduces a race condition; the final state of `numbers` is unpredictable, likely resulting in a count less than 10 and an unexpected order of elements.


**Example 2: Correct – Using a Lock**

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class CorrectPopulationWithLock
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
        object lockObject = new object(); // Lock object

        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(() =>
            {
                lock (lockObject) // Critical section protected by lock
                {
                    numbers.Add(i * 10);
                }
            }));
        }

        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Number of elements: {numbers.Count}"); // Count will be 10
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers)); // Order might still vary slightly
    }
}
```

This improved version uses a `lock` statement to synchronize access to the `numbers` list.  The `lock` ensures that only one task can execute the `numbers.Add` operation at a time, preventing race conditions.  The order of elements might still vary slightly due to the non-deterministic nature of task scheduling, but the count will always be 10, ensuring data integrity.


**Example 3: Correct – Using a Thread-Safe Collection**

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class CorrectPopulationWithConcurrentCollection
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        ConcurrentBag<int> numbers = new ConcurrentBag<int>(); // Thread-safe collection

        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(() =>
            {
                numbers.Add(i * 10); // No need for explicit locking
            }));
        }

        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Number of elements: {numbers.Count}"); // Count will be 10
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers)); // Order might be unexpected
    }
}
```

This example leverages a `ConcurrentBag<T>`, a thread-safe collection designed for concurrent access.  Using a thread-safe collection eliminates the need for explicit locking, simplifying the code and improving performance, as the internal synchronization mechanisms are handled by the collection itself. The order of elements remains non-deterministic, but data integrity is guaranteed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of concurrent programming concepts and thread safety, I recommend consulting the following:

*   A comprehensive textbook on multithreaded programming.
*   The official documentation for your chosen programming language's concurrency features.
*   Articles and tutorials on specific synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, and monitors.
*   Advanced texts on concurrent data structures and algorithms.  Understanding how these structures work internally is crucial to selecting the appropriate data structure for your specific concurrency needs.


By understanding the dangers of concurrent access to shared mutable state and employing appropriate synchronization techniques, you can avoid the pitfalls of incomplete collection population when using tasks in your applications. Remember, selecting the right approach—locking or using thread-safe collections—depends on the specific performance characteristics and complexity of your application.  For simple cases, a lock might suffice; for more complex scenarios, utilizing thread-safe collections often offers a cleaner and more efficient solution.
