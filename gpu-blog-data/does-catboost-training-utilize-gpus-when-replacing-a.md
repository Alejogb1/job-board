CatBoost, when trained with the objective of replacing a linear layer's output using a separate model's predictions as features, leverages GPU acceleration provided that the relevant training parameters are correctly configured and the environment possesses compatible GPU hardware. This functionality arises from CatBoost's underlying architecture and its implementation of gradient boosting on decision trees, coupled with the ability to process custom loss functions and feature transformations.

The process of replacing a linear layer involves not directly manipulating a neural network's architecture, but rather reframing the problem. Instead of directly optimizing the weights of the linear layer, we consider the output of that layer to be a target variable to be predicted by CatBoost. The predictions of another, independently trained model become the input features used by CatBoost for this prediction task. This approach effectively learns a non-linear mapping between the external model's predictions and what would be produced by the linear layer in the original, larger model. CatBoost can then be used to approximate this complex function.

Crucially, CatBoost's ability to utilize GPUs is largely independent of the specific nature of the feature space; whether those features come from raw data, handcrafted features, or outputs from a separate model, the core gradient boosting computations remain the same. Consequently, enabling GPU training in CatBoost for this replacement scenario depends on configuring the training hyperparameters to utilize available GPU resources. CatBoost does not natively understand the source of the input features as belonging to a specific model, it simply sees a matrix of numerical feature values.

The primary performance gains from using GPUs come from the parallelization of gradient computations and decision tree construction. CatBoost’s internal algorithms are optimized to take advantage of the massively parallel processing capabilities of GPUs, resulting in substantially faster training, especially on larger datasets and with complex tree ensembles. If no GPU is specified or is unavailable, the calculations fall back to CPU processing, which is substantially slower.

To demonstrate, consider three different usage scenarios. Let’s assume you have a pre-trained model, denoted as `external_model`, which you will feed the input data `X_train` through, generating features. The output of this model on `X_train` is called `external_features`, which is used by Catboost in place of the linear layer output and is compared to `y_train` which is the linear layer output data.

**Example 1: Basic GPU Usage with Default Parameters**

This example showcases the minimal setup required to train CatBoost on the output of an external model using a GPU. In this case, the defaults are used in relation to the Catboost model.

```python
import catboost as cb
import numpy as np

# Assume external_model and X_train are defined, producing external_features
external_features = external_model.predict(X_train)
# Assume y_train holds the linear layer’s output target data

train_pool = cb.Pool(external_features, y_train)

model = cb.CatBoostRegressor(iterations=100,
                            task_type="GPU", # Specifies GPU utilization
                            devices='0:1', #Explicitly specifies which GPU to use
                            verbose=False) #Silences training output

model.fit(train_pool)

```

In this instance, `task_type="GPU"` directs CatBoost to initiate training on available GPU hardware. Note that the line `devices='0:1'` explicitly specifies the GPU(s) to use. Omitting this will direct CatBoost to use all GPUs. The `verbose=False` is used to suppress the training iteration output, which can be useful when working in a pipeline to avoid clutter.  It is important to install the correct version of the `catboost` library; a standard install of `catboost` via pip might not include the GPU-accelerated version. The installation documentation must be consulted for proper GPU support.

**Example 2: Customized Training Parameters with GPU**

This example illustrates the adjustment of specific training hyperparameters while retaining GPU utilization.

```python
import catboost as cb
import numpy as np

# Assume external_model and X_train are defined, producing external_features
external_features = external_model.predict(X_train)
# Assume y_train holds the linear layer’s output target data

train_pool = cb.Pool(external_features, y_train)

model = cb.CatBoostRegressor(iterations=200,
                             learning_rate=0.05,
                             depth=6,
                             l2_leaf_reg=3,
                             task_type="GPU",
                             loss_function='RMSE',
                             devices='0', #Explicitly specifies which GPU to use
                             random_seed=42,
                             verbose=False)

model.fit(train_pool)
```

Here, we have set parameters such as `learning_rate`, `depth`, `l2_leaf_reg`, and `loss_function` to tailor the training behavior. Setting a random seed via `random_seed` ensures reproducibility when needed. The task type is again set to "GPU," ensuring that GPU hardware is used for the computation, and it specifies the GPU device explicitly. The choice of these hyperparameters influences the trade-off between training time, generalization performance and preventing overfitting. Through empirical tuning and experiments, it would be possible to identify the most optimized hyperparameters.

**Example 3: Using a Validation Set with GPU**

This final example shows how to use a validation set with the GPU enabled.
```python
import catboost as cb
import numpy as np

# Assume external_model and X_train are defined, producing external_features
external_features = external_model.predict(X_train)
external_features_val = external_model.predict(X_val)

# Assume y_train and y_val hold the linear layer’s output target data

train_pool = cb.Pool(external_features, y_train)
val_pool = cb.Pool(external_features_val, y_val)

model = cb.CatBoostRegressor(iterations=200,
                             learning_rate=0.05,
                             depth=6,
                             l2_leaf_reg=3,
                             task_type="GPU",
                             loss_function='RMSE',
                             devices='0', #Explicitly specifies which GPU to use
                             random_seed=42,
                             verbose=False)

model.fit(train_pool, eval_set=val_pool)
```
This instance explicitly uses the CatBoost `Pool` object and the `eval_set` parameter. This allows you to monitor how well your training is generalizing by providing validation metrics.  It can be used during training to monitor progress and adjust early stopping or other training parameters. It follows similar logic to the previous examples but is useful in a more realistic training scenario. The validation set should come from the same distribution as the training data and allows one to avoid overfitting. It also showcases that CatBoost expects two `Pool` objects to be used, not simply the underlying NumPy arrays themselves.

In summary, CatBoost training, when used to replace a linear layer's output with another model's predictions, benefits directly from GPU acceleration when correctly configured. The underlying mechanism of gradient boosting remains unchanged, making GPU utilization applicable to various feature sources, including those derived from external models.  Correct setup of the task type parameter along with any explicit GPU device specifications are vital in enabling the acceleration. These three examples illustrate the basic application and various tuning parameters which can be deployed when using CatBoost for this purpose.

For those seeking further information on CatBoost capabilities, I recommend consulting the official CatBoost documentation and reviewing practical tutorials available through online machine learning communities. Exploration of specific parameter options, custom loss function capabilities and hardware performance considerations will provide valuable insight in making optimal use of the software. Further, benchmarking against other boosting algorithms like XGBoost with a similar parameterization is useful to understand performance in specific applications.
