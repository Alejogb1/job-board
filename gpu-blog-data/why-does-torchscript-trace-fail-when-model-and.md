The core issue with TorchScript tracing failing when both model and input tensors are on the same device stems from the fundamental way tracing operates within PyTorch's JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation framework. Tracing doesn't execute the model; instead, it observes the operations performed on the input tensors to build a static representation of the computational graph. This graph then undergoes optimization and is eventually compiled for faster execution. When a model's operations are device-dependent (e.g., specific CUDA operations) and the tracing input is on the same device, the tracer *captures* device-specific operations *as-is*, embedding them directly into the graph. This isn't a problem if the compiled module is *always* expected to run on that specific device, but it creates a rigid graph that lacks portability across devices.

I've encountered this problem multiple times during my work in deploying custom models for edge devices. Initially, I assumed that since the operations were valid on the device, the tracing process would be agnostic to the device itself. This was demonstrably not the case. The key misunderstanding lies in the difference between executing the model dynamically with PyTorch tensors and generating a static, compiled representation using TorchScript tracing. The former handles device specifics at runtime, while the latter hardcodes them during the tracing stage. If the tracing is performed on the GPU and the graph includes operations using `torch.cuda.FloatTensor` or equivalent, then the compiled module is only useful for running on that type of CUDA device, and fails if any input is given on another device or CPU.

The fundamental problem lies in the tracer’s literal interpretation of the operations. When a model is dynamically executed in PyTorch, operations like tensor addition or multiplication are dispatched to the appropriate backend (CPU, CUDA) based on the tensor's device at runtime. When tracing, however, the tracer sees these operations as concrete instructions tied to a specific device. These specific operations become nodes in the trace. This means that if `model(input)` is traced when both are on a CUDA device, the generated TorchScript graph might contain CUDA-specific operations instead of device-agnostic representations. This contrasts with how PyTorch ordinarily dispatches based on dynamic type checks on Tensor objects.

Here's a code example illustrating the problem:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Example 1: Tracing on CPU
model_cpu = SimpleModel()
input_cpu = torch.randn(1, 10)
traced_model_cpu = torch.jit.trace(model_cpu, input_cpu)

# Example 2: Tracing on GPU (if available)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    model_gpu = SimpleModel().to(device)
    input_gpu = torch.randn(1, 10).to(device)
    traced_model_gpu = torch.jit.trace(model_gpu, input_gpu)
    #Try to run the GPU traced model on the CPU. Will fail.
    input_cpu_again = torch.randn(1,10)
    try:
       output_cpu = traced_model_gpu(input_cpu_again)
    except RuntimeError as e:
       print("Error when running GPU traced model on the CPU: ",e)

    #Try running it on the GPU. Will work.
    try:
        output_gpu = traced_model_gpu(input_gpu)
        print("Successfully ran GPU traced model on the GPU")
    except RuntimeError as e:
       print("Error when running GPU traced model on the GPU: ",e)


```

In this example, tracing `model_cpu` with `input_cpu` on the CPU generates a TorchScript module that operates correctly on CPU tensors. However, when tracing `model_gpu` on the GPU using `input_gpu`, the resulting `traced_model_gpu` module can only be executed on CUDA devices and fails if given a CPU input. This is because specific CUDA calls were captured in the trace. Notice also the addition of the try/except blocks demonstrating that the model works on its original device, but fails on another device. The error produced is a `RuntimeError` stemming from attempting to execute a device-specific operation on the wrong device.

The core issue isn't that the model itself is incapable of running on different devices. The problem arises from tracing a specific runtime behavior. The tracer has embedded the operations it witnessed, instead of making the graph flexible to dispatch dynamically on the basis of device type.

Here’s a different example that highlights a more complex scenario:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class ComplexModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 7 * 7, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv(x))
        x = self.pool(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Example 3: Tracing a CNN on GPU
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    model_gpu_cnn = ComplexModel().to(device)
    input_gpu_cnn = torch.randn(1, 3, 14, 14).to(device)
    traced_model_gpu_cnn = torch.jit.trace(model_gpu_cnn, input_gpu_cnn)

    #Try to run this model on a CPU. Will fail.
    input_cpu_cnn = torch.randn(1, 3, 14, 14)
    try:
      output_cpu_cnn = traced_model_gpu_cnn(input_cpu_cnn)
    except RuntimeError as e:
       print("Error when running GPU traced CNN model on the CPU: ", e)
    #Try to run this model on a GPU. Will work.
    try:
        output_gpu_cnn = traced_model_gpu_cnn(input_gpu_cnn)
        print("Successfully ran GPU traced CNN model on the GPU")
    except RuntimeError as e:
       print("Error when running GPU traced CNN model on the GPU: ", e)
```

In this case, the problem is not limited to simple linear layers. Convolutional layers (`nn.Conv2d`), pooling layers (`nn.MaxPool2d`), and view operations can all become device-specific if traced while running on a specific device like the GPU. The resulting traced model is tied to the GPU and throws an error when used with CPU inputs, because the compiled graph contains specific instructions which are not available on the CPU.

The solution isn't to simply avoid tracing on the GPU, as device-specific optimizations (especially with CUDA) can provide substantial performance boosts. However, it’s critical to understand *when* this approach is suitable. For applications needing portable models that run on either CPU or GPU, a more robust alternative is to use a scripting approach via `torch.jit.script` or to perform the tracing operations and export the model using a CPU input and model. The scripting approach is usually better at inferring the data types, and can be used in a much more flexible way than tracing.

One critical lesson I've learned through experience is that, to create deployable TorchScript modules for different devices, I should generally avoid tracing on a device which is different from the end-user environment. Instead I opt for scripted models, or tracing on the CPU even if the intended target environment is the GPU.  Then I can use `to(device)` during model execution rather than having the tracing process embed device specific information into the graph.

Resource recommendations for further study include the PyTorch documentation on TorchScript, paying close attention to the sections on tracing versus scripting, the JIT compiler, and the use of custom operators. Also, investigate articles that present solutions for cross-platform model deployment, focusing on the challenges and solutions that involve different hardware types. Another resource can be any book dedicated to advanced topics in PyTorch, specifically the sections dealing with JIT and deployment. Finally, study examples of models deployed across multiple devices, and understand why they might have chosen one implementation approach over another.
