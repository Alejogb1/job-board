Generating multiple captions for a single image using a Keras/TensorFlow image captioning model requires careful consideration of the model architecture and the decoding strategy.  My experience building and deploying similar systems in production environments has highlighted the limitations of simply feeding the image through the model once and expecting diverse outputs.  The inherent stochasticity of the process, coupled with the deterministic nature of many standard sequence-to-sequence models, often results in repetitive captions.  To overcome this, I developed several techniques leveraging beam search and diverse sampling methods, each with its own trade-offs.

The core issue lies in the decoding phase.  Standard greedy decoding, where the model selects the word with the highest probability at each step, tends to produce the same or very similar captions repeatedly.  This is because the model, once it starts down a particular path, is unlikely to deviate, even if slightly less probable alternatives might lead to more diverse outputs.  To address this, we need strategies that explore the probability landscape more thoroughly.

**1. Beam Search:** This algorithm is a significant improvement over greedy decoding. Instead of selecting only the single most probable word at each step, beam search maintains a fixed number (the beam width) of the most likely partial captions.  At each step, it expands these partial captions by considering the next most probable words, keeping only the top *k* most probable sequences.  This allows the model to explore multiple potential caption paths simultaneously, increasing the chance of generating diverse captions.  A higher beam width leads to greater diversity but also increased computational cost.


**Code Example 1: Beam Search Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

def beam_search_decode(model, image_features, beam_width=3, max_length=30):
    """Decodes image features using beam search.

    Args:
        model: The trained Keras image captioning model.
        image_features: Feature vector of the input image.
        beam_width: The width of the beam search.
        max_length: Maximum length of the generated caption.

    Returns:
        A list of generated captions.
    """
    start_token = model.start_token  # Assuming your model has a start token attribute.
    end_token = model.end_token    # Assuming your model has an end token attribute.

    sequences = [[start_token]]
    scores = [0.0]

    for _ in range(max_length):
        all_sequences = []
        all_scores = []
        for seq, score in zip(sequences, scores):
            partial_caption = tf.expand_dims(tf.constant(seq), axis=0)
            predictions = model(image_features, partial_caption) # Output should be probability distribution
            probs = tf.squeeze(predictions, axis=0)

            # Top k predictions
            top_k_indices = tf.math.top_k(probs, k=beam_width).indices
            top_k_probs = tf.math.top_k(probs, k=beam_width).values

            for i, idx in enumerate(top_k_indices):
                new_seq = seq + [idx.numpy()]
                new_score = score + tf.math.log(top_k_probs[i]).numpy() # Log-probabilities for numerical stability
                all_sequences.append(new_seq)
                all_scores.append(new_score)

        # Sort by score and keep top k
        sorted_indices = tf.argsort(all_scores, direction='DESCENDING')
        sequences = [all_sequences[i] for i in sorted_indices[:beam_width]]
        scores = [all_scores[i] for i in sorted_indices[:beam_width]]

        # Check for end token
        finished_sequences = [seq for seq in sequences if end_token in seq]
        if len(finished_sequences) == beam_width:
            break


    return [model.vocab.index_to_word(seq) for seq in sequences] # Assuming model has vocabulary mapping

```

This code snippet demonstrates a beam search decoder. It assumes your model outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each timestep.  Critical to its success is the appropriate handling of log-probabilities to avoid numerical underflow.  Remember to adapt `start_token` and `end_token` based on your specific vocabulary.

**2. Diverse Sampling:** This technique directly addresses the problem of repetitive captions by intentionally sampling from the probability distribution using methods that favor less probable words.  One effective method is nucleus sampling, where words are sampled from the subset of the vocabulary that cumulatively accounts for a certain probability mass (nucleus). This introduces more randomness into the caption generation process.


**Code Example 2: Nucleus Sampling**

```python
import numpy as np

def nucleus_sampling(probs, p=0.9):
    """Performs nucleus sampling from a probability distribution.

    Args:
        probs: Probability distribution over the vocabulary.
        p: The nucleus probability mass.

    Returns:
        The index of the sampled word.
    """
    probs_sorted = np.sort(probs)[::-1]
    cumulative_probs = np.cumsum(probs_sorted)
    k = np.argmax(cumulative_probs >= p)
    mask = np.zeros_like(probs)
    mask[np.argsort(probs)[::-1][:k+1]] = 1
    probs_masked = probs * mask
    probs_masked /= np.sum(probs_masked)
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs_masked)


def generate_caption_nucleus(model, image_features, p=0.9, max_length=30):
    # ... (Similar setup as beam search, but uses nucleus_sampling instead of top_k) ...
    caption = []
    word_index = model.start_token
    for _ in range(max_length):
        partial_caption = tf.expand_dims(tf.constant([word_index]), axis=0) #Input as sequence
        predictions = model(image_features, partial_caption)
        probs = tf.squeeze(predictions, axis=0).numpy()
        word_index = nucleus_sampling(probs, p=p)
        caption.append(word_index)
        if word_index == model.end_token:
            break
    return model.vocab.index_to_word(caption)
```

This example implements nucleus sampling. The parameter `p` controls the diversity; lower values lead to more diverse, potentially less coherent captions. This should be integrated into the decoding loop.


**3. Top-k sampling with temperature:** A simpler approach involves sampling from the top *k* most probable words, but applying a temperature parameter to the probabilities before sampling.  A higher temperature increases the randomness of the sampling process, leading to more diverse captions, while a lower temperature makes the sampling more deterministic.


**Code Example 3: Top-k Sampling with Temperature**

```python
def top_k_sampling_with_temperature(probs, k=5, temperature=1.0):
    probs = np.exp(np.log(probs) / temperature) #Apply temperature
    probs_sorted = np.sort(probs)[::-1]
    cumulative_probs = np.cumsum(probs_sorted)
    k = min(k, len(probs)) # Handle cases where k exceeds vocabulary size.
    mask = np.zeros_like(probs)
    mask[np.argsort(probs)[::-1][:k]] = 1
    probs_masked = probs * mask
    probs_masked /= np.sum(probs_masked)
    return np.random.choice(len(probs), p=probs_masked)


def generate_caption_topk(model, image_features, k=5, temperature=1.0, max_length=30):
    # ... (Similar setup as beam search and nucleus sampling) ...
    caption = []
    word_index = model.start_token
    for _ in range(max_length):
        partial_caption = tf.expand_dims(tf.constant([word_index]), axis=0)
        predictions = model(image_features, partial_caption)
        probs = tf.squeeze(predictions, axis=0).numpy()
        word_index = top_k_sampling_with_temperature(probs, k=k, temperature=temperature)
        caption.append(word_index)
        if word_index == model.end_token:
            break
    return model.vocab.index_to_word(caption)

```

This example uses top-k sampling but introduces a temperature parameter to control randomness.  Experimentation with `k` and `temperature` is crucial for optimal results.

By implementing these decoding strategies and carefully tuning hyperparameters, you can significantly improve the diversity of generated captions from a single image, without needing to fundamentally alter the model architecture.  Remember to evaluate the trade-offs between diversity and coherence; overly diverse captions may lack semantic meaning.  Thorough experimentation with different beam widths, nucleus probabilities, and temperatures is essential to find the optimal settings for your specific model and dataset.
