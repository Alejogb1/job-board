The absence of a `shape` attribute on a tensor object usually stems from the underlying library or framework not providing this attribute directly, or from the tensor's representation being such that a readily-available shape is not inherently defined.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across various deep learning projects, including a large-scale natural language processing system and a real-time computer vision application, highlights the need for careful attention to data structures and library functionalities.

**1. Explanation:**

Most popular tensor libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch) explicitly provide a `shape` attribute (or an equivalent method like `.size()` in PyTorch) for their tensor objects.  If you're encountering a tensor lacking this attribute, the most probable causes are:

* **Incorrect Library Import or Object Type:**  You might be working with a custom tensor class, a wrapper, or a data structure that mimics tensor functionality but doesn't faithfully implement the standard shape attribute.  Double-check that you're using the correct library and that the object is genuinely a tensor from that library.  A common error is accidentally using a list of lists instead of a properly created tensor.

* **Dynamically Shaped Tensors (or Lack Thereof):** Some frameworks support dynamically shaped tensors where the shape is not fixed at creation and can change during computation. While the shape is still accessible (often through a function call), a direct attribute might not exist.  This is less common in typical numerical computation but is crucial in certain graph computation frameworks.

* **Custom Tensor Implementations:**  If working with a specialized tensor library or a custom implementation, the developers may have chosen a different approach to represent the shape information, potentially for optimization or specific functionality.  Consult the library's documentation thoroughly to ascertain how shape information is accessed.

* **Data Serialization and Deserialization:** If you've loaded the tensor from a file or a serialized format, the shape information might have been lost during the process. The serialization method may not preserve all metadata, including the tensor shape. Careful handling during saving and loading procedures is crucial to prevent this.

* **Wrapper Functions or Objects:**  Intermediate layers of abstraction or wrapper functions might obscure the underlying tensor's attributes. Inspect the object's type and trace back the operations that generated it to identify the source of the missing attribute.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Library Import/Object Type**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# Incorrect: Using a list of lists instead of a NumPy array
my_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
# Attempting to access shape will fail
try:
  print(my_list.shape)
except AttributeError:
  print("AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'")

# Correct: Using a NumPy array
my_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(my_array.shape)  # Output: (2, 2)

# Correct: Using a PyTorch tensor
my_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(my_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([2, 2])
```

This example demonstrates the critical difference between a standard Python list and a NumPy array or PyTorch tensor.  Lists don't have the `shape` attribute, highlighting the importance of using the correct data structures for numerical computations.  The error handling demonstrates a robust approach to managing potential issues.

**Example 2: Dynamically Shaped Tensors (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#  In TensorFlow, shape information is often accessed through methods
# rather than a direct attribute in dynamic computational graphs.

dynamic_tensor = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3])
print(dynamic_tensor.shape) # Might output a TensorShape or similar dynamic representation

# Reshape the tensor - shape changes dynamically
dynamic_tensor.assign([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(dynamic_tensor.shape)  # shape will reflect this change
print(tf.shape(dynamic_tensor))  # explicit shape retrieval using a function


```

TensorFlow's dynamic nature demonstrates a case where the shape isn't a static attribute but is accessible through methods.  The code showcases dynamic reshaping and the explicit retrieval of shape information using `tf.shape`. Note that the exact output might vary depending on the TensorFlow version and execution context.


**Example 3: Custom Tensor Implementation (Conceptual)**

```python
class MyTensor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.dims = self._calculate_dimensions(data)

    def _calculate_dimensions(self, data):
        # Recursive function to determine dimensions (simplified)
        if isinstance(data, (int, float)):
            return ()  # Scalar
        elif isinstance(data, list):
            return (len(data),) + self._calculate_dimensions(data[0])
        else:
            raise TypeError("Unsupported data type")

    def get_shape(self):
        return self.dims


my_custom_tensor = MyTensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(my_custom_tensor.get_shape())  # Output: (2, 3)

# No 'shape' attribute directly, but information is accessible through a method.

```

This example shows a custom `MyTensor` class that doesn't have a `shape` attribute but provides the dimension information through the `get_shape()` method.  This approach reflects the flexibility in how tensor-like structures can be designed, highlighting the need to consult the specific library or implementation's documentation for details on accessing shape information.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation for NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.  A good introductory book on linear algebra will provide valuable context for understanding the underlying mathematical concepts related to tensors and their shapes.  Finally, a solid text on deep learning will further contextualize the role of tensors in machine learning frameworks.
