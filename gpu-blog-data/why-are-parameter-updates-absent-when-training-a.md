Siamese networks trained with contrastive loss often present a seemingly paradoxical situation: the network’s output changes during training, signifying learning, yet the explicitly computed parameter updates appear absent. The key lies in the mechanism of the backpropagation algorithm and how contrastive loss interacts with the shared weights of the Siamese architecture. Understanding this nuance clarifies why updates aren’t directly visible in isolation, and how the network is still demonstrably learning.

At the core, Siamese networks leverage two or more identical subnetworks that share all parameters. These subnetworks process distinct inputs and produce embedded representations. Contrastive loss, unlike classification losses, does not aim to directly predict a label. Instead, it aims to learn an embedding space where similar inputs are close, and dissimilar inputs are far apart. The loss function penalizes distances between embeddings based on whether the inputs are from the same or different classes. During backpropagation, gradients are computed with respect to this distance, flowing backward through *both* subnetworks and affecting the shared weights. The crucial point here is the gradients' effect on shared parameters, not the presence of isolated, distinct updates on each instance.

Consider this scenario from a past project where I worked on facial recognition using a Siamese network: we had a training dataset consisting of pairs of images – some pairs showing the same person, others showing different people. Initially, the embeddings produced by the Siamese network were essentially random and clustered together irrespective of the input pairings. Using contrastive loss, we aimed to “pull” embeddings from same-person pairs closer, and “push” embeddings from different-person pairs apart. While monitoring the network’s output, we observed the embedding space gradually organizing itself, yet examining the computed weight changes on a per-instance basis yielded no straightforward, visible updates. Here's why:

The backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to *each* weight in the network. The gradients derived from both subnetworks of the Siamese network are combined (typically summed or averaged) before updating the *shared* parameters. These gradients can be viewed as instructions of how to change the network’s weights to reduce the loss. Because the weights are shared, the changes are not applied per subnetwork or per input pair but aggregated. Thus, observing a delta on one subnetwork’s weights is not possible. Instead, the effective change manifests as a cumulative alteration to the shared parameters, observable when the network is subsequently evaluated with a new pair, not during a single step of backpropagation. In essence, updates are present, but they are cumulative, distributed across the shared weights, and are not reflected as distinct deltas for each subnetwork during each training pass.

To illustrate further, let’s look at some code examples. Consider a simplified PyTorch implementation of a Siamese network and contrastive loss:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim

class SiameseNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SiameseNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3)
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 13 * 13, 128) # Assuming input of 28x28, 1 channel
        self.embedding_dim = 128

    def forward_once(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 13 * 13)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return x

    def forward(self, input1, input2):
        output1 = self.forward_once(input1)
        output2 = self.forward_once(input2)
        return output1, output2

class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super(ContrastiveLoss, self).__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, output1, output2, label):
        distances = F.pairwise_distance(output1, output2)
        loss = torch.mean((1-label) * torch.pow(distances, 2) +
                          (label) * torch.pow(torch.clamp(self.margin - distances, min=0.0), 2))
        return loss

# Example Usage
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
net = SiameseNetwork().to(device)
criterion = ContrastiveLoss().to(device)
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

input1 = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28).to(device)
input2 = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28).to(device)
label = torch.tensor([0], dtype=torch.float).to(device) # 0 for dissimilar, 1 for similar

# Perform one training step
optimizer.zero_grad()
output1, output2 = net(input1, input2)
loss = criterion(output1, output2, label)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

# Observe changes. No direct changes on isolated inputs
# but parameters are changed through accumulation of gradients
```

Here, `SiameseNetwork` represents the network, sharing weights between the `forward_once` path. `ContrastiveLoss` calculates the loss based on the distances between embeddings and the label specifying whether they are from same or different class. During the optimization step, `loss.backward()` triggers the backpropagation. The `optimizer.step()` performs the update. The key takeaway is that parameter updates occur on *shared* weights and are not tied to input pairs, making them appear absent when looking at isolated subnetwork gradients.

To further illustrate, consider adding a gradient check within the training loop:

```python
# Within the training loop, after loss.backward()
for name, param in net.named_parameters():
   if param.grad is not None:
      # Prints the gradients accumulated on shared parameters
      # This illustrates that gradients are calculated, not that they aren't present
      print(f"Gradient on parameter {name}: {param.grad.norm()}")
```

This code snippet will reveal that gradients are indeed calculated for each *parameter* (not per subnetwork), even though parameter updates are applied to shared weights only. The gradients of each subnetwork effectively accumulate onto the shared parameters, and the update happens on those shared parameters.

Finally, examine the parameter updates before and after a single training step:

```python
# Before training
for name, param in net.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter {name} before training: {param[0][0][0][0].item()}")

# Perform one training step (as in previous example)
optimizer.zero_grad()
output1, output2 = net(input1, input2)
loss = criterion(output1, output2, label)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

# After training
for name, param in net.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter {name} after training: {param[0][0][0][0].item()}")
```

This example demonstrates how the shared parameters do indeed change after training. The values printed before and after training will show a delta, confirming parameter updates, albeit applied to the collective weights not tied directly to the individual sub-networks of the Siamese architecture. The parameters themselves are updated based on the accumulated gradients and not based on individual gradients for each input instance.

In summary, the parameter updates in Siamese networks with contrastive loss are not absent; they are a product of accumulated gradients from each subnetwork and are applied to the *shared weights*. The changes aren’t per subnetwork but are cumulative, affecting the shared parameters. This mechanism explains why individual updates are not directly visible when focusing on individual branches and their isolated calculations, but are clearly apparent when examining the shared weights and the overall change to the network’s embedding behaviour.

For further understanding, I suggest exploring the following resources: a textbook on deep learning covering backpropagation and gradient descent, a journal article focusing on Siamese network architectures, and resources describing contrastive loss functions and their properties. These sources will offer a comprehensive explanation of the mechanisms involved in Siamese network training.
