The observation that only a single PyTorch process appears per GPU, even when attempting multi-process parallelism, often stems from a misunderstanding of how PyTorch interacts with CUDA and the underlying operating system's process management.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale deep learning deployments consistently points to a failure to properly leverage multiprocessing libraries in conjunction with appropriate CUDA context management.  The core problem is not necessarily a limitation of PyTorch itself, but rather a result of how processes are launched and their access to GPU resources is managed.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Each GPU possesses a finite number of CUDA contexts.  A CUDA context is essentially a dedicated environment within the GPU's memory space where kernels (the core computational units of CUDA programs) execute. PyTorch, when utilizing CUDA acceleration, creates and manages these contexts.  Crucially, a single process on a given GPU generally owns a single CUDA context.  Therefore, multiple Python processes attempting to concurrently access the same GPU without careful orchestration will encounter contention for this limited resource. The operating system's process scheduler will typically only assign one process to utilize a given GPU at any moment, resulting in the observed behavior of only one PyTorch process appearing active on each GPU.  This isn't an inherent limitation of PyTorch's GPU utilization, but a consequence of process-level GPU resource allocation.

To achieve true parallelism across multiple GPUs, strategies that leverage either multi-process parallelism with inter-process communication (IPC) or distributed data parallel training are necessary.  These strategies require explicit management of GPU allocation, ensuring that each process is assigned a unique GPU and that communication between processes is efficient.  Ignoring this crucial aspect will lead to a single PyTorch process dominating each GPU, even if multiple processes have been launched.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Multiprocessing Attempt**

```python
import torch
import multiprocessing

def gpu_task(gpu_id):
    print(f"Process {multiprocessing.current_process().name} starting on GPU {gpu_id}")
    device = torch.device(f'cuda:{gpu_id}')
    model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10).to(device) # Simple model
    # ... training or inference code using model ...
    print(f"Process {multiprocessing.current_process().name} finishing on GPU {gpu_id}")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_gpus = torch.cuda.device_count()
    processes = []
    for i in range(num_gpus):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=gpu_task, args=(i,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

**Commentary:** This code, while seemingly attempting multi-process GPU utilization, is flawed. Each process independently attempts to acquire a CUDA context on its assigned GPU. While it might appear to run on multiple GPUs, only one process will effectively use each GPU at a given time, leading to the single-process-per-GPU observation.  The system's process scheduler will arbitrate between the processes, leading to inefficient utilization.

**Example 2: Correct Multiprocessing with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES**

```python
import torch
import multiprocessing
import os

def gpu_task(gpu_id):
    os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_id)  # Crucial line
    print(f"Process {multiprocessing.current_process().name} starting on GPU {gpu_id}")
    device = torch.device('cuda:0') # Note: always cuda:0 after setting environment variable
    model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10).to(device)
    # ... training or inference code using model ...
    print(f"Process {multiprocessing.current_process().name} finishing on GPU {gpu_id}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_gpus = torch.cuda.device_count()
    processes = []
    for i in range(num_gpus):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=gpu_task, args=(i,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

**Commentary:** This improved example utilizes the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. This variable restricts each process's view to only a single GPU, effectively assigning a dedicated GPU to each process.  Note that within the `gpu_task` function, we always refer to `cuda:0`, as the environment variable has masked the other GPUs from the process's view. This prevents resource contention and allows for true parallelism.  Each process now has its own isolated CUDA context.

**Example 3: Distributed Data Parallel Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def run(rank, size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=size)
    model = nn.Linear(10,10).to(rank) # Each process on its own GPU
    # ...Distributed Training using torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel...
    dist.destroy_process_group()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    mp.spawn(run, args=(size,), nprocs=size, join=True)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates distributed data parallel training, a more sophisticated approach for large-scale deep learning.  `torch.distributed` provides mechanisms for efficient communication and synchronization between processes running on different GPUs.  Each process is explicitly assigned a rank and communicates using the chosen backend (here, NCCL, a fast communication library). This method provides better scalability and avoids the limitations of simple multiprocessing.  The `mp.spawn` function handles process creation and ensures proper initialization of the distributed environment.
