Gradients can appear as zero in TensorFlow 2 for several interconnected reasons, primarily stemming from operations performed within the computation graph that effectively disconnect the gradient flow or lead to a situation where the derivative evaluates to zero. I've encountered this frequently during my development of complex neural network models, often requiring meticulous inspection of the graph structure and applied operations.

The core issue is that TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation system relies on the chain rule to propagate gradients backward through the computational graph. This means that each operation needs to have a defined derivative with respect to its inputs. If this derivative is zero, then any subsequent gradients passed back through that operation will also be zero, effectively blocking gradient propagation and preventing weight updates during training. This can happen in several situations which fall under the following three categories: 1) operations with derivatives that evaluate to zero, 2) unintentional detaching from the gradient tape, and 3) the lack of trainable variables within a specific path.

First, consider operations that inherently result in zero gradients. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, a common component in deep learning models, serves as a good example. ReLU outputs x if x > 0 and 0 otherwise. The derivative is 1 if x > 0 and 0 if x < 0. When the ReLU's input is negative (or zero, depending on implementation), its derivative is zero, thus causing a zero gradient. This zero derivative can propagate back through subsequent layers, preventing updates to the weights, causing a phenomenon known as 'dying ReLU'. Another, often overlooked, source of zero derivatives is the 'tf.where' function. When the condition provided to 'tf.where' remains constant, gradients can be lost, specifically for those cases not selected by the condition as they don't contribute to the computation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ReLU example:
x = tf.constant([-2.0, 0.0, 3.0])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  y = tf.nn.relu(x)
gradients = tape.gradient(y, x)
print("ReLU gradients:", gradients.numpy())

# tf.where example:
x_where = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
condition = tf.constant([True, False, False])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x_where)
  y_where = tf.where(condition, x_where, tf.zeros_like(x_where))
gradients_where = tape.gradient(y_where, x_where)
print("tf.where gradients:", gradients_where.numpy())

```
In the above code snippet, notice that for the ReLU function, the gradients are 0 where the input `x` is negative or 0. The `tf.where` function provides gradients of 1 when the condition is true and 0 otherwise, effectively preventing gradient flow to elements not selected. This behavior, while sometimes intentional, can inadvertently lead to problems if not correctly considered.

Secondly, unintentional detachment from the gradient tape is another common cause of zero gradients. TensorFlow's gradient tape only records operations involving differentiable `tf.Variable` objects, those defined as trainable weights. Operations involving intermediate results or constants are often not included in the tape's recording. Additionally, some operations, such as those involving non-differentiable functions or variables passed through Python functions that do not interact directly with the tape, will not provide proper gradient information. Furthermore, using `.numpy()` to extract a tensor value will break the gradient chain, effectively creating a constant, not a `tf.Variable`, for operations downstream, resulting in a zero gradient. Similarly, `tf.stop_gradient()` will deliberately prevent gradients from flowing backward through the computation graph, again leading to zero gradients in downstream calculations. The use of tensor slicing and assignment, when not done carefully, can also result in an operation detached from the gradient tape.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Detachment example using numpy
x_detatch = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_detatch = x_detatch.numpy() * 3.0
gradients_detatch = tape.gradient(y_detatch, x_detatch) # Expect None here

print("Detachment gradients:", gradients_detatch)


# tf.stop_gradient example
x_stop = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_stop = tf.stop_gradient(x_stop) * 3.0
gradients_stop = tape.gradient(y_stop,x_stop)
print("Stop Gradient:", gradients_stop)

# Using Python operations and constants
x_const = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_const = my_function(x_const) # No gradient defined within my_function
gradients_const = tape.gradient(y_const, x_const)

print("Python operations with constant:", gradients_const)

def my_function(x):
    return x * 2.0 # Will not register with the gradient tape if x is a variable.
```

This code block illustrates several ways in which the tape can be detached. The `.numpy()` conversion makes `y_detatch` a non-differentiable value, producing a 'None' gradient. The use of `tf.stop_gradient()` prevents gradients to flow from `x_stop` to `y_stop`. Similarly, using Python functions may not register with the tape, resulting in ‘None’ gradient as seen when using the function `my_function`.

Thirdly, and often overlooked, is the possibility that there are simply no trainable variables along a certain path of computation. For instance, if you are only feeding data through a model's non-trainable layers, gradients will not flow as there are no learnable parameters to update within that portion of the graph. It can also be caused by a missing dependency when composing a model with multiple parts.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# No trainable weights example:
class DummyModel(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
      super(DummyModel, self).__init__()
      self.non_trainable_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, trainable=False) # No weights to train

    def call(self, x):
      return self.non_trainable_layer(x)

model = DummyModel()
x = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = model(x)
gradients_model = tape.gradient(y, model.trainable_variables)

print("Model with no trainable weights gradients:", gradients_model)
```
In the last example, a custom model is created that does not contain any trainable variables. Therefore, even if using a gradient tape, the gradient returned will be 'None'.

Diagnosing zero gradient issues requires careful code inspection, especially for large neural network models. I would advise inspecting the outputs of activation functions before and after transformations, verifying that all necessary variables are being tracked within the tape, ensuring non-differentiable operation are not unintentionally inserted in the computation graph, and verifying that there are trainable parameters along the gradient path. Using model debugging tools can also help visualize and analyze computational graphs, which helps to identify issues in gradient flow. Specifically, when building custom layers and models, it's important to double-check the gradient flow by testing the layer in isolation before deploying it inside the larger model.

To further understand and prevent zero gradients, I strongly recommend reviewing TensorFlow's official documentation on gradient tape and automatic differentiation. Additionally, exploring tutorials on custom layers and model building techniques within TensorFlow is crucial. Books or articles covering neural network architecture and optimization can also greatly help develop a better grasp of how gradient flow is critical for successful training. Finally, actively engaging with the TensorFlow community on forums and discussion boards is invaluable for learning from other developers' experiences and perspectives.
