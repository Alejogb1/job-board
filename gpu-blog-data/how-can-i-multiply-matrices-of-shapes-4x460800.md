Directly, the stated matrix multiplication (4x460800) by (80000x16) is fundamentally incompatible due to the inner dimensions not matching. Standard matrix multiplication requires the number of columns in the first matrix to equal the number of rows in the second. To enable this operation in PyTorch, we must restructure the matrices to conform to the rules of matrix multiplication, likely involving a transposition and/or reshaping, while taking into account the desired output shape. I will detail the steps involved and provide viable options.

My experience working on large-scale neural network projects has frequently led to encountering such shape mismatches. When dealing with tensor operations, particularly in deep learning, understanding and manipulating tensor dimensions is paramount for achieving correct results. The problem isn't merely about using the `torch.matmul` or `@` operator but rather about preparing the tensors to allow these operators to function properly and generate the intended mathematical result. Ignoring shape requirements leads to errors or, worse, produces incorrect results without raising errors.

**Explanation of the Issue and Solution**

The core issue stems from the basic definition of matrix multiplication. If we have a matrix A with dimensions *m x n* and matrix B with dimensions *p x q*, the multiplication *AB* is only defined when *n = p*.  The resultant matrix will have dimensions *m x q*. The provided matrices (4x460800) and (80000x16) clearly violate this condition.

To make these matrices compatible, we need to consider the intended mathematical operation within the context of our application. Given the drastically different orders of magnitude in dimensions, we will likely be looking to either transform or aggregate some of the information. Common adjustments I use in practice are:

1. **Transposition:** If the underlying mathematics allows, transposing a matrix will swap its rows and columns.  For a matrix A with dimension *m x n*, its transpose, denoted as A<sup>T</sup>, has dimensions *n x m*. This can be helpful to align inner dimensions.

2. **Reshaping/View:** PyTorch allows tensors to be reshaped to different dimensions as long as the total number of elements remains consistent. This operation only changes how data is interpreted; the underlying memory representation remains unchanged. For instance, a tensor of (4, 4) could be reshaped to (2, 8) or (8, 2).

3. **Tensor Contraction:** Operations like a dot product between rows of the matrices.

Considering our case, several operations might be necessary. Directly multiplying these matrices as given, is impossible. Let's examine different scenarios and their solutions in code using PyTorch.

**Code Examples**

In the examples that follow, I'll assume the ultimate goal is to perform operations that are meaningful in the context of signal processing, such as weighting columns from one matrix by elements in another or calculating aggregations. Pure matrix multiplication using the provided dimensions would likely be a mistake, so I will proceed accordingly.

**Example 1: Column-wise Multiplication and Aggregation**

This example is motivated by an idea common in machine learning: using one matrix as "weights" that are applied to the columns of another matrix.

```python
import torch

# Original matrices
matrix_A = torch.randn(4, 460800)
matrix_B = torch.randn(80000, 16)

# Reshape matrix A to have 16 columns
matrix_A_reshaped = matrix_A.reshape(4, 28800, 16) # 28800 = 460800 / 16

# Transpose to be of the shape (16, 4*28800)
matrix_A_reshaped = matrix_A_reshaped.transpose(1,2).reshape(16,-1) # (16, 4*28800)

# Take the first 80000 columns of matrix_A
matrix_A_selected = matrix_A_reshaped[:, :80000].transpose(0,1) # (80000, 16)

# Element-wise multiplication
weighted_matrix_C = matrix_A_selected * matrix_B


# Aggregate the weighted values by column
aggregated_matrix_C = torch.sum(weighted_matrix_C, dim = 1).reshape(80000)

print("Shape of matrix_A_reshaped:", matrix_A_reshaped.shape)
print("Shape of matrix_A_selected:", matrix_A_selected.shape)
print("Shape of weighted_matrix_C:", weighted_matrix_C.shape)
print("Shape of aggregated_matrix_C:", aggregated_matrix_C.shape)
```

*Commentary:* Here, I initially reshape `matrix_A` to separate the last dimension. Then, after reshaping and transposing, I select the first 80000 columns of reshaped matrix `A`. This allows a shape that can be multiplied element-wise with `matrix_B`, then summing the multiplication products per column. This approach assumes the application wants to treat the rows in `matrix_B` as weights for different parts of `matrix_A`. The shape of final output is (80000).

**Example 2: Row-wise operations**

This example demonstrates how to process `matrix_A` and `matrix_B` row by row. This approach is useful when you are treating each row as an independent observation.

```python
import torch

# Original matrices
matrix_A = torch.randn(4, 460800)
matrix_B = torch.randn(80000, 16)


results_list = []

for row_a in matrix_A:
  reshaped_row_A = row_a.reshape(28800, 16)
  row_results = []
  for row_b in matrix_B:
      row_results.append(torch.dot(row_b, reshaped_row_A[0]))

  results_list.append(torch.stack(row_results))


final_result = torch.stack(results_list)
print("Shape of final result", final_result.shape)
```

*Commentary:* Here, the code iterates over the rows of matrix `A`. Inside the loop the rows of matrix `A` is reshaped. Then I loop through the rows of `matrix_B` and compute a dot product between it and first reshaped row `matrix_A`, appending the results in row_results list, then stacking into the result list. Finally the final result matrix is generated by stacking `results_list`. This generates a (4, 80000) matrix. This would apply if one were applying some kind of comparison or aggregation for each row.

**Example 3: Using a learned weight matrix**
This example provides a more realistic scenario in the context of a machine learning model.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Original matrices
matrix_A = torch.randn(4, 460800)
matrix_B = torch.randn(80000, 16)

# Define a linear layer that will learn a weight matrix
linear_layer = nn.Linear(460800, 16, bias = False) # no bias

# Generate a weight matrix by feeding random input
weight_matrix = linear_layer(torch.randn(1, 460800))

# Weight multiplication
matrix_C = matrix_A @ weight_matrix.transpose(0,1) # shape: (4, 16)
matrix_C = matrix_C.unsqueeze(1) # shape: (4, 1, 16)

# Reshape matrix B
matrix_B_reshaped = matrix_B.reshape(80000, 1, 16) # shape (80000, 1, 16)

# matrix multiplication and aggregation
aggregated_C = torch.matmul(matrix_C, matrix_B_reshaped.transpose(1,2)).squeeze(1) # shape: (4, 80000)

final_result = torch.sum(aggregated_C, dim = 0) # shape: (80000)
print("Shape of final result", final_result.shape)
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates how to leverage PyTorch's linear layer to learn weight matrix that can bridge between the shape mismatches. The linear layer `nn.Linear` learns a weight matrix that transforms `matrix_A`. After that I transform and use standard matrix multiplication to compute matrix C. Then I use matrix multiplication between the output of the transformed matrix A and matrix B.
