The crux of your issue lies in the disparity between your GPU's compute capability and the CUDA architecture you're targeting: 8.6. Specifically, the CUDA architecture 8.6, introduced with the NVIDIA Ampere architecture (e.g., RTX A4000, A5000, A6000, RTX 30 series except 3050/3050ti) is not backward compatible with older GPUs that might have a lower compute capability. The compute capability determines which CUDA features and instructions a given GPU can execute; if your GPU's compute capability is lower, it will not support CUDA 8.6.

The compute capability value is typically represented as X.Y, for example, 3.5, 7.5, or 8.6. The higher this number, the more advanced the architectural features and instruction sets the GPU can process. Therefore, attempting to compile or execute code targeting CUDA architecture 8.6 on a GPU that does not possess at least an 8.x or higher compute capability results in an incompatibility error, manifesting as a failure to launch the CUDA kernels or utilize specific CUDA APIs designed for higher compute capabilities. The CUDA toolkit does not automatically bridge this gap, instead it requires explicit support at compile time.

I've spent considerable time troubleshooting similar problems in our internal GPU acceleration projects. Typically, this mismatch presents itself in two forms. The first is during compilation when you explicitly specify the target architecture. The second is during runtime if you build for a more recent architecture than is supported by the physical hardware. This results in errors related to unsupported instructions or features. Often, the error message provides some diagnostic information.

Here are some concrete examples based on the kind of situation I've encountered while working with CUDA:

**Example 1: Compilation Failure Due to Incompatible Architecture Flag**

Imagine you are using a CMake build system with NVIDIA's `nvcc` compiler, and you’ve specified the target architecture in the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` variable.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyCudaProject)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

set(CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "86") # Targeting CUDA architecture 8.6

cuda_add_executable(my_cuda_executable my_cuda_kernel.cu)
```

```cpp
// my_cuda_kernel.cu
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int* data, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(idx < size){
    data[idx] = idx * 2;
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int *h_data, *d_data;

    h_data = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size* sizeof(int));

    for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        h_data[i] = i;

    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    myKernel<<<256, 256>>>(d_data, size);
    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << h_data[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    cudaFree(d_data);
    free(h_data);
    return 0;
}
```

If the GPU you’re using has a compute capability lower than 8.0, the `nvcc` compiler will emit an error during compilation. The error message will typically indicate that the specified architecture ("sm_86") is not supported by the target GPU architecture of the device being compiled for. This is because the compiler generates machine code specific to the given target. You must ensure the targeted architecture is either supported by your GPU, or alternatively compile for multiple architectures and rely on the driver to pick the right one at runtime.

**Example 2: Runtime Error Due to Compiled-in Architecture Incompatibility**

Even if the code compiled successfully targeting CUDA 8.6, the error can still manifest at runtime. This is typically the case when using pre-compiled libraries that were built specifically for one architecture but are being run on different hardware. The error generated by the CUDA driver often mentions an "invalid device ordinal," "unsupported GPU architecture," or, more specifically, an "unsupported PTX version". This error means that the pre-compiled binary contains instructions that your GPU cannot execute.

For example, if I compiled the following code targeting 8.6 as described above (and assuming for the moment this worked), and tried to run it on a machine with, for example, a GPU with compute capability 7.5:

```cpp
// same my_cuda_kernel.cu compiled as above
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int* data, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(idx < size){
    data[idx] = idx * 2;
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int *h_data, *d_data;

    h_data = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size* sizeof(int));

    for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        h_data[i] = i;

    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    myKernel<<<256, 256>>>(d_data, size);
    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << h_data[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    cudaFree(d_data);
    free(h_data);
    return 0;
}
```

Upon execution, the application would not function correctly, displaying the aforementioned runtime error. It is important to not confuse this with a compilation issue, the compilation might have succeeded but the resulting machine code targets an instruction set that the hardware does not support, resulting in runtime failure.

**Example 3: Resolving the Issue Using Multiple Architecture Compilation**

The appropriate solution to this issue is to compile for the specific architecture of the target GPU. If you are targeting multiple GPUs with varying architectures, CUDA offers the option of specifying multiple architectures for compilation. The driver then selects the most appropriate compiled binary at runtime.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyCudaProject)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

set(CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "75;86") # Compiling for 7.5 and 8.6

cuda_add_executable(my_cuda_executable my_cuda_kernel.cu)
```

By including both `75` and `86` in the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` variable, the compiler generates both `sm_75` and `sm_86` machine code. During runtime, the CUDA driver will select the version compatible with the detected GPU. This is the most reliable method for ensuring compatibility across a range of target GPU hardware. If the host machine's GPU does not support any of the specified architectures, the application will fail at runtime with an appropriate error message.

This also applies to direct `nvcc` compilation, the `-arch` flag can accept a semicolon separated list of architectures for simultaneous compilation.

To summarize, the fact that CUDA architecture 8.6 is unsupported by your GPU stems from the GPU's compute capability being lower than 8.0. This can manifest in compile-time errors, runtime failures, or both. The recommended strategy to overcome this is to either: build code explicitly targeted for your hardware, or utilize the compiler to target multiple supported architectures and rely on the driver to select the appropriate one at runtime. This often provides the best trade-off between performance and compatibility.

For further information on CUDA compute capabilities, I would recommend consulting NVIDIA's official documentation regarding CUDA toolkit releases and the associated supported architectures. There are detailed guides available on NVIDIA developer's website that explain how the compute capability relates to GPU architecture and which features are supported for each version. A comprehensive guide to the `nvcc` compiler flags can also provide additional information about the `-arch` flag and how to properly build code targeting your system. Lastly, examine the CMake documentation for CUDA and the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` variable, this will be invaluable in building cross-platform and cross-architecture projects.
