TensorFlow's custom layer functionality offers considerable flexibility, but initializing layer attributes based on information only available at graph execution, or during the first forward pass, necessitates careful consideration of how TensorFlow constructs computational graphs. Static initialization, while simpler, is not always sufficient when the desired attribute depends on the input data shape or other runtime characteristics.

My experience developing a neural network for variable-length time series data underscored this challenge. I needed a custom layer where the size of an internal weight matrix was not known until the layer received its first input; the time series lengths were not fixed, which precluded static size declarations during layer instantiation. To address this, we need to move beyond standard attribute definition within the layer's `__init__` method and instead leverage delayed initialization logic within the `build` method, which gets invoked only after the input shape becomes known.

A TensorFlow layer's `__init__` method, which is typically where one would set instance attributes, primarily focuses on defining the parameters that are fixed across all invocations of the layer. This is because it is executed only once upon instantiation. In contrast, the `build` method is invoked after the layer's input shape is determined, either during the first forward pass or when the `build()` method is explicitly called. The `build` method receives the input shape as an argument, allowing us to dynamically compute and initialize attributes based on that shape. Crucially, the `build` method also ensures that TensorFlow variables are registered with the layer, thereby making them trainable.

The crux is understanding that defining an attribute within the `__init__` method and initializing its value within the `build` method are two distinct operations. The former merely establishes the existence of a variable, while the latter allocates and populates it. This distinction is paramount when dynamic initialization is necessary. Variables defined in the `__init__` method will not depend on the input and cannot be changed afterwards.

Hereâ€™s the core idea demonstrated through a progressively complex example:

**Example 1: Basic Dynamic Shape Initialization**

This example shows the basic structure of initializing a weight matrix inside `build`. The matrix dimensions are determined by the size of the input.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(DynamicDense, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = None # Define variable; value assigned in build

    def build(self, input_shape):
      input_dim = input_shape[-1] # Assume last dim is feature dimension
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units),
                              initializer='random_normal',
                              trainable=True)
      self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                              initializer='zeros',
                              trainable=True)


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Usage example:
layer = DynamicDense(units=10)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 5)) # Batch of 32, 5 features
output = layer(input_tensor)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

In this example, we define a weight matrix, `self.w`, but assign it an initial shape and value within `build`. The input dimension is deduced from the shape of the input. This approach guarantees that `self.w` will match the input data, even if the data shape is only available during the initial forward pass. It also registers `w` and `b` as trainable variables through `add_weight`. Note, that `build` is only run once.

**Example 2: Utilizing a Lookup Table with Dynamic Indexing**

Here, the need for dynamic indexing arises when we use an internal lookup table. The size of the lookup table depends on the number of unique categories in the input data. We will pretend that this number is only available at runtime.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicLookup(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim):
        super(DynamicLookup, self).__init__()
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
        self.lookup_table = None # Define variable; value assigned in build

    def build(self, input_shape):
        max_index = tf.reduce_max(tf.cast(tf.convert_to_tensor(input_shape), dtype=tf.int32))  # Assume max index in input batch
        self.lookup_table = self.add_weight(shape=(max_index + 1, self.embedding_dim),
                              initializer='uniform',
                              trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
      return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.lookup_table, inputs)


# Usage example:
layer = DynamicLookup(embedding_dim=16)
input_indices = tf.constant([[0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [0, 3, 4]], dtype=tf.int32)
output_embed = layer(input_indices)
print("Output shape:", output_embed.shape)
```

In this example, the `build` method infers the maximum category index from the maximum integer in the first batch of data and constructs the lookup table (`self.lookup_table`) accordingly. This strategy permits embedding lookup for categories with numbers only discovered at runtime without relying on a pre-defined maximum. Notice how I used the input shape in a very specific way. I converted the input shape tensor to an integer and find its max to pretend that max value came from the tensor that I used as input to the layer. This is how I was able to initialize a variable with a shape that depended on the data.

**Example 3: Conditional Initialization Based on Input Properties**

This demonstrates that attributes can depend on other properties of the input and that there is no restriction that dynamic initialization must come from the input tensor shape. Here we decide the initialization method based on an arbitrary condition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ConditionalInitializer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, init_type='random'):
        super(ConditionalInitializer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.init_type = init_type
        self.w = None # Define variable; value assigned in build

    def build(self, input_shape):
      input_dim = input_shape[-1]
      if self.init_type == 'random':
            self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units),
                                      initializer='random_normal',
                                      trainable=True)
      elif self.init_type == 'zero':
            self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units),
                                    initializer='zeros',
                                    trainable=True)
      else:
          raise ValueError("Invalid init_type")


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# Usage example:
layer_random = ConditionalInitializer(units=10, init_type='random')
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 5))
output_random = layer_random(input_tensor)


layer_zero = ConditionalInitializer(units=10, init_type='zero')
input_tensor_zero = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 5))
output_zero = layer_zero(input_tensor_zero)

print("Output from random initializer:", output_random.shape)
print("Output from zero initializer:", output_zero.shape)

```
This showcases how the choice of initializer can be controlled based on layer-specific parameters, in this case `init_type`, making the layer highly configurable without the need for separate implementations. We define the variables within the `build` method.

In summary, dynamic initialization of layer attributes requires a shift from relying solely on the `__init__` method to utilizing the `build` method, which provides the necessary information to initialize parameters that depend on input data or other runtime configurations. Crucially, employing `add_weight` within the `build` method ensures the created variables are automatically tracked for training.

For further study I would recommend the TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and variables, along with advanced tutorials focusing on creating complex architectures. Resources detailing best practices for creating modular and maintainable code will also be invaluable. Furthermore, studying how TensorFlow's `keras` API works provides a great source of examples of how to construct complex models using custom components.
