Filtering Torch tensors by index while maintaining the original tensor shape necessitates a nuanced approach that goes beyond simple boolean indexing.  Direct indexing alters the tensor's dimensions, which can be problematic for subsequent operations requiring consistency in shape.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines underscored the critical need for preserving original tensor structure during filtering operations.  Failing to do so resulted in significant debugging time and, ultimately, performance bottlenecks.  The solution lies in leveraging Torch's advanced indexing capabilities and leveraging the `torch.zeros_like()` function to construct a tensor of identical shape to the original, allowing for selective population.

The core principle involves creating a mask based on your indexing criteria and then using this mask to selectively populate a new tensor of the original shape. This prevents the shape change associated with direct indexing.  We'll explore three approaches, illustrating the varying levels of complexity and applicability to different filtering scenarios.

**1.  Boolean Masking with `torch.where()`:**

This approach is best suited for scenarios involving simple boolean conditions where we want to selectively keep or replace elements based on a condition.  For example, consider filtering a tensor to retain only elements greater than a threshold.

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Threshold value
threshold = 5

# Create a boolean mask
mask = tensor > threshold

# Create a new tensor with the original shape, filled with zeros
filtered_tensor = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=tensor.dtype)

# Use torch.where to selectively populate the new tensor
filtered_tensor = torch.where(mask, tensor, filtered_tensor)

# Output:
# tensor([[0, 0, 0],
#         [4, 5, 6],
#         [7, 8, 9]])
```

The code first generates a boolean mask (`mask`) indicating elements exceeding the threshold.  Then, a zero-filled tensor (`filtered_tensor`) is created, matching the original shape and data type.  Finally, `torch.where` conditionally populates `filtered_tensor` using elements from the original tensor where the mask is `True`, otherwise retaining the zero values.  This ensures that the shape is preserved, and elements not satisfying the condition are represented by zeros (or a user-defined default value).

**2. Advanced Indexing with List of Indices and `torch.scatter()`:**

When filtering based on specific index positions rather than a boolean condition, advanced indexing with `torch.scatter()` provides a powerful solution.  This method is particularly beneficial when dealing with irregular selection patterns.

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Indices to keep, as a list of tuples (row, column)
indices_to_keep = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]

# Create a new tensor with the original shape, filled with zeros
filtered_tensor = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=tensor.dtype)

# Use torch.scatter_ to populate the new tensor
for index in indices_to_keep:
    filtered_tensor[index] = tensor[index]

#Output:
#tensor([[0, 2, 0],
#        [0, 0, 6],
#        [7, 0, 0]])
```

Here, `indices_to_keep` directly specifies the (row, column) coordinates of elements to preserve. The loop iterates through these indices, populating the zero-filled `filtered_tensor` accordingly. The crucial aspect is the use of `filtered_tensor[index] = tensor[index]`, which assigns the values from the original tensor based on the specified coordinates, retaining the original tensor shape.  Note that this approach is efficient for relatively small numbers of indices; for very large sets, alternative vectorized operations might be more performant.

**3.  Combination of Boolean Masking and Advanced Indexing:**

This technique combines the flexibility of boolean masking with the precision of index-based selection.  This approach is ideal for intricate filtering conditions involving both conditional logic and specific index selection.

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Boolean condition
condition = tensor > 4

# Indices to keep (even if not satisfying the condition)
indices_to_keep = [(0,0), (2,2)]

# Create a mask incorporating both the condition and the indices
combined_mask = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=torch.bool)
combined_mask[condition] = True
for index in indices_to_keep:
    combined_mask[index] = True

# Create a new tensor with the original shape, filled with zeros
filtered_tensor = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=tensor.dtype)

# Populate using the combined mask
filtered_tensor[combined_mask] = tensor[combined_mask]


#Output:
#tensor([[1, 0, 0],
#        [0, 5, 6],
#        [0, 0, 9]])
```


This example illustrates a more complex scenario.  We first create a boolean mask based on a condition (`condition`). Then, we introduce `indices_to_keep`, which specifies additional indices to include regardless of the boolean condition.  A combined mask is generated, merging the condition and the explicit indices. This allows for refined control over which elements are preserved, ultimately populating `filtered_tensor` while maintaining the original shape.


In conclusion, effectively filtering Torch tensors while preserving the original shape requires a thoughtful selection of techniques based on the filtering criteria. The examples provided showcase three common approaches: boolean masking, advanced indexing, and a combination thereof.  The choice depends on the specifics of your filtering needs.
