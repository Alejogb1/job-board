TensorFlow's performance disparity between GPU and CPU for text processing on macOS stems primarily from the limitations imposed by macOS's CUDA driver and the inherent architecture of text processing tasks.  My experience working on large-scale natural language processing projects has consistently highlighted this issue.  While GPUs excel at parallel computation, the overhead associated with data transfer to and from the GPU, coupled with the often-sequential nature of certain text processing operations, can negate the potential performance gains.

The fundamental problem lies in the memory access patterns.  GPUs thrive on highly parallel operations on large, contiguous data blocks.  Text processing, however, frequently involves irregular memory accessesâ€”consider tasks like tokenization, where word lengths vary significantly, leading to non-uniform memory access patterns.  This irregularity inhibits efficient utilization of the GPU's parallel processing units.  The CUDA driver on macOS, while functional, hasn't always provided the same level of optimization and performance as its Linux counterparts, exacerbating the problem.  Furthermore, the overhead of transferring the often relatively small text data to the GPU memory and back to the CPU memory for processing can outweigh the speed advantage of the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.

Let's examine this through code examples.  These examples assume basic familiarity with TensorFlow and Python.  Note that raw execution times will vary based on hardware specifications and TensorFlow version.  The focus here is on illustrative code structures that highlight the performance bottlenecks.


**Example 1: Simple Text Classification using CPU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
sentences = ["This is a positive sentence.", "This is a negative sentence."]
labels = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])  # One-hot encoded labels

# Simple text vectorization
vectorizer = tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization(max_tokens=1000, output_mode='int')
vectorizer.adapt(sentences)

# Model (simple sequential model)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    vectorizer,
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train (CPU execution by default)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(sentences, labels, epochs=10)
```

This example uses a simple text classification model running solely on the CPU.  The vectorization and model operations are all performed within the CPU's memory space, minimizing data transfer overheads.  This approach often outperforms GPU-based approaches for small datasets due to the absence of GPU transfer overhead.


**Example 2:  Attempting GPU Acceleration (Potentially Slow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (same data and vectorization as Example 1) ...

# Attempting to use GPU
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Assumes a GPU is available
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        vectorizer,
        tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64),
        tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(sentences, labels, epochs=10)

```

This example attempts to force GPU usage.  However, if the dataset is small, the overhead of transferring data to the GPU, performing the relatively lightweight computation, and then transferring the results back to the CPU will likely outweigh any benefits. The performance gains are heavily dataset-size dependent; this becomes noticeable only when dealing with substantial corpora.


**Example 3: Optimized GPU Usage (Requires Larger Datasets)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (larger dataset required here -  thousands of sentences) ...

# Data preprocessing for efficient GPU usage (batching and data alignment)
batched_data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((sentences, labels)).batch(64).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Model with potential GPU optimization (adjust layers based on dataset size)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        vectorizer,
        tf.keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 128),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(batched_data, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates a strategy that could potentially yield better GPU performance.  A larger dataset is crucial here.  Efficient batching and prefetching using `tf.data` are essential for minimizing data transfer latency.  The model itself is slightly more complex and is designed to better leverage the GPU's parallel capabilities.  Even with these optimizations, however, the sequential nature of parts of text processing can still limit the overall speedup.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation on GPU support, focusing specifically on CUDA configuration and performance optimization guides tailored for macOS.  Examine resources on efficient data loading and preprocessing techniques within TensorFlow, with a particular emphasis on batching and prefetching strategies.  Additionally, reviewing materials on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) applied to text data will enhance your understanding of architecture choices relevant to GPU performance in NLP tasks.  Finally, consider exploring advanced topics such as mixed-precision training and TensorRT optimization for further performance enhancement.  Careful benchmarking against both CPU and GPU implementations, accompanied by thorough profiling, is essential to pinpoint bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.
