The dominant factor influencing efficient string comparison within extraordinarily large arrays, such as those exceeding 11 million elements, is the avoidance of nested loops.  Brute-force approaches – comparing each string to every other string – result in O(n²) time complexity, completely infeasible for this scale. My experience optimizing similar data processing pipelines in high-frequency trading systems highlights the critical need for algorithmic selection based on the specifics of the comparison task.

**1. Clear Explanation: Algorithmic Choices for Scalable String Comparison**

Efficient string comparison at this scale hinges on selecting an appropriate algorithm and leveraging data structures that facilitate rapid search and retrieval.  Three primary approaches stand out, each with its own trade-offs:

* **Hashing:**  This technique maps strings to numerical hash values.  If two strings are identical, their hash values will be identical (with a vanishingly small probability of collision with well-chosen hash functions).  Comparing hash values is significantly faster than comparing strings directly.  This is advantageous when the goal is to detect duplicates or identify strings that are present multiple times within the array. The efficiency is heavily dependent on the quality of the hash function to minimize collisions.  Poor hash functions can lead to significant performance degradation and incorrect results.

* **Trie Data Structure:** A Trie (prefix tree) is exceptionally well-suited for prefix-based searches. If the comparison involves identifying strings sharing common prefixes or substrings, a Trie offers significant performance gains compared to hashing.  Building the Trie upfront requires a single pass through the array, but subsequent searches are highly efficient.

* **Sorting:**  Sorting the array lexicographically, followed by linear scanning, is effective when the goal is to identify identical strings or strings ordered in a particular sequence.  Efficient sorting algorithms such as merge sort or quicksort (with appropriate pivot selection to handle strings effectively) offer O(n log n) complexity, significantly better than O(n²) but potentially slower than hashing for simple duplicate detection.  The subsequent linear scan for comparison has a time complexity of O(n).

The optimal choice depends on the specific requirements of the comparison:  finding duplicates, identifying similar strings (e.g., based on edit distance), or prefix-based matching.  For a large array of 11 million strings, the pre-processing step of building a Trie or sorting the array may still be time-consuming, but this cost is amortized over numerous comparison operations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate hashing, Trie-based comparison, and sorting techniques in Python.  Note that these examples are simplified for clarity; optimization in a production environment might require more sophisticated techniques such as memory mapping and parallel processing.

**Example 1: Hashing for Duplicate Detection**

```python
import hashlib

def find_duplicates_hashing(strings):
    """Finds duplicate strings using hashing."""
    hashes = {}
    duplicates = set()
    for string in strings:
        h = hashlib.sha256(string.encode()).hexdigest() #Using SHA256 for robustness
        if h in hashes:
            duplicates.add(string)
        else:
            hashes[h] = string
    return list(duplicates)

# Example usage (replace with your 11 million string array)
strings = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]
duplicates = find_duplicates_hashing(strings)
print(f"Duplicate strings: {duplicates}")
```

This example utilizes SHA256 hashing for robust collision resistance.  The `hexdigest()` method converts the hash to a hexadecimal string for easy storage and comparison.  The choice of the hash function is critical for performance; simpler hash functions might lead to more collisions, requiring more complex collision resolution mechanisms.

**Example 2: Trie for Prefix Matching**

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def starts_with(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True


# Example Usage
trie = Trie()
strings = ["apple", "app", "banana", "bat"]
for string in strings:
    trie.insert(string)

print(f"Strings starting with 'ap': {[s for s in strings if trie.starts_with(s[:2])] }")

```

This example demonstrates a basic Trie implementation.  For a dataset of 11 million strings, a more optimized Trie implementation, potentially leveraging memory-mapped files for efficient storage, would be necessary.


**Example 3: Sorting for Identical String Detection**

```python
def find_duplicates_sorting(strings):
    """Finds duplicate strings using sorting."""
    sorted_strings = sorted(strings)
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(1, len(sorted_strings)):
        if sorted_strings[i] == sorted_strings[i-1]:
            duplicates.append(sorted_strings[i])
    return duplicates

#Example Usage
strings = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]
duplicates = find_duplicates_sorting(strings)
print(f"Duplicate strings: {duplicates}")
```

This code uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which utilizes Timsort, a highly efficient hybrid sorting algorithm.  For datasets of this size, careful consideration of memory usage is paramount; strategies such as external sorting might be required if the data exceeds available RAM.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting textbooks on algorithms and data structures, specifically focusing on chapters dealing with string algorithms, hashing techniques, and advanced data structures like Tries.  Furthermore, exploring research papers on large-scale data processing and string matching will provide valuable insights into optimized solutions for extremely large datasets.  Finally, studying the source code of highly optimized string processing libraries will offer practical examples of efficient implementations.  Understanding the trade-offs between different approaches and their computational complexities is crucial for effective selection.
