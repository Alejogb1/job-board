The optimal number of CUDA kernel blocks isn't a fixed calculation; it's an optimization problem dependent on several factors, including hardware capabilities, the nature of the kernel, and data size.  My experience optimizing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations highlighted this repeatedly. Simply aiming for maximum occupancy, while a common starting point, often leads to suboptimal performance.  Effective block sizing requires careful consideration of both thread-level parallelism and memory access patterns.  Ignoring the latter often results in significant performance bottlenecks due to memory bandwidth limitations.

**1.  Understanding the Interplay of Threads, Blocks, and Grids**

A CUDA kernel executes as a grid of blocks, each block containing a number of threads.  The total number of threads is dictated by the problem size, while the number of blocks and threads per block influence performance.  The CUDA runtime handles the distribution of blocks across the available multiprocessors (SMs) on the GPU.  Each SM can execute multiple blocks concurrently, up to a limit imposed by its hardware constraints.  Crucially, the occupancy – the fraction of SM resources utilized – directly impacts performance. Low occupancy means idle resources, while excessively high occupancy can lead to register spilling and increased latency.

To determine the optimal number of blocks, one must understand the interplay between these components.  Factors like shared memory usage, register pressure, and the kernel's memory access patterns significantly affect the overall performance. Over-subscription of shared memory or registers can lead to performance degradation even with high occupancy.

**2.  Calculating the Minimum and Maximum Blocks**

There's no single formula to calculate the *ideal* number of blocks. Instead, we typically work with a range, defined by a minimum and a maximum. The minimum is determined by the total number of threads required, while the maximum is constrained by the GPU's capabilities.  My early work often overlooked this crucial distinction, leading to inefficient kernel launches.

* **Minimum Blocks:** This is determined by dividing the total number of threads required by the maximum number of threads per block.  This ensures that all the work is covered.  It's frequently a starting point for iterative optimization.

* **Maximum Blocks:** This is constrained by the GPU's capacity to handle concurrent blocks.  While this is hardware-dependent, documentation provides limits on the maximum number of blocks per multiprocessor and the maximum grid dimension. Exceeding these limits will result in runtime errors.  Practical experience shows that staying significantly below the maximum often avoids unexpected behavior.

**3.  Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to block sizing.  These demonstrate how to determine and manage block and grid dimensions within a CUDA kernel launch.  Note that error handling, crucial in production code, is omitted for brevity.

**Example 1: Simple Block Calculation Based on Problem Size**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    // Perform computation on data[i]
  }
}

int main() {
  int N = 1024 * 1024; // Problem size
  int threadsPerBlock = 256; // Experimentally determined
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock; // Ceiling division

  myKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(data_d, N); // Kernel launch
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic calculation of blocks based on the problem size and a predefined threads-per-block value. The ceiling division ensures all elements are processed.  The choice of `threadsPerBlock` (256 in this case) often requires experimentation to find an optimal value based on the kernel's complexity and the target GPU architecture.  This approach is suitable for simple kernels where memory access patterns are straightforward.

**Example 2: Incorporating Shared Memory**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *data, int N) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256]; // Shared memory usage

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[threadIdx.x] = data[i]; // Load data into shared memory
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block
    // Perform computation using sharedData
    __syncthreads();
    data[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x]; // Store results back to global memory
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Similar to Example 1, but using sharedMemoryKernel)
}
```

This example showcases the use of shared memory, which can significantly improve performance by reducing global memory accesses.  The size of the shared memory array (`sharedData`) should be carefully chosen based on the available shared memory per block and the kernel's data requirements.  Note the crucial `__syncthreads()` calls; these ensure data consistency within a block before and after using shared memory.  The block size here would likely be chosen to effectively utilize the shared memory capacity.

**Example 3: Dynamic Block Sizing Based on Occupancy**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>

int main() {
  // ... (Problem size and other parameters)

  int maxThreadsPerBlock; //Obtain from cudaGetDeviceProperties
  int maxBlocksPerMultiProcessor; //Obtain from cudaGetDeviceProperties

  //Iterative approach to find good occupancy:
  int bestThreadsPerBlock = 256; //Start with a common value
  int blocksPerGrid;
  float occupancy;

  //Iterate through reasonable thread block sizes, calculating occupancy and choosing the highest
    // ... code to calculate occupancy based on threadsPerBlock, kernel attributes, and device properties ...
    // ... updates bestThreadsPerBlock based on highest occupancy ...

  blocksPerGrid = (N + bestThreadsPerBlock - 1) / bestThreadsPerBlock;

  myKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, bestThreadsPerBlock>>>(data_d, N); // Kernel launch

  return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates a more sophisticated approach, iterating through possible block sizes to find the one maximizing occupancy. This involves obtaining relevant GPU properties using `cudaGetDeviceProperties()` and calculating occupancy based on these properties, the chosen block size, and the kernel's register usage.  This approach requires more complex code but can result in significantly improved performance for complex kernels or large datasets. My work frequently involved such iterative optimization to achieve optimal performance.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and the NVIDIA documentation for your specific GPU architecture.  Understanding the specifics of your target hardware is vital for efficient kernel optimization.  Profiling tools are indispensable for analyzing kernel performance and identifying bottlenecks.  Experimentation and iterative refinement remain key elements in the process.  Thorough understanding of memory access patterns, and the effects of shared memory usage is equally important.
