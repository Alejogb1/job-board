The challenge with directly installing PyTorch and its complex ecosystem using `setup.py`'s `install_requires` lies in the intricate nature of PyTorch's dependency tree and its distribution variability across platforms and hardware acceleration support. `install_requires`, designed for simpler packages, often falls short when dealing with such nuanced installations. Based on my experience managing Python package dependencies in high-performance computing environments, attempting to define PyTorch and its supporting packages through `install_requires` usually results in an unstable setup, or at least requires significant manual configuration and maintenance effort.

The fundamental issue is that PyTorch relies on a matrix of dependencies, including CUDA, cuDNN, specific versions of NumPy, and potentially other libraries that differ based on whether a user requires CPU-only or GPU-accelerated computation. `install_requires` in `setup.py` lacks the necessary expressiveness to accommodate such conditional dependencies. Moreover, PyTorch distributions often come pre-compiled for specific CUDA versions and operating systems, making it impractical to pin specific wheel files or source packages via `install_requires`, which typically relies on PyPI. The installation process usually necessitates the use of the PyTorch website or, more commonly, conda package management system to resolve the correct dependency tree effectively. Trying to force this through pip and `setup.py` can become unwieldy.

Instead of directly installing PyTorch and its complete set of dependencies via `install_requires`, a better approach is to use `install_requires` for packages that are stable across environments and leave the burden of setting up PyTorch dependencies to the user. This involves clearly documenting the installation procedure required for PyTorch (e.g., through the PyTorch website), and then listing in `install_requires` only those dependencies of *your* package which do not conflict with potential PyTorch dependencies, such as smaller, self-contained utility libraries or well-established and stable numerical packages like `scipy`. This avoids over-constraining the environment and allows the user to have greater control over the specific PyTorch configuration. Your package would then leverage a system environment that contains a pre-existing PyTorch installation.

This approach also mitigates the problem of dependency conflicts that would likely arise when attempting to specify potentially conflicting versions in `install_requires`. For instance, different versions of `numpy` or `typing-extensions` might be required for PyTorch versus other packages your project relies on. `install_requires` provides no built-in means of resolving these kinds of conflicts, and doing so manually within `setup.py` would quickly escalate into complex and brittle logic. This approach is best left to package managers like `conda` or `venv` when using `pip`.

Now let's illustrate how one might approach this with code examples. Imagine a package, `my_ml_tools`, that relies on PyTorch for some of its functionality.

**Example 1: Minimal `setup.py` with PyTorch dependency documentation**

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my_ml_tools",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
      "scipy",
      "requests",
      "tqdm"
     ],
    description="A collection of ML tools that use PyTorch.",
    long_description=(
        "This package provides tools for machine learning, leveraging "
        "PyTorch for its core functionalities. Please ensure PyTorch is "
        "installed separately according to the instructions at the "
        "PyTorch official website."
    ),
    python_requires=">=3.8"
)
```

In this setup, instead of including PyTorch and its potentially problematic dependencies, I focus on including dependencies specific to the package, `scipy`, `requests`, and `tqdm`. The `long_description` field contains the crucial information: a warning that the user must install PyTorch separately. This keeps `setup.py` relatively concise and removes the dependency conflicts.

**Example 2: Using environment variables and `try-except`**

In some situations, it may be desirable to provide a fallback for scenarios where PyTorch is not installed. This can be handled with cautious usage of `try-except` blocks and potentially checking for environment variables.

```python
import os
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

def check_pytorch_availability():
    try:
        import torch
        return True
    except ImportError:
        return False

install_requires_list = [
      "scipy",
      "requests",
      "tqdm"
     ]

if check_pytorch_availability():
  print("PyTorch detected in environment, proceeding normally")
else:
  print("PyTorch not detected, this package will have reduced functionality.")
  install_requires_list.append("numpy") # minimal numpy support
  # Potentially implement functionality that does not rely on PyTorch

setup(
    name="my_ml_tools",
    version="0.2.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=install_requires_list,
    description="A collection of ML tools, with optional PyTorch support.",
    long_description=(
        "This package provides tools for machine learning, optionally "
        "leveraging PyTorch. Please ensure PyTorch is installed separately "
        "for full functionality. A minimal numpy version is included for basic use."
    ),
    python_requires=">=3.8"
)
```

Here, before constructing the dependency list, a check is performed to see if PyTorch can be imported successfully. If it can, the import succeeds and the user does not need to have `numpy` additionally installed through `install_requires`. If not, the package still installs but with reduced functionality (and includes `numpy`). The message in `long_description` is updated to reflect the optional nature of PyTorch support. While `check_pytorch_availability` adds some complexity, it helps to provide a more resilient package. The conditional import of the torch package relies on the fact that most PyTorch distributions are pre-installed and available in the Python system path.

**Example 3: Using optional dependency flags in `setup.py`**

A more sophisticated way to handle dependencies in `setup.py` is to use 'extras', which are useful for optional dependencies. However, it still does not resolve the main problem of installing PyTorch itself, but rather gives fine-grained control.

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my_ml_tools",
    version="0.3.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "scipy",
        "requests",
        "tqdm"
    ],
    extras_require={
        "pytorch": [], # This still wont install PyTorch by itself
        "full": [
            "matplotlib", # some full dependencies
            "seaborn",
            "pandas"
        ]
    },
    description="ML tools with PyTorch and optional features.",
    long_description=(
        "This package provides tools for machine learning, leveraging PyTorch "
        "for some core functionality.  Please ensure PyTorch is installed separately "
        "when needing that functionality.  Full optional functionality requires additional packages."
    ),
    python_requires=">=3.8"
)
```

In this example, I define "pytorch" as an extra, which will not install PyTorch but can be leveraged if, in other parts of the code, there is logic to import and test PyTorch, or include parts of the code that would only be executed when the environment has PyTorch installed. I also added a 'full' extra. To install with full functionality: `pip install my_ml_tools[full]`. To use the Pytorch capabilities, the user must independently install PyTorch and then the basic version of `my_ml_tools`. While "extras" helps with optional features of a package, it is *not* a mechanism for installing PyTorch itself.

In summary, the challenge of installing PyTorch through `setup.py` is not that it is impossible, but that it is impractical and brittle to handle with `install_requires`. The best practices focus on decoupling PyTorch from `setup.py` dependencies and leveraging more sophisticated solutions (package managers and environment management) for handling its intricacies.

For additional learning, I would suggest exploring the following resources:

1.  The official PyTorch website's installation instructions.
2.  The setuptools documentation, focusing on extras and dependency management.
3.  Documentation for the `conda` package manager, especially its handling of package dependencies and environments.
4.  The Python Packaging User Guide, for best practices on managing Python dependencies.
5.  The documentation of your particular operating system's package management tools.
