The inherent sparsity of weight matrices in the final layer of a neural network, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional output spaces or overparameterized models, can significantly impact computational efficiency and generalization performance.  My experience optimizing large-scale recommendation systems revealed a critical need to directly control this sparsity, moving beyond simple regularization techniques.  The key is to understand that enforcing zero weights isn't simply about pruning after training; it requires integrating the constraint directly into the training process.  This is achievable through several architectural modifications and training strategies.

**1. Explanation: Constraining Weight Generation**

Directly limiting the number of zero weights in the final Keras layer necessitates a deviation from standard weight initialization and optimization approaches.  Standard weight initializations, such as Glorot uniform or Xavier, produce dense weight matrices, offering no direct control over the zero-weight count.  Therefore, we need to influence the weight generation and update process.  This can be effectively achieved using custom weight initialization functions, combined with carefully chosen regularization and optimization algorithms.  My work on a large-scale collaborative filtering model demonstrated the efficacy of this approach.  The goal is not necessarily to eliminate *all* zero weights, but rather to actively manage the sparsity level, striking a balance between model complexity and performance.  Excessive sparsity can lead to underfitting, while dense matrices can increase computational cost and overfitting.  The optimal sparsity level is often dependent on the dataset and the model's architecture.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different methods to introduce and manage weight sparsity during training.  Each focuses on a specific technique within the Keras framework, assuming a sequential model for simplicity.

**Example 1: Custom Weight Initialization with a Sparsity Parameter**

This example demonstrates a custom weight initializer that generates a sparse weight matrix with a controllable sparsity level.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def sparse_initializer(shape, dtype=tf.float32, sparsity=0.8):
    """Initializes a weight matrix with a specified sparsity level."""
    num_non_zero = int((1 - sparsity) * np.prod(shape))
    indices = np.random.choice(np.prod(shape), num_non_zero, replace=False)
    values = np.random.normal(size=num_non_zero)
    sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=[np.unravel_index(i, shape) for i in indices],
                                          values=values, dense_shape=shape)
    return tf.sparse.to_dense(sparse_tensor)

# Model definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... previous layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(10, kernel_initializer=sparse_initializer, sparsity=0.7)
])

# Compile and train the model
# ...
```

This code defines a custom initializer `sparse_initializer` which creates a sparse matrix by randomly selecting a fraction of weights to be non-zero. The `sparsity` parameter controls the proportion of zero weights. Note that this approach initializes the weights sparsely; the subsequent training process might alter the sparsity level.  This method is beneficial in initialising a model with a desired sparse structure, potentially reducing training time for very large models.

**Example 2:  L1 Regularization with Gradient Clipping**

L1 regularization encourages sparsity by adding a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights.  However, simply adding L1 might lead to instability.  Gradient clipping helps mitigate this by limiting the magnitude of gradients during backpropagation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... previous layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(10, kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l1(0.01))
])

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) # Gradient clipping

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, `keras.regularizers.l1(0.01)` applies L1 regularization to the final layer's weights. The `clipnorm` parameter in the Adam optimizer limits the gradient norm to 1.0, preventing excessively large updates that might destabilize training and hinder the emergence of zero weights. The strength of L1 regularization (0.01 in this case) needs careful tuning.


**Example 3:  Mask-based Weight Pruning during Training**

This approach involves dynamically creating a mask that sets certain weights to zero during training.  This mask is updated iteratively based on a criterion, such as the magnitude of the weights.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class SparseDense(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, sparsity_target, **kwargs):
        super(SparseDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.sparsity_target = sparsity_target
        self.w = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                 initializer='glorot_uniform',
                                 trainable=True)
        super(SparseDense, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        #Pruning Logic.  Replace with a more sophisticated method if needed.
        mask = tf.math.greater(tf.abs(self.w), tf.math.percentile(tf.abs(self.w), 100*(1-self.sparsity_target)))
        masked_weights = tf.where(mask, self.w, tf.zeros_like(self.w))
        return tf.matmul(inputs, masked_weights)


# Model definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... previous layers ...
    SparseDense(10, sparsity_target=0.8)
])

# Compile and train the model
# ...
```

This example introduces a custom layer `SparseDense` that incorporates a pruning mechanism within the forward pass.  The `sparsity_target` parameter sets the desired sparsity level. This specific example uses a simple percentile-based pruning; more sophisticated methods, such as those based on weight sensitivity or magnitude, can be implemented. This dynamic approach allows the network to adapt its sparsity throughout the training process.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting research papers on sparse neural networks, focusing on weight pruning techniques, L1 regularization, and advanced optimization algorithms designed for sparse models.  Explore texts on deep learning that cover regularization methods in detail.  Study the Keras documentation for custom layer and custom initializer implementations. Examine publications on efficient training strategies for sparse models, paying attention to memory management and computational optimization.  Finally, thorough examination of different regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning is crucial for effective implementation.
