The MNIST dataset, a cornerstone for introductory machine learning, requires careful handling within the Keras framework to ensure data integrity and optimal model training. Having spent considerable time refining workflows for image recognition tasks, I've found there are several nuances that beginners often overlook, going beyond simply invoking the `mnist.load_data()` function. I'll outline a reliable process incorporating data inspection, preprocessing, and the importance of maintaining consistent data formats throughout the pipeline.

Fundamentally, the MNIST dataset is not immediately usable in its raw, downloaded state. It's provided as a collection of unsigned 8-bit integers representing grayscale pixel intensities, ranging from 0 to 255, arranged into 28x28 images. Moreover, it’s partitioned into training and testing sets, each with corresponding labels. The crucial initial step lies in understanding this format and how to reshape it appropriately for network input and label encoding. Keras facilitates this process through dedicated functions, but mindful implementation is necessary.

The initial step using Keras involves loading the data, which is straightforward, but then further manipulations are almost always required for compatibility with machine learning algorithms. The `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()` function returns a tuple consisting of training images, training labels, testing images, and testing labels, respectively. Direct examination of the shapes and data types of these tensors reveals the need for rescaling the pixel values and potentially one-hot encoding of labels.

For instance, let’s begin with a basic code example to examine the structure:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

print("Training images shape:", train_images.shape)
print("Training labels shape:", train_labels.shape)
print("Testing images shape:", test_images.shape)
print("Testing labels shape:", test_labels.shape)

print("Training images data type:", train_images.dtype)
print("Training labels data type:", train_labels.dtype)
```

This preliminary step reveals that the image data is shaped as (60000, 28, 28) for the training set and (10000, 28, 28) for testing; the labels have shapes (60000,) and (10000,). These are 3D arrays for images, where the first dimension represents the number of samples, and 1D arrays for labels. Additionally, the data types are `uint8` for images and `uint8` for labels, confirming they are unsigned integers.

Before the data can be fed into a neural network, two crucial preprocessing steps are typically applied. Firstly, the image pixel values, which are integers between 0 and 255, need to be normalized to a floating-point range. Dividing by 255.0 accomplishes this, mapping the values to the interval [0, 1]. This normalization is essential for stable gradient-based optimization as it prevents excessively large or small gradients. Secondly, most neural network architectures require the input to have a specific shape, often a 4D tensor including a channel dimension (height, width, channel, batch_size). Since MNIST images are grayscale they will have one channel, so a channel dimension of size one must be added.

Next, let's explore a code example that normalizes and reshapes the images:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]
train_images = train_images.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
test_images = test_images.astype(np.float32) / 255.0

# Reshape the images to include a channel dimension of 1
train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, axis=-1)
test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, axis=-1)


print("Training images shape after normalization:", train_images.shape)
print("Training images data type after normalization:", train_images.dtype)
```
Here, we explicitly converted the pixel values to floating-point using `.astype(np.float32)` before normalization. Then `np.expand_dims(train_images, axis=-1)` reshapes the array to have shape (60000, 28, 28, 1) for the training set. The same transformation is done to the test images. This demonstrates both a practical necessity for neural network input shapes and a critical understanding of data types for numerical operations.

Furthermore, the label data, which currently represents classes as integers from 0 to 9, should be converted into a one-hot encoded format if a classification algorithm based on a softmax activation is to be used. This transformation maps each integer to a vector where only the element corresponding to the class is 1 and the rest are 0. Keras' `tf.keras.utils.to_categorical` method readily facilitates this. The one-hot encoded labels then serve as target vectors during training. Using one-hot encoded labels also tends to produce better results for classification tasks, as these labels are more representative of categorical values.

Now, consider this complete example which includes one-hot encoding:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]
train_images = train_images.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
test_images = test_images.astype(np.float32) / 255.0

# Reshape the images to include a channel dimension of 1
train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, axis=-1)
test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, axis=-1)

# Perform one-hot encoding on the labels
num_classes = 10
train_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels, num_classes)
test_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(test_labels, num_classes)

print("Training labels shape after one-hot encoding:", train_labels.shape)
print("Training labels data type after one-hot encoding:", train_labels.dtype)
```

After this stage the training data shape is (60000, 28, 28, 1) and the training label shape is (60000, 10). The test data and labels are similarly processed. The labels have also undergone the data type changes, now being of type `float32` by virtue of the `to_categorical` function. Each numerical label is now represented as a 10-element vector.

These transformations are crucial for several reasons. First, neural networks typically work best with floating-point inputs. Normalizing the pixel values ensures the network doesn't encounter excessively large values, which can hinder learning. Second, the one-hot encoded labels ensure that categorical targets are properly represented in a numerical format that the network can use for calculating a loss. Finally, the explicit dimension added for the channel is critical for convolutional layers, which are common choices for image data processing.

In essence, while loading the data using `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()` is the initial step, preprocessing, normalization and reshaping are mandatory to utilize the MNIST dataset effectively with Keras-based machine learning models. Neglecting these steps could lead to poor model performance or unexpected errors during training. Careful inspection of data shapes and types throughout the pipeline is a key practice.

For a deeper understanding of data loading, manipulation and preprocessing, I would recommend exploring resources such as the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on data loading and input pipelines, and the Keras API documentation relating to image preprocessing. For specific methods of neural network design, literature and courses on Convolutional Neural Networks is valuable. The documentation provided by NumPy provides a useful guide for array manipulation, and the documentation provided by SciPy contains several resources relating to scientific computing and data science.
