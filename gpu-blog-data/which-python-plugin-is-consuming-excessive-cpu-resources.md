Identifying the specific Python plugin consuming excessive CPU in a multithreaded application requires a systematic approach, combining code instrumentation and operating system-level monitoring. I've encountered this scenario multiple times during performance tuning for large-scale data processing pipelines, where seemingly innocuous plugins would occasionally bottleneck entire workflows. It's rarely as straightforward as a single culprit; often, the issue involves a combination of factors like inefficient algorithms within the plugin and suboptimal interaction with Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

A clear explanation starts with the understanding that Python’s multithreading doesn’t offer true parallelism for CPU-bound operations due to the GIL. While multiple threads can be active and switch execution contexts, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at any given time within a single process. Thus, if a plugin executes intensive computations directly in Python, threading alone will likely not improve CPU utilization. Furthermore, some plugins might make extensive use of native libraries, which release the GIL during their execution, offering potential for concurrent execution. However, poorly implemented calls to these libraries or excessive overhead in managing GIL-released regions can negate any gains.

To determine which plugin is causing CPU spikes, I typically begin by collecting granular performance data. This involves profiling the entire application and then focusing on the specific areas with high resource consumption. I utilize Python’s built-in `cProfile` module for this purpose in conjunction with techniques that allow me to attribute CPU usage to plugins.

First, I would modify the application's main execution flow to include calls to the profiler within a context manager, enabling the profiler only during plugin execution. A basic implementation might look like this:

```python
import cProfile
import pstats
import time
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# A simple abstract base class for plugins
class BasePlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, data):
       pass

# Fictional plugins for demonstration
class PluginA(BasePlugin):
    def execute(self, data):
        time.sleep(0.01)  # Mimic some CPU bound work
        return data * 2

class PluginB(BasePlugin):
    def execute(self, data):
        res = 0
        for i in range(10000):
            res += i
        return data + res

class PluginC(BasePlugin):
    def execute(self, data):
       import numpy as np
       matrix_size = 100
       matrix = np.random.rand(matrix_size, matrix_size)
       result_matrix = np.dot(matrix, matrix)
       return result_matrix.sum()

# Mimic multithreaded execution
import threading

class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = [PluginA(), PluginB(), PluginC()]

    def execute_with_profiling(self, plugin, data, filename="profile.prof"):
        with cProfile.Profile() as profiler:
             result = plugin.execute(data)

        stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
        stats.dump_stats(filename)
        return result

    def run_in_threads(self, data):
        threads = []
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            thread = threading.Thread(target=self._run_plugin, args=(plugin, data))
            threads.append(thread)
            thread.start()

        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()

    def _run_plugin(self, plugin, data):
        # Profile each plugin execution
        _ = self.execute_with_profiling(plugin, data, filename=f"{plugin.__class__.__name__}.prof")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    manager = PluginManager()
    manager.run_in_threads(100)

    print("Profiling data collected. Analyze '.prof' files.")

```

In this snippet, I've created a `PluginManager` that orchestrates the execution of multiple plugins in separate threads. The `execute_with_profiling` method uses `cProfile` to generate profiling data for each plugin, storing it in separate files named after the plugin class. This ensures no intermingling of profiling results.  Post-execution, I can analyze the `.prof` files using `pstats` to identify which plugins consumed the most time. `PluginA` is designed to be relatively lightweight, `PluginB` more CPU bound in Python code and `PluginC` uses numpy which will release the GIL. I would then use `pstats` after execution to assess these differences.

After analyzing individual plugin profiles, I would use an operating system tool like `htop` or `top` to understand global CPU usage. If a particular plugin appears to use a disproportionate amount of CPU, even when it’s not actively profiled, it indicates that the GIL may not be the primary issue. This is where deeper analysis into native libraries' CPU usage, thread scheduling issues, or contention between threads becomes relevant. I would then move to operating system level inspection of the processes and threads involved.

Second, focusing on inter-thread dependencies and data sharing becomes imperative.  I might utilize Python's `threading` module along with tools that can analyze lock contention to uncover bottlenecks caused by shared resources.  For example, let's introduce a scenario where plugins interact with a shared data structure:

```python
import threading
import time
import random
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class SharedData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def update_data(self, value):
      with self.lock:
        self.data += value
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.0001,0.001)) # Simulate some processing time with contention

    def get_data(self):
      with self.lock:
        return self.data

# A simple abstract base class for plugins
class BasePlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, data, shared_data):
       pass

class PluginD(BasePlugin):
    def execute(self, data, shared_data):
        for _ in range(1000):
            shared_data.update_data(data)
        return shared_data.get_data()

class PluginE(BasePlugin):
    def execute(self, data, shared_data):
         for _ in range(1000):
            shared_data.update_data(data)
         return shared_data.get_data()

class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = [PluginD(), PluginE()]
        self.shared_data = SharedData()

    def run_in_threads(self, data):
        threads = []
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            thread = threading.Thread(target=self._run_plugin, args=(plugin, data, self.shared_data))
            threads.append(thread)
            thread.start()

        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()

    def _run_plugin(self, plugin, data, shared_data):
       _ = plugin.execute(data, shared_data)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    manager = PluginManager()
    manager.run_in_threads(5)
    print(f"Final Shared data {manager.shared_data.get_data()}")

```

In this example, `SharedData` encapsulates a shared resource protected by a `threading.Lock`. Both `PluginD` and `PluginE` modify this shared data.  While each plugin might not have a computationally intensive `execute` method, the lock contention becomes the bottleneck.  Without proper analysis, it is challenging to attribute the excessive CPU usage simply to either plugin. Instead, the lock contention and time spent waiting would show up as time spent within the lock acquisition within `cProfile` or other profilers. In a scenario like this, moving to asynchronous I/O or a multiprocessing solution instead of threading may be beneficial.

Finally, the impact of external resources cannot be understated. If a plugin relies heavily on I/O or makes numerous calls to external services or databases, these might manifest as CPU spikes when the application is waiting for responses.  To effectively gauge this, I've found it useful to use Python's `asyncio` library to simulate I/O latency within test cases before deployment. Consider this fictional example:

```python
import asyncio
import time
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class ExternalServiceSimulator:
    async def fetch_data(self, id, delay=0.1):
      await asyncio.sleep(delay)
      return f"Data for id: {id}"

class BasePlugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, data):
       pass

class PluginF(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(self):
        self.service = ExternalServiceSimulator()

    async def execute(self, data):
       tasks = [self.service.fetch_data(i) for i in range(10)]
       results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
       return results

class PluginG(BasePlugin):
     def __init__(self):
        self.service = ExternalServiceSimulator()

     async def execute(self, data):
       results = []
       for i in range(10):
           result = await self.service.fetch_data(i, delay=0.5) # Artificially increase latency here
           results.append(result)
       return results


async def main():
    plugin_f = PluginF()
    plugin_g = PluginG()
    start_time = time.time()
    results_f = await plugin_f.execute(10)
    end_time_f = time.time()
    print(f"Plugin F took: {end_time_f - start_time}s")

    start_time = time.time()
    results_g = await plugin_g.execute(10)
    end_time_g = time.time()
    print(f"Plugin G took: {end_time_g - start_time}s")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, `PluginF` and `PluginG` both simulate interactions with an external service.  `PluginF` uses `asyncio.gather` to concurrently make requests.  `PluginG` processes the requests serially. When these plugins are used concurrently in a multithreaded program, the additional latency caused by `PluginG` is often less obvious during profiling. This example shows that even when I/O is the bottleneck, how the plugin is implemented greatly affects the execution time of the thread, and hence the potential CPU usage due to the thread waiting.

In summary, identifying the specific plugin responsible for excessive CPU usage in a multithreaded Python application requires methodical profiling with `cProfile`, analysis of shared resources and lock contention, and examination of external I/O operations.  Understanding the inherent limitations of the GIL in Python threading is essential for accurately pinpointing the true performance bottleneck. For further study of Python profiling and threading I would recommend consulting the official Python documentation, as well as resources on concurrent programming and operating systems.
