TensorFlow 1.2.1's tensor assignment differs significantly from later versions, primarily due to the absence of eager execution.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for working with legacy code or models built on this specific version.  My experience porting several large-scale image recognition systems from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x highlighted the nuances of this assignment mechanism.  The core principle revolves around the concept of computational graphs and `tf.placeholder` objects.  Tensors weren't directly assigned values; instead, they were defined as placeholders for data fed during session execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

In TensorFlow 1.2.1, tensors are not assigned values directly as in typical programming languages.  Instead, you define a computational graph, specifying operations on symbolic tensors. These symbolic tensors represent variables or placeholders for data that will be fed into the graph later.  The actual assignment of numerical values happens during the execution phase, using a `tf.Session` object.  This approach contrasts sharply with TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution, where tensors are evaluated immediately.  The key components are:

* **`tf.placeholder`:** This is the primary mechanism for creating symbolic tensors representing input data.  You specify the data type and shape.  The actual value is provided later during the session's `feed_dict`.

* **`tf.Variable`:** This creates a tensor that can be modified during the session's execution.  Unlike placeholders, variables need to be explicitly initialized.

* **`tf.Session`:** This object executes the computational graph. It takes the placeholders' values (supplied through `feed_dict`) and performs the defined operations.  The results are then tensors that can be accessed.

* **`feed_dict`:** A dictionary that maps `tf.placeholder` objects to their corresponding numerical values.  This is crucial for providing input data to the computational graph during execution.

The lack of direct tensor assignment necessitates a more structured approach, where the data flow is explicitly defined through the graph structure. This can initially seem less intuitive but provides significant advantages for large-scale computation and optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Addition with Placeholders:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define placeholders
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)

# Define the operation
c = a + b

# Create a session
sess = tf.Session()

# Execute the graph, feeding values to placeholders
result = sess.run(c, feed_dict={a: 2.0, b: 3.0})

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

sess.close()
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental principle.  `a` and `b` are placeholders, not tensors with assigned values.  Their values are only provided during the `sess.run()` call via `feed_dict`.  The addition operation is defined symbolically; the actual addition takes place during execution.


**Example 2: Variable Assignment and Update:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable
x = tf.Variable(0.0, name="my_variable")

# Define an operation to update the variable
update_op = tf.assign(x, x + 1.0)

# Initialize the variable
init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# Create a session
sess = tf.Session()

# Initialize the variables
sess.run(init_op)

# Update the variable multiple times
for _ in range(5):
    sess.run(update_op)

# Retrieve the final value
final_value = sess.run(x)

# Print the final value
print(final_value)  # Output: 5.0

sess.close()
```

This example shows how to use `tf.Variable`.  `x` is initialized to 0.0 and updated iteratively using `tf.assign`.  The `tf.global_variables_initializer()` is essential for initializing variables before the session starts executing operations.


**Example 3: Placeholder with Defined Shape:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder with a specific shape
input_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 3])  # Batch size unspecified, 3 features

# Define a simple operation (e.g., matrix multiplication)
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([3, 2]))  # 3 input features, 2 output features
output = tf.matmul(input_tensor, weights)

# ... (Rest of the model and session execution) ...

#Example feed_dict
feed_dict_example = {input_tensor: [[1.0,2.0,3.0],[4.0,5.0,6.0]]}

# Initialize variables and run session with example data
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init)
    result = sess.run(output, feed_dict=feed_dict_example)
    print(result)


```

This illustrates creating a placeholder with a defined shape.  `shape=[None, 3]` indicates that the batch size is flexible (None), but each data point has three features. This is a common pattern for handling variable-sized input data, particularly in machine learning applications where the batch size during training might vary.  The example also shows a more realistic scenario involving `tf.Variable` for weights and `tf.matmul` for a linear transformation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation (specifically the sections on computational graphs, placeholders, variables, and sessions).  Furthermore, I found studying examples from the TensorFlow Models repository (for TensorFlow 1.x) invaluable.  Reviewing materials on symbolic computation and graph-based programming will strengthen your understanding of this paradigm.  Finally, exploring tutorials and examples focused on TensorFlow 1.x's `tf.Session` API is recommended.  Working through practical exercises is key to mastering this specific assignment mechanism.
