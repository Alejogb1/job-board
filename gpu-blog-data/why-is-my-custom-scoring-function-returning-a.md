The unexpected return of a TensorFlow tensor instead of a scalar value from a custom scoring function, often encountered within training loops or evaluation pipelines, typically stems from a failure to explicitly execute the tensor operation. I've observed this repeatedly when defining custom metrics or callbacks that involve TensorFlow operations, and it's a subtle but crucial distinction to understand for correct model behaviour.

The core issue is that TensorFlow operations, by design, are not immediately computed when defined. Instead, they construct a computational graph. When you create operations like `tf.reduce_mean`, `tf.square`, or any other TensorFlow function, these don't return a numerical result directly. They return a tensor, a symbolic representation of that operation. Therefore, simply defining a function that computes a score using such TensorFlow operations will, when called, output the un-evaluated tensor and not the computed value itself.

To bridge this gap, TensorFlow requires explicit execution to derive the numerical output from the defined tensor. This execution can occur through various mechanisms, most notably with the `numpy()` method when eager execution is enabled, or within a `tf.Session` context if eager execution is disabled (prior to TensorFlow 2.0). This distinction is critical because without the correct evaluation step, the downstream processing, which expects a numerical score, will receive a tensor and not produce valid results or potentially trigger type errors.

The discrepancy in function output can go unnoticed, particularly when running inside a training loop as the code often proceeds without throwing visible errors initially. The issue becomes more apparent during evaluation or when analysing training progress.

Here's a code example illustrating this common mistake:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def incorrect_scoring_function(y_true, y_pred):
    """Incorrectly returns a Tensor, not a scalar."""
    squared_error = tf.square(y_true - y_pred)
    mean_squared_error = tf.reduce_mean(squared_error)
    return mean_squared_error # This is a tensor, not a scalar

# Example usage (this will output a tensor)
y_true_example = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred_example = tf.constant([1.1, 1.9, 3.2])
score_tensor = incorrect_scoring_function(y_true_example, y_pred_example)
print(f"Incorrect Scoring Function Output: {score_tensor}")
```

In the above `incorrect_scoring_function`, the `mean_squared_error` variable holds a TensorFlow tensor. When the function returns this, you get a representation of the underlying computation rather than the actual numerical mean squared error. The print statement will output the tensor object, not a float.

To rectify this, we need to execute the tensor evaluation to get the actual numeric score. With eager execution enabled (the default for TensorFlow 2.0 and later), we can use the `.numpy()` method:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def correct_scoring_function_eager(y_true, y_pred):
    """Correct function using .numpy() for eager execution."""
    squared_error = tf.square(y_true - y_pred)
    mean_squared_error = tf.reduce_mean(squared_error)
    return mean_squared_error.numpy() # Execute to get scalar with .numpy()


# Example usage (this will output a scalar)
y_true_example = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred_example = tf.constant([1.1, 1.9, 3.2])
score_scalar = correct_scoring_function_eager(y_true_example, y_pred_example)
print(f"Correct Scoring Function (Eager) Output: {score_scalar}")
```

The `correct_scoring_function_eager` now returns a scalar float. The addition of `.numpy()` triggers the tensor's computation and converts it into a NumPy numerical value. Itâ€™s important to note the context: `.numpy()` is only applicable if eager execution is enabled.

In cases where eager execution is disabled (as was common in TensorFlow 1.x), explicit evaluation requires a `tf.Session`. Here is an illustration:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() # Disables eager execution for demonstration

def correct_scoring_function_session(y_true, y_pred):
    """Correct function using tf.Session() with eager execution disabled."""
    squared_error = tf.square(y_true - y_pred)
    mean_squared_error = tf.reduce_mean(squared_error)
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as session:
      return session.run(mean_squared_error) # Execute with Session


# Example usage (this will output a scalar, requires session)
y_true_example = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred_example = tf.constant([1.1, 1.9, 3.2])
score_scalar_session = correct_scoring_function_session(y_true_example, y_pred_example)
print(f"Correct Scoring Function (Session) Output: {score_scalar_session}")

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution() # Re-enables eager execution
```

In `correct_scoring_function_session`, the computation is executed using a TensorFlow Session.  `session.run(mean_squared_error)` will execute the operations that lead to `mean_squared_error` and then return its value as a NumPy array. If only single scalar value is returned by operations within session, the result is extracted as a scalar number.

When using the Session approach, you would typically construct a single Session for the entire training/evaluation process instead of creating one inside the scoring function. This is for efficiency. The example creates a new Session just for this function for clarity in showing the concept. Note also that `tf.compat.v1` was used for enabling/disabling eager execution which is deprecated now. This is for demonstration purposes only.

In summary, the critical understanding is that when working with TensorFlow, operations return symbolic tensors, not immediately computed numbers. To get the actual values, you must explicitly execute the tensor, either with `.numpy()` if eager execution is enabled or through a `tf.Session` if it is disabled. Failure to do so will result in a function that returns a tensor object, not the numerical score required.

For further exploration, I'd recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the guides on eager execution and the differences between eager execution and graph execution. Consulting resources covering custom metric implementation and callback creation within the TensorFlow API will also provide insights. The TensorFlow tutorials on understanding graphs and sessions also provide foundational knowledge, although the explicit use of session is mostly legacy now. These resources contain the most up to date guidance and implementation details.
