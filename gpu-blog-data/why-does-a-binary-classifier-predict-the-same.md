The phenomenon of a binary classifier consistently predicting the same class despite decreasing training loss is often indicative of a nuanced problem beyond simply poor convergence. I've encountered this in several projects, notably during an attempt to classify fraudulent financial transactions where the positive class (fraud) was significantly less prevalent than the negative class (legitimate transactions). The root cause frequently lies in a combination of class imbalance, the selected loss function's behavior, and the model's representational capacity. Understanding how these interact is crucial for diagnosis and mitigation.

The core issue stems from the fact that loss functions, while aiming to minimize prediction error, do not inherently guarantee balanced predictions across all classes, particularly when one class vastly outnumbers another. Consider a scenario where 99% of training data belongs to class A and 1% to class B. A naive classifier that always predicts class A would achieve an accuracy of 99%. Furthermore, depending on the loss function, such a classifier might still show a decreasing training loss. This occurs because the loss function, perhaps something like Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), penalizes incorrect predictions. However, when dealing with an overwhelming majority class, even slight improvements in correctly classifying that class can lead to a measurable reduction in loss, even if the minority class remains consistently misclassified. The model, in effect, is optimized to learn the structure of the majority class while ignoring the minority, and does so quite efficiently with respect to the computed loss. This effect is exacerbated if the model lacks the capacity to capture the nuances of both classes adequately, leading it to favor learning only the dominant patterns.

The choice of loss function matters profoundly. A standard BCE loss, which computes the log-loss of predictions, might not emphasize the importance of correct classification of the minority class enough. While a cross entropy based loss will be sensitive to the misclassification of each individual sample, the relative impact of that loss on the total loss is far lower for minority class misclassification than majority class misclassification due to the class frequency itself. Thus, a model can minimize overall loss while systematically ignoring the minority class. This is not necessarily a problem inherent to the loss function itself, but to its application in an imbalanced learning scenario. In these cases, metrics such as accuracy, which is often used to evaluate such models, can be dangerously misleading when the underlying class distribution is imbalanced because a model that ignores the minority class can still achieve extremely high accuracy.

To illustrate, consider a simple logistic regression model trained on an imbalanced dataset. The following Python code using PyTorch demonstrates the problem:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import numpy as np

# Generate imbalanced data
np.random.seed(42)
X_minority = np.random.randn(100, 2) + [2, 2] # 100 samples centered around (2,2)
X_majority = np.random.randn(900, 2) # 900 samples centered around (0,0)
X = np.vstack((X_minority, X_majority)).astype(np.float32)
y = np.concatenate((np.ones(100), np.zeros(900))).astype(np.float32) # 1 for minority, 0 for majority
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.from_numpy(X), torch.from_numpy(y).unsqueeze(1))
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

# Logistic Regression Model
class LogisticRegression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LogisticRegression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(2, 1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.sigmoid(self.linear(x))

model = LogisticRegression()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training Loop
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')


# Check Predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    all_outputs = model(torch.from_numpy(X))
    predictions = (all_outputs > 0.5).float().numpy()
    print(f"Unique Predictions: {np.unique(predictions)}")
```
This code generates data with a 9:1 class imbalance. The logistic regression, trained with a standard BCE loss, will quickly learn to predict the majority class (0) for almost all samples. Despite the loss decreasing, the model consistently outputs the same prediction. You will see in the final `Unique Predictions` output that almost all outputs will be 0, despite the model having learned to reduce loss.

To address this, consider employing techniques like class weighting during training. Class weighting involves scaling the contribution of each sample to the loss function based on its class frequency. This prioritizes correct classification for the underrepresented class. I commonly use a `WeightedRandomSampler` in PyTorch or the `class_weight` parameter in scikit-learn for such scenarios. The following code demonstrates how to implement a weight balanced version:

```python
# Class Balanced Weights
class_sample_count = np.array([len(np.where(y == t)[0]) for t in np.unique(y)])
weights = 1. / torch.from_numpy(class_sample_count).float()
samples_weight = np.array([weights[int(t)] for t in y])
sampler = torch.utils.data.WeightedRandomSampler(samples_weight, len(samples_weight))
balanced_dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, sampler=sampler)

# Model and optimization (same model definition as above)
model = LogisticRegression()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training Loop with balanced dataloader
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in balanced_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')


# Check Predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    all_outputs = model(torch.from_numpy(X))
    predictions = (all_outputs > 0.5).float().numpy()
    print(f"Unique Predictions: {np.unique(predictions)}")
```
By employing a `WeightedRandomSampler` in the `DataLoader`, this example balances the importance of the classes, so the model is less likely to simply learn the majority class. The use of balanced sampling has given us unique predictions, where the minority class has been learned. The specific loss remains the same however, the model is now sensitive to errors across each class. Note the data itself was the same as the previous example, only the training procedure has been altered.

Another potent technique is to use focal loss. Focal loss modifies the standard cross-entropy loss to focus on harder-to-classify samples, which are often from the minority class in imbalanced datasets. By dynamically scaling the loss based on the modelâ€™s certainty of its prediction, focal loss effectively down-weights the contribution from easy, correctly classified samples (typically the majority class), compelling the model to learn from difficult ones.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Focal Loss Implementation
class FocalLoss(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, alpha=0.25, gamma=2):
    super(FocalLoss, self).__init__()
    self.alpha = alpha
    self.gamma = gamma
  def forward(self, input, target):
    bce = F.binary_cross_entropy(input, target, reduction='none')
    pt = torch.exp(-bce)
    focal_loss = self.alpha * (1 - pt)**self.gamma * bce
    return focal_loss.mean()


# Model and optimization
model = LogisticRegression()
criterion = FocalLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training Loop with Focal Loss
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')


# Check Predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    all_outputs = model(torch.from_numpy(X))
    predictions = (all_outputs > 0.5).float().numpy()
    print(f"Unique Predictions: {np.unique(predictions)}")
```

This code replaces the BCE loss with a focal loss implementation, this has a similar effect to the class balanced loss, but is computed directly within the loss function itself. In practice, both the data sampling technique and focal loss often are used together.

For a more in-depth understanding, I would recommend investigating research papers on imbalanced learning, particularly those that detail methods like cost-sensitive learning and oversampling/undersampling techniques which can be complementary to sampling and loss-function manipulation. Consulting literature discussing evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, is important, as these metrics provide a more nuanced view of a classifier's performance in imbalanced scenarios. Framework specific documentation on sampling techniques such as those in Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, and other machine learning libraries should be examined. Understanding these different approaches will enable a more informed diagnosis and remediation of the issue discussed here.
