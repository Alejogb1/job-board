The creation of an application-scoped Ninject kernel within a lambda, subsequently used by Ninject Web.Common's `UseNinjectMiddleware`, presents an unconventional, but not inherently problematic, approach contingent upon the precise implementation and its implications within a larger application architecture. I've encountered this pattern in legacy codebases during several large application migrations and have observed its successes and potential pitfalls.

The primary objective of Ninject Web.Common is to manage the lifecycle of a Ninject kernel within the context of an ASP.NET Core application's request pipeline. This commonly involves creating a single, static kernel instance and utilizing `UseNinjectMiddleware` to ensure that Ninject's dependency injection services are available to the application's controllers and other dependencies within the web request scope. However, generating the kernel dynamically within a lambda changes the scope of kernel initialization. Rather than relying on a static, globally accessible instance, each call to the lambda would, technically, produce a new kernel and, consequently, a new dependency injection container.

This deviates from the established practice and the expected behavior of a singleton kernel. While Ninjectâ€™s dependency management is robust, repeatedly instantiating kernels can introduce unexpected side effects. These include performance issues due to frequent object creation and potential inconsistencies in dependency resolution, depending on the lifecycle management strategy implemented within the kernel's configuration. Critically, each request might, in effect, have its own container rather than sharing a single application-wide one, effectively undermining the purpose of Ninject as a singular dependency injection framework managing the application.

Here's the conventional method for kernel setup, demonstrating the singleton pattern, which I've used in the majority of projects:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Ninject;
using Ninject.Web.Common;

public class Startup
{
    private static IKernel Kernel { get; } = new StandardKernel();

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add other services if needed.
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        Kernel.Bind<IService>().To<ServiceImpl>().InSingletonScope(); // Example binding.
        app.UseNinjectMiddleware(() => Kernel);
        //Other application pipeline configuration.
    }
}

public interface IService {}
public class ServiceImpl : IService {}

```
In this typical setup, the `Kernel` is instantiated statically within the `Startup` class. The `Configure` method utilizes `UseNinjectMiddleware`, providing it with a function that returns the static instance of the Kernel. This ensures that the single kernel is consistently available for request handling throughout the application's lifetime. All dependency bindings are defined against that single container.

However, let's examine an example illustrating the lambda-based approach described in the original question:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Ninject;
using Ninject.Web.Common;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add other services if needed.
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseNinjectMiddleware(() => {
          var kernel = new StandardKernel();
          kernel.Bind<IService>().To<ServiceImpl>().InSingletonScope(); // Example binding.
          return kernel;
          });
        //Other application pipeline configuration.
    }
}

public interface IService {}
public class ServiceImpl : IService {}
```

Here, a new kernel is created *each* time `UseNinjectMiddleware` is invoked during the application's startup sequence, not each request; this is because the `Func<IKernel>` supplied to the method is only used during middleware setup. While less egregious than a new kernel per request, it is still an atypical setup. The kernel created here, though intended to be the application's dependency injection container, is not guaranteed to be the same kernel used throughout the application's lifecycle. The lifecycle of that initial container may be undefined. A critical point is that bindings are effectively applied multiple times during application startup, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior, and potentially resulting in memory leaks if those containers and related objects are not correctly collected by the Garbage Collector. I've encountered situations where such a configuration led to inconsistent dependency resolutions across different application components during debugging, a truly frustrating scenario to resolve.

Let's consider a slightly more refined example involving modules, in what would be a more realistic scenario I have seen, but is still flawed:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Ninject;
using Ninject.Modules;
using Ninject.Web.Common;

public class Startup
{
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      // Add other services if needed.
  }

  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
      app.UseNinjectMiddleware(() =>
      {
          var kernel = new StandardKernel(new MyModule());
          return kernel;
      });
      //Other application pipeline configuration.
  }
}

public class MyModule : NinjectModule
{
    public override void Load()
    {
        Bind<IService>().To<ServiceImpl>().InSingletonScope(); // Example binding.
    }
}
public interface IService { }
public class ServiceImpl : IService { }
```
In this example, the lambda now initializes the kernel with a module, but the fundamental problem remains. While using modules is a good practice for structuring dependencies, the kernel instantiation within the lambda still means a new kernel, and new bindings, will be created during the startup sequence of the application.

While `UseNinjectMiddleware` doesn't technically preclude using a lambda to generate the kernel, doing so circumvents the central intent of dependency injection frameworks. The core principle of dependency injection is to maintain consistent, application-wide access to dependencies through a single, managed container. Using a lambda, especially one that instantiates a new kernel, introduces uncertainty and potential performance drawbacks related to repeated initialization.

Furthermore, using a lambda without proper handling of the kernel lifecycle introduces a risk of memory leaks if those kernels created during application startup are not disposed of correctly. Because the kernel is a resource that holds onto object instances throughout the lifetime of the application, relying on transient kernel instances risks a resource leak.

For resource recommendations, I would suggest thoroughly reviewing the official Ninject documentation, which provides comprehensive guidance on kernel management and best practices for integrating Ninject with ASP.NET Core applications. Exploring community resources like blog posts and sample projects can provide practical insights. Furthermore, delving into articles discussing the principles of dependency injection and Inversion of Control can offer a theoretical framework for understanding why the singleton kernel pattern is generally preferred. Examination of different design patterns for dependency injection, particularly Singleton, is strongly recommended.
