CUDA runtime error codes represent a nuanced system for classifying failures within the CUDA execution model.  Their variability stems from the multifaceted nature of GPU computation, encompassing device-specific hardware limitations, driver interactions, and the diverse ways applications can misuse the CUDA API.  My experience troubleshooting high-performance computing applications across diverse architectures, including Tesla K80s and A100s, has highlighted the critical importance of understanding these distinctions.  A superficial interpretation of error codes can lead to hours of wasted debugging.  A thorough understanding of the underlying causes, however, allows for more effective diagnostics and rapid resolution.

**1. A Clear Explanation of CUDA Runtime Error Code Variation:**

CUDA runtime errors originate from different stages of the CUDA execution pipeline.  The primary source of differentiation lies in *where* the error occurs.  A failure during memory allocation will produce a different code than a failure during kernel launch or data transfer.  Furthermore, the specific nature of the failure within that stage adds another layer of granularity.  For example, a memory allocation failure could result from insufficient free memory on the device, an improperly sized allocation request exceeding device limits, or a permission error stemming from driver-level restrictions.  This combinatorial effect leads to a large number of distinct error codes, each pointing to a specific problem within a particular context.

The CUDA runtime library maps these internal error conditions to a set of publicly accessible error codes. While the numerical values may differ between CUDA versions, the general categories and their semantic meanings remain consistent across major releases.  This system allows developers to analyze error codes programmatically and tailor their debugging strategies accordingly.  Simply put, the diversity in codes directly reflects the complexity and numerous potential failure points within the CUDA programming model.

Another key factor influencing the variation in error codes is the interaction between the CUDA runtime and other software components.  Driver bugs, operating system limitations, and even hardware defects can all trigger CUDA runtime errors.  These external factors are often reflected in the error codes, providing hints regarding the root cause outside of the immediate application code.  Successfully debugging CUDA applications necessitates a holistic approach, considering the entire software and hardware stack involved.

Finally, the granularity of error reporting varies depending on the level of detail provided by the CUDA driver and the application's error handling mechanisms.  A poorly implemented error-handling routine might mask finer-grained error information, leading to less specific error codes.  Conversely, a robust approach can provide more detailed error messages, aiding the debugging process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Memory Allocation Failure:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB allocation

    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void **)&devPtr, size);

    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << " (" << err << ")" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ... further CUDA operations ...

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

This example attempts to allocate 1GB of device memory.  If the allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), `cudaMalloc` will return a non-`cudaSuccess` error code.  The `cudaGetErrorString` function retrieves a human-readable description of the error, enhancing debugging.  Different error codes, such as `cudaErrorMemoryAllocation` or `cudaErrorOutOfMemory`, would indicate different reasons for allocation failure.  Note that large allocations can be subject to fragmentation, even if sufficient total memory exists.

**Example 2: Kernel Launch Failure:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
  // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(int);
    cudaMalloc((void **)&devPtr, size);

    // Incorrect grid and block dimensions can lead to failure.
    dim3 gridDim(1024, 1024); //Potentially too large for the device
    dim3 blockDim(256);
    cudaError_t err = cudaLaunchKernel(myKernel, gridDim, blockDim, 0, 0, devPtr);


    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error during kernel launch: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << " (" << err << ")" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates a kernel launch.  Errors here can arise from improper grid or block dimensions exceeding device limits, insufficient shared memory, or register spilling, leading to distinct error codes.  The specific error code will pinpoint the exact reason for the launch failure.  For instance, `cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration` might indicate a mismatch between kernel parameters and device capabilities.

**Example 3:  Peer-to-Peer Memory Access Failure:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int *devPtr1, *devPtr2;
    size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(int);

    int device1 = 0;
    int device2 = 1;  //Assuming a multi-GPU system

    cudaMalloc((void **)&devPtr1, size);
    cudaMalloc((void **)&devPtr2, size);


    cudaError_t err = cudaMemcpyPeer(devPtr2, device2, devPtr1, device1, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error during peer-to-peer memory copy: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << " (" << err << ")" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ... further operations ...

    cudaFree(devPtr1);
    cudaFree(devPtr2);
    return 0;
}
```

This example highlights peer-to-peer memory access between two GPUs (devices 0 and 1).  Failures here can stem from lack of peer-to-peer capability between devices, insufficient permissions, or incorrect memory access patterns.  The resulting error code would inform the developer about the exact nature of the failure, such as `cudaErrorPeerAccessAlreadyEnabled` or `cudaErrorPeerAccessUnsupported`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections detailing runtime API functions and error codes, is invaluable.  The CUDA programming guide provides comprehensive information on best practices and potential pitfalls.  Understanding the CUDA architecture and its limitations, through dedicated reading material, is crucial for efficient debugging. Finally, meticulously examining the output of the `nvidia-smi` command-line utility helps diagnose hardware-related issues.
