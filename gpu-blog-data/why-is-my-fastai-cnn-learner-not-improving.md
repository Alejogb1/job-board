The absence of improvement in a fastai CNN learner, despite adequate training, frequently stems from issues within the data pipeline or hyperparameter selection, rather than a fundamental flaw in the model architecture itself. I’ve encountered this issue repeatedly during my time developing image classification systems, and the solution is often a careful, methodical review of each stage of the training process.

Let's begin with data. It's easy to assume your data is 'good,' but real-world image datasets frequently contain subtle, pervasive issues that severely hamper training. Noise is the primary culprit. This can manifest as incorrect labels, low-resolution images, or images with severe artifacts that a human would struggle to classify, let alone a CNN. Before any attempt at hyperparameter tuning, a thorough data review is critical. It's not enough to verify the directory structure and filename conventions; one must visualize a large number of samples from each class. This involves a random sampling approach—not simply the first few files in the directory. Use the `show_batch()` method from fastai to verify that the image augmentation applied is reasonable for the type of data you are working with. If you’re using pre-labeled data, cross-reference a substantial sample with a second, independent source if possible, as human error during labeling is remarkably common, even when using well-established annotation tools. Mislabeling within even a small percentage of the dataset can significantly reduce the learner's ability to converge on a useful set of feature representations.

Another common problem resides in inappropriate data loading practices. The size and resolution of your images are crucial. If your image resolution is significantly smaller than the resolution used to train the pretrained model, that pretrained model might not contribute much. If your images are of very diverse resolutions, it's essential to ensure they're resized to consistent dimensions through the data loader. While fastai's `ImageDataLoaders` class typically performs resizing for you, the exact parameters of this resizing process can make or break a model's ability to learn. Verify that your `item_tfms` and `batch_tfms` are compatible with your dataset. For example, using aggressive rotations with images that are not rotationally invariant will result in the model seeing the same objects as different categories, causing significant confusion. If your dataset consists of very small objects in the images, it's beneficial to explicitly use `RandomResizedCrop` to zoom in on portions of the image during training, in effect performing image augmentation on top of standard resizing. Similarly, excessive use of color jitter may cause the model to focus too much on color artifacts that don't convey meaningful information.

Once the data is validated, the focus shifts to the training process itself. The most immediate issue to investigate is your choice of learning rate. Learning rate selection is a fine art; if it is too high, training may diverge. If it is too low, training will be incredibly slow or stall completely. Fastai's `lr_find()` method is indispensable for determining a reasonable starting value for the maximum learning rate in the one-cycle policy. However, `lr_find()` is a heuristic. You must inspect the loss vs. learning rate plot it produces to understand how your learning rate should be selected. The learning rate selection should be approximately one magnitude smaller than where the loss function is minimized. It’s not enough to pick the minimum point if you observe that loss rapidly diverges after it. If the loss plot does not present the standard ‘hockey stick’ shape, with the loss decreasing sharply with an increase in learning rate, the model has likely already diverged prior to calling `lr_find()`. Consider the number of epochs you’ve chosen for training. In the early stages of your project, it’s sometimes useful to train for longer than is necessary, just to verify that loss eventually stops decreasing. If the loss stops improving well before your stated number of epochs, you can likely reduce the training time without any reduction in accuracy. Consider if you’ve started with too little data, in which case, more epochs may not actually result in improved accuracy. The model may overfit, meaning it’s memorizing the training set, rather than learning to generalize.

Here are some concrete examples, based on common scenarios I’ve encountered, with accompanying commentary:

**Example 1: Incorrect Image Resizing**

Here’s a situation where insufficient image resizing can cause a model not to learn. Assume a dataset composed of images of varying dimensions.

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Assume `path` points to a directory with image subdirectories
path = Path('./image_dataset')

# Incorrect dataloaders (no specific item transform for resizing)
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=None) 

# Trainer
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)

# Training the model for the first time
learn.fit_one_cycle(10)

# This model likely won't converge well because no specific resizing was done.
```

In this example, the `item_tfms=None` parameter results in no specific resizing of the images. Fastai will still attempt to resize images to match the model architecture by simply stretching them, however, this is not a recommended approach. The solution is to specify image resizing.

```python
# Correct dataloaders (with specific image resizing item transform)
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=Resize(224))
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)
learn.fit_one_cycle(10) # This model will likely train much more effectively
```

Here, by using `Resize(224)` as our `item_tfms`, all the images are resized to 224x224 pixels prior to being used in training. This eliminates the potential for inconsistent image sizes to interfere with the training process.

**Example 2: Poor Learning Rate**

Here’s a situation where the choice of learning rate is critical.

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

path = Path('./image_dataset')
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=Resize(224))
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)

# Incorrect Learning Rate -- Manually set LR without using lr_find()
learn.fit_one_cycle(10, lr_max=1e-1)
# Model likely diverges due to very large initial learning rate
```

Here, the initial learning rate is set far too large without consulting the `lr_find` method. This will often result in the model diverging, leading to very poor results, or the model will simply not train correctly. 

```python
# Correct Learning Rate Selection using lr_find() method
lr_min, lr_steep = learn.lr_find()
learn.fit_one_cycle(10, lr_max=lr_steep)
# Model will likely train much more effectively.
```

By using the `lr_find()` method, and inspecting the resulting graph, we can obtain an appropriate learning rate by picking the learning rate where the loss begins to sharply decline.

**Example 3: Issues with Data Augmentation**

Consider the following scenario involving augmentation for images that are not rotationally invariant.

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

path = Path('./image_dataset')

# Incorrectly applying random rotations to non-rotational invariant data
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=Resize(224), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)
learn.fit_one_cycle(10)
# This model may not train well because augmentation causes confusion
```

Here, we apply random rotations without consideration as to whether the images are invariant to these transformations. The `aug_transforms` function automatically includes rotations by default.

```python
# Correct augmentation for non-rotationally invariant images
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=Resize(224), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75, flip_vert=True, max_rotate=0))
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)
learn.fit_one_cycle(10)
# This model will likely train much more effectively.
```

By explicitly setting `max_rotate=0` we prevent rotations during training, which is appropriate when data is not rotationally invariant. Here we explicitly chose to keep the vertical flip as a viable augmentation.

In summary, diagnosing a stalled fastai CNN learner requires a systematic approach. Start by inspecting your data thoroughly, both visually and programmatically, to identify common issues with labels, resolution, and consistency. Then, use fastai's tooling to find an appropriate initial learning rate and carefully review your batch transforms to verify they are appropriate for your data. Remember that even small errors in these areas can lead to significant degradation in model performance.

For resource recommendations, I suggest consulting the official fastai documentation, specifically the sections on data loading, training techniques, and fine-tuning pretrained models. The fastai forum is another good source to investigate, but be sure to exhaustively test the suggestions given above before requesting outside assistance. A general textbook on deep learning concepts would also aid in the theoretical understanding of these issues. Finally, experiment by changing one factor at a time to understand the impact of the changes on the model.
