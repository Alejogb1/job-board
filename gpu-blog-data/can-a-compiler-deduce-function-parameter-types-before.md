Function parameter type deduction prior to compilation, specifically within the realm of statically-typed languages, is a complex interplay between compiler design, language specification, and the nature of the code itself. Fundamentally, no, a compiler cannot universally deduce *every* function parameter type without some level of explicit declaration or inference mechanism defined by the language. The degree to which it can perform such deduction varies significantly between languages, and even within a language, based on the specific context. My experience developing embedded systems firmware, particularly in C++, has provided firsthand exposure to these limitations and capabilities.

The core issue revolves around static type checking, a cornerstone of compiled languages such as C, C++, and Java. During compilation, the compiler needs to know the exact data types of variables and function parameters to allocate memory correctly, perform type-safe operations, and optimize the generated machine code. If all parameter types were completely unknown until runtime, this would be impossible. Therefore, compilers rely on type information provided either directly by the programmer (explicit declaration) or through a set of defined rules (type inference).

Explicit parameter type declarations are the simplest approach. A function definition like `int add(int a, int b)` in C++ directly states that the `add` function expects two integer parameters. The compiler can immediately verify the types used in any subsequent call to `add` and flag errors if a call attempts to pass a float or a string, for example. The compiler does not *deduce* anything here; it simply verifies that the provided types conform to the declaration.

Type inference, on the other hand, is where the compiler exhibits a form of parameter deduction. Languages like modern C++ with its `auto` keyword, or languages with Hindley-Milner type systems like Haskell, can infer types based on the context where a variable or parameter is used. Consider templates in C++. I worked on a hardware interface library where I extensively used templates to handle various sensor data types. Templates don't specify concrete types; instead, they allow parameterized types. The compiler generates specialized code instances when the template is instantiated with concrete types, deducing those types from the usage context. For function templates, the compiler attempts to infer template argument types from the function arguments.

Here is a C++ code example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 10;
  std::cout << add(x, y) << std::endl; // T is deduced as int

  double z = 3.14;
  double w = 2.71;
  std::cout << add(z, w) << std::endl; // T is deduced as double

  // Error: Ambiguous template argument deduction - types are not the same
  // std::cout << add(x, z) << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the template function `add` doesn't explicitly declare the type, T. When `add(x, y)` is called, the compiler infers that `T` must be `int` based on the arguments' types. Similarly, for `add(z, w)`, `T` is inferred to be `double`. This is a form of deduction, but it is limited. The compiler still needs some kind of clue to perform the deduction. If I were to uncomment the call to `add(x, z)`, the compiler would throw an error because it cannot unambiguously deduce a single type for `T`. The deduction only works when all arguments consistently imply the same type.

Another powerful example of inference is found in C++ lambda functions. Lambdas can have parameter types inferred implicitly when they are used in contexts where the expected type is known:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    int sum = 0;
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 
        [&sum](int x){ sum += x;}); // Parameter type `int x` is explicitly declared here

    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;

    int sum2 = 0;
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 
        [&sum2](auto x){ sum2 += x;}); // Parameter type `auto x` is implicitly inferred

    std::cout << "Sum2: " << sum2 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the first `for_each` uses an explicitly typed lambda, while the second uses `auto`. The compiler deduces that the type of the parameter `x` within the lambda must be `int` because the `for_each` algorithm is iterating over a `std::vector<int>`. If the vector was of type `double`, the lambda parameter `x` would be deduced as `double`. While `auto` provides convenient type inference, it's essential to remember that the compiler is not operating on "magic." It leverages the surrounding context to determine the type, not randomly guessing.

For languages with advanced type systems, such as Haskell, the deduction process can be more sophisticated. Here's a conceptual Haskell example, without executable code:

```haskell
-- Conceptual Haskell Example (not strictly executable within this format)
add_list :: Num a => [a] -> a
add_list [] = 0  -- Base case for an empty list of type 'a'
add_list (x:xs) = x + add_list xs -- 'x' and 'add_list xs' must conform to 'a'

-- Usage example:
-- add_list [1, 2, 3]  -- type 'a' inferred as Int
-- add_list [1.1, 2.2, 3.3] -- type 'a' inferred as Double
```
In this Haskell example, the `add_list` function uses a type variable `a`, which is constrained by `Num a`, meaning the type must be numeric. The compiler infers the specific type of `a` based on the type of the list given during usage. The `[1,2,3]` list implies `a` is `Int`, and `[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]` implies it's a `Double`.  The compiler can perform this intricate type deduction because Haskell's type system has robust rules and constraints that enable it to perform the inference. However, even in Haskell, the compiler is constrained by its type rules, it doesn't deduce types out of thin air.

In summary, compilers do not universally deduce function parameter types before compilation without some mechanism provided by the language itself, like explicit declarations, template instantiation, or type inference through keywords such as auto and type constraints. The extent to which they do so is dictated by the language specifications and design. Type inference, while offering a degree of parameter deduction, is fundamentally bound by the information the compiler can gather from the surrounding code context.

To further investigate this topic, I recommend exploring resources on compiler construction, specifically focusing on static analysis and type systems. Additionally, books on specific languages like "Effective Modern C++" and "Programming in Haskell" provide practical insights into type inference mechanisms. Exploring academic papers on the Hindley-Milner type system will provide deeper knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of type inference. Textbooks on formal language theory also offer context on how compilers parse and process code to ultimately create executable programs, providing a deeper understanding of the challenges and intricacies of type systems within compiled languages.
