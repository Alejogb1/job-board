The absence of a direct runtime mechanism within the CUDA driver API to introspect the `-arch` flag employed during compilation presents a significant challenge.  My experience troubleshooting optimized CUDA kernels across diverse hardware led me to realize that inferring the compute capability, rather than directly querying the compilation flag, is a more reliable and practical approach.  This is because the `-arch` flag dictates the target architecture, which in turn directly maps to the compute capability.  While the compiler uses the `-arch` flag, the runtime operates based on the compute capability of the device.

This approach is necessary because the `-arch` flag itself is a compile-time parameter;  it's not embedded as metadata within the compiled PTX or binary.  Attempting to extract this information from the loaded kernel would require a deep, potentially unsafe, reverse-engineering of the binary, something I strongly advise against due to its fragility and platform dependence.  Focusing on the compute capability instead provides a robust and portable solution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The strategy revolves around leveraging the CUDA runtime API to query the device's properties. Specifically, `cudaGetDeviceProperties()` provides comprehensive information about the GPU, including its compute capability.  This compute capability is a crucial identifier that corresponds to the architectural features supported by the hardware.  Once we obtain the compute capability, we can correlate it with the architecture specified by the `-arch` flag during the compilation process. This correlation isn't explicit; it requires understanding the mapping between compute capability and the `-arch` flag's values (e.g., `compute_75` maps to a specific compute capability).  This mapping is documented in the CUDA Toolkit documentation.  Note that you should handle cases where the device compute capability is not supported by your compiled kernel gracefully.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Compute Capability Retrieval:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int device;
    cudaGetDevice(&device);

    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);

    std::cout << "Device Name: " << prop.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Compute Capability: " << prop.major << "." << prop.minor << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental process of obtaining the compute capability.  It first checks for CUDA devices, selects a device, and then retrieves its properties using `cudaGetDeviceProperties()`. The `major` and `minor` fields within `prop` provide the compute capability.  Error handling is minimal here for brevity but should be significantly expanded in production code.

**Example 2:  Mapping Compute Capability to Architectural String:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string getArchString(int major, int minor) {
    // This mapping needs to be updated as new architectures are released.  Refer to CUDA documentation.
    if (major == 7 && minor == 5) return "compute_75";
    if (major == 8 && minor == 0) return "compute_80";
    // ... Add more mappings as needed ...
    return "Unknown";
}

int main() {
    // ... (Device selection and property retrieval from Example 1) ...

    std::string archString = getArchString(prop.major, prop.minor);
    std::cout << "Inferred Arch String: " << archString << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example extends the previous one by adding a function `getArchString()` to map the numerical compute capability to a string representation that resembles the `-arch` flag.  This function is crucial because it translates the runtime information into a form that can be compared against the expected architecture during development.  Remember to consult the official CUDA documentation for the latest mapping. This example highlights the need for rigorous maintenance as new hardware and compute capabilities are introduced.

**Example 3: Runtime Check and Conditional Execution:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// ... (getArchString function from Example 2) ...

int main() {
    // ... (Device selection and property retrieval from Example 1) ...

    std::string archString = getArchString(prop.major, prop.minor);

    std::string expectedArch = "compute_75"; // Replace with your expected architecture

    if (archString == expectedArch) {
        std::cout << "Running kernel compiled for " << expectedArch << std::endl;
        // Launch your CUDA kernel here.
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Mismatch: Kernel compiled for " << expectedArch << ", but device is " << archString << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example incorporates a conditional execution based on the inferred architecture. It compares the inferred architecture string against the expected architecture used during compilation. This check enables robust runtime adaptation or error handling. This is particularly beneficial when deploying CUDA applications on heterogeneous clusters.  Proper error handling is essential in production to avoid unexpected failures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA Toolkit Documentation: This is the primary source for understanding CUDA programming, including the CUDA runtime API and compute capability details.

CUDA Programming Guide: Provides in-depth guidance on various aspects of CUDA development.

CUDA Best Practices Guide: Offers advice on writing efficient and portable CUDA code.  This is especially relevant when dealing with architecture-specific optimizations.


By focusing on the compute capability and implementing the suggested approaches, you can reliably determine the effective architecture at runtime without resorting to fragile and unsupported techniques.  Remember that this method relies on the consistency between the `-arch` flag used during compilation and the compute capability of the target device.  Thorough testing across different hardware configurations is crucial to ensure robust functionality.  The accuracy of the mapping function (`getArchString`) is paramount for the reliability of this method.
