Unusable tensors in TensorFlow, specifically within the context of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), manifest primarily as `None` values or tensors with inconsistent shapes within the time dimension, causing unpredictable and often catastrophic failures in the computation graph.  My experience debugging large-scale sequence modeling projects has highlighted this issue repeatedly;  the silent failures resulting from malformed tensor inputs to RNN cells are often much harder to trace than explicit errors.  The root cause frequently lies in data preprocessing or batching inconsistencies.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

RNN cells, unlike feedforward networks, process sequences of data sequentially. Each cell receives an input at a specific time step, and its output depends on both this current input and its internal state (hidden state) from the previous time step.  Crucially, the shape and structure of these input tensors across time steps must remain consistent.  A single `None` value or a shape mismatch in a single time step can propagate through the entire sequence, resulting in unpredictable behavior.  This is because the RNN cell relies on the correct dimensionality of its inputs to perform its matrix multiplications and activation functions correctly.  If the expected dimensionality is violated, the computation either fails silently, producing garbage outputs, or throws an exception further down the computation graph, making debugging difficult.

Specifically, the issues arise when:

* **The input sequence length varies unpredictably:** Batching sequences of varying lengths often requires padding or masking.  Incorrect padding or masking leads to tensors with inconsistent shapes.  An RNN cell expecting a shape of `(batch_size, timesteps, features)` will fail if a sequence in the batch is shorter and hence has fewer timesteps.

* **Data preprocessing errors introduce `None` values:** Missing values in your input data, if not handled appropriately, can lead to `None` values in your tensors.  RNN cells cannot handle `None` values directly; they require numerical representations.

* **Incorrect handling of dynamic RNNs:**  When using dynamic RNNs (e.g., `tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn`), ensuring that the input sequence lengths are correctly provided is critical.  Mismatches between the actual sequence lengths and those passed to the function will cause errors.

The consequence of unusable tensors is a corrupted hidden state, leading to incorrect outputs for all subsequent time steps within the affected sequence.  This will manifest as poor model performance, inaccurate predictions, or cryptic errors that are difficult to diagnose.  The error may not appear at the point of the malformed tensor but much later in the computation graph, making debugging time-consuming and frustrating.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect padding: shorter sequence lacks padding
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
padded_sequences = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post', value=0)

cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=10)
# This will lead to an error or incorrect results because of the inconsistent shape across the batch
output, _ = cell(padded_sequences) 
```

This example demonstrates incorrect padding. The second sequence is shorter than the first, resulting in a tensor where the dimensions are not consistent across all sequences in the batch. The RNN cell will either produce erroneous results or throw an error depending on the TensorFlow version and configuration.


**Example 2: Handling `None` values:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input tensor with None value
input_tensor = np.array([[1, 2, None], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=np.float32)

# Attempt to use this tensor directly with an RNN cell
cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=10)
try:
  output, _ = cell(input_tensor)  # This will raise a TypeError
except TypeError as e:
  print(f"Caught expected TypeError: {e}")

# Correct approach: Replace None with a placeholder value (e.g., mean imputation)
mean_value = np.nanmean(input_tensor)
imputed_tensor = np.nan_to_num(input_tensor, nan=mean_value)
output, _ = cell(imputed_tensor) # Now this runs without error.

```

This example showcases the impact of `None` values.  Directly feeding a tensor containing `None` values into an RNN cell will raise a `TypeError`.  The correct approach is to pre-process the data and replace `None` values with a suitable placeholder value.  The example uses mean imputation, but other strategies (e.g., median imputation, or more advanced imputation techniques) are viable, depending on the data's nature and desired behaviour.

**Example 3:  Dynamic RNN with incorrect sequence lengths:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
inputs = tf.random.normal((2, 5, 3)) # Batch size 2, max sequence length 5, 3 features

# Incorrect sequence lengths: one sequence is shorter
sequence_lengths = [3, 5]

cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=10)
try:
    output, state = tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, inputs, sequence_length=sequence_lengths, dtype=tf.float32)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")


# Correct sequence lengths
sequence_lengths_correct = [5,5]  #both sequences have same length

cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=10)
output, state = tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, inputs, sequence_length=sequence_lengths_correct, dtype=tf.float32)


```

This example highlights the importance of correctly specifying sequence lengths when using `tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn`. Providing incorrect sequence lengths can lead to errors, though the specific error will depend on the RNN implementation and TensorFlow version. The corrected version ensures that the lengths correctly reflect the input data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of RNNs, I recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on RNN layers and dynamic RNN implementations.  Furthermore, studying textbooks on deep learning focusing on sequence modeling will provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Finally, exploring research papers on advanced RNN architectures and sequence processing techniques can offer valuable insights into handling complex sequence data and potential solutions for dealing with missing data.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and numerical methods is also crucial for effectively working with tensor operations.
