The conversion of a Darknet model to ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) without utilizing CUDA is indeed possible, although it introduces performance considerations. The primary challenge stems from CUDA's role as a highly optimized parallel computing platform for GPUs, often the target hardware for Darknet training. When converting to ONNX, which is designed for interoperability across diverse hardware, the absence of CUDA necessitates that the model's operations be translated into a form executable on CPUs or other accelerators lacking native CUDA support. This process involves careful manipulation of the model's computational graph.

Typically, Darknet models, characterized by their configuration files (`.cfg`) and weight files (`.weights`), are heavily reliant on CUDA libraries during training. The operations implemented within these layers, such as convolutional layers and batch normalization, are often optimized with CUDA kernels for rapid parallel execution on Nvidia GPUs. ONNX, on the other hand, is a hardware-agnostic representation. Conversion tools like those found within the PyTorch ecosystem (which has direct support for ONNX export) or dedicated converters must deconstruct the CUDA-optimized operations and reconstruct them using their equivalent CPU-executable forms.

The conversion itself involves parsing the Darknet configuration file to reconstruct the network’s architecture within the target framework, then loading the pre-trained weights from the corresponding `.weights` file. This process then culminates in the export of the newly constructed model to the ONNX format. Since the ONNX format is framework and hardware independent, it is not inherently tied to CUDA. The crucial distinction occurs during the *execution* of the ONNX model. If the backend executing the ONNX model uses CUDA, then it will benefit from CUDA acceleration. But when run on a CPU, the execution will proceed without it. In my experience, this process has involved utilizing several distinct strategies depending on the framework utilized for the conversion, especially regarding how batch normalization is handled.

I've directly converted Darknet models to ONNX in scenarios where CUDA hardware wasn't available for inference. This typically involved a workflow using PyTorch, as PyTorch provides excellent support for constructing neural network models from scratch and exporting them to ONNX. While using frameworks other than PyTorch is also possible, PyTorch has streamlined this significantly. The steps usually involve the following: 1) Create a PyTorch neural network equivalent to the Darknet model’s architecture, 2) Transfer the weights from the Darknet weights file to the corresponding layer in the newly created network, 3) Export the PyTorch model into ONNX format using `torch.onnx.export`.

Here's a simplified Python code example to illustrate a basic conversion process:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx
import numpy as np

class SimpleDarknetModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleDarknetModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu1(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        return x

def convert_to_onnx(model, input_size, output_path):
    model.eval() # set the model to inference mode

    dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, input_size[0], input_size[1], requires_grad=False)
    torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, output_path,
                      export_params=True,  # Store trained parameter weights
                      opset_version=10,    # Target ONNX opset version
                      do_constant_folding=True, # Optimize network by pre-computing constant parts
                      input_names = ['input'],
                      output_names = ['output'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
  model = SimpleDarknetModel()

  # The following lines simulate loading weights
  # In a real scenario, load the weights from the Darknet weights file.
  conv_weights = np.random.rand(16, 3, 3, 3).astype(np.float32)
  bn_gamma = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
  bn_beta = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
  bn_mean = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
  bn_var = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)

  model.conv1.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(conv_weights)
  model.bn1.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_gamma)
  model.bn1.bias.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_beta)
  model.bn1.running_mean.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_mean)
  model.bn1.running_var.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_var)

  input_size = (256, 256)
  output_path = "simple_model.onnx"
  convert_to_onnx(model, input_size, output_path)
```

In this example, I define a very rudimentary Darknet-like model in PyTorch. I intentionally skipped loading weights from a real darknet file, as that's a more involved process. The key is that the `convert_to_onnx` function takes this PyTorch model and an example input tensor and uses `torch.onnx.export` to generate the ONNX model. Notably, this entire process utilizes only CPU computation. The resulting `simple_model.onnx` file is independent of CUDA.

A more complex example might include handling batch normalization layers correctly, which can pose challenges during the conversion. Darknet’s batch normalization is sometimes represented differently in other frameworks. PyTorch's batch normalization is represented as learnable parameters and mean and variance which are kept during inference and so must be loaded appropriately. Here’s an example of the batchnorm adjustment. This example assumes the loaded weights for the batch norm layer as an numpy array.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx
import numpy as np

class DarknetBatchnormModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, channels):
      super(DarknetBatchnormModel, self).__init__()
      self.conv = nn.Conv2d(channels, channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
      self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(channels)
      self.relu = nn.ReLU()

  def forward(self, x):
      x = self.relu(self.bn(self.conv(x)))
      return x

def load_bn_weights(model, gamma, beta, mean, var):
    model.bn.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(gamma)
    model.bn.bias.data = torch.from_numpy(beta)
    model.bn.running_mean.data = torch.from_numpy(mean)
    model.bn.running_var.data = torch.from_numpy(var)

def convert_to_onnx_bn(model, input_size, output_path):
  model.eval()
  dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size[0], input_size[1], input_size[2], requires_grad=False)
  torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, output_path,
                    export_params=True,
                    opset_version=10,
                    do_constant_folding=True,
                    input_names = ['input'],
                    output_names = ['output'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
  channels = 3
  model = DarknetBatchnormModel(channels)
  # Simulated loading of weights:
  gamma = np.random.rand(channels).astype(np.float32)
  beta = np.random.rand(channels).astype(np.float32)
  mean = np.random.rand(channels).astype(np.float32)
  var = np.random.rand(channels).astype(np.float32)

  load_bn_weights(model, gamma, beta, mean, var)

  input_size = (channels, 256, 256)
  output_path = "bn_model.onnx"
  convert_to_onnx_bn(model, input_size, output_path)
```

Here, the key is the `load_bn_weights` function and its careful loading of the pre-trained batch normalization parameters. The process for export via the `convert_to_onnx_bn` function is fundamentally the same as before. This ensures that the ONNX model contains all of the original model's learned characteristics.

Finally, a more production-oriented scenario might require more sophisticated model building and loading. I had to work with custom layers and custom Darknet layer parsers within PyTorch previously, where there weren’t standard modules available. This requires an understanding of how Darknet layers are constructed, but the core conversion process remains the same. The weights loading process, however, is modified as well. This final code illustrates a structure where custom modules are created and the weights loading is generalized:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx
import numpy as np

class CustomConv(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0):
        super(CustomConv, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.conv(x)

class CustomDarknetModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels):
        super(CustomDarknetModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = CustomConv(in_channels, 16, 3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = CustomConv(16, 32, 3, padding = 1)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.relu1(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
      x = self.conv2(x)
      return x

def load_custom_weights(model, conv_weights, bn_gamma, bn_beta, bn_mean, bn_var, conv2_weights):
    model.conv1.conv.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(conv_weights)
    model.bn1.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_gamma)
    model.bn1.bias.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_beta)
    model.bn1.running_mean.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_mean)
    model.bn1.running_var.data = torch.from_numpy(bn_var)
    model.conv2.conv.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(conv2_weights)


def convert_to_onnx_custom(model, input_size, output_path):
  model.eval()
  dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size[0], input_size[1], input_size[2], requires_grad=False)
  torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, output_path,
                      export_params=True,
                      opset_version=10,
                      do_constant_folding=True,
                      input_names = ['input'],
                      output_names = ['output'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    in_channels = 3
    model = CustomDarknetModel(in_channels)

    #Simulated Weights
    conv_weights = np.random.rand(16, in_channels, 3, 3).astype(np.float32)
    bn_gamma = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
    bn_beta = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
    bn_mean = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
    bn_var = np.random.rand(16).astype(np.float32)
    conv2_weights = np.random.rand(32, 16, 3, 3).astype(np.float32)

    load_custom_weights(model, conv_weights, bn_gamma, bn_beta, bn_mean, bn_var, conv2_weights)

    input_size = (in_channels, 256, 256)
    output_path = "custom_model.onnx"
    convert_to_onnx_custom(model, input_size, output_path)
```

Here, we see how I’ve generalized the weight loading and how more custom modules can be incorporated into the network. It reflects the kinds of scenarios that appear more regularly in practice.

For further exploration and a more in-depth understanding of these conversions, I recommend studying the documentation provided by the ONNX project itself. The official PyTorch documentation is also essential for understanding how to export models to ONNX using the `torch.onnx.export` function. Additionally, resources explaining general neural network concepts and architecture design will provide a strong foundation for converting models between various frameworks. I found that reviewing research papers detailing how different types of neural network layers are implemented can be invaluable when encountering unusual network structures or formats.
