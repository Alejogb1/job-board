The efficacy of standard cross-entropy loss is often undermined by class imbalances within datasets. Weighted cross-entropy provides a direct mechanism to mitigate this, penalizing errors in minority classes more heavily, thus guiding the model towards a more balanced performance. I’ve frequently observed its utility in image segmentation and medical diagnostics where skewed class distributions are commonplace.

The core principle behind weighted cross-entropy is the modification of the standard cross-entropy calculation. Instead of treating all classes equally, each class is assigned a weight which is applied to the loss contribution of instances belonging to that class. This weighting amplifies the error for underrepresented classes, forcing the optimization process to prioritize learning their features.

In TensorFlow, the implementation primarily involves adjusting the standard `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy` or `tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy` loss functions. Specifically, a `sample_weight` parameter can be incorporated, providing instance-specific loss weights. The challenge usually arises in calculating these sample weights appropriately, especially with multi-class problems.

Let’s analyze a binary classification scenario first. Assume we have a heavily imbalanced dataset with significantly more samples of class '0' than class '1'. The goal is to penalize misclassifications of the minority class ('1') more severely. We can define class weights, where the minority class gets a higher weight and the majority class has a weight of '1'. For instance, if class '1' makes up 10% of the data, we might assign it a weight of 9 (or 0.9), effectively multiplying its error contribution by a factor of 9, while class 0 retains a weight of 1. This is achieved by setting instance-level weights based on the sample’s class, creating `sample_weights`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate binary classification data (imbalanced)
num_samples = 1000
labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=num_samples, p=[0.9, 0.1])  # 90% class 0, 10% class 1
predictions = np.random.rand(num_samples, 1) # Sample predictions between 0 and 1
predictions = tf.convert_to_tensor(predictions, dtype=tf.float32) #convert to tensor
labels = tf.convert_to_tensor(labels, dtype=tf.float32) #convert to tensor


# Define class weights. For simplicity, class 0 will always have a weight of 1,
# and class 1 will have a weight which scales up the error by a factor equivalent to the inverse proportion of its representation
class_1_weight = 9.0  # Class '1' will be weighted 9 times as much
class_weights = {0: 1.0, 1: class_1_weight}

# Create sample weights
sample_weights = tf.gather(list(class_weights.values()), tf.cast(labels, tf.int32))

# Using BinaryCrossentropy with sample_weights
bce_weighted = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss_weighted = bce_weighted(tf.expand_dims(labels, -1), predictions, sample_weight=sample_weights)

print("Weighted Binary Cross Entropy Loss:", loss_weighted.numpy())

# Using BinaryCrossentropy without weights
bce_unweighted = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss_unweighted = bce_unweighted(tf.expand_dims(labels, -1), predictions)

print("Unweighted Binary Cross Entropy Loss:", loss_unweighted.numpy())
```

In this first example, the `sample_weight` tensor is computed such that for every sample in the batch belonging to class ‘1’, its loss is multiplied by a factor of 9. This increases the overall loss value for misclassifications within the minority class, forcing the optimizer to consider this error magnitude, and correct for it, as opposed to the less significant error magnitude of the more dominant class. The print statement clearly shows the increased magnitude of the weighted loss, which would significantly affect the optimization process.

Now consider a multi-class classification problem. The concept remains the same, but we need to define a weight for each class. This is particularly important when dealing with multi-class problems where certain classes are severely underrepresented. The weights are determined similarly to the binary case, inversely proportional to class frequency. Again, the `sample_weight` argument is leveraged.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate multi-class classification data (imbalanced)
num_samples = 1000
num_classes = 4
labels = np.random.choice(num_classes, size=num_samples, p=[0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1]) #Simulated Class distributions
predictions = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_classes)
predictions = tf.convert_to_tensor(predictions, dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.convert_to_tensor(labels, dtype=tf.int32)
one_hot_labels = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=num_classes)

# Calculate class weights inversely proportional to class frequencies
class_counts = np.bincount(labels.numpy(), minlength=num_classes)
class_weights = 1.0 / (class_counts + 1e-6) #Avoid division by zero and ensure all classes are present
class_weights = class_weights / np.sum(class_weights)
print("Class weights:", class_weights)


# Generate sample weights by getting the class weight corresponding to the sample
sample_weights = tf.gather(class_weights, labels)

# Using CategoricalCrossentropy with sample_weights
cce_weighted = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss_weighted = cce_weighted(one_hot_labels, predictions, sample_weight=sample_weights)
print("Weighted Categorical Cross Entropy Loss:", loss_weighted.numpy())

# Using CategoricalCrossentropy without weights
cce_unweighted = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss_unweighted = cce_unweighted(one_hot_labels, predictions)
print("Unweighted Categorical Cross Entropy Loss:", loss_unweighted.numpy())
```

In this second example, I explicitly compute the inverse class frequencies and derive the class weights using numpy. This strategy is more flexible than manually specifying weights, especially if class distributions are not known a priori, or vary throughout the process. It’s important to ensure that your prediction tensor matches the shape of the one-hot encoded labels. Notice also that `tf.gather` is now used to derive instance-level weights from the previously computed class-level weights, according to the label of the instance.

Finally, it is not always optimal to compute weights based strictly on inverse frequencies. We can also use pre-defined values to adjust for task-specific requirements or prior knowledge. Below, I will show how to do this. Assume for example, that we know class '2' is of greater importance than the other classes. We can increase its weight to account for this.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate multi-class classification data (imbalanced)
num_samples = 1000
num_classes = 4
labels = np.random.choice(num_classes, size=num_samples, p=[0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1])
predictions = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_classes)
predictions = tf.convert_to_tensor(predictions, dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.convert_to_tensor(labels, dtype=tf.int32)
one_hot_labels = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=num_classes)

# Predefined class weights
class_weights = np.array([0.4, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1])  # Class 2 is given higher weight.

# Generate sample weights
sample_weights = tf.gather(class_weights, labels)

# Using CategoricalCrossentropy with sample_weights
cce_weighted = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss_weighted = cce_weighted(one_hot_labels, predictions, sample_weight=sample_weights)

print("Weighted Categorical Cross Entropy Loss:", loss_weighted.numpy())

# Using CategoricalCrossentropy without weights
cce_unweighted = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss_unweighted = cce_unweighted(one_hot_labels, predictions)
print("Unweighted Categorical Cross Entropy Loss:", loss_unweighted.numpy())
```

In this third example, the weights are set manually. The weights are then used in the loss function with the sample weights parameter, exactly the same way as in the prior examples. This shows that the `sample_weights` parameter is highly flexible, and is an effective way to handle cases where class weights are to be determined by external considerations, or are adjusted dynamically according to intermediate results.

In summary, implementing weighted cross-entropy in TensorFlow largely depends on crafting appropriate `sample_weight` tensors, based on either inverse class frequencies or task-specific considerations. These weights are then passed as a parameter to the `BinaryCrossentropy` or `CategoricalCrossentropy` loss functions. This strategy is effective in handling imbalanced datasets, and fine-tuning the learning process based on external factors.

For further study, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for the `tf.keras.losses` module. Books on deep learning with TensorFlow, as well as online courses focusing on advanced deep learning techniques, provide more contextual background. Research papers discussing class imbalance techniques, including weighted cross-entropy and focal loss, offer a comprehensive theoretical perspective and deeper analysis into the pros and cons of each implementation.
