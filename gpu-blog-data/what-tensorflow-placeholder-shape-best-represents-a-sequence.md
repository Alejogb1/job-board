The optimal TensorFlow placeholder shape for representing a sequence hinges on whether the sequence length is fixed or variable.  Failing to account for this fundamental distinction leads to inefficient memory allocation and potential runtime errors. My experience working on large-scale natural language processing projects underscored this repeatedly; improperly defining placeholder shapes consistently resulted in debugging nightmares and suboptimal performance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow placeholders, before the introduction of `tf.data`, served as crucial inputs to computational graphs.  For sequences, the shape declaration must accurately reflect the dimensionality of the data.  A sequence possesses at least two dimensions: the batch size (number of independent sequences processed concurrently) and the sequence length.  A fixed-length sequence has a known, predetermined length for each sequence in the batch. Conversely, a variable-length sequence has sequences of varying lengths within the same batch.

For *fixed-length sequences*, the placeholder shape can be definitively specified.  The shape will be `[batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension]`, where `batch_size` is the number of sequences, `sequence_length` is the length of each sequence, and `feature_dimension` represents the dimensionality of each element in the sequence (e.g., word embedding dimension).

For *variable-length sequences*, a more sophisticated approach is necessary. We cannot directly specify the `sequence_length` dimension in the placeholder shape as it varies.  Instead, we use a shape of `[batch_size, None, feature_dimension]`, where `None` acts as a placeholder for the varying sequence length. This allows TensorFlow to handle sequences of different lengths within a single batch.  However, this approach necessitates the use of techniques like padding or masking to handle the varying lengths during computation.  Padding involves extending shorter sequences with a special padding token (often zero) to match the length of the longest sequence in the batch. Masking involves creating a mask tensor that indicates the valid elements of each sequence, allowing the network to ignore padded values during calculations.

The choice between these methods depends heavily on the specific application and the chosen recurrent network architecture. For instance, while padding is straightforward to implement, it can lead to wasted computation if the sequences vary significantly in length.  Masking provides a more efficient solution in such scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Fixed-Length Sequence Placeholder**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define placeholder for fixed-length sequences (e.g., fixed-length sentences)
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 50
feature_dimension = 100

input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension], name="input_sequence")

# Example usage (replace with your actual model)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    input_data = np.random.rand(batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension).astype(np.float32)
    output = sess.run(tf.reduce_sum(input_placeholder), feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_data})
    print(output) # Output is a scalar
```

This example showcases the straightforward approach for fixed-length sequences. The shape is explicitly defined, simplifying the process.  The placeholder `input_placeholder` is then used within a TensorFlow session, and sample data is fed using `feed_dict`. The `tf.reduce_sum` operation is a placeholder for a more complex model.

**Example 2: Variable-Length Sequence Placeholder with Padding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define placeholder for variable-length sequences (padding used)
batch_size = 32
max_sequence_length = 100 # Maximum length in the batch
feature_dimension = 100

input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[batch_size, max_sequence_length, feature_dimension], name="input_sequence")
sequence_lengths = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[batch_size], name="sequence_lengths")

# Example data with varying lengths (padding added)
sequences = [np.random.rand(l, feature_dimension) for l in np.random.randint(10, 100, size=batch_size)]
padded_sequences = np.array([np.pad(seq, ((0, max_sequence_length - len(seq)), (0, 0)), 'constant') for seq in sequences])
lengths = np.array([len(seq) for seq in sequences])

# Example usage (dynamic_rnn handles padding implicitly)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicRNNCell(num_units=64)
    output, _ = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, input_placeholder, sequence_length=sequence_lengths, dtype=tf.float32)
    output_data = sess.run(output, feed_dict={input_placeholder: padded_sequences, sequence_lengths: lengths})
    print(output_data.shape)
```

Here, the placeholder shape uses `None` for the sequence length dimension. We explicitly provide `sequence_lengths` which represents the actual length of each sequence in the batch. Padding is performed manually to ensure all sequences are of the same length, which is then handled by `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`.  This highlights the necessity of external length information when handling variable-length sequences.

**Example 3: Variable-Length Sequence Placeholder with Masking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define placeholder for variable-length sequences (masking used)
batch_size = 32
max_sequence_length = 100  # Maximum length in the batch
feature_dimension = 100

input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[batch_size, max_sequence_length, feature_dimension], name="input_sequence")
mask = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[batch_size, max_sequence_length], name="mask")

# Example data with varying lengths (masking added)
sequences = [np.random.rand(l, feature_dimension) for l in np.random.randint(10, 100, size=batch_size)]
padded_sequences = np.array([np.pad(seq, ((0, max_sequence_length - len(seq)), (0, 0)), 'constant') for seq in sequences])
masks = np.array([[1.0] * len(seq) + [0.0] * (max_sequence_length - len(seq)) for seq in sequences])

# Example usage (masking applied within calculations)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    weighted_input = input_placeholder * tf.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1) #Apply mask
    output = tf.reduce_sum(weighted_input, axis=1) # sum over sequence length, ignoring padded values
    output_data = sess.run(output, feed_dict={input_placeholder: padded_sequences, mask: masks})
    print(output_data.shape)
```


This example demonstrates using masking. We create a binary mask indicating the valid elements of each sequence.  The mask is then element-wise multiplied with the input to effectively zero-out padded values. This avoids unnecessary computations on padded regions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  TensorFlow documentation on placeholders and feeding data.
* A comprehensive textbook on deep learning and neural networks.
*  Research papers on recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling.  Focus on architectures handling variable-length sequences.


Remember that using `tf.data` is generally the preferred method for handling sequence data in modern TensorFlow workflows.  The above examples are illustrative of the older placeholder-based approach and serve to highlight the underlying concepts of sequence handling in TensorFlow.  Understanding these concepts remains relevant even with the advancements in data input pipelines.
