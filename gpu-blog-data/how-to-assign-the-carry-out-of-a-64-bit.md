The crucial detail concerning 64-bit adder carry-out assignment lies in understanding that the carry-out bit represents an overflow condition in unsigned arithmetic or a sign extension in signed arithmetic.  Directly assigning it to the most significant bit (MSB) necessitates careful consideration of the data type and intended operation.  My experience working on high-performance computing systems, particularly within the context of developing a custom FPGA-based signal processing unit, has provided me with extensive insight into efficient bit-level manipulation.  This experience highlighted the importance of explicit bitwise operations for achieving optimal performance and predictability.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The naive approach of directly concatenating the carry-out bit to the sum using a simple bitwise concatenation will lead to incorrect results unless handled with specific awareness of the arithmetic context.  For unsigned arithmetic, this concatenation will effectively represent a 65-bit result, representing the full sum including the overflow. In signed arithmetic, however, this concatenation is equivalent to sign extension – the carry-out reflects the sign bit’s propagation, thus correctly representing the two's complement signed result. The correct methodology, therefore, depends entirely on whether the adder operates on signed or unsigned data.

For unsigned 64-bit addition,  the carry-out indicates overflow.  If the intended result is a 64-bit value, the carry-out is typically ignored, or the operation may trigger an exception handling mechanism.  However, if a 65-bit result is desired, the carry-out should be placed as the MSB (64th bit) of a 65-bit variable.  Conversely, for signed 64-bit addition, the carry-out is inherently part of the sign extension mechanism.  Concatenating the carry-out to the MSB directly gives the correct signed result, as it ensures the sign bit is consistent across the entire 65-bit representation.

Therefore, the most robust method is to use conditional logic to handle both signed and unsigned operations separately, selecting the appropriate approach based on the data type.  This avoids potential inconsistencies or undefined behavior.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unsigned 64-bit Addition with 65-bit Result (C++)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

uint65_t unsignedAddWithCarry(uint64_t a, uint64_t b) {
  uint64_t sum = a + b;
  bool carry = (sum < a); // Carry flag set if sum is less than a (overflow)
  return (static_cast<uint65_t>(carry) << 64) | sum;
}

int main() {
  uint64_t a = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF; // Maximum 64-bit unsigned integer
  uint64_t b = 1;
  uint65_t result = unsignedAddWithCarry(a, b);
  std::cout << std::hex << result << std::endl; // Expected output: 0x10000000000000000
  return 0;
}
```

This example explicitly checks for overflow using the less-than comparison. The carry is then left-shifted 64 bits to become the MSB before being bitwise ORed with the sum.  Note the use of `uint65_t`, which assumes the existence of a 65-bit unsigned integer type. If this type is unavailable, a larger type (e.g., `unsigned __int128` if available) can be substituted, with appropriate masking to extract the significant 65 bits.

**Example 2: Signed 64-bit Addition with Sign Extension (Assembly - x86-64)**

```assembly
section .text
  global signedAddWithSignExtension

signedAddWithSignExtension:
  ; Arguments: RDI = a, RSI = b
  mov rax, rdi  ; Move a into accumulator
  add rax, rsi  ; Add b to accumulator (rax now holds the sum)
  jnc no_overflow  ; Jump if no carry (no overflow)
  mov rdx, 0x8000000000000000 ; Set RDX to 0x8000... (sign extension)
no_overflow:
  ; The result is now in RAX (lower 64 bits), RDX (upper 64 bits, only MSB meaningful)
  ret
```

This assembly code demonstrates signed addition. The `jnc` instruction checks the carry flag. If a carry occurs (indicating a negative overflow in this context), the top 64 bits are set to a negative sign extension. The result is implicitly a 128-bit value with the relevant information distributed in `RAX` and `RDX`.  The MSB is effectively determined by the carry flag and the state of `RDX`. This avoids explicit concatenation while still effectively extending the sign bit.


**Example 3:  Conditional Handling (Python)**

```python
import ctypes

def add_with_carry(a, b, signed=False):
    if signed:
        result = ctypes.c_int64(a).value + ctypes.c_int64(b).value
        carry = (result < 0) if a >=0 else (result >= 0)
        return (carry << 63) | (abs(result) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
    else:
        result = a + b
        carry = (result < a)
        return (carry << 64) | result


a = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
b = 1

unsigned_result = add_with_carry(a, b)
signed_result = add_with_carry(a,b, signed=True)

print(hex(unsigned_result))  # Output will vary slightly depending on Python version (unsigned overflow behavior)
print(hex(signed_result))   # Output depends on the interpretation of signed overflow by the Python interpreter
```

This Python example uses conditional logic to select the appropriate handling based on the `signed` flag. It leverages `ctypes` to handle signed integer overflow explicitly.  Note that Python's native integer handling automatically accommodates arbitrary precision, so simulating a fixed-width behaviour requires the usage of the `ctypes` library or similar methods for explicit type management.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* A comprehensive textbook on computer architecture.
* A reference manual for your target processor architecture (e.g., x86-64, ARM).
* Documentation on the specifics of your chosen programming language and its handling of integer types and overflow conditions.  Consult documentation concerning libraries offering fixed-size integer types, if necessary.
* Publications focusing on digital logic design and arithmetic circuits.
