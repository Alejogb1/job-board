PyTorch GPU memory usage, in my experience debugging deep learning models, doesn't inherently increase *per batch* during training. Instead, the apparent upward trend often results from how tensors are handled during the forward and backward passes, and more specifically, from operations within the computation graph persisting intermediate values that are essential for gradient computation. The crucial distinction lies in understanding that memory allocation happens once for the majority of tensor-based operations within a model’s training loop, not repeatedly for each batch.

When a PyTorch model executes a forward pass, several operations are performed, leading to the creation of intermediate tensors. These tensors, often outputs of layers, are needed during the backward pass to calculate gradients. PyTorch’s autograd engine tracks these operations and their resulting tensors in a computational graph. This graph structure enables the reverse propagation of gradients. By default, PyTorch retains these intermediate tensors, requiring memory proportional to the size of these tensors and not necessarily related to the batch size if the operation itself doesn't scale linearly with the batch. Therefore, a sudden increase isn't usually a direct result of processing a new batch. It’s more likely that these tracked tensors, along with their associated gradient data, accumulate memory until cleared.

The memory usage per batch during training is influenced by several factors. The model architecture plays a significant role; larger models with more parameters naturally require more GPU memory. The choice of data type also impacts this: using float32 tensors requires twice as much memory as float16 tensors, which also applies to gradients. Furthermore, operations that involve large intermediate tensor allocations, such as matrix multiplications in fully connected layers or convolution operations, contribute heavily to GPU memory footprint. However, the main aspect impacting "per batch" usage is the computational graph and the retained tensors associated with it.

Here's a typical scenario where memory increases during training if not managed properly:

1.  **Forward Pass:** Each batch is processed, creating new intermediate tensors needed for gradient calculation.
2.  **Backward Pass:** Gradients are computed and accumulated.
3.  **Optimizer Step:** Model parameters are updated.

If steps 1 and 2 do not clear or reuse the intermediate tensors and gradient information from the previous batch, these data accumulate. This isn't a "per batch allocation" but a failure to manage the allocated memory from the previous batch before processing the new one. Without proper memory management, GPU memory usage will steadily grow until resources are exhausted or operations become very slow.

I've encountered situations where memory increases were caused by storing unnecessary intermediate tensors during training. In a project involving a complex sequence-to-sequence model, I made a mistake and wasn't explicitly releasing the attention weights, which grew with sequence length, and I also kept the embeddings in CPU memory when they should have been in GPU. Initially, I thought there was something fundamentally wrong with the model per-batch memory requirements, until I realized the actual culprit. Let's illustrate this with code examples.

**Code Example 1: Illustrating Grad and Tensor Accumulation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Model and optimizer setup
model = SimpleModel().cuda()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Input data
input_data = torch.randn(32, 10).cuda()
target_data = torch.randn(32, 1).cuda()

# Training loop (simplified)
def train_step(inputs, targets):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = model(inputs)
  loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

for i in range(5):
    train_step(input_data, target_data)
    print(f"Step {i+1}: GPU memory allocated = {torch.cuda.memory_allocated()/1024**2:.2f} MB")

```

This code demonstrates a simple training loop. If you run it, and I have while debugging a similar issue, you'll find the memory allocation increases significantly at the beginning, but then plateaus. This happens because the initial memory allocation for layers and the data required for the first forward and backward passes will allocate memory. However, the training loop does not store any large new intermediate tensors each time and reuses them (since `backward()` is called) . Thus the memory does not grow per batch in the steady state. The memory usage does not keep increasing because PyTorch is overwriting the same memory areas after the gradients are calculated.

**Code Example 2: Impact of Unnecessary Tensor Storage (Memory Accumulation)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ModelWithStoredTensor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelWithStoredTensor, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)
        self.intermediate_tensors = []

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.linear1(x))
        self.intermediate_tensors.append(x) # store intermediate tensor
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x


model = ModelWithStoredTensor().cuda()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Input data
input_data = torch.randn(32, 10).cuda()
target_data = torch.randn(32, 1).cuda()

def train_step_memory_leak(inputs, targets):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    # No clearing, accumulating memory

for i in range(5):
  train_step_memory_leak(input_data,target_data)
  print(f"Step {i+1}: GPU memory allocated = {torch.cuda.memory_allocated()/1024**2:.2f} MB")
```

Here, the `intermediate_tensors` list in the model accumulates outputs from the first linear layer during every forward pass and this will accumulate tensors on the GPU as the training loop proceeds. This shows how the incorrect management of data can lead to accumulating memory usage across batches. When run, this demonstrates how the memory usage per batch actually does increase, but the issue isn't inherent in the framework, but because the programmer is explicitly keeping intermediate results.

**Code Example 3: Memory Management with `del`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ModelWithStoredTensor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelWithStoredTensor, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)
        self.intermediate_tensors = []

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.linear1(x))
        self.intermediate_tensors.append(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = ModelWithStoredTensor().cuda()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Input data
input_data = torch.randn(32, 10).cuda()
target_data = torch.randn(32, 1).cuda()


def train_step_clear_memory(inputs, targets):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    model.intermediate_tensors.clear()
    # or del model.intermediate_tensors[:]

for i in range(5):
  train_step_clear_memory(input_data, target_data)
  print(f"Step {i+1}: GPU memory allocated = {torch.cuda.memory_allocated()/1024**2:.2f} MB")
```

In this example, the intermediate tensors are explicitly cleared after each training step using `model.intermediate_tensors.clear()`. This prevents the accumulation of memory and illustrates one mechanism to prevent increasing memory usage during training.

To manage GPU memory effectively, I'd recommend exploring techniques such as gradient checkpointing, which reduces memory usage by recalculating specific parts of the computational graph during the backward pass, but which might come at the cost of computation time. Consider using mixed precision training with float16 instead of float32 when appropriate to halve the memory usage associated with tensors and gradients. Also, pay attention to the size of intermediate tensors by ensuring that large tensors are deallocated whenever no longer needed. Monitoring the GPU memory allocation via `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and `torch.cuda.memory_summary()` is a crucial debugging step. Additionally, using optimizers like `AdamW` instead of `SGD` can sometimes improve GPU memory usage due to different internal calculations. Always check your data loaders to make sure data is loading into the correct location, if the data is being loaded onto the CPU then transferred to the GPU on every step this can cause a lot of memory swapping.
