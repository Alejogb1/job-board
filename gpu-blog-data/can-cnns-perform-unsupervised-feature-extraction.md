Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are not inherently unsupervised feature extractors in the same way that techniques like autoencoders or k-means clustering are.  My experience developing and deploying CNN-based image classification systems over the past decade has underscored the crucial role of supervised learning in their typical application. However,  it's inaccurate to state they are entirely incapable of unsupervised feature extraction;  the capability exists, but requires careful architectural choices and strategic training methodologies.  The effectiveness hinges on how the network is designed and trained, shifting the emphasis away from explicit label prediction towards learning useful representations from unlabeled data.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core strength of CNNs lies in their ability to learn hierarchical feature representations through convolutional layers.  These layers, equipped with filters, identify local patterns in the input data.  Higher layers then combine these lower-level features to extract more complex and abstract representations.  In supervised learning, this feature hierarchy is guided by a loss function designed to minimize the error in predicting class labels.  The network learns to extract features that are particularly discriminative for the specific classification task.  Unsupervised learning removes this explicit label-based guidance.

To achieve unsupervised feature extraction using CNNs, one must modify the training procedure.  Instead of minimizing a classification loss, alternative loss functions are utilized that promote the learning of meaningful representations without explicit labels. Common strategies include:

* **Autoencoder-based approaches:**  A CNN can be structured as an autoencoder, where the network learns to reconstruct its input. The bottleneck layer in this architecture, positioned between the encoder (initial layers) and the decoder (final layers), acts as a compressed representation of the input.  Training involves minimizing the reconstruction error, encouraging the network to learn features that capture the essence of the input data. The features learned in this bottleneck layer can then be utilized for downstream tasks.

* **Predictive modeling:**  The network is trained to predict certain properties of the input data without explicit class labels. For instance, one could train a CNN to predict the next frame in a video sequence or to predict the masked portion of an image.  This forces the network to learn robust features that capture the temporal or spatial relationships within the data.

* **Contrastive learning:**  This approach involves training the network to distinguish between similar and dissimilar data points. By encouraging the network to embed similar data points closer together in the feature space and dissimilar points further apart, a meaningful representation is learned.  This approach leverages the inherent structure in the unlabeled data to generate informative features.

The crucial difference lies in the objective function. Supervised learning focuses on class separation, while unsupervised methods aim to capture the underlying structure and relationships within the data.  Therefore, the "quality" of the extracted features depends heavily on the chosen unsupervised learning objective and the architecture's ability to optimize it effectively.

**2. Code Examples:**

Below are illustrative examples (using a Pythonic pseudo-code for brevity, as the exact implementation depends heavily on the chosen deep learning framework):

**Example 1: Autoencoder for Image Feature Extraction:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf  # Or PyTorch

# Define the encoder part of the CNN
encoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128) # Bottleneck layer
])

# Define the decoder part of the CNN
decoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(7*7*64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape((7, 7, 64)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, (3, 3), strides=2, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid')
])

# Combine encoder and decoder
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(inputs=encoder.input, outputs=decoder(encoder.output))

# Compile and train the autoencoder with reconstruction loss
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=10)

# Extract features from the bottleneck layer of the encoder
features = encoder.predict(x_test)
```
This code demonstrates a simple autoencoder for image feature extraction.  The `encoder` learns to compress the input image into a 128-dimensional representation, and the `decoder` attempts to reconstruct the original image. The features are then extracted from the bottleneck layer.

**Example 2:  Predictive Modeling for Video Feature Extraction:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a CNN to predict the next frame in a video sequence
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 64, 64, 3)), # 10 frames as input
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D((2, 2, 2)),
    # ... more convolutional and pooling layers ...
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64*64*3) # Output shape matches a frame
])

# Compile the model with MSE loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model on consecutive frames from a video
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Extract features from an intermediate layer
features = intermediate_layer_model.predict(x_test)

```

This example uses a 3D CNN to predict the next frame in a video. The features learned are implicitly useful representations for understanding temporal dynamics within video data.

**Example 3: Contrastive Learning:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a Siamese network
base_network = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... CNN layers ...
])

# Create two input branches for the Siamese network
input_a = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
input_b = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

processed_a = base_network(input_a)
processed_b = base_network(input_b)

# Compute the similarity score
similarity = tf.keras.layers.Dot(axes=1)([processed_a, processed_b])

# Define the contrastive loss
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=similarity)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=contrastive_loss)

# Train the model on pairs of similar and dissimilar images
model.fit([x_train_a, x_train_b], y_train, epochs=10)

# Extract features from the base network
features = base_network.predict(x_test)
```

This example outlines a Siamese network architecture employed in contrastive learning.  Two identical CNNs process pairs of images; the output similarity score is then used to learn feature embeddings that cluster similar images together and separate dissimilar images.

*   Research papers on autoencoders, Siamese networks, and contrastive learning.  A focused literature review within these areas would be significantly beneficial.


In conclusion, while CNNs are predominantly known for their performance in supervised learning scenarios, their adaptability allows for effective unsupervised feature extraction when employing alternative training methodologies and carefully considering the network architecture. The examples provided illustrate approaches leveraging autoencoders, predictive modeling, and contrastive learning to extract meaningful features from unlabeled data. The success of such methods depends critically on the dataset's inherent structure and the chosen loss function's efficacy in capturing this structure.  Furthermore, selecting appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for ensuring optimal performance.
