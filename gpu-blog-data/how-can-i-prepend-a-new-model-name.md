Importing a frozen TensorFlow graph with `tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def` doesn't inherently offer a direct method to prepend a new name to all nodes and their associated tensors within the graph. Instead, this process requires a manual transformation of the graph definition proto message *before* passing it to `import_graph_def`. Based on my experience modifying pre-trained models for custom deployment, I've found that the most reliable approach involves parsing the graph definition, modifying the node names, and then utilizing the modified proto to construct the graph.

The core challenge arises from the fact that a TensorFlow graph definition, represented as a `GraphDef` protocol buffer, stores each node and tensor with a specific name that must be unique within the graph. `import_graph_def` expects this structure to be consistent; altering names directly within the imported graph after it has been created isn't practical. Prepending a model name, therefore, requires iterating over each node and tensor within the `GraphDef` before its import, modifying their `name` fields and updating any references to them within the graph's `input` fields.

Here's the typical workflow: First, we load the frozen graph as a byte string using standard file handling. We then parse this byte string into a `GraphDef` proto message using the protobuf library. This message is a data structure holding all graph metadata. We systematically modify the names of the nodes within this message, prefixing them with the desired model name. Finally, the modified `GraphDef` is used with `import_graph_def` to create the TensorFlow graph with the new names.

Here’s an illustration using Python and the TensorFlow library:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from google.protobuf import text_format

def prepend_graph_name(graph_def_bytes, model_name):
  """Prepends a model name to all node names in a GraphDef.

  Args:
    graph_def_bytes: A byte string containing the serialized GraphDef.
    model_name: The name to prepend to all node and tensor names.

  Returns:
    A modified GraphDef protobuf object.
  """
  graph_def = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()
  graph_def.ParseFromString(graph_def_bytes)

  for node in graph_def.node:
    # Rename the node itself
    original_name = node.name
    node.name = f"{model_name}/{node.name}"

    # Update input references to this node if needed
    for i in range(len(node.input)):
      if node.input[i].startswith(original_name):
           node.input[i] = f"{model_name}/{node.input[i]}"

  return graph_def

# Example usage
def load_and_prepend(frozen_graph_path, model_name, output_node_name):
  """Loads a frozen graph, prepends a name, and returns a usable session."""
  with open(frozen_graph_path, 'rb') as f:
      graph_def_bytes = f.read()

  modified_graph_def = prepend_graph_name(graph_def_bytes, model_name)

  graph = tf.Graph()
  with graph.as_default():
      tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def(modified_graph_def, name='')
      output_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(f"{model_name}/{output_node_name}")

  session = tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph)
  return session, output_tensor

# Path to a frozen graph file
frozen_graph_file = "path/to/your/frozen_graph.pb"
# New model name
new_model_name = "my_renamed_model"
#  Name of the original output node (e.g., "output_node:0")
original_output_node_name = "output_node:0"

session, output_tensor = load_and_prepend(frozen_graph_file, new_model_name, original_output_node_name)
# Now use the session and the output_tensor as needed
# e.g. output_values = session.run(output_tensor, feed_dict={input_tensor: some_input_data})
```
In this first example, `prepend_graph_name` function is the central piece. It loads the serialized graph definition, iterates through each node, and changes the node's `name` field to include the new model name prefix. Crucially, it also iterates over each `input` reference to a node, updating them accordingly if they are references to the currently processed node. This ensures graph connections remain valid. The `load_and_prepend` function wraps this logic to provide a session and the renamed output tensor. It assumes `output_node_name` is given without the new model name prefix because, at that point, the graph renaming is already finished.

A crucial aspect often overlooked is handling tensor names. TensorFlow tensor names are constructed from their owning operation’s name and output index. Therefore, renaming only operation names with a prefix isn’t always sufficient. The above example addresses this by updating node input names only if they explicitly point to the current node. In cases where a tensor itself is directly referenced in graph structure using its name (e.g. `"node_name:0"`), it will be implicitly renamed as well, because the node’s name part of the tensor name is being changed.

In certain frozen models, input references might use fully qualified tensor names instead of just node names. Here’s an example of how to address this more general case.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from google.protobuf import text_format

def prepend_graph_name_with_tensors(graph_def_bytes, model_name):
  """Prepends a model name to all node/tensor names in a GraphDef.

  Args:
    graph_def_bytes: A byte string containing the serialized GraphDef.
    model_name: The name to prepend to all node and tensor names.

  Returns:
    A modified GraphDef protobuf object.
  """
  graph_def = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()
  graph_def.ParseFromString(graph_def_bytes)

  for node in graph_def.node:
    original_name = node.name
    new_node_name = f"{model_name}/{original_name}"

    # Rename the node itself
    node.name = new_node_name

     # Update input references
    for i, input_name in enumerate(node.input):
        parts = input_name.split(":")
        if len(parts) > 1: # tensor name
            op_name = parts[0]
            if op_name == original_name:
                new_input_name = f"{model_name}/{op_name}:{parts[1]}"
                node.input[i] = new_input_name
        elif input_name == original_name:
            node.input[i] = new_node_name

  return graph_def

# Example usage (same logic as before but with new prepend_graph_name function)
def load_and_prepend_with_tensors(frozen_graph_path, model_name, output_node_name):
  """Loads a frozen graph, prepends a name, and returns a usable session."""
  with open(frozen_graph_path, 'rb') as f:
      graph_def_bytes = f.read()

  modified_graph_def = prepend_graph_name_with_tensors(graph_def_bytes, model_name)

  graph = tf.Graph()
  with graph.as_default():
      tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def(modified_graph_def, name='')
      output_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(f"{model_name}/{output_node_name}")

  session = tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph)
  return session, output_tensor

frozen_graph_file = "path/to/your/frozen_graph.pb"
new_model_name = "my_renamed_model_with_tensors"
original_output_node_name = "output_node:0"
session, output_tensor = load_and_prepend_with_tensors(frozen_graph_file, new_model_name, original_output_node_name)
```
Here,  `prepend_graph_name_with_tensors` expands upon the previous version by specifically checking for tensor name suffixes (`:0`, `:1`, etc.). It splits the input string by the colon. If a colon is found, and the first portion of that split refers to the current node, then the input string is replaced with the fully qualified, model-prefixed tensor name. This ensures consistent renaming for cases where tensor names are explicitly used in the input.

A final scenario arises if you have explicit control over graph construction and are looking for alternative methods to prepend the model name to graph, before freezing it, instead of performing surgery on an existing frozen graph. In such a case, you might consider using TensorFlow's name scopes. Here's an example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
def build_scoped_graph(model_name):
  """Builds a simple graph inside a name scope."""
  graph = tf.Graph()
  with graph.as_default():
    with tf.name_scope(model_name):
      input_tensor = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 10), name="input_placeholder")
      weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 5)), name="weights")
      biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=(5)), name="biases")
      output_tensor = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(input_tensor, weights) + biases, name="output_relu")

      # This will be available under "<model_name>/output_relu:0"
    # You can add more operations outside the scope
    global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False, name="global_step")

    return graph, output_tensor, global_step

model_name = "my_scoped_model"
graph, output_tensor, global_step = build_scoped_graph(model_name)

#Freeze graph (example). Not needed for demonstration of namescopes
with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    output_graph_def = tf.compat.v1.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(sess, graph.as_graph_def(), [output_tensor.name.split(':')[0]]) # Split removes ":0" suffix
    with open("scoped_model.pb", 'wb') as f:
        f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())

# Example of retrieval using name scopes:
with graph.as_default():
    new_output_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(f"{model_name}/output_relu:0")
    new_input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(f"{model_name}/input_placeholder:0")
    print("Retrieved via namescope:",new_output_tensor.name) #Output: my_scoped_model/output_relu:0

```
This demonstrates TensorFlow's native `name_scope`. When creating the graph, we enclose a section of the graph definition within `tf.name_scope(model_name)`. All operations defined within this scope will be prefixed with the scope’s name during graph creation. This method effectively prepends the model name by design and eliminates the need for graph proto message manipulation after freezing.

For further learning I suggest consulting TensorFlow's official documentation, particularly the section on graph manipulation and the documentation for the protobuf library used for parsing the graph definitions. Textbooks on deep learning often contain chapters covering graph creation and management as well. Finally, reviewing examples of how others are dealing with these issues on platforms such as Github or forums will be helpful to refine your approach.
