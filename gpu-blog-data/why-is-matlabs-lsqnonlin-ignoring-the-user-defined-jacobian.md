The issue of `lsqnonlin` in MATLAB seemingly ignoring a user-supplied Jacobian sparsity pattern stems from a misunderstanding of how the algorithm utilizes this information, coupled with potential errors in pattern specification or underlying numerical issues.  My experience debugging large-scale optimization problems within the aerospace industry frequently highlighted this pitfall.  The algorithm doesn't directly *ignore* the pattern; rather, it may fail to leverage it effectively due to inconsistencies or limitations inherent in its implementation.

The `lsqnonlin` function employs a trust-region reflective algorithm, which, in essence, iteratively refines a solution by exploring a local region around the current estimate. The Jacobian matrix, crucial for approximating the function's behavior, determines the gradient direction.  Providing a sparsity pattern allows `lsqnonlin` to exploit the structure inherent in the Jacobian, leading to significant computational savings, especially when dealing with large, sparse systems – a common scenario in many scientific applications.  The savings arise from reduced memory requirements and faster computation of matrix operations.  However, the effectiveness of this optimization hinges on the accuracy and consistency of the supplied pattern.

The crucial point is that the Jacobian *pattern* (a sparse matrix of logical values indicating non-zero elements) is distinct from the Jacobian *values* themselves. `lsqnonlin` uses the pattern to pre-allocate memory and structure its calculations for sparse matrix operations. If the pattern is incorrect—indicating zeros where non-zeros exist, or vice-versa—the algorithm's performance will suffer, even if the Jacobian values are accurately calculated.  Furthermore, even with a correctly specified pattern, numerical issues can lead to unexpected behaviour.  For instance, near-zero elements, below a certain tolerance within the solver, might be treated as exactly zero, rendering the pattern ineffective.


**Explanation:**

The `lsqnonlin` algorithm uses a finite-difference approximation of the Jacobian if one is not provided. This finite difference approximation doesn't inherently respect the sparsity structure.  The user-provided Jacobian pattern acts as a guide, instructing the solver to exploit sparsity during computations, however it only improves efficiency when the pattern precisely reflects the locations of non-zero entries in the Jacobian. This involves understanding how the Jacobian is constructed relative to the problem's structure.

Furthermore, internal numerical tolerances within `lsqnonlin` can impact the perceived efficacy of the sparsity pattern. Small values in the Jacobian, though technically non-zero, might be treated as zero due to these tolerances, rendering the sparse calculations less efficient than anticipated.  This behaviour becomes significant when the Jacobian features many small non-zero elements.

Finally, it is essential to verify that the function providing the Jacobian (or its sparsity pattern) is correctly implemented. A common error stems from inaccurate calculations within the Jacobian function itself, often related to indexing or logic flaws within the user-defined code.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Correct Jacobian Pattern Implementation**

```matlab
function F = myFun(x)
  F = [x(1)^2 + x(2) - 11; x(1) + x(2)^2 - 7];
end

function J = myJac(x)
  J = [2*x(1), 1; 1, 2*x(2)]; % Analytical Jacobian
end

function Jpattern = myJacPattern(x)
  Jpattern = [1, 1; 1, 1]; % Sparse Jacobian Pattern.  Full in this case.
end

x0 = [1; 2];
options = optimoptions('lsqnonlin','Jacobian','on','JacobianPattern',@myJacPattern);
[x,resnorm,residual,exitflag,output] = lsqnonlin(@myFun,x0,[],[],options);
```

In this example, a full Jacobian is used, so a full pattern is appropriate. The `JacobianPattern` option is correctly supplied using a function handle.


**Example 2: Sparse Jacobian Pattern – Incorrect Pattern**

```matlab
function F = sparseFun(x)
  F = sparse([x(1)^2 + x(2) - 11; x(1) + x(2)^2 - 7]); %Note the use of sparse
end

function J = sparseJac(x)
  J = sparse([2*x(1), 1; 1, 2*x(2)]); % Analytical Jacobian - Note it is also sparse
end

function Jpattern = sparseJacPattern(x)
  Jpattern = sparse([1, 0; 0, 1]); %INCORRECT Pattern -  Missed cross-terms.
end

x0 = [1; 2];
options = optimoptions('lsqnonlin','Jacobian','on','JacobianPattern',@sparseJacPattern);
[x,resnorm,residual,exitflag,output] = lsqnonlin(@sparseFun,x0,[],[],options);
```

This example illustrates an incorrect Jacobian pattern. The provided pattern omits the cross-terms from the Jacobian, preventing `lsqnonlin` from efficiently exploiting the inherent sparsity structure. The solution will be correct, but the solver won't benefit from the sparse representation.


**Example 3:  Numerical Issues Affecting Sparse Jacobian**

```matlab
function F = nearZeroFun(x)
  F = [x(1)^2 + 1e-10*x(2) - 11; x(1) + x(2)^2 - 7];
end

function J = nearZeroJac(x)
  J = [2*x(1), 1e-10; 1, 2*x(2)];
end

function Jpattern = nearZeroJacPattern(x)
  Jpattern = [1, 1; 1, 1]; %Correct pattern but the small value might be lost
end

x0 = [1; 2];
options = optimoptions('lsqnonlin','Jacobian','on','JacobianPattern',@nearZeroJacPattern, 'Display', 'iter'); %Add display to observe iterations
[x,resnorm,residual,exitflag,output] = lsqnonlin(@nearZeroFun,x0,[],[],options);

```

In this case, even with a correct pattern, the extremely small value `1e-10` might be treated as zero by `lsqnonlin` due to internal tolerances, negating the advantages of a sparse implementation. The `'Display','iter'` option helps monitor solver behaviour.



**Resource Recommendations:**

MATLAB documentation on `lsqnonlin`, focusing on the `Jacobian` and `JacobianPattern` options.  The documentation on sparse matrices in MATLAB.  A numerical analysis textbook covering optimization algorithms and sparse matrix computations. A guide on debugging numerical algorithms.


In conclusion, while `lsqnonlin` does not directly *ignore* a supplied Jacobian pattern, its effectiveness depends critically on pattern accuracy and the interplay between the pattern, Jacobian values, and the solver's internal numerical tolerances. Careful consideration of these aspects is crucial for achieving optimal performance when dealing with large-scale sparse problems.  Thorough testing and debugging, including examination of intermediate results within the optimization process, are essential to identify and resolve inconsistencies.
