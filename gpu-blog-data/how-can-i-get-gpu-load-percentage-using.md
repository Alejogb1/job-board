Determining GPU utilization within a CUDA application requires a nuanced approach, extending beyond simply accessing a single percentage value.  Accurate measurement necessitates understanding the interplay between kernel execution, data transfer, and overall system activity.  My experience profiling high-performance computing applications has highlighted the limitations of relying solely on operating system-level monitoring tools; these often fail to capture the granular details crucial for effective CUDA performance optimization.  Instead, I've found that combining CUDA profiling tools with strategic instrumentation within the application code itself yields the most comprehensive and reliable results.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Precise GPU load percentage is not a directly accessible metric within the CUDA runtime API.  The CUDA driver, however, provides tools for examining occupancy and kernel execution time, which can be used to infer GPU load.  Crucially, this inferred load reflects the percentage of time the GPU is actively processing CUDA kernels, excluding data transfers to and from the host and periods of idle time.  Therefore, the reported percentage will always be a *lower bound* on overall GPU utilization; the true utilization might be higher due to background processes or asynchronous operations.

The approach involves using the CUDA Profiler (nvprof) or similar profiling tools to gather detailed execution statistics, focusing on metrics such as kernel time, GPU time, and memory transfer times.  These metrics provide a granular view of how the GPU resources are utilized over the applicationâ€™s lifecycle.  Supplementing this with code-level instrumentation allows for finer-grained analysis of specific kernel invocations and potential bottlenecks.

Furthermore, it's vital to distinguish between GPU utilization at the kernel level and overall GPU utilization within the operating system.  The OS-level percentage often encompasses non-CUDA activities running on the GPU, such as OpenGL rendering or other parallel computing frameworks. This means the CUDA-specific utilization will likely be lower than the OS-reported value.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using CUDA Profiler (nvprof)**

NVPROF offers a command-line interface for profiling CUDA applications.  Through command-line arguments, you can specify the application executable and desired metrics.  The output provides a wealth of information, including kernel execution time, memory transfer times, and overall GPU activity.

```bash
nvprof --metrics "gld_throughput,gst_throughput,sm_efficiency" ./myCUDAApplication
```

This command profiles `myCUDAApplication`, focusing on global load/store throughput, shared memory throughput, and SM efficiency.  Analyzing the output helps identify bottlenecks: low SM efficiency indicates potential underutilization of the streaming multiprocessors, while low throughput might indicate insufficient memory bandwidth.  This is not a direct load percentage, but it provides essential data to assess GPU utilization effectively.

**Example 2:  Instrumentation with CUDA Events**

For more precise control over timing within the application, CUDA events can be utilized.  These events mark specific points in the code, allowing for accurate measurement of kernel execution time.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  cudaEvent_t start, stop;
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop);

  // ... CUDA kernel launch ...
  cudaEventRecord(start, 0); // Record start event on default stream
  kernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(...);
  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);   // Record stop event on default stream
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop);  // Ensure event is complete before timing

  float milliseconds = 0;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
  std::cout << "Kernel execution time: " << milliseconds << " ms" << std::endl;

  cudaEventDestroy(start);
  cudaEventDestroy(stop);
  return 0;
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates the use of CUDA events to measure the execution time of a kernel.  While not directly a percentage, this timing data, when combined with the total execution time obtained from the profiler, allows for calculating the fraction of time spent in kernel execution.  This provides a more granular measure than OS-level monitoring.  Remember that the synchronization step (`cudaEventSynchronize`) is crucial for accurate timing.

**Example 3: Combining Profiler and Instrumentation for Comprehensive Analysis**

To achieve a more comprehensive understanding, combine the profiler's overview with code-level timing.  Profiling tools provide context, while instrumentation provides granular data on specific parts of the application.


```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

// ... function definitions ...

int main() {
  // ... CUDA event creation (as in Example 2) ...
  // ... data transfer to GPU ...

  // Record start time for data transfer
  cudaEventRecord(start,0);
  cudaMemcpy(...); // Data Transfer
  cudaEventRecord(stop,0);
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
  float milliseconds = 0;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start,stop);
  std::cout << "Data Transfer Time: " << milliseconds << " ms" << std::endl;

    // ... kernel launch with event recording (as in Example 2) ...

  // ... data transfer from GPU ...

  // ... other CUDA operations with event recording as needed ...

  //Post-processing the gathered timing data with nvprof results provides a complete analysis.

  cudaEventDestroy(start);
  cudaEventDestroy(stop);
  return 0;
}
```

This combines the data transfer time measurement with the kernel execution time measurement from the previous example. This allows you to analyze what percentage of the total execution time is devoted to kernel execution versus data transfer, potentially revealing memory bandwidth as a limiting factor. Comparing this with profiler results can show whether the data transfer time matches the profiler's reported memory transfer time. Discrepancies would indicate potential issues.
