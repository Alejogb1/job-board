The core challenge in using `tf.where()` to selectively modify a 3D tensor based on 2D conditions lies in effectively broadcasting the 2D condition across the third dimension to generate indices suitable for `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  Direct application of `tf.where` on the 2D condition alone yields indices only within that 2D space; it doesn't inherently provide the necessary third-dimension coordinates for the 3D tensor update.  This necessitates a careful construction of the index tensor using broadcasting and concatenation.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines involving conditional masking and tensor manipulation has highlighted this precise issue numerous times.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The process involves three primary steps:

* **Condition Generation:**  A 2D boolean tensor representing the conditions for selection is created. This tensor's shape must match the first two dimensions of the 3D target tensor.

* **Index Generation:**  We leverage broadcasting to expand the 2D indices identified by `tf.where` on the condition tensor.  This involves creating a range tensor representing the third dimension and using `tf.meshgrid` to generate all combinations of indices satisfying the condition.  These indices are then concatenated to form a suitable input for `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.

* **Tensor Update:** The generated indices are used with `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` to replace elements in the 3D tensor based on the conditions.  The update values must be provided in a tensor matching the shape of the selected elements.

This approach leverages the power of `tf.where` for identifying satisfying elements in the 2D condition and extends its functionality to the 3D context through careful indexing and broadcasting.  Improper handling of broadcasting or incorrect index creation will lead to errors, most commonly `InvalidArgumentError` from mismatched tensor shapes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Replacement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 3D tensor
tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])

# 2D condition
condition_2d = tf.constant([[True, False], [False, True]])

# Indices where condition is True
indices_2d = tf.where(condition_2d)

# Expand indices for 3D using broadcasting
row_indices, col_indices = tf.meshgrid(indices_2d[:, 0], indices_2d[:, 1])
depth_indices = tf.range(tensor_3d.shape[2])
indices_3d = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices, depth_indices], axis=-1)

# Update values (replace with -1)
update_values = tf.ones_like(indices_3d) * -1

# Update the 3D tensor
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor_3d, indices_3d, update_values)

print(updated_tensor)
```

This example demonstrates a basic replacement of selected elements with -1.  `tf.meshgrid` creates all combinations of row and column indices identified by `tf.where`, and `tf.range` generates the depth indices.  The crucial step is stacking these to create `indices_3d`, a tensor of shape (N, 3) where N is the number of elements satisfying the condition.  `update_values` is broadcasted to match the shape of selected elements.

**Example 2:  Conditional Replacement with Variable Values**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
condition_2d = tf.constant([[True, False], [False, True]])
indices_2d = tf.where(condition_2d)

row_indices, col_indices = tf.meshgrid(indices_2d[:, 0], indices_2d[:, 1])
depth_indices = tf.range(tensor_3d.shape[2])
indices_3d = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices, depth_indices], axis=-1)


update_values = tf.constant([[100, 200, 300], [400, 500, 600]])
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor_3d, indices_3d, tf.reshape(update_values, [-1, 3]))

print(updated_tensor)
```

Here, we replace elements with values from `update_values`.  Note that the shape of `update_values` must match the number of selected elements and the depth of the tensor. `tf.reshape` ensures compatibility with `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  Incorrect shaping of `update_values` is a frequent source of errors.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Conditions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
condition_2d_1 = tf.constant([[True, False], [False, True]])
condition_2d_2 = tf.constant([[False, True], [True, False]])

# Combine conditions using logical OR
combined_condition = tf.logical_or(condition_2d_1, condition_2d_2)

indices_2d = tf.where(combined_condition)
row_indices, col_indices = tf.meshgrid(indices_2d[:, 0], indices_2d[:, 1])
depth_indices = tf.range(tensor_3d.shape[2])
indices_3d = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices, depth_indices], axis=-1)

update_values = tf.ones_like(indices_3d) * -10

updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor_3d, indices_3d, update_values)

print(updated_tensor)
```

This example illustrates handling multiple 2D conditions. The conditions are combined using `tf.logical_or`, allowing for more complex selection criteria.  The remaining steps are analogous to previous examples.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable. Pay close attention to the sections detailing tensor manipulation, broadcasting, and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook can provide the theoretical background to understand broadcasting and index manipulation efficiently.  Furthermore, exploring examples within the TensorFlow examples repository will aid in mastering these techniques in various scenarios.  Finally, I recommend practicing with smaller tensors and visualizing the intermediate results to improve your understanding of index generation and broadcasting.  Thorough testing and debugging are critical, especially when dealing with complex index manipulations.
