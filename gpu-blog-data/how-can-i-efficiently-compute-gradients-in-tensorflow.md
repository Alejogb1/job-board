TensorFlow 1.14's automatic differentiation capabilities, while powerful, require careful consideration for efficient gradient computation, especially when dealing with complex models or large datasets.  My experience optimizing neural networks within this framework highlighted the crucial role of `tf.gradients` and the strategic use of computational graph control.  Inefficient gradient calculations lead to significant performance bottlenecks, impacting both training speed and resource utilization.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Efficient gradient computation in TensorFlow 1.14 hinges on understanding how the computational graph is constructed and manipulated.  `tf.gradients` is the core function, taking a list of tensors to be differentiated (outputs) and a list of tensors with respect to which the differentiation is performed (inputs). The function returns a list of gradients corresponding to each input tensor. However, simply calling `tf.gradients` without considering graph structure can lead to suboptimal performance.

Several factors contribute to inefficient gradient calculations:

* **Redundant Computations:**  If the computational graph contains redundant operations, the gradient calculation will unnecessarily repeat these computations. This is particularly problematic with complex architectures involving shared layers or repeated sub-graphs.

* **Unnecessary Gradient Accumulation:**  If gradients are calculated for many variables unnecessarily, it leads to increased computational load and memory consumption.  Careful selection of the variables with respect to which gradients are computed is crucial.

* **Inefficient Graph Structure:** A poorly structured graph can hinder optimization.  For example, unnecessary branching or deeply nested operations can hinder TensorFlow's optimization algorithms.

Optimized gradient computation involves:

* **Graph Optimization:** TensorFlow's built-in optimizers can perform some graph-level optimizations.  However, careful design of the model architecture itself plays a significant role.

* **Selective Gradient Calculation:** Only calculate gradients with respect to the variables that require updates. This might involve partitioning the model into smaller subgraphs where gradient computations are localized and parallelisation may be leveraged.

* **Computational Graph Visualization:**  Tools for visualizing the computational graph help identify redundancies and inefficiencies in the graph structure.  This allows for targeted optimization.

* **Control Dependencies:**  Employing `tf.control_dependencies` allows for precise control over the order of operations within the graph, ensuring that certain operations are completed before gradient calculations begin. This prevents race conditions and unnecessary recomputations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.constant(3.0), name='x')
y = x**2

dy_dx = tf.gradients(y, x)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(dy_dx))  # Output: [6.0]
```

This showcases a basic gradient calculation. TensorFlow automatically constructs the computational graph and computes the gradient efficiently for this simple case.

**Example 2: Gradient Calculation with Control Dependencies**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.constant(2.0), name='x')
y = x**3

# Operation to be executed before gradient computation
update_op = tf.assign(x, x + 1)

with tf.control_dependencies([update_op]):  # Ensure update_op completes first
    dy_dx = tf.gradients(y, x)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(dy_dx))  # Output: [27.0]  Gradient calculated after x is updated
```

Here, `tf.control_dependencies` ensures that `x` is updated before its gradient is calculated, preventing potential inconsistencies in the gradient calculation.


**Example 3:  Gradient Calculation with Multiple Outputs and Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0]), name='x')
y1 = x[0]**2
y2 = x[1]**3
dy_dx = tf.gradients([y1, y2], x)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(dy_dx))  # Output: [array([2., 0.], dtype=float32), array([0., 12.], dtype=float32)]
```

This demonstrates gradient computation with multiple outputs (`y1`, `y2`) and a single input tensor (`x`).  The result is a list of gradients, each corresponding to a respective output. This approach is beneficial when dealing with models with multiple loss functions or objectives.  Note that the individual gradients are correctly calculated and aligned with the input tensor's elements.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for 1.14, focusing on sections dedicated to automatic differentiation and graph optimization.  Supplement this with resources detailing best practices for computational graph construction and optimization strategies within TensorFlow.  A solid understanding of calculus and linear algebra will greatly benefit your ability to interpret and optimize the gradient computation process.  Finally, explore resources on profiling and debugging TensorFlow code to identify performance bottlenecks specific to your applications.  These resources will equip you to handle intricate scenarios and achieve optimal performance in gradient calculations within TensorFlow 1.14.
