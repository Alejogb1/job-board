The core determinant of an NDArray's trainability hinges not on the NDArray itself, but on its usage within a computational graph managed by a deep learning framework.  An NDArray, in its raw form, is simply a multi-dimensional array of numerical data;  trainability is a property conferred upon it by its integration into a training process.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale recommendation systems has underscored this critical distinction numerous times.  Misinterpreting an NDArray's inherent properties as indicative of its trainability has led to significant debugging headaches in the past.  This response will clarify this point and offer practical examples.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The trainability of an NDArray depends entirely on its role within the framework's automatic differentiation mechanism.  Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch utilize computational graphs to track operations performed on tensors (their equivalent of NDArrays).  During the forward pass, these graphs compute the output.  During the backward pass (backpropagation), the gradients of the loss function with respect to the trainable parameters are calculated. Only parameters included within this computational graph, and explicitly marked as such by the framework, have their gradients computed and subsequently updated during optimization.  Therefore, an NDArray is "trainable" only if it represents a parameter that the framework identifies as requiring gradient updates.

This identification usually occurs through the creation of the NDArray using framework-specific functions designed for parameter initialization.  These functions typically allocate memory for the NDArray and register it as a trainable variable within the graph.  Conversely, NDArrays created using standard array creation methods (like NumPy's `np.array()`) are not automatically considered trainable.  They might hold data used *during* the training process (e.g., input features), but their values will not be adjusted during backpropagation.

Therefore, the question of an NDArray's trainability is not a property inherent to the NDArray itself; it's a contextual property defined by its position and role within the larger training pipeline.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow (Trainable)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a trainable variable
weight = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 1]), name="weight")  #Explicitly defined as trainable

# Build a simple model (linear regression)
input_data = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
output = tf.matmul(input_data, weight)

# Define loss and optimizer
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(output - tf.constant([[1.0],[4.0],[9.0]])))
optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop
for i in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        output = tf.matmul(input_data, weight)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(output - tf.constant([[1.0],[4.0],[9.0]])))
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [weight])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [weight]))
    print(f"Epoch {i+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

print("Weight values after training:", weight.numpy())
```

*Commentary*: This example explicitly creates a `tf.Variable`.  The `tf.Variable` constructor creates a tensor that is automatically tracked by TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system.  The `optimizer.apply_gradients` function updates the `weight` variable's value based on computed gradients, demonstrating its trainability.

**Example 2: PyTorch (Trainable)**

```python
import torch

# Create a trainable tensor
weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10, 1)) #Explicitly marked as a trainable parameter

# Define a simple linear layer
linear_layer = torch.nn.Linear(1,1, bias=False)
linear_layer.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(weight) # Assign our custom weight

# Input data and target
input_data = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
target = torch.tensor([[1.0], [4.0], [9.0]])

# Define loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(linear_layer.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    output = linear_layer(input_data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

print("Weight values after training:", linear_layer.weight.data)
```

*Commentary*: This PyTorch example leverages `torch.nn.Parameter` to explicitly declare the `weight` tensor as a trainable parameter.  The optimizer then updates this parameter during the training process.  Note that simply assigning a `torch.Tensor` to `linear_layer.weight` would not be sufficient without wrapping it in `torch.nn.Parameter`.


**Example 3: NumPy (Not Trainable)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
weight = np.random.rand(10, 1)

# Perform some calculations (simulating a forward pass)
input_data = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
output = np.dot(input_data, weight)

#Attempting gradient updates will fail
#There is no automatic differentiation mechanism for NumPy
# Any attempt at gradient calculation or update would require manual implementation
# and is outside the scope of automatic differentiation frameworks.
print("Weight values:", weight)
```

*Commentary*: This code showcases a NumPy array.  Itâ€™s demonstrably not trainable within the context of deep learning frameworks because it lacks any integration with automatic differentiation.  While you could manually implement gradient descent, this falls outside the realm of the framework's automated training mechanisms.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I suggest consulting the official documentation of TensorFlow and PyTorch.  Explore resources dedicated to automatic differentiation and backpropagation. Textbooks on deep learning covering computational graphs and automatic differentiation are also beneficial. Finally, reviewing the source code of popular deep learning libraries can provide invaluable insight.  These resources will offer more comprehensive details than can be provided within this response.
