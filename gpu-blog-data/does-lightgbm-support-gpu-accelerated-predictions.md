Yes, LightGBM supports GPU-accelerated predictions, but the nature of this support differs between training and inference. I've observed this firsthand through various projects involving large-scale datasets where optimizing prediction speed was paramount. While training can be significantly sped up through the use of GPUs via parameter configuration, prediction acceleration is primarily achieved through a combination of optimized model format loading and efficient code execution on the CPU. It’s crucial to understand that LightGBM’s GPU-based acceleration during prediction doesn’t involve the same degree of computation offloading to the GPU that we see during training.

Let's clarify the core mechanism. During the training phase, LightGBM leverages CUDA (if available) to perform computationally intensive operations, such as calculating gradients and constructing histograms, on the GPU. This dramatically reduces training time for large datasets. However, once a model is trained, the prediction process is largely about traversing the learned tree structure and summing up leaf values based on the input features. This traversal can be parallelized across multiple CPU cores using optimized algorithms and is generally not computationally demanding enough to benefit extensively from GPU acceleration, particularly in the context of a single row. In essence, the benefit of GPU involvement during the training phase is far more pronounced than during the prediction phase.

Now, while direct GPU computation is not the primary mode for prediction, LightGBM’s design optimizes CPU-based prediction performance through several methods. Firstly, the models are serialized into efficient binary formats, allowing for fast loading and initialization. Secondly, LightGBM’s core prediction engine is written in highly optimized C++, ensuring quick evaluation of decision trees. Thirdly, the library provides efficient mechanisms to batch prediction across multiple input rows, which maximizes throughput. These techniques, combined with modern CPU capabilities like multi-threading and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, allow for high-speed prediction even without direct GPU involvement.

Let’s examine this through a few code examples, focusing on the configuration of a LightGBM model and subsequently using that model for prediction.

**Example 1: Training with GPU and CPU prediction**

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100000, 20)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# LightGBM parameters with GPU enabled for training
params_gpu = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': 'binary_logloss',
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'feature_fraction': 0.9,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'verbose': -1,
    'device' : 'gpu', # Specify GPU usage during training
    'gpu_platform_id': 0, # Set the desired GPU platform ID
    'gpu_device_id': 0 # Set the desired GPU device ID
}


train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
test_data = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=y_test, reference=train_data)

# Train the model with GPU acceleration
model_gpu = lgb.train(params_gpu, train_data, num_boost_round=100,
                      valid_sets=[test_data], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose_eval=False)


# Perform prediction, this uses CPU
predictions = model_gpu.predict(X_test)

print("Predictions done on CPU after GPU training")
```

In this example, we configure the `device` parameter to ‘gpu’ which enables GPU utilization during the training process. The `gpu_platform_id` and `gpu_device_id` parameters allow specifying which GPU to use if multiple GPUs are available. Notice that after model training, the `predict` method is called without any GPU-specific directives; it defaults to utilizing the CPU resources for prediction. While the training benefits heavily from the GPU, the prediction inherently relies on CPU-based calculations.

**Example 2: Batch Prediction**

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100000, 20)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': 'binary_logloss',
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'feature_fraction': 0.9,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'verbose': -1,
}

train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
test_data = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=y_test, reference=train_data)

# Train model without explicitly using GPU
model = lgb.train(params, train_data, num_boost_round=100,
                   valid_sets=[test_data], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose_eval=False)

# Batch prediction
num_samples = X_test.shape[0]
batch_size = 1000
predictions_all = []

for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
    batch = X_test[i:i+batch_size]
    predictions_batch = model.predict(batch)
    predictions_all.extend(predictions_batch)

print("Batch prediction with CPU")
```

This example showcases batch prediction. Instead of processing single rows one at a time, we divide the test data into batches and perform prediction on each batch. This is beneficial, as LightGBM can optimize its internal calculations to take advantage of multiple rows for faster throughput. The prediction continues to be CPU-bound, but this approach maximizes the available CPU cores efficiently.

**Example 3: Model Load and Predict**

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100000, 20)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': 'binary_logloss',
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'feature_fraction': 0.9,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'verbose': -1,
}

train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
test_data = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=y_test, reference=train_data)

# Train the model
model = lgb.train(params, train_data, num_boost_round=100,
                    valid_sets=[test_data], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose_eval=False)

# Save model to file
model.save_model('model.txt')

# Load model
loaded_model = lgb.Booster(model_file='model.txt')

# Prediction using the loaded model
predictions = loaded_model.predict(X_test)

print("Prediction after model loading on CPU")
```

This example emphasizes model loading before prediction.  The model trained is saved to a text file and then loaded using `lgb.Booster()`. This demonstrates that LightGBM’s prediction engine is optimized to work with the saved binary model format. This process of loading and subsequent prediction also occurs on the CPU, further reinforcing that while the GPU plays a large part in training speed, the model inference, while highly optimized, runs primarily on the CPU.

In conclusion, while LightGBM's training phase is GPU-accelerated through CUDA integration when enabled, predictions primarily leverage efficient algorithms executed on the CPU. While the prediction process itself is not offloaded to the GPU, the library's optimized C++ code, efficient model format loading, batching capabilities, and leveraging modern CPU capabilities allow for high-throughput predictions.

For users seeking further details, I recommend exploring the official LightGBM documentation for specifics on parameter configuration and performance tuning. Additionally, consulting research publications that delve into decision tree algorithms and their hardware acceleration strategies will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. Experimenting with different dataset sizes and model complexities provides practical insight. Lastly, scrutinizing open-source implementations of machine learning libraries, even if not directly LightGBM, can provide a holistic view of prediction optimization strategies.
