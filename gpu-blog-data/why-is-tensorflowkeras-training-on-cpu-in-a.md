The primary reason TensorFlow/Keras training might default to CPU within a Jupyter Notebook, despite a functioning GPU being present, stems from TensorFlow's resource allocation logic and the environment’s configuration, rather than an outright hardware failure. TensorFlow does not automatically assume GPU utilization; explicit configuration or validation is often needed, especially within containerized environments or isolated notebook servers. I've encountered this frequently during model development and deployment across varied platforms.

TensorFlow, at initialization, probes the system for available devices. If it fails to locate a usable CUDA-enabled GPU or detects that CUDA drivers are missing, are outdated, or there are version mismatches between the CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, and the installed TensorFlow version, it will revert to the CPU. This is a safety mechanism to ensure execution rather than outright program failure. The Jupyter Notebook environment, running within a web browser, adds another layer of potential complication. The backend kernel, typically a Python process, might not inherently inherit the necessary environment variables or permissions required for GPU access. Furthermore, issues could arise from the Python environment itself, potentially using a TensorFlow installation that wasn’t built with GPU support or is incompatible with the installed CUDA components.

In practice, I've seen this manifest in several ways. First, a user might have installed the CPU-only version of TensorFlow (`tensorflow`), instead of the GPU-enabled variant (`tensorflow-gpu`). While newer TensorFlow versions have tried to merge these distributions, older configurations can still be problematic. Second, even with the correct TensorFlow package installed, underlying drivers, namely NVIDIA’s CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library, must be properly set up, accessible through system paths, and match the TensorFlow's requirements. Third, within a Jupyter environment, the process initiating the kernel might lack access or permissions to the GPU. Consider scenarios where a container is used that doesn’t expose GPU devices, or the notebook server is running in a virtual environment where CUDA isn’t correctly installed. This is crucial. The problem is not always a simple case of "GPU not detected;" it’s often related to system configurations that TensorFlow cannot navigate or dependencies that are unmet.

To illustrate, consider these common scenarios and code examples that can verify or remediate these issues.

**Example 1: Verifying TensorFlow Device Availability**

This code block utilizes TensorFlow’s API to inspect available devices. It is a vital first step to determine if TensorFlow can even "see" the GPU.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def check_gpu():
    physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if physical_devices:
        print("GPU devices found:")
        for device in physical_devices:
            print(f"  {device}")
        logical_devices = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(f"Logical GPUs: {len(logical_devices)}")
        if not logical_devices:
              print("No logical GPUs configured. Ensure TensorFlow can initialize the GPU")
    else:
        print("No GPU devices found by TensorFlow. CPU only mode will be used.")
    print(f"TensorFlow using {tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices()}")


check_gpu()

```

*Commentary:* The function `check_gpu` first attempts to list physical GPU devices using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`. If this returns an empty list, it indicates that TensorFlow does not recognize any usable GPUs, which is the root of the problem. The number of logical GPUs, derived from `tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')`, should match the number of physical GPUs if the GPU is correctly initialized by TensorFlow. If no logical GPUs are present, even if physical GPUs exist, it points toward an initialization or CUDA configuration problem. Finally, it will always list all physical devices detected, CPU or GPU. Inspecting this output provides critical insight into the system state as understood by TensorFlow. A GPU should be explicitly listed within those devices.

**Example 2: Explicitly Setting GPU Memory Growth**

In some cases, particularly when multiple processes are competing for GPU resources, or if TensorFlow is being launched in an environment with limited GPU visibility, enabling memory growth can be beneficial. By default TensorFlow allocates all GPU memory, but we can specify to only allocate as needed.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def configure_gpu_memory():
    physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if physical_devices:
        try:
            # Only allow memory growth to be set once per session
            for gpu in physical_devices:
                tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
            print("GPU memory growth enabled.")
        except RuntimeError as e:
           print(f"Error configuring GPU memory growth: {e}")
    else:
      print("No GPU to configure")
    print(f"TensorFlow using {tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices()}")


configure_gpu_memory()

#Example training loop (for testing)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,)),
                            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

model.fit(x, y, epochs=2)
```

*Commentary:* The `configure_gpu_memory` function iterates through any found GPUs and sets the memory growth flag to true using `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)`. This prevents TensorFlow from allocating all GPU memory upfront, which can cause problems if other GPU processes are active. It addresses scenarios where TensorFlow could be restricted from accessing a large enough segment of memory, causing it to fallback to CPU execution even if the GPU is present. The included, short model training loop helps show how this config is applied. The `fit` function should then execute on the GPU if available after memory growth has been configured.

**Example 3: Manually Assigning Computation to GPU**

For further verification and control, we can manually specify the GPU device for computations, enforcing GPU usage whenever possible.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def run_on_gpu():
    if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
        with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # or the correct GPU device string
           a = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
           b = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
           c = tf.matmul(a, b)
           print("Computation executed on GPU")
           print(f"Device: {c.device}")
    else:
      print("GPU not found, executing on CPU")
      a = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
      b = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
      c = tf.matmul(a, b)
      print("Computation executed on CPU")
      print(f"Device: {c.device}")


run_on_gpu()
```

*Commentary:* This `run_on_gpu` function checks for available GPUs and, if present, executes the matrix multiplication (`tf.matmul`) within a specific GPU context using `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):`. This approach verifies that TensorFlow can explicitly utilize a GPU when directed to do so, helping to determine if the underlying issue is related to device assignment or a deeper driver configuration problem. If it falls back to CPU, then GPU assignment is not working. The device of the result tensor `c` is then printed out. This provides very concrete proof of whether the GPU is being utilized, and which device is assigned to the calculation. It can also identify incorrect GPU device naming if the process fails.

In summary, a lack of GPU utilization within TensorFlow in a Jupyter Notebook is rarely a simple hardware absence. It typically stems from configuration issues within TensorFlow's installation, the environment setup, or unmet dependencies for CUDA drivers. The methods above are useful for identifying and addressing these issues.

For further assistance, referring to the TensorFlow installation guide is recommended to ensure that the required CUDA and cuDNN versions are correctly installed and accessible on your system. Additionally, examining NVIDIA’s documentation for best practices related to CUDA driver installation, and consulting any system-level administrator documentation for container and permission requirements can often clarify setup issues. Understanding the intricacies of resource allocation, especially within complex environments, is critical for effective TensorFlow development. The official TensorFlow documentation website is also very helpful.
