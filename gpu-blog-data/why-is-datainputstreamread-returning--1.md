`DataInputStream.read()` returning -1 signifies the end-of-stream condition.  This is not an error; rather, it's the expected behavior when attempting to read beyond the available data within the underlying input stream.  I've encountered this frequently during my work developing high-throughput data processing pipelines, particularly when dealing with network streams or large files read sequentially.  Understanding this fundamental aspect is crucial for robust stream handling.


**1.  Explanation:**

The `DataInputStream` class wraps another input stream, providing methods for reading primitive data types in a platform-independent manner.  The core `read()` method attempts to read a single byte from the underlying stream.  If successful, it returns this byte as an integer value in the range 0 to 255. However, if the end-of-stream is encountered—meaning no more bytes are available for reading—it returns -1. This design choice distinguishes between a genuine reading error (which would typically throw an exception) and the natural conclusion of the data stream.

It's important to distinguish between the end-of-file (EOF) marker within a file and the end of a network stream. A file typically has an explicit EOF marker.  Network streams, however, can close implicitly; the connection may be severed unexpectedly by the peer.  In both cases, `read()` will return -1, prompting appropriate handling in the application code. Failure to correctly handle this -1 return value can lead to exceptions further down the stream processing chain, potentially resulting in system instability or data loss.  The most common error is attempting to further process the stream's data after encountering -1, leading to `NullPointerExceptions` or `IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Reading a File Completely:**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class ReadFileCompletely {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("mydata.txt");
             DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(fis)) {

            int byteRead;
            while ((byteRead = dis.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) byteRead); // Process each byte
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the typical pattern for reading a file entirely. The `while` loop continues until `dis.read()` returns -1, indicating that all bytes have been processed.  The `try-with-resources` statement ensures that the streams are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.  Crucially, each byte is cast to a `char` before printing.  This is essential because `dis.read()` returns an `int`, not a `char`.


**Example 2:  Handling Network Stream Closure:**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.Socket;

public class HandleNetworkStream {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Socket socket = new Socket("example.com", 80); // Replace with your server details
             InputStream is = socket.getInputStream();
             DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(is)) {

            int byteRead;
            StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();
            while ((byteRead = dis.read()) != -1) {
                response.append((char) byteRead);
            }
            System.out.println("Server response: " + response.toString());

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Network error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This example illustrates reading from a network stream.  The `Socket` establishes a connection to a server.  The same `while` loop structure is used.  However, the `catch` block now handles `IOExceptions` that may occur due to network issues, such as connection timeouts or abrupt disconnections.  The crucial point here is that -1 isn't an error from the socket itself but a signal that the stream has been closed—perhaps by the server, or due to a network issue.  The code gracefully handles both conditions.



**Example 3: Reading a Specific Number of Bytes:**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class ReadSpecificBytes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("mydata.txt");
             DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(fis)) {

            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; // Adjust buffer size as needed
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = dis.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                // Process bytesRead bytes from the buffer
                System.out.println("Read " + bytesRead + " bytes.");
                //Further processing of buffer content would go here
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```


This example showcases reading a chunk of bytes at a time using `dis.read(buffer)`. This is more efficient for larger files than reading byte-by-byte.  The `read(byte[] buffer)` method returns the number of bytes read, which can be less than the buffer size if the end of the stream is reached before the buffer is full. A return value of -1 indicates the end of the stream.  Improper handling of this return might cause the processing to crash or only process part of the available data.  This method is vital when dealing with resource-intensive operations.  Efficient handling of large data volumes is key to optimized system performance, and this is a fundamental aspect of that optimization strategy.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Java I/O, I recommend consulting the official Java documentation on `InputStream`, `DataInputStream`, and exception handling.  Thorough review of the relevant sections in a reputable Java programming textbook would be highly beneficial.  Exploring the source code of established networking libraries can further illuminate best practices for stream management.  Furthermore, understanding the intricacies of operating system file handling is crucial for complete comprehension.  Working through practical exercises involving file and network stream processing will solidify your understanding of these concepts.
