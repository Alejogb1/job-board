Predicting future-dependent outputs within a Keras sequential model necessitates a departure from the standard feed-forward architecture.  My experience developing time-series forecasting models for financial applications revealed the inherent limitations of directly feeding future data into a sequential layer. The key lies in crafting input features that encapsulate the temporal dependencies you wish to model.  This fundamentally alters the data preprocessing stage and requires a careful consideration of the model's architecture.


**1.  Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:**

The crux of achieving future-dependent outputs in a Keras sequential model lies in meticulously crafted input features.  Rather than directly inputting future data points, you must engineer features that represent the relevant past information needed to predict the future value.  For example, consider a scenario predicting stock prices: simply feeding tomorrow's price as an input is inappropriate; instead, you would utilize previous days' closing prices, trading volumes, and potentially external economic indicators as input features.

This involves several steps:

* **Time Windowing:** This is a common technique where you create input sequences of a fixed length (the "time window").  For instance, if your time window is 10 days, each training example will consist of the closing prices for the preceding 10 days as input, with the 11th day's price as the target output.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Normalization or standardization of input features is crucial to ensure optimal model performance and prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.  Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Z-score standardization.

* **Lagged Features:**  These are features that represent past values of the target variable.  In the stock price example, this would include closing prices from previous days.

* **External Features:**  Incorporate relevant external data like economic indicators or weather patterns, if applicable. These should also undergo the same scaling as the primary time-series data.


**2. Model Architecture and Implementation:**

Once the data is prepared, a standard sequential model with recurrent layers (LSTMs or GRUs) are often appropriate.  However, the model's architecture itself doesn't directly 'see' the future; the future dependence is entirely encoded within the engineered input features.

**3. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1:  Simple LSTM for univariate time series**

This example uses a single time-series variable (e.g., daily temperature) and predicts future values based on a fixed-length past sequence.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(1000)

# Reshape data for time window of 10 days
def create_dataset(dataset, look_back=10):
    dataX, dataY = [], []
    for i in range(len(dataset)-look_back-1):
        a = dataset[i:(i+look_back), 0]
        dataX.append(a)
        dataY.append(dataset[i + look_back, 0])
    return np.array(dataX), np.array(dataY)

# Scale data
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
data = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1,1))

# Create dataset
look_back = 10
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(data, look_back)

# Reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
trainX = np.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], trainX.shape[1], 1))

# Define model
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(keras.layers.LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(look_back, 1)))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# Train model
model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=100, batch_size=1, verbose=2)

#Make Predictions
#... (Prediction code would follow, using appropriately reshaped input data)
```

**Example 2:  Multivariate time series with external features**

This example demonstrates incorporating multiple input variables, including external factors.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data (replace with your data)
timesteps = 100
features = 3  # 2 time series variables + 1 external feature
data = np.random.rand(timesteps, features)

# Scale data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Create dataset with a lookback of 5 timesteps.
look_back = 5
trainX, trainY = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - look_back -1):
    trainX.append(data[i:(i+look_back), :])
    trainY.append(data[i+look_back, 0]) # Predicting the first time series variable

trainX = np.array(trainX)
trainY = np.array(trainY)

# Define model
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(keras.layers.LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(look_back, features)))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Train model
model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=100, batch_size=1, verbose=2)
# ... (Prediction code follows)
```

**Example 3:  Handling Missing Data:**

Real-world time-series data often contains missing values.  This example uses imputation to handle missing data:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Sample data with missing values (NaN)
data = np.random.rand(1000,1)
data[::10] = np.nan #introduce some missing data

# Impute missing values using mean imputation
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data = imputer.fit_transform(data)


# Scale data (rest of the code remains similar to Example 1)
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Create dataset
look_back = 10
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(data, look_back)

# Reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
trainX = np.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], trainX.shape[1], 1))

# Define model (same as Example 1)
# ...
```


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of time series analysis and LSTM networks, I would suggest consulting texts on time series analysis, including those focusing on forecasting methods and those specifically detailing the application of neural networks to time series data.  Furthermore, detailed Keras documentation, focusing on the LSTM and GRU layers and their parameters, is invaluable.  Finally, review articles focusing on best practices for time series forecasting using deep learning can offer additional insights.  These resources provide a solid foundation for developing sophisticated models and refining your approach to complex forecasting problems.
