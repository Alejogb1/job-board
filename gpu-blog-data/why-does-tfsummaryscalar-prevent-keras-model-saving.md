TensorFlow’s `tf.summary.scalar` operation, when employed within a Keras model's training loop without proper handling, directly inhibits the model's ability to be saved using `model.save()`. The core issue arises from the fact that `tf.summary.scalar` adds TensorFlow operations to the computation graph, specifically intended for logging and visualization through TensorBoard. These operations introduce dependencies outside the core model's trainable variables, which the standard Keras saving mechanism is not designed to manage seamlessly.

When `tf.summary.scalar` is called inside the `tf.GradientTape` block or within a custom training loop, it generates TensorBoard summaries that are effectively detached from the Keras model's inherent structure. Keras' `model.save()` function, by default, serializes the model's configuration and trained weights—not the auxiliary logging operations added through `tf.summary`. This distinction is crucial: `tf.summary` operations require a `tf.summary.FileWriter` (or, more commonly, a summary writer created with the `tf.summary.create_file_writer`) to write log data to disk; this writer's usage is separate from the model's trainable parameter space. Consequently, when we save a model where summaries have been computed directly, we save an incomplete graph. Loading such a saved model does not recreate the summary writing pipeline, leading to issues such as missing metrics or errors.

This complication arises from the fact that TensorFlow graphs, while designed to be highly expressive, are not inherently equipped to capture the execution logic of external logging or visualization mechanisms directly into the model’s structural definition, which Keras’ `save` and `load` mechanism rely upon. Saving a Keras model using its standard mechanisms is tailored around persisting and restoring model parameters, and the architecture of that model, and does not encompass external operations performed during training.  The graph that the model saves is not the graph that includes any `tf.summary` ops.

To address this, the recommended practice is to separate summary logging from the model's core computation and saving routines. This involves ensuring that `tf.summary.scalar` operations occur outside the context of the model’s forward pass or gradient updates. A common method is to explicitly define a summary logging step within a custom training loop where the summary operation is performed using the writer provided. Alternatively, one can incorporate the `tf.summary` calls inside Keras callbacks specifically designed to log metrics, bypassing the issue of inserting logging operations inside the computational graph the model intends to save.

Below, three code examples illustrate different scenarios and approaches to this problem. Each example utilizes a simple Keras model for demonstration purposes.

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage – `tf.summary.scalar` inside training loop (problematic).**

This example demonstrates the incorrect usage of `tf.summary.scalar` within a training loop and attempts to save the model after such usage.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Dummy data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype(np.float32)

summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
        # Incorrect usage: tf.summary.scalar inside the computational graph
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=optimizer.iterations)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


for epoch in range(2):
    for i in range(10):
        batch_indices = np.random.choice(100, size=32, replace=False)
        x_batch = X[batch_indices]
        y_batch = y[batch_indices]
        loss_value = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss_value.numpy()}")
with summary_writer.as_default():
    # Attempt to save the model
    model.save('problematic_model.h5')  # Will save, but not contain summaries.
```

In this incorrect example, `tf.summary.scalar` is called within the `train_step` function, which is decorated with `@tf.function` and thus becomes part of the TensorFlow computational graph used for training. The intention is to log loss for TensorBoard visualization. While the training proceeds normally, the model saved using `model.save()` will lack the summary logging context and any metrics logging during that training. Upon loading such a model, the summary ops will be entirely absent. You won't be able to continue with summary ops from a newly loaded instance.

**Example 2: Correct Usage – Summary Logging Outside Training Loop.**

This example demonstrates the correct approach, by explicitly separating logging with summaries from the model's core computation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Dummy data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype(np.float32)

summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')


@tf.function
def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


for epoch in range(2):
    for i in range(10):
        batch_indices = np.random.choice(100, size=32, replace=False)
        x_batch = X[batch_indices]
        y_batch = y[batch_indices]
        loss_value = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
        # Correct usage: tf.summary.scalar outside the graph's computation
        with summary_writer.as_default():
            tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss_value, step=optimizer.iterations)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss_value.numpy()}")

# Attempt to save the model
model.save('correct_model.h5')
```

In this corrected example, the `tf.summary.scalar` call is moved outside of `train_step` and therefore, outside the traced computation graph during training.  The summary value for loss is recorded directly to the `summary_writer` context. `train_step` remains a function of computational graph, but the logging is decoupled. The model, when saved and then reloaded, can be used for inference and continued training, and the TensorBoard data, stored separately, is available for analysis. This separation prevents interference with the model saving operation.

**Example 3: Correct Usage with Keras Callback.**

This example demonstrates the use of a custom Keras callback for logging, offering another appropriate approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class CustomTensorBoardCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_dir):
        super(CustomTensorBoardCallback, self).__init__()
        self.summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
            logs = {}
        with self.summary_writer.as_default():
            for metric, value in logs.items():
                tf.summary.scalar(metric, value, step=epoch)

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['mse'])


# Dummy data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype(np.float32)

# Use Keras fit and custom callback
custom_callback = CustomTensorBoardCallback('./logs')

model.fit(X, y, epochs=2, batch_size=32, callbacks=[custom_callback])


# Attempt to save the model
model.save('callback_model.h5')
```

In this example, a custom callback `CustomTensorBoardCallback` is defined to handle summary logging. This callback uses the `on_epoch_end` event to log the metrics to TensorBoard. The key benefit is that it separates summary logging from both the training loop and the model's own definition. Keras’ `model.fit()` incorporates callbacks into its training process, and by doing so they remain external to the model’s saveable graph, thus solving the issue.

The recommendation in practice is to always either utilize the callback-based approach or to explicitly log metrics and summaries using a dedicated logging step during training in a controlled manner that’s distinct from operations saved with the model using Keras’ `save` command. The latter is particularly pertinent when not using `model.fit`.

For further information on TensorFlow logging practices, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation on TensorBoard and summaries. Consult the Keras documentation concerning custom callbacks for training and validation metric logging. Additionally, review available resources detailing the best practices for custom training loops and handling gradient operations in TensorFlow.
