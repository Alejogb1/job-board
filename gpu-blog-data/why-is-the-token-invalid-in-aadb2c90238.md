The error "token invalid in AADB2C90238" typically stems from a mismatch between the expected token format and the token presented for authentication within the Azure Active Directory B2C (AADB2C) environment.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous enterprise deployments points to several root causes, often interacting in complex ways.  This response will delineate those causes and illustrate common solutions with concrete code examples.

**1.  Token Expiration and Clock Skew:**

The most prevalent cause of this error is a token that has expired.  AADB2C tokens have a defined lifespan, and requests made after this period will invariably result in the "token invalid" error.  This is exacerbated by clock skew â€“ a discrepancy between the time on the client application making the request and the time on the AADB2C authentication servers. Even a minor difference, perhaps a few seconds, can trigger token rejection.

This isn't merely a matter of checking a timestamp.  A robust solution requires verification using the token's `exp` (expiration) claim.  This claim, present within the JWT (JSON Web Token) payload, specifies the exact Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) at which the token expires.  The client must obtain the current time from a reliable source, ideally a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, and compare it against the `exp` claim before attempting authentication.

**2.  Incorrect Token Usage and Audience:**

The "aud" (audience) claim is another crucial aspect often overlooked. This claim identifies the intended recipient of the token.  If the application making the request doesn't match the audience specified in the token, AADB2C will correctly reject it. This frequently happens when applications are misconfigured, using tokens intended for a different application or service.  Similarly, using an access token in a context expecting an ID token, or vice versa, will lead to this error.  Understanding the distinctions between access tokens (for API access) and ID tokens (for user identity verification) is paramount.

**3.  Token Signing Key Mismatch:**

Azure AD B2C utilizes asymmetric cryptography for signing tokens.  The client application must possess the correct public key to verify the token's signature. If the application is using an outdated or incorrect key, the signature verification will fail, triggering the "token invalid" error.  This is especially relevant in scenarios with rotating signing keys, a security best practice in AADB2C deployments.  The application needs a mechanism to fetch and update its key set regularly, often from the Azure AD B2C metadata endpoint.  Failure to update this key set promptly will result in failed authentication.


**Code Examples:**

Here are three code examples illustrating solutions for the aforementioned issues.  These examples are conceptual and may need adjustments based on your specific technology stack (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python).


**Example 1:  Token Expiration Check (Conceptual JavaScript)**

```javascript
// Assuming 'token' contains the JWT string
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = 'your_jwt_token_here';

try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'your_public_key_here'); //Replace with actual public key retrieval method

    const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); //Current time in Unix timestamp
    if (decoded.exp < now) {
        console.error("Token expired.");
        // Handle token expiration (e.g., initiate refresh token flow)
    } else {
        // Token is valid
        console.log("Token is valid",decoded);
    }
} catch (err) {
    console.error("Token verification failed:", err);
    // Handle token verification errors (e.g., invalid signature)
}
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates basic token verification using a library (jsonwebtoken in Node.js).  In real-world scenarios, you would retrieve the public key dynamically from the AADB2C metadata endpoint rather than hardcoding it.  Error handling is crucial;  it should trigger appropriate actions like re-authentication or displaying error messages to the user.


**Example 2:  Audience Validation (Conceptual C#)**

```csharp
// Assuming 'token' contains the JWT string and 'expectedAudience' is your application's identifier

using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;

// ... other code ...

var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
try
{
    var tokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateAudience = true,
        ValidAudience = expectedAudience,
        // ... other validation parameters ...
    };

    SecurityToken validatedToken;
    ClaimsPrincipal principal = tokenHandler.ValidateToken(token, tokenValidationParameters, out validatedToken);

    // Access claims from the validated token
    // ...
}
catch (SecurityTokenException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Token validation failed: {ex.Message}");
}

```

**Commentary:** This C# snippet leverages the .NET's `JwtSecurityTokenHandler` to perform token validation.  Critically, `ValidateAudience` is set to `true`, and `ValidAudience` is configured to match your application's registered identifier in AADB2C.  This ensures that only tokens intended for your application are accepted.  Appropriate exception handling is demonstrated.


**Example 3:  Dynamic Key Retrieval (Conceptual Python)**

```python
import requests
import jwt
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# Replace with your AADB2C tenant's metadata endpoint
metadata_url = "https://your-tenant.b2clogin.com/<your-policy>/discovery/v2.0/keys"

response = requests.get(metadata_url)
response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes

keys = response.json()

# Find the appropriate key (consider key ID, expiration, etc.)
# This requires careful selection based on metadata structure
key = find_appropriate_key(keys)

# Extract public key from the chosen key object
public_key = key["x5c"][0] #extract PEM encoded public key - adapt based on metadata structure

# Verify the token
try:
    decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, public_key, algorithms=["RS256"])
    #Access token payload here
except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
    print("Token expired.")
except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
    print("Invalid token.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates how to fetch the signing keys dynamically from the AADB2C metadata endpoint.  The `find_appropriate_key` function (not implemented here) would need to be tailored to parse the JSON response and select the appropriate public key based on criteria like key ID and expiration time.  Error handling is crucial, as key retrieval can fail due to network issues or invalid metadata format.  The actual extraction of the public key from the JSON response will depend on how AADB2C returns the keys, this is an example.

**Resource Recommendations:**

Microsoft's official Azure Active Directory B2C documentation.  Books on JWT and OAuth 2.0.  Articles focusing on securing applications with JWT and handling refresh tokens.  A comprehensive understanding of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is essential.  Explore libraries specific to your programming language for simplifying JWT handling and public key retrieval.


This detailed analysis and illustrative code examples should provide a solid foundation for diagnosing and resolving "token invalid" errors within AADB2C.  Remember that careful consideration of token lifespans, audience validation, and key management are crucial for secure and robust application integration with Azure AD B2C.
