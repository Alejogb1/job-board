The core challenge in extracting minimum and maximum predicted values from a Keras model stems from the fact that Keras primarily focuses on training models and generating predictions, not explicitly identifying these extreme values *after* prediction. Direct access to the raw predictions before post-processing or application of an activation function is critical, and we must manage this process deliberately. My experiences building regression models for time-series forecasting highlighted this need for precise output analysis, forcing me to move beyond the standard prediction methods.

The initial step is to obtain the raw model output on the data we intend to analyze. This typically involves using the `model.predict()` function in Keras. However, the output format and structure are vital, and will often require further transformation. Consider a model that predicts a single continuous value, like temperature, for multiple input instances. The `model.predict()` function will return a NumPy array (or similar array-like structure) where each row corresponds to an input instance, and each column represents a predicted output, potentially with post-processing from an output layer's activation. Our goal is to isolate those raw predicted values before this processing if itâ€™s applied.

The next critical step involves retrieving the minimum and maximum value from this prediction data. NumPy provides the necessary utilities for this, such as `np.min()` and `np.max()`. We're not merely interested in the overall minimum and maximum across all predictions, but potentially in the minimum and maximum *for each* output feature in multi-output problems. Furthermore, understanding the data structure that the model generates is paramount. If the output from `model.predict()` is a structured array or a list of arrays, we must access each component correctly before applying NumPy operations. I have frequently found myself debugging this aspect to correctly align input shapes with the prediction output.

Let me illustrate through a series of examples how this is achieved in practice. In the first scenario, consider a straightforward regression model predicting a single output feature.

**Example 1: Single Output Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Generate dummy data for demonstration
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Find the minimum and maximum predicted values
min_value = np.min(predictions)
max_value = np.max(predictions)

print(f"Minimum Predicted Value: {min_value}")
print(f"Maximum Predicted Value: {max_value}")
```

In this code example, we generate a basic Keras sequential model having one output, and a dataset `X_test`. We use `model.predict` to compute the output. Critically, the prediction output is a NumPy array with shape `(100, 1)`. `np.min()` and `np.max()` operate on the flattened array. The resulting values represent the smallest and largest single predicted values for our test data. Notice how I didn't explicitly include the output activation function. I often find these are included more frequently in classification problems.

Next, consider a more complex case, one with multiple output predictions. This might be relevant if, for example, we're simultaneously predicting multiple variables from a single input.

**Example 2: Multiple Output Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a Keras model with multiple outputs
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3) # Three output values
])

# Generate dummy data
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Find minimum and maximum for each output feature
min_values = np.min(predictions, axis=0) # Minimum across rows (input samples) for each column
max_values = np.max(predictions, axis=0) # Maximum across rows for each column

print("Minimum Predicted Values (per output feature):", min_values)
print("Maximum Predicted Values (per output feature):", max_values)

```

In this example, the output layer has three units. As such `model.predict()` outputs a NumPy array with shape `(100, 3)`. Here, `np.min` and `np.max` take an `axis` parameter. Setting `axis=0` means that the calculation is performed along the rows, thus producing a minimum and maximum *for each output variable*, across all the input data. My experience has shown this technique is needed in a majority of practical cases when working with multi-output regression. This ensures a thorough analysis of the predicted range per feature, avoiding aggregation across all outputs which would mask the distribution of each.

The third example delves into the scenario where custom activation functions are involved or where we need to look at the intermediate outputs. I sometimes found myself needing to identify these values before a final activation function is applied.

**Example 3: Analyzing Intermediate Outputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a Keras model
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        # Here is where the critical manipulation happens.
        intermediate_output = x # Access before final layer.
        x = self.dense2(x) # Final output
        return x, intermediate_output

model = MyModel()

# Generate dummy data
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Obtain predictions
predictions, intermediate_values = model(X_test) # Get both final and intermediate output

# Find minimum and maximum of the final predictions
min_value_final = np.min(predictions)
max_value_final = np.max(predictions)
print("Min & Max of final output",min_value_final, max_value_final)

# Find the min and max of the intermediate layer
min_values_intermediate = np.min(intermediate_values, axis=0) # for each intermediate neuron
max_values_intermediate = np.max(intermediate_values, axis=0)
print("Min of intermediate output per neuron", min_values_intermediate)
print("Max of intermediate output per neuron", max_values_intermediate)

```

This example illustrates how we can access intermediate outputs. The crucial change involves defining the model using Keras' subclassing API. Here I override the `call` method to return *both* the final prediction from the second dense layer and the intermediate output *before* this second layer. We can subsequently analyze both. This approach allows for a more granular level of analysis and has been helpful when I wanted to examine activation distributions.  The `intermediate_values` will have a shape of (100, 128), hence we use `axis=0` to get the min/max of each neuron.

For further exploration, I would suggest reading the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.Model`, `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, and the relevant NumPy documentation for array manipulation. I would also recommend a solid understanding of Keras Functional and Subclassing APIs as they will influence how you build and analyze your model. Books dedicated to deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras, often including hands-on code examples, prove useful for developing intuition.

In conclusion, finding minimum and maximum predicted values in Keras relies on carefully using the model's `predict()` method and understanding its output structure. NumPy's `np.min()` and `np.max()` are fundamental tools for this analysis. By considering various scenarios, including single-output, multi-output and even intermediate outputs using the Subclassing API, we can effectively extract the desired insights from trained Keras models. My work has consistently demonstrated the importance of these methods for detailed model evaluation.
