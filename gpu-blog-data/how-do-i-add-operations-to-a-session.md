The fundamental challenge in adding operations to an empty session graph lies in understanding the underlying execution model.  In my experience working with TensorFlow (prior to the 2.x eager execution paradigm shift, which simplifies this considerably), the session graph served as a static representation of the computation before execution.  An empty graph is simply an uninitialized computational structure;  it possesses no nodes representing operations.  Therefore, adding operations requires defining these nodes and then appropriately connecting them to form a valid computation graph.  Failure to do so results in execution errors or unexpected behavior.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three key steps:  defining the operations (nodes), establishing dependencies between them (edges), and finally initializing the session with the constructed graph. Operations are defined using TensorFlow's (or analogous framework's) function calls that represent specific mathematical or computational units.  These functions, such as `tf.add`, `tf.matmul`, or custom operations, become nodes in the graph.  Dependencies are implicitly defined based on the data flow: the output of one operation becomes the input of another.  The `tf.Session` object then orchestrates the execution of this defined graph.

Crucially, the order of operation definition matters.  Operations dependent on the output of others must be defined *after* the operations producing that output.  Incorrect ordering results in undefined behavior, similar to referencing a variable before its declaration in many programming languages.  For instance, attempting to add two tensors before defining the tensors themselves would fail.

The session is initialized with the constructed graph, enabling the execution of the defined operations.  It’s important to remember that before the `run()` method of a session is called, the graph remains largely passive; it only becomes active upon execution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Addition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the graph.  Note the explicit creation of the graph.  Prior to TensorFlow 2.x, this was more crucial.
graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(5.0, name="a")
    b = tf.constant(3.0, name="b")
    c = tf.add(a, b, name="c")

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(f"Result: {result}") # Output: Result: 8.0
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental steps. A graph is explicitly created.  Within the graph's scope, two constant tensors (`a` and `b`) and an addition operation (`c`) are defined.  The session then executes the graph, computing the sum.  The `tf.compat.v1.Session` is used here for backward compatibility, maintaining the explicit graph creation model of older TensorFlow versions.


**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    matrix1 = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], name="matrix1")
    matrix2 = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], name="matrix2")
    product = tf.matmul(matrix1, matrix2, name="product")

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    result = sess.run(product)
    print(f"Result:\n{result}") # Output: Result: [[19. 22.] [43. 50.]]
```

This expands upon the first example, illustrating matrix multiplication (`tf.matmul`).  The principle remains the same: define the operations (matrix constants and multiplication), then execute them within the session’s context.  Note the consistent usage of `tf.constant` for defining the input data; this is essential as the graph is static.

**Example 3: Placeholder for Dynamic Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 2], name="x")
    W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 1]), name="weights")
    b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name="bias")
    y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

    init = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer() # Initialize variables

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    sess.run(init) # Crucial step to initialize variables
    input_data = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
    result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: input_data})
    print(f"Result:\n{result}")
```

This example introduces placeholders (`tf.compat.v1.placeholder`) and variables (`tf.Variable`). Placeholders allow for dynamic input at runtime, while variables maintain state across multiple executions.  Note the crucial `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` call, which is necessary to allocate and initialize the variables before execution.  The `feed_dict` argument supplies the actual data to the placeholder during execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official documentation of the relevant deep learning framework (TensorFlow 1.x, PyTorch, etc.).  Focus specifically on the sections detailing graph construction, session management, and variable initialization.   A well-structured textbook on deep learning fundamentals will provide a broader context.  Finally, studying example code from reputable sources, particularly those found in research papers, can be highly beneficial for learning practical implementation strategies.  Pay close attention to how data flow is managed and operations are sequenced within those examples.
