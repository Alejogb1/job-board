In my experience, inconsistencies in device placement for tensors within a custom PyTorch module are a common source of errors, particularly when working with CUDA. The fundamental issue stems from the fact that PyTorch does not automatically manage device affinity for tensors created within custom layers or modules. It's the developer's responsibility to explicitly ensure all operations and intermediary tensors reside on the same CUDA device, especially when dealing with multi-GPU systems. Left unmanaged, this can lead to runtime exceptions such as “Expected all tensors to be on the same device.”

The core principle to guarantee proper tensor placement is to propagate the device information from the input tensors to all subsequent tensors within the module. This propagation can be accomplished using a combination of techniques including explicit `.to(device)` calls, using the `torch.device` object, and careful management of module parameters.

A typical workflow I follow when defining a custom module involves first checking the device of the initial input tensor. This information is then used to explicitly place all newly created tensors onto the same device before performing subsequent computations. Failure to do so risks operating on a CPU tensor or a tensor on the incorrect GPU, resulting in an error.

Let me illustrate this with a few code examples. I’ve encountered these scenarios often, and these patterns have proven effective.

**Example 1: Basic Device Placement**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(MyCustomModule, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, input_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        device = x.device  # Get the device from the input tensor
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x) # no need to push these since they are already on the correct device from linear layer
        return x

# Example usage:
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  device = torch.device("cuda:0")
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 5).to(device)
else:
  device = torch.device("cpu")
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10,5).to(device)

model = MyCustomModule(5, 10).to(device)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Output device: {output.device}")
```

In this basic example, I first retrieve the device from the input tensor `x` within the `forward` method. The linear layers (`self.fc1` and `self.fc2`) as well as the activation function (`torch.relu`) automatically maintain the same device as their input.  Notice that the model itself is also placed on the specified device at initialization with `.to(device)`. This method ensures that all parameters associated with the `nn.Linear` layers are on the correct device initially. The input tensor is also moved to this device prior to calling the forward pass. This basic pattern forms the foundation for more complex scenarios.

**Example 2: Explicitly moving all created tensors.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(MyCustomModule, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, input_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        device = x.device
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        intermediate_tensor = torch.randn(x.shape).to(device) # Explicitly create and move a tensor
        x = x + intermediate_tensor
        x = self.fc2(x)

        return x


# Example usage:
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  device = torch.device("cuda:0")
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 5).to(device)
else:
  device = torch.device("cpu")
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10,5).to(device)

model = MyCustomModule(5, 10).to(device)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Output device: {output.device}")

```

In this second example, I've introduced an intermediary tensor `intermediate_tensor` created using `torch.randn`. The creation of this tensor, if not explicitly pushed to the correct device, defaults to the CPU. Therefore, before using it, I ensure it resides on the same device as the input tensor using `.to(device)`. This showcases how even explicitly created tensors must have their device affinity set correctly. I routinely find that overlooking tensors like these leads to device errors. All tensors involved must be on the same device for any arithmetic operations or layer computations to execute successfully in PyTorch. Note that the model itself and the original input tensor are moved to the correct device during instantiation.

**Example 3: Using Parameters as References**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(MyCustomModule, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, input_size)) # Using a parameter instead
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, input_size)


    def forward(self, x):
        device = x.device
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)

        weighted_x = torch.matmul(x, self.weight.to(device)) # Using parameter after explicitly placing on device
        x = x + weighted_x
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Example usage:
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  device = torch.device("cuda:0")
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 5).to(device)
else:
  device = torch.device("cpu")
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10,5).to(device)

model = MyCustomModule(5, 10).to(device)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Output device: {output.device}")
```

This final example introduces `nn.Parameter` and further illustrates how device affinity is propagated using another layer attribute. Here, `self.weight` is an explicitly defined parameter initialized as a tensor. While these parameters, initialized during module creation, are inherently placed on the same device as the module, it is considered best practice to explicitly specify the device to be sure. Inside the `forward` pass, I use `self.weight.to(device)` to explicitly push the parameter tensor onto the correct device before performing the matrix multiplication, thereby ensuring compatibility. If this `.to(device)` operation is omitted, then it will be using the default CPU value that gets created as a base layer parameter. Using `nn.Parameter` in this way, I'm able to incorporate more complex layers, custom matrix multiplications, or other operations requiring a fixed parameter set in the module. Again, the model itself and input tensors are moved to device at initialization.

In summary, consistent device management within custom PyTorch modules is crucial for CUDA tensor processing. The three examples illustrate the fundamental pattern of extracting the device from the input tensor and then explicitly placing all other tensors on the same device using the `.to(device)` method. Failure to adhere to these practices leads to device-related errors, and debugging such errors can be time-consuming. It's important to make sure that any tensors created either explicitly, through another layer, or as a parameter are tracked to make sure they are on the same device.

For further reading, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on tensors and device management. Articles and tutorials focused on CUDA best practices are also valuable. Specifically, studying the use of `torch.cuda.is_available()`, `torch.device`, and the `.to()` method are key.
