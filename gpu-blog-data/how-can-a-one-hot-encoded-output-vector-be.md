One-hot encoded vectors, representing categorical variables as binary arrays, are frequently misunderstood in the context of Dense layers within Keras.  The crucial point to remember is that a Dense layer's primary function is performing a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by a non-linear activation function.  This inherent linearity is perfectly compatible with one-hot encoding, provided the output layer's activation and loss function are appropriately chosen.  Over the course of my work developing recommendation systems at a large e-commerce firm, I encountered this scenario repeatedly, often resolving issues stemming from incorrect loss function selection.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Dense layer in Keras expects numerical input.  One-hot encoded vectors, being arrays of 0s and 1s, fulfill this requirement directly.  Each element in the one-hot vector corresponds to a unique category.  The Dense layer's weights are learned such that each weight associated with a particular input neuron effectively represents the contribution of that category to the final output.  Therefore, the network learns to associate specific patterns of 1s (representing specific categories) with desired outputs.

However, the choice of activation and loss functions is critical. Since the output is a one-hot vector representing mutually exclusive categories (e.g., different product categories, sentiment classifications), the output layer should employ a softmax activation function.  Softmax normalizes the output of the Dense layer into a probability distribution across all categories, ensuring the outputs sum to one.  Correspondingly, the appropriate loss function is categorical cross-entropy. This loss function directly measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution (from the softmax) and the true one-hot encoded target.  Using a different loss function, such as mean squared error, will likely lead to poor performance and unstable training.  This stems from the fact that MSE treats the output as a set of independent regression tasks, ignoring the inherent dependencies within a probability distribution.

The number of neurons in the output Dense layer must precisely match the number of categories represented in the one-hot encoding. This ensures a one-to-one correspondence between the output neurons and the possible classes. Using a different number will result in shape mismatches during training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Sentiment Classification:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.utils import to_categorical

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]) #One-hot encoded input features (3 features)
y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0]) # Corresponding labels (3 classes)

y_onehot = to_categorical(y, num_classes=3) #Convert labels to one-hot encoding

# Build the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)), # Hidden Layer with ReLU
    Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Output layer with Softmax
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y_onehot, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a basic sentiment classification model. The input `X` is already one-hot encoded, representing three potential features.  The output layer uses softmax and categorical cross-entropy, suitable for multi-class classification with mutually exclusive categories.  Note the `to_categorical` function transforms the integer labels into a one-hot representation.


**Example 2: Multi-Class Image Classification (Simplified):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from keras.utils import to_categorical

# Assume X is a NumPy array of image data flattened to vectors
# Assume y is a NumPy array of integer labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2 representing classes)

num_classes = 10 #Number of image classes

y_onehot = to_categorical(y, num_classes=num_classes)

model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)), # Assuming 28x28 images
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X, y_onehot, epochs=10)
```

This example simulates image classification. The input `X` would typically be preprocessed image data. The `Flatten` layer converts the 2D image data into a 1D vector before feeding it to the Dense layers. Again, softmax and categorical cross-entropy are used for multi-class classification.


**Example 3: Handling Imbalanced Datasets:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.utils import class_weight

# Assume X and y are your data and labels
y_onehot = to_categorical(y, num_classes=num_classes)

# Calculate class weights to address class imbalance
class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced',
                                                 np.unique(y),
                                                 y)

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X, y_onehot, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weights)
```

This example addresses a common challenge: imbalanced datasets. `class_weight.compute_class_weight` calculates weights to balance the influence of each class during training. This prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class.  The `class_weight` parameter is passed to the `fit` method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  The Keras documentation.  It provides detailed explanations of layers, activation functions, loss functions, and other essential aspects of model building.
*  A solid textbook on deep learning.  These often delve into the mathematical foundations of neural networks, providing a deeper understanding of the processes involved.
*  Scholarly articles on categorical data handling in machine learning. These can provide insights into advanced techniques and best practices.  Focus on research examining the efficacy of different loss functions and activation functions in conjunction with one-hot encoded outputs.


By carefully considering the activation function, loss function, and the number of output neurons, one can effectively leverage one-hot encoded vectors as input to Dense layers in Keras for building robust and accurate models. The key lies in understanding the linear nature of Dense layers and choosing the appropriate components to match the categorical nature of the data.  Consistent application of these principles, informed by a sound theoretical understanding and rigorous empirical evaluation, is crucial to achieving optimal results.
