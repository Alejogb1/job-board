Overriding a Docker image's entrypoint with a new executable often fails due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how Docker's execution lifecycle interacts with the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` instructions within a Dockerfile.  My experience troubleshooting containerization issues for large-scale deployments has highlighted this repeatedly.  The key is recognizing that `ENTRYPOINT` defines the *main process* of the container, and `CMD` provides *default arguments* to that process.  Overriding with a simple `docker run` command doesn't replace the defined entrypoint; instead, it appends arguments.  This behavior is often unexpected, leading to failures.

**1.  Understanding the Execution Lifecycle**

When a Docker container starts, the execution sequence is as follows:

1. **Image Layers:** The Docker image, built from a Dockerfile, consists of layered filesystems. These layers contain the application code, dependencies, and system libraries.

2. **ENTRYPOINT Execution:** The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, if present, defines the primary executable that will be run. This executable becomes the main process of the container.  It's critical to understand that the `ENTRYPOINT` is not merely a command; it's the *process that governs the lifecycle* of the container.  The container will stop when this process terminates.

3. **CMD Argument Application:**  The `CMD` instruction, if present, supplies default arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` command. If the `ENTRYPOINT` is not specified, the `CMD` becomes the primary process.

4. **`docker run` Overrides (Argument Appending):** When executing `docker run`, any provided command-line arguments are *appended* to the `CMD` arguments,  *not* replacing the `ENTRYPOINT`.  This is a crucial distinction.

5. **Process Execution:**  The container's main process, defined by `ENTRYPOINT` (or `CMD` if no `ENTRYPOINT` exists), starts execution with the combined arguments.

6. **Container Termination:** The container remains running as long as the main process continues to run. When the main process terminates (either gracefully or due to an error), the container automatically stops.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate the behavior with three examples, using a fictitious application named `my-app`.

**Example 1: Correct Entrypoint and CMD Usage**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY my-app /my-app
RUN chmod +x /my-app

ENTRYPOINT ["/my-app"]
CMD ["start"]
```

```bash
# This correctly runs my-app with the "start" argument
docker run my-image
```

Here, `/my-app` is the main process. "start" is the default argument.  The container runs as intended.


**Example 2: Incorrect Attempt at Overriding with `docker run`**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY my-app /my-app
RUN chmod +x /my-app

ENTRYPOINT ["/my-app"]
CMD ["start"]
```

```bash
# This attempts to override, but appends instead
docker run my-image stop
```

This *does not* replace `/my-app` with `stop`. Instead, it attempts to run `/my-app stop`, which is likely to fail if `my-app` isn't designed to accept "stop" as a command-line argument.  My experience indicates this is the most common source of confusion.


**Example 3: Correct Overriding using `docker run --entrypoint`**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY my-app /my-app
RUN chmod +x /my-app

ENTRYPOINT ["/my-app"]
CMD ["start"]
```

```bash
# This correctly overrides the entrypoint.
docker run --entrypoint="/bin/sh" -it my-image -c "my-app stop"
```

This demonstrates the correct approach to replacing the entrypoint.  The `--entrypoint` flag explicitly sets the main process to `/bin/sh`. The `-c` flag then allows execution of a shell command (`my-app stop`), which is far more likely to be successful. Note the use of `-it` for interactive operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official Docker documentation is invaluable; it provides detailed explanations of `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` functionalities and the intricacies of image building and container execution.  Thoroughly reviewing the sections on Dockerfiles and the `docker run` command is highly recommended.  Further, exploring resources on process management in Linux will enhance understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in container operation.  Consulting advanced Docker tutorials and best practices guides will clarify sophisticated scenarios and help prevent common pitfalls.  Consider dedicated books and online courses focusing on containerization and orchestration.  These provide a more systematic understanding than scattered blog posts or forum threads.
