The `ImageDataGenerator` class in Keras, prior to TensorFlow 2.0, employed a different workflow for data augmentation and preprocessing compared to its current iteration.  My experience working on a large-scale image classification project in 2018 highlighted this distinction.  The crucial point is that the `fit_generator` method was associated with the `Model.fit_generator` method, not directly with the `ImageDataGenerator` itself. This often led to confusion among developers unfamiliar with the pre-2.0 Keras API.  The `ImageDataGenerator` simply provided preprocessed data; the model's training loop handled the iteration.  The shift to TensorFlow 2.0 and the `fit` method streamlined this process, eliminating the need for `fit_generator`.


1. **Clear Explanation:**

The absence of a `fit_generator` attribute within the `ImageDataGenerator` class stems from the evolution of Keras's data handling mechanisms.  In older versions (pre-TensorFlow 2.0), Keras utilized a generator-based approach to train models on large datasets that couldn't fit into memory. The `Model.fit_generator` method accepted a generator (often created using `ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory` or a custom generator) as input, iterating through it batch by batch during training.  The `ImageDataGenerator` itself remained solely responsible for reading, augmenting, and preprocessing image data.  It didn't perform the training loop; it only supplied the data to the training loop.

The TensorFlow 2.0 update introduced a significant paradigm shift. The emphasis moved toward a more streamlined and unified training API.  The `Model.fit` method was enhanced to directly accept various data inputs, including generators.  This simplification eliminated the need for a separate `fit_generator` method on the model itself. Consequently, the `ImageDataGenerator` retained its core functionality of data augmentation and preprocessing, but its role within the training process became implicit, integrated seamlessly into the `Model.fit` method.  The explicit reliance on a separate `fit_generator` call became obsolete.  This improved code readability and maintained backward compatibility by allowing the use of generators within the `fit` method.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Pre-TensorFlow 2.0 approach (Illustrative, not directly executable without the old API):**

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# ...Model Definition...

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, shear_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2)
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        'train_data',
        target_size=(150, 150),
        batch_size=32,
        class_mode='categorical')

model.fit_generator(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=2000, epochs=10) # Note fit_generator
```

*Commentary:* This code snippet demonstrates the older approach.  `ImageDataGenerator` created `train_generator`, and `model.fit_generator` explicitly consumed this generator for training. The `steps_per_epoch` argument indicates the number of batches per epoch.  This approach is outdated and not compatible with current Keras versions.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.0 approach using `fit` with a generator:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# ...Model Definition...

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, shear_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2)
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        'train_data',
        target_size=(150, 150),
        batch_size=32,
        class_mode='categorical')

model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:* This example showcases the modern, simplified approach. The `ImageDataGenerator` still generates the data, but the `model.fit` method directly handles the iteration, eliminating the need for `fit_generator`. The method implicitly manages the data flow from the generator. The number of steps per epoch is automatically determined based on the size of the training set and batch size.


**Example 3: TensorFlow 2.0 approach with `tf.data.Dataset` (for improved performance):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# ...Model Definition...

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, shear_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2)
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    lambda: train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        'train_data',
        target_size=(150, 150),
        batch_size=32,
        class_mode='categorical'),
    output_signature=(tf.TensorSpec(shape=(32, 150, 150, 3), dtype=tf.float32),
                      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(32, num_classes), dtype=tf.float32)))

model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:* This advanced example utilizes `tf.data.Dataset` for creating a highly optimized data pipeline.  It leverages the flexibility of `tf.data` for potentially improved performance, particularly for very large datasets. The `output_signature` explicitly defines the data types and shapes for better performance and error checking.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering Keras and `tf.data`, provides comprehensive information on data handling and model training.  A thorough understanding of Python generators is essential.  Consult advanced machine learning texts focusing on deep learning frameworks for a deeper grasp of the underlying concepts and best practices.  Exploring examples and tutorials related to image classification within the TensorFlow ecosystem will be highly beneficial.  Reviewing the Keras changelog will offer insight into the changes introduced with TensorFlow 2.0.
