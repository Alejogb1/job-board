The core difference between `nvprof` and `ncu` lies in their profiling methodologies.  `nvprof` utilizes a kernel-level instrumentation approach, providing detailed profiling data encompassing both CPU and GPU activities, whereas `ncu` focuses primarily on GPU profiling via hardware counters, offering a distinct performance analysis perspective.  Direct replication of `nvprof`'s default behavior with `ncu` is therefore impossible due to the fundamental divergence in their data collection mechanisms. However, we can approximate certain aspects of `nvprof`'s functionality using appropriate `ncu` commands and post-processing techniques.  My experience troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in high-throughput scientific simulations has highlighted this distinction repeatedly.

To clarify, `nvprof` offers a broader view, capturing kernel launches, memory transfers, and CPU-related overheads.  `ncu` prioritizes GPU-centric metrics, providing precise measurements of hardware utilization and detailed instruction-level statistics. This inherent difference necessitates a strategic approach to achieve a comparable, though not identical, profiling outcome.  We must strategically select `ncu`'s options to focus on the specific metrics mirroring those considered most relevant from `nvprof`'s default output.

The key to approximating `nvprof`'s default behavior is to leverage `ncu`'s ability to profile based on hardware counters. By carefully selecting relevant counters, we can gain insight into GPU utilization, memory access patterns, and instruction throughput, mimicking some of the information typically presented by `nvprof`.


**1.  Focusing on Kernel Execution Time:**

`nvprof`'s default report frequently highlights kernel execution times.  We can approximate this using `ncu` by focusing on the `sm__cycles_active` counter, which measures the number of active cycles on the streaming multiprocessors.  Combining this with the kernel launch information from `ncu`'s output enables an estimation of kernel execution time.  However, it's important to remember that this is an approximation, as `nvprof`'s kernel execution time is typically more inclusive, considering overhead beyond pure compute cycles.

**Code Example 1:**

```bash
ncu --metrics sm__cycles_active ./my_kernel_executable
```

This command profiles `my_kernel_executable` using only the `sm__cycles_active` counter. The output will contain the total active cycles, which can then be used to estimate execution time given the GPU clock frequency.   Note: This requires post-processing to correlate the cycles with specific kernels, which `ncu`'s output readily provides in a structured format suitable for scripting.  I've often used Python with libraries like Pandas for this purpose.

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a direct focus on a key metric, but it lacks the comprehensive context provided by `nvprof`'s default output. It is a starting point for replicating a specific aspect, but not a complete replacement.


**2.  Analyzing Memory Access Patterns:**

`nvprof` often shows information regarding global memory access, which is crucial for identifying memory bandwidth bottlenecks.  `ncu` can provide similar insights using counters related to memory transactions.  This includes counters like `dram__bytes_read`, `dram__bytes_written`, and `l2__bytes_read`, `l2__bytes_written` which indicate the amount of data read from and written to DRAM and L2 cache respectively.

**Code Example 2:**

```bash
ncu --metrics dram__bytes_read,dram__bytes_written,l2__bytes_read,l2__bytes_written ./my_kernel_executable
```

This command profiles the application using multiple counters to analyze memory traffic. Examining the relative values of these counters, alongside the overall kernel execution time (approximated as above), helps in identifying memory-bound performance limitations.

**Commentary:** This approach allows for a more granular analysis of memory access, which `nvprof` also offers, though its visualization might differ.  Understanding the interplay between memory access patterns and kernel execution time is key for optimizing memory-intensive applications. This requires understanding the application's memory access patterns and aligning the analysis with that knowledge.


**3.  Investigating Occupancy and Warp Divergence:**

`nvprof` often includes information about GPU occupancy and warp divergence, both critical factors impacting performance.  `ncu` can provide related metrics. While direct equivalents might not exist, examining `sm__inst_executed` (instructions executed per SM) in conjunction with `sm__active_warps` (number of active warps per SM) can give a good sense of occupancy and potential divergence issues.  Lower-than-expected instruction execution relative to active warps suggests warp divergence which is a vital piece of information not to be overlooked.

**Code Example 3:**

```bash
ncu --metrics sm__inst_executed,sm__active_warps ./my_kernel_executable
```

This command profiles the application focusing on the instruction execution and active warps per SM. Analyzing the ratio of these metrics across different kernels or sections within the kernel can reveal potential performance limitations related to occupancy and divergence.


**Commentary:** This example leverages the power of `ncu`'s low-level hardware counter access to indirectly gather information comparable to occupancy and divergence analysis performed by `nvprof`.  Analyzing the variation in these metrics across different parts of the code can reveal areas for optimization.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA Nsight Compute User Guide.  The NVIDIA Nsight Systems User Guide.  Documentation related to CUDA profiling tools and techniques.  Furthermore, a strong foundation in CUDA programming and parallel computing principles is essential for effectively interpreting the profiling data from both `nvprof` and `ncu`.  Understanding the architecture of NVIDIA GPUs (SMs, memory hierarchy, etc.) is also crucial for interpreting the counters effectively.


In conclusion, while a perfect replication of `nvprof`'s default behavior using `ncu` is not feasible due to inherent differences in their approaches, a substantial approximation can be achieved by strategically selecting hardware counters and judiciously analyzing the resulting data. Combining this with a good grasp of CUDA programming and GPU architecture leads to insightful performance analysis, enabling effective optimization of parallel applications.  Remember that the key is not aiming for a direct reproduction but for acquiring the critical performance data that addresses the primary bottlenecks discovered during profiling.
