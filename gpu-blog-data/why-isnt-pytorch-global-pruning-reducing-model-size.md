Global pruning in PyTorch, while conceptually straightforward, often fails to deliver the expected model size reduction due to the interplay between the pruning algorithm's implementation and the underlying PyTorch data structures.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across several large-scale NLP projects revealed a crucial oversight: the pruned weights are frequently *removed logically*, not physically. This means the parameters remain within the model's state dictionary, consuming memory despite being deemed unimportant by the pruning process.

**1. Explanation:**

PyTorch's pruning functionalities, typically accessed through the `torch.nn.utils.prune` module, predominantly implement *sparse* pruning methods.  These methods identify less-important weights based on criteria like magnitude or gradient, and then mark them for removal. However, this marking often involves setting the weight to zero or a very small value. The critical detail here is that the weight tensor itself persists in the model's parameter space.  The model architecture remains unchanged; only the values within the weight tensors are altered.  Standard saving and loading procedures, therefore, will not reduce the model's file size, as the entire tensor, including the zeroed-out weights, is still serialized.

This differs from what one might intuitively expect â€“ a structural change in the model's architecture, where entire neurons or layers are physically removed.  Global pruning usually aims for a certain sparsity level (e.g., 90% sparsity), meaning 90% of the weights are deemed insignificant.  Achieving an actual 90% reduction in model size requires a post-pruning step to explicitly remove these weights from the model's structure. This often necessitates manual manipulation of the model's state dictionary or the use of specialized libraries designed for efficient sparse model representation.

Another contributing factor is the presence of buffers and other model attributes unrelated to the pruned weights. These elements remain unaffected by the pruning process and contribute to the overall model size.  Similarly, the optimizer's state, if saved alongside the model, adds to the file size, masking the effect of the weight pruning.  Finally, the chosen serialization format (e.g., PyTorch's native `.pt` format versus ONNX) also impacts the final file size; some formats are more efficient in representing sparse tensors than others.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the issue and demonstrate a potential solution.  These are simplified for clarity but capture the core concepts.

**Example 1: Standard Global Pruning (No Size Reduction)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.utils import prune

# Define a simple linear layer
model = nn.Linear(10, 5)

# Apply global pruning (90% sparsity)
prune.global_unstructured(model, name="weight", amount=0.9)

# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "pruned_model.pt")

# Observe that pruned_model.pt is not significantly smaller than a non-pruned model
```

In this example, the `global_unstructured` function sets 90% of the weights in the `model.weight` tensor to zero.  However, the tensor itself remains the same size, leading to minimal file size reduction.

**Example 2: Manual Weight Removal (Partial Size Reduction)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.utils import prune
import numpy as np

# ... (Model definition and pruning as in Example 1) ...

# Manually remove pruned weights
pruned_weights = model.weight.data.cpu().numpy()
mask = np.abs(pruned_weights) > 0  # Identify non-zero weights
new_weights = pruned_weights[mask].reshape(np.sum(mask), -1)

# Create a new, smaller weight tensor
model.weight.data = torch.from_numpy(new_weights).to(model.weight.device)

# Adjust biases if necessary (only those corresponding to remaining weights)

# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "pruned_model_manual.pt")
```

This example demonstrates a post-pruning step. We manually extract the non-zero weights, creating a smaller weight tensor.  This leads to a more significant reduction in the model size, although it's still not optimal without addressing the structure changes.


**Example 3: Using a Sparse Tensor Library (Significant Size Reduction)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.utils import prune
import scipy.sparse as sparse

# ... (Model definition and pruning as in Example 1) ...

# Convert to sparse representation (e.g., CSR format)
sparse_weights = sparse.csr_matrix(model.weight.data.cpu().numpy())

# Save using a format supporting sparse tensors (this part requires a library capable of handling sparse tensors within a custom serialization mechanism)
# This would involve using a format that explicitly encodes the sparsity and avoids storing the zero-valued elements.  The precise implementation varies greatly depending on the chosen library.
# ... (Code to save the model using a sparse tensor library) ...
```

This third example illustrates leveraging a dedicated sparse tensor library to reduce the storage space.  This is often the most effective solution for considerable model size reduction, as it directly addresses the fundamental issue of storing only the non-zero elements.  However, this approach necessitates careful handling of the data structure conversion and the selection of a suitable serialization method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official PyTorch documentation on the `torch.nn.utils.prune` module.  Explore advanced tutorials on model compression techniques, particularly those focusing on pruning and quantization.  Familiarize yourself with sparse tensor libraries and their integration with PyTorch.  Review research papers on efficient model representations for sparse neural networks.


In summary, simply applying global pruning in PyTorch is insufficient for achieving significant model size reduction.  The process primarily involves logical removal, requiring further steps such as manual weight removal or employing specialized sparse tensor libraries to realize substantial space savings.  Careful consideration of the chosen methodology and post-processing steps is essential for successful model compression through pruning.
