Determining thread write positions within a 3D CUDA kernel employing nested `for` loops requires a precise understanding of thread indexing and memory allocation.  The key lies in correctly mapping the three-dimensional problem space onto the two-dimensional grid and block structure CUDA utilizes.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations for geophysical modeling has highlighted the critical role of efficient index calculation to avoid race conditions and maximize performance.  Incorrect indexing invariably leads to data corruption and unpredictable results.

The core issue is translating the three nested loop iterators into a unique linear index for the output array.  This linear index determines where each thread writes its computed result.  Failure to perform this translation correctly leads to threads overwriting each other’s data, rendering the computation invalid.  We must explicitly leverage the `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx` built-in variables provided by CUDA.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The CUDA execution model organizes threads into blocks, and blocks into a grid.  A 3D grid is specified as `dim3 gridDim(grid_x, grid_y, grid_z)` and a 3D block as `dim3 blockDim(block_x, block_y, block_z)`.  Each thread within a block is identified by its 3D coordinates `threadIdx.x`, `threadIdx.y`, `threadIdx.z`,  while the block's position in the grid is given by `blockIdx.x`, `blockIdx.y`, `blockIdx.z`.  To calculate the linear index for a 3D array, we must consider the dimensions of the array and the thread's position within the grid and block.

Let's assume a 3D array `outputArray` with dimensions `(array_x, array_y, array_z)`. The linear index `index` for a given thread can be computed as follows:

```
index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * block_stride_x + threadIdx.x +
        blockIdx.y * blockDim.y * block_stride_y + threadIdx.y * stride_y +
        blockIdx.z * blockDim.z * block_stride_z + threadIdx.z * stride_z;
```

Where `block_stride_x = array_y * array_z`, `block_stride_y = array_z`, `stride_y = array_z`, and `block_stride_z = 1`, `stride_z = 1`. These stride values define how many elements are skipped to move to the next dimension.  This formula ensures that each thread gets a unique, non-overlapping index into the `outputArray`.  Critical to this approach is ensuring that the total number of threads launched does not exceed the size of the `outputArray`.  Otherwise, out-of-bounds writes will occur, leading to segmentation faults or corrupted data.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple 3D Summation:**

This example calculates the sum of elements in a 3D array.  Each thread calculates the sum of a single element.

```c++
__global__ void sum3D(const float* inputArray, float* outputArray, int array_x, int array_y, int array_z) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int z = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;

  if (x < array_x && y < array_y && z < array_z) {
    int index = z * array_x * array_y + y * array_x + x;
    outputArray[index] = inputArray[index]; // In a real summation, accumulate here
  }
}

// ... Kernel launch code ...
```

This simplifies the index calculation by directly using the 3D coordinates and the array dimensions.  The boundary check (`if` statement) prevents out-of-bounds access.  Note that this example only assigns the input value.  A genuine summation would involve atomic operations for thread safety or a reduction algorithm for efficiency.


**Example 2:  Matrix Multiplication (Simplified):**

This illustrates a portion of a matrix multiplication, focusing on the write operation.  It assumes a suitable method for calculating the partial sums.

```c++
__global__ void matrixMultiply(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int N) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < N && col < N) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        // ... Calculation of sum (omitted for brevity)...

        int index = row * N + col;
        C[index] = sum;
    }
}
// ... Kernel launch code ...
```

This example uses a 2D grid and block structure to efficiently handle matrix multiplication.  The index calculation is simplified for a 2D matrix.

**Example 3: Handling Irregular Data:**

Often, the data isn't perfectly regular.  This example demonstrates how to handle irregular data structures where the array’s dimensions are non-uniform. Let's consider a volume represented by a series of slices, each with varying numbers of elements.


```c++
__global__ void processIrregularVolume(const int* sliceSizes, const float* inputData, float* outputData, int numSlices){
    int sliceIndex = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;

    if(sliceIndex < numSlices){
        int threadIndexInSlice = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
        if(threadIndexInSlice < sliceSizes[sliceIndex]){
            int globalIndex = 0;
            for(int i=0; i < sliceIndex; ++i) globalIndex += sliceSizes[i];
            globalIndex += threadIndexInSlice;

            outputData[globalIndex] = inputData[globalIndex] * 2.0f; // Example operation
        }
    }
}

// ... Kernel launch code ...
```


This kernel utilizes a `sliceSizes` array to determine the size of each slice. The calculation of `globalIndex` accounts for the varying slice sizes to provide a correct write position.  The example operation is placeholder; real-world applications will substitute a suitable operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA C Programming Guide.  CUDA Best Practices Guide.  NVIDIA's official documentation on memory management and parallel programming techniques.  A comprehensive textbook on parallel computing algorithms and data structures.  Reference materials on linear algebra and numerical methods relevant to your specific application.


Remember, always profile your code to identify bottlenecks and optimize your kernel launch parameters (`gridDim` and `blockDim`) for maximum performance.  Thoroughly testing for out-of-bounds memory access and employing techniques like atomic operations or reduction algorithms where appropriate are crucial for correctness and efficiency.  Efficient memory access patterns are paramount for optimal performance.  The examples provided are simplified; production-level code would require error handling, more robust memory management, and optimized algorithms.
