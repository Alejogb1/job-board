Pre-processing data within a TensorFlow model itself, rather than as a separate step, can offer significant advantages in deployment, especially concerning graph optimization and avoiding inconsistencies between training and inference environments. However, directly inserting layers *before* the input layer of a restored `.pb` model is not straightforward because the input placeholder is typically a fixed point in the graph definition. Iâ€™ve encountered this challenge several times while integrating pre-trained models with custom data pipelines. The key is to identify the input node, modify the graph to connect new operations, and subsequently redefine the input.

The restored `.pb` graph, loaded using `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`, defines a series of interconnected operations represented as nodes. These nodes perform calculations, data movement, and management. Input data, often a placeholder, acts as a source node. To insert layers before this input, we need to essentially redirect the data flow. Instead of feeding input directly into the placeholder, the placeholder should now receive input from the output of our pre-processing layers. This involves creating new operations, linking their output to the placeholder node, and then adjusting how we feed data into the graph.

This process can be broken down into these fundamental steps: First, load the existing graph definition from the `.pb` file. Next, identify the input node. This is typically a placeholder, identifiable by its `dtype` and `name`. Then, create the desired preprocessing layers within the same graph, treating them as independent operations. These layers might involve normalization, resizing, or other data transformations. Finally, modify the existing graph by adjusting the placeholder node's inputs to point to the outputs of the created preprocessing layers, effectively routing the data through these new operations. A crucial part of this process is ensuring the names of the newly added operations do not clash with existing ones; this might require strategic name scoping or even renaming existing nodes for safety. We then need to redefine the input tensor for the overall graph.

Now, let's explore this with some practical examples.

**Example 1: Basic Normalization**

Let's assume the existing graph expects a raw image as input, and we want to add a simple normalization layer before it.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def insert_normalization(graph_def, input_name, mean, std):
    """Inserts a normalization layer before the specified input."""
    graph = tf.Graph()
    with graph.as_default():
        tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')

        # Find input placeholder
        input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(input_name + ':0')

        # Create normalization layer
        with tf.compat.v1.name_scope('pre_processing'):
          normalized_input = tf.compat.v1.div(tf.compat.v1.subtract(tf.cast(input_tensor, tf.float32), mean), std, name = 'normalized_input')

        # Update graph to use normalized input
        input_tensor.op._inputs = [normalized_input.op] # Direct pointer to op not output
        new_input = normalized_input

        return graph.as_graph_def(), new_input

# Assume `graph_def` is your loaded .pb graph
# Assume "input_placeholder" is your placeholder name in the existing .pb graph
mean = 127.5
std = 127.5
graph_def, new_input_tensor = insert_normalization(graph_def, "input_placeholder", mean, std)

# Now use the modified graph for inference
with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
    # Feed the normalized data
    output = sess.run( ... , feed_dict={new_input_tensor: ...})
```
Here, I first load the graph definition, locate the input placeholder by its name, and then define the normalization as a division by a standard deviation after subtracting the mean. It's important to cast the input to `tf.float32` for numeric computations. Instead of replacing the node directly, I've updated the input of the existing placeholder operation using the `_inputs` attribute. This makes the placeholder take data from the normalization layer output. The `new_input` variable will be used as the new input to the graph when running a session.

**Example 2: Resizing an Image**

This time, let's say the model expects a fixed size image, but the input might be varying in size. We will resize it before feeding into the model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def insert_resizing(graph_def, input_name, new_size):
  """Inserts a resizing layer before the specified input."""
  graph = tf.Graph()
  with graph.as_default():
      tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
      input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(input_name + ':0')

      with tf.compat.v1.name_scope('pre_processing'):
        resized_input = tf.compat.v1.image.resize(input_tensor, new_size,method = tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR, name = 'resized_input')

      input_tensor.op._inputs = [resized_input.op]
      new_input = resized_input
      return graph.as_graph_def(), new_input

# Assume `graph_def` is your loaded .pb graph
# Assume "input_placeholder" is your placeholder name in the existing .pb graph
new_size = [224, 224]
graph_def, new_input_tensor = insert_resizing(graph_def, "input_placeholder", new_size)

# Now use the modified graph for inference
with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
    # Feed the resized data
    output = sess.run( ... , feed_dict={new_input_tensor: ...})

```
Here, I've used `tf.image.resize` to handle the resizing to the `new_size`. We have opted for `BILINEAR` interpolation. This example is similar to the normalization example, but instead, we modify the graph using a different operation. The input data will undergo resizing before being fed to the rest of the graph.

**Example 3: Combining Multiple Pre-processing Steps**

Let's combine both normalization and resizing into one modified graph. This will showcase how to build up a more complex preprocessing pipeline before the input.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def insert_preprocessing(graph_def, input_name, mean, std, new_size):
  """Inserts resizing and normalization layers before the specified input."""
  graph = tf.Graph()
  with graph.as_default():
      tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
      input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name(input_name + ':0')

      with tf.compat.v1.name_scope('pre_processing'):
        resized_input = tf.compat.v1.image.resize(input_tensor, new_size,method = tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR, name = 'resized_input')
        normalized_input = tf.compat.v1.div(tf.compat.v1.subtract(tf.cast(resized_input, tf.float32), mean), std, name = 'normalized_input')


      input_tensor.op._inputs = [normalized_input.op]
      new_input = normalized_input
      return graph.as_graph_def(), new_input

# Assume `graph_def` is your loaded .pb graph
# Assume "input_placeholder" is your placeholder name in the existing .pb graph
mean = 127.5
std = 127.5
new_size = [224, 224]

graph_def, new_input_tensor = insert_preprocessing(graph_def, "input_placeholder", mean, std, new_size)


# Now use the modified graph for inference
with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
    # Feed the normalized and resized data
    output = sess.run( ... , feed_dict={new_input_tensor: ...})
```
Here, both resizing and normalization are applied, and the input will go through all of the pre-processing before entering the existing graph. These operations are linked sequentially, demonstrating how a series of operations can be included.

For further study, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation related to `tf.GraphDef`, `tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def`, and `tf.compat.v1.Graph` for in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Detailed examples using the `tf.image` module for image manipulation are also worth considering. Understanding the concept of `tf.Operation` and `tf.Tensor` and how they relate is important as well. Finally, being familiar with graph visualization tools like TensorBoard can help understand how the structure of a TensorFlow graph evolves and allows for more detailed debugging. Using these resources, one will be able to construct custom pipelines before the input of any graph.
