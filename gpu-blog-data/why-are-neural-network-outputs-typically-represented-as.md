Neural network outputs are predominantly represented as floating-point numbers due to the need for fine-grained representation of probabilities, continuous predictions, and the inherent nature of the mathematical operations within the network itself. Restricting outputs to integers would introduce a significant loss of information and severely limit the network's ability to learn complex mappings.

The core issue lies in the activation functions and weight adjustments that drive neural network training. Activation functions like sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU, commonly employed in various network layers, typically output values across a continuous spectrum, not discrete integers. A sigmoid function, for example, maps an input to a value between 0 and 1, representing a probability. Attempting to quantize this to an integer, say 0 or 1, would eradicate the nuanced probabilistic information conveyed by the original output, potentially leading to misclassification. ReLU, while producing values that can, at times, be integers, is defined across the real number line for the positive domain; artificially forcing it to integers would create discontinuities in the training landscape, hindering gradient-based optimization. Similarly, the intermediate outputs of linear layers result from multiplications and additions of potentially non-integer weights and inputs. Forcing these results to integers at each step would produce a network that fails to converge due to high information loss and the elimination of gradient flow essential for backpropagation.

Furthermore, many tasks neural networks are used for necessitate continuous outputs. Consider the case of regression tasks, such as predicting housing prices or stock values. These variables naturally exist on a continuum and cannot be accurately represented with integers. Forcing them to be integers would dramatically reduce prediction accuracy. Likewise, in classification problems, the output layer often utilizes a softmax activation, which generates a probability distribution across multiple classes, where the probability of each class is inherently a floating-point value summing to one. Mapping these probabilities to integers would not only be inaccurate but also difficult to interpret.

Let's illustrate these concepts with a few code examples. I'll use Python with NumPy, a common library for numerical computing in machine learning, to simulate these ideas. In a professional setting, these computations would typically happen inside a deep learning framework.

**Example 1: Impact of Floating-Point Activation Function**

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

input_val = np.array([0.5, -1.2, 2.0])
output_val = sigmoid(input_val)

print("Original Sigmoid Output:", output_val) # Output: [0.62245933 0.23147086 0.88079708]

#Attempting integer quantization:
integer_output = np.rint(output_val)
print("Integer Quantized Output:", integer_output)  #Output: [1. 0. 1.]
```

As the output from the `sigmoid` function demonstrates, the probabilities generated are floating-point numbers between 0 and 1. The first output, approximately 0.62, could be interpreted as an instance having a 62% probability of belonging to a certain class. However, upon attempting to reduce it to the nearest integer, this nuanced information is lost. We are left with either 1 or 0, lacking any granularity in the original prediction. This coarse approximation eliminates the fine distinctions that the network has learned to encode.

**Example 2: Continuous Regression Output**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulated linear output layer for regression.
# In actual practice, this would be part of a larger neural network,
# but the core idea is illustrated.
weights = np.array([1.2, -0.5])
inputs = np.array([3.1, 2.5])
output = np.dot(inputs, weights)
print("Original Regression Output:", output) # Output: 2.47

#Integer Quantization
int_output = int(round(output))
print("Integer Quantized Output:", int_output) # Output: 2
```

In this regression scenario, the original output of 2.47 represents a continuous prediction. Attempting to quantize it to the nearest integer value, 2,  results in a loss of precision. While this may not seem overly dramatic in this instance, these discrepancies become critical in complex regressions involving multiple interactions and features. This demonstrates why float precision is vital in these scenarios. If we had more samples or a more complex network, the error would become more apparent

**Example 3: Softmax Output in a Classification Scenario**

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(x):
  e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
  return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0)

# Simulate output logits from a classification network
logits = np.array([1.5, 0.2, -0.7])
probabilities = softmax(logits)
print("Softmax Probabilities", probabilities) # Output: [0.68846151 0.22141208 0.09012641]

#Integer Quantization
int_probabilities = np.rint(probabilities)
print("Quantized Probabilities", int_probabilities) # Output: [1. 0. 0.]

```

The softmax function, a cornerstone of multi-class classification, converts raw outputs (logits) into a probability distribution. In the above example, it shows the modelâ€™s likelihood across three different classes. The original output indicates that the model assigns a probability of approximately 0.69, 0.22, and 0.09 to each of the respective classes. When forced to integers by rounding, the information is lost, making it look like the model is very confident in one class when it was not. This can lead to significant problems in performance and make it very difficult to measure confidence.

In addition to the loss of information as seen in the examples, using floating point enables the neural network to leverage the mathematical properties of real numbers during optimization. The process of backpropagation relies on calculating derivatives (gradients) with respect to the weights and biases of the network. These gradients, which are critical for updating the parameters through gradient descent, are calculated using calculus and inherently involve continuous values. If the network operated solely with integers, we would encounter discontinuities and non-differentiable points, preventing backpropagation from working. Integer based systems make gradient calculations more complex and error prone.

For further exploration into these concepts, I recommend focusing on resources that cover the mathematical foundations of neural networks, specifically sections on activation functions, gradient descent, and backpropagation. Textbooks and courses dedicated to machine learning and deep learning often elaborate on the nuances of floating-point arithmetic in neural network computations. Additionally, research papers that address quantization techniques (methods of approximating floating-point values with lower-precision representations) can illuminate the trade-offs associated with integer approximations and highlight why they're not the default approach for neural network outputs. Sources that focus on specific activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax, can also offer deeper insight into why continuous outputs are necessary. Investigating the implementations of deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, can further help understand how floating-point numbers are handled in practice.
