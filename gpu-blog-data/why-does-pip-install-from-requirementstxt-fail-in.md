The discrepancy between successful individual package installations and the failure of `pip install -r requirements.txt` within a Dockerfile often stems from inconsistencies in the runtime environment and the underlying package dependencies, specifically regarding the presence of build dependencies not explicitly listed in `requirements.txt`.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects, ranging from microservices to data processing pipelines,  this oversight consistently proves problematic.  The Dockerfile's isolated nature magnifies these discrepancies, as it inherits nothing from the host system.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A `requirements.txt` file only specifies runtime dependencies;  it doesn't inherently include build dependencies.  When you install packages individually using `pip install <package_name>`, the underlying package manager often resolves transitive dependencies and pulls in necessary build tools implicitly.  However, inside a Dockerfile, this implicit resolution is absent. The Docker image starts with a minimal base image, usually lacking the compilers, headers, and libraries required to build certain packages from source.  Even if a package has pre-built wheels for your target architecture, the build tools might still be needed to satisfy dependencies of other packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

Consequently, when `pip install -r requirements.txt` executes within the constrained environment of a Docker image, it might encounter errors because it's missing the necessary build-time dependencies.  These dependencies are not reflected in the `requirements.txt` because they are typically not needed for the package's runtime execution; only its compilation.  If package A depends on a package B which requires a specific compiler, and only package A's runtime dependency is listed in `requirements.txt`,  the installation will fail when attempting to install package A inside the Docker container.

Furthermore, subtle differences in Python versions between the host system and the Docker image can also lead to installation problems, even if all necessary dependencies seem present.  A package might work on your host system with Python 3.9, but fail to install in a Docker image using Python 3.8 due to incompatibility.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Failure due to missing build dependencies:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```requirements.txt
numpy
scipy
```

This Dockerfile might fail if `scipy` requires a compiler (like gfortran) or specific libraries not present in the `python:3.9-slim-buster` base image.  The solution involves installing the missing build tools *before* installing the packages.


**Example 2: Successful Installation after adding build dependencies:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    libgfortran5 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Here, we explicitly install `build-essential` and `libgfortran5` (common dependencies for scientific packages).  The `--no-install-recommends` flag minimizes the image size by avoiding unnecessary package installations.  The final `rm` command cleans up temporary files to reduce image size further.  This addresses the issue in Example 1.


**Example 3: Handling version conflicts:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```requirements.txt
requests==2.28.1
beautifulsoup4==4.11.1
```

This example might fail if there's a conflict between the versions of `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` and their dependencies. The `--no-cache-dir` flag ensures that pip doesn't rely on an outdated cache that might contain incompatible versions.  Often, carefully specifying version constraints in the `requirements.txt` is necessary (e.g., using `>=` or `==` operators) to resolve such conflicts.  In some cases, a virtual environment is needed for isolating incompatible versions.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official Python packaging guides and the documentation for your chosen package manager (`pip` in this case). Understanding the distinction between runtime and build dependencies is crucial.  Exploring Docker best practices, including image layering and minimizing image size, also proves valuable in improving build efficiency and troubleshooting issues effectively.  Consulting the documentation for individual packages to understand their build requirements is essential.  Finally, I'd suggest using a version control system (like Git) to track your Dockerfiles and `requirements.txt` and employ rigorous testing strategies to catch these types of errors early in the development cycle.  These methods, coupled with diligent problem-solving, ensure robust and efficient Docker deployments.
