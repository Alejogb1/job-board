The `ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable` in TensorFlow 2.0 almost invariably stems from a disconnect between the model's trainable variables and the computation graph used for backpropagation.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale recommendation system and a complex image segmentation model, this error typically arises from one of three sources: incorrect tape usage, improper variable definition, or a flawed loss function calculation.

**1.  Understanding the Gradient Tape Mechanism:**

TensorFlow 2.0 relies heavily on `tf.GradientTape` for automatic differentiation.  The `GradientTape` context manager records operations performed on tensors within its scope.  Crucially, only tensors created *within* the `GradientTape` context and subsequently used in the loss calculation will have gradients computed.  Variables created outside this context are effectively invisible to the backpropagation process, resulting in the "No gradients provided" error.  This often manifests when developers unintentionally create or modify tensors outside the tape's scope or use pre-computed values that lack the necessary gradient lineage.

**2.  Code Examples and Analysis:**

Let's examine three scenarios illustrating potential causes and their corrections.

**Example 1: Incorrect Tape Placement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
                             tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y = tf.constant([[5.0], [6.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - y)) #Loss calculated inside tape

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) #Gradients calculated correctly

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

This example demonstrates the correct usage. The loss calculation and, therefore, the variables requiring gradients are all within the `tf.GradientTape` context.  The `tape.gradient` function correctly retrieves gradients for all trainable variables.

**Example 2:  Variable Creation Outside the Tape:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
                             tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y = tf.constant([[5.0], [6.0]])

weights = model.trainable_variables  # Incorrect:  Weights accessed outside the tape

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - y))

# Error: tape.gradient cannot trace gradients for weights because it was not created inside the tape
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, weights) #Error will occur here

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

Here, the error is apparent.  The `weights` are accessed before the `GradientTape` context, meaning the tape cannot track their usage in the loss calculation.  The corrected version would place the `weights = model.trainable_variables` *inside* the `with` block, ensuring the tape captures the required information.  Note that even though this example uses Keras, the underlying TensorFlow gradient tape principles remain unchanged.


**Example 3:  Detached Gradient Computation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
                             tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y = tf.constant([[5.0], [6.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x)
    intermediate_result = tf.math.log(predictions)  # Potential problem here
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(intermediate_result - y)) #Loss depends on intermediate_result

#Gradients will likely not be passed through intermediate_result correctly depending on TensorFlow versions and the function applied.
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example highlights a more subtle problem.  While variables are within the tape's scope, the operations might lead to gradient detachment.  `tf.math.log`, for instance, might introduce non-differentiable points depending on the input values of `predictions`.  If `predictions` contains non-positive values, the gradients might become `NaN` or `Inf` causing issues within the gradient computation. Thoroughly checking for numerical stability and ensuring that all operations within the tape are differentiable is crucial.  In this case, a careful review of the mathematical operations and their applicability to automatic differentiation is needed.  For instance, applying a clipping function to ensure the input of `tf.math.log` remains strictly positive is a good practice.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further solidify your understanding, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing `tf.GradientTape`, automatic differentiation, and best practices for building and training custom models.  Furthermore,  reviewing advanced tutorials on custom training loops within TensorFlow will give you a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  The TensorFlow API reference itself is an invaluable resource to find detailed information on the specific functions you use.  Finally, examining example code from well-maintained open-source projects using TensorFlow can provide insights into practical implementation techniques.


In conclusion, the "No gradients provided" error in TensorFlow 2.0 almost always boils down to a lack of connectivity between the trainable variables and the loss function within the `tf.GradientTape` context.  Careful attention to variable creation, operation placement within the tape, and numerical stability of the loss function calculation are crucial for avoiding this error.  A systematic examination of these aspects, guided by a clear understanding of the gradient tape mechanism, will typically lead to a successful resolution.
