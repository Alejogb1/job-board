The core challenge in retrieving intermediate values from a TensorFlow `tf.while_loop` lies in the inherent sequential nature of the loop and TensorFlow's reliance on static graph construction.  Unlike traditional imperative loops, where intermediate results are implicitly available, the `tf.while_loop` requires explicit mechanisms for accumulating and returning these values.  My experience debugging complex reinforcement learning models heavily reliant on `tf.while_loop` for unfolding time-steps has highlighted the necessity of careful tensor manipulation to achieve this.  The solution often involves pre-allocating tensors to store intermediate results and updating them within the loop body.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The `tf.while_loop` operates by defining a condition and a body function. The condition determines whether the loop continues, while the body function performs computations and updates variables within each iteration.  To obtain intermediate results, we must modify the loop's structure to include a mechanism for accumulating these values.  This generally involves the following steps:

a) **Pre-allocation:**  Before entering the loop, create tensors of appropriate shape and data type to store the intermediate results.  The size of these tensors should accommodate all iterations.  The initial values can be placeholders (e.g., zeros) or predetermined values relevant to the specific application.

b) **Accumulation within the loop body:** Inside the `tf.while_loop`'s body function, update the pre-allocated tensors with the computed intermediate results.  This typically involves tensor slicing and assignment operations.  Efficient indexing is crucial for performance.

c) **Returning the accumulated results:** The body function should return the updated tensors along with any other necessary variables that the loop condition might depend upon.  These accumulated tensors represent the intermediate values generated throughout the loop's execution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Counter**

This example demonstrates a basic counter that accumulates its value at each iteration.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def counter_loop_body(i, accumulated_values):
  accumulated_values = tf.concat([accumulated_values, tf.reshape(i, [1])], axis=0)
  return i + 1, accumulated_values

i0 = tf.constant(0)
accumulated_values0 = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.int32, shape=[0])

final_i, accumulated_values = tf.while_loop(
    cond=lambda i, _: i < 5,
    body=counter_loop_body,
    loop_vars=[i0, accumulated_values0]
)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(accumulated_values)
    print(result)  # Output: [0 1 2 3 4]

```

This code pre-allocates an empty tensor `accumulated_values0`.  The `counter_loop_body` function then concatenates the current iteration's counter value (`i`) to this tensor within each iteration.  The `tf.while_loop` executes until `i` reaches 5.  The final `accumulated_values` tensor contains all intermediate values of the counter.


**Example 2: Matrix Power Calculation**

Here, the loop calculates matrix powers, storing each intermediate result.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def matrix_power_loop_body(i, accumulated_matrices, matrix):
    new_matrix = tf.matmul(accumulated_matrices[-1], matrix) #Efficient matrix multiplication using last matrix in list
    accumulated_matrices = tf.concat([accumulated_matrices, tf.expand_dims(new_matrix, 0)], axis=0)
    return i + 1, accumulated_matrices, matrix

initial_matrix = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], dtype=np.float32)
initial_i = tf.constant(0)
accumulated_matrices0 = tf.expand_dims(tf.constant(initial_matrix, dtype=tf.float32), 0) #Initialise with identity matrix (or 1st power)

final_i, accumulated_matrices, _ = tf.while_loop(
    cond=lambda i, _, __: i < 3,
    body=matrix_power_loop_body,
    loop_vars=[initial_i, accumulated_matrices0, tf.constant(initial_matrix, dtype=tf.float32)]
)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(accumulated_matrices)
    print(result)

```

This demonstrates the accumulation of matrices.  Note the use of `tf.concat` to efficiently append new matrices to the accumulated list.  The initial matrix is included.  The loop calculates the matrix raised to powers 0 to 2. The `tf.expand_dims` ensures consistent tensor shape for concatenation.

**Example 3:  Simulating a Dynamic System**

This example simulates a simple dynamic system, capturing the system's state at each time step.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_system_body(t, state, parameters):
    # Model of dynamic system.  Replace with your actual equations.
    next_state = state * parameters[0] + parameters[1] 
    state = tf.stack([state, next_state], axis = 0) # Stack vertically in tensor
    return t + 1, state, parameters

initial_state = tf.constant([1.0])
parameters = tf.constant([0.5, 1.0])
time_steps = 5
initial_t = tf.constant(0)

_, states, _ = tf.while_loop(
    cond=lambda t, _, __: t < time_steps,
    body=dynamic_system_body,
    loop_vars=[initial_t, initial_state, parameters]
)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(states)
  print(result)

```

This example simulates a linear system. The state is stacked at each time step within the `dynamic_system_body`. The resulting `states` tensor then contains the history of the system's evolution.  This approach generalizes to more complex dynamic systems where you might store multiple state variables at every time step.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's control flow operations and tensor manipulation, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation focusing specifically on `tf.while_loop`, `tf.cond`, tensor manipulation functions (`tf.concat`, `tf.stack`, `tf.reshape`, `tf.expand_dims`), and  the intricacies of static graph construction.  Supplement this with well-structured tutorials focusing on advanced TensorFlow usage, including those found in commonly used machine learning and deep learning textbooks.  Furthermore,  exploring examples of recurrent neural network implementations can provide valuable insight into managing sequences and accumulating results within TensorFlow computations.  Finally, proficiency in NumPy array manipulation will enhance your ability to understand and efficiently handle the tensor operations involved in these types of problems.
