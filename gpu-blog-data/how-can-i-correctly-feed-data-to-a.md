The core challenge in feeding data to a TensorFlow Estimator with a placeholder of shape `[?, 784]` lies in understanding the implications of the `?`—representing a variable batch size—and ensuring compatibility between your input data format and the Estimator's input function.  This necessitates careful consideration of data structures and feeding mechanisms within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue numerous times while building and deploying various machine learning models, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets where batch processing is crucial for efficiency.

My experience reveals that the most common pitfalls involve incorrect data types, incompatible shapes due to misinterpretations of the `?` dimension, and inefficient feeding strategies that lead to performance bottlenecks.  A robust solution requires careful structuring of input data, using appropriate TensorFlow functions, and leveraging the `tf.data` API for optimized data pipelines.

**1. Data Preparation and Input Function Design**

The `[?, 784]` placeholder shape signifies that the Estimator expects input data in batches, where each batch contains an arbitrary number of samples (represented by `?`), each sample having 784 features. This implies your data should be structured as a NumPy array or a similar format readily convertible to a TensorFlow tensor, with the shape `(batch_size, 784)`.  The batch size (`batch_size`) can vary from one batch to the next.  Critically,  it is not a fixed dimension.

The input function, a crucial component of the Estimator, acts as a bridge, providing data to the model during training and evaluation. It should be designed to yield batches of data conforming to the expected `[?, 784]` shape.  Failure to do so results in shape mismatches and runtime errors.

**2. Code Examples**

Here are three illustrative examples demonstrating different data feeding approaches, accompanied by explanatory comments:

**Example 1: Using `tf.data.Dataset` (Recommended Approach)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def input_fn(data, labels, batch_size=32):
  """Creates a tf.data.Dataset for feeding data to the Estimator."""
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
  dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(data)).batch(batch_size)
  return dataset

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 784).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)  # Assuming 10 classes

# Create the Estimator (replace with your actual model)
estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(...)

# Train the model
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(data, labels), steps=1000)
```

This example utilizes the `tf.data.Dataset` API, widely considered the best practice for efficient data handling in TensorFlow.  `from_tensor_slices` creates a dataset from NumPy arrays, `shuffle` randomizes the data (essential for training), and `batch` groups the data into batches of the specified size. The `lambda` function provides a concise way to pass the `input_fn` to the `estimator.train` method.


**Example 2:  Manual Batching (Less Efficient)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def input_fn(data, labels, batch_size=32):
  """Manually creates batches. Less efficient than tf.data.Dataset."""
  num_samples = len(data)
  for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
    batch_data = data[i:i+batch_size]
    batch_labels = labels[i:i+batch_size]
    yield {'x': batch_data}, batch_labels

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 784).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)

# Create the Estimator
estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(...)

# Train the model
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(data, labels), steps=1000)
```

This example demonstrates manual batching.  While functional, it's less efficient than using `tf.data.Dataset` as it lacks the optimization features of the latter. Note the dictionary structure `{'x': batch_data}` – this is how you would define features in your input function if you had more than one feature.


**Example 3:  Feeding with `tf.compat.v1.placeholder` (Deprecated)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Deprecated approach; use tf.data.Dataset instead
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784], name='input_placeholder')
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None], name='labels_placeholder')

# ... your model definition using x and y ...

# Sample data
data = np.random.rand(100, 784).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  # ... your model initialization and training loop ...
  feed_dict = {x: data, y: labels}
  # ... sess.run(your_training_op, feed_dict=feed_dict) ...
```

This example shows the use of `tf.compat.v1.placeholder`, which is deprecated in favor of the `tf.data` API.  This method requires manual session management and feeding within a training loop, making it less convenient and less efficient. It's presented here primarily for illustrative purposes to highlight the differences and to discourage its use in new projects.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow Estimators and the `tf.data` API, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the sections dedicated to Estimators, input functions, and the `tf.data` API.  Furthermore, exploring examples and tutorials provided within the official TensorFlow repositories and community-contributed codebases is invaluable. Thoroughly understanding NumPy array manipulation will also significantly assist in data preparation.  Familiarizing yourself with different types of TensorFlow datasets, like `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`, can be helpful when working with custom data sources.  Finally, practicing with increasingly complex scenarios will solidify your understanding of the principles discussed here.
