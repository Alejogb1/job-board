The core mechanism PyTorch employs to selectively compute gradients for model parameters hinges on the `requires_grad` attribute of each parameter tensor.  This attribute, intrinsically tied to each tensor, acts as a gatekeeper, dictating whether the autograd engine will track operations performed on that tensor and subsequently compute its gradient during backpropagation.  My experience debugging complex neural networks over the years has highlighted the critical importance of understanding this fundamental aspect of PyTorch's automatic differentiation system. Misconfigurations concerning `requires_grad` often lead to perplexing errors that manifest as unexpected gradient values or even complete absence of gradients during training.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's autograd engine operates on a computational graph implicitly constructed during the forward pass.  Each operation performed on a tensor, assuming `requires_grad` is set to `True`, adds a node to this graph, recording the operation and its inputs. When the loss function is computed, this marks the end of the forward pass.  The backward pass, triggered by calling `.backward()` on the loss tensor, initiates the gradient computation.  This computation traverses the computational graph in reverse, applying the chain rule to determine the gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter tensor.  However, this traversal only considers tensors where `requires_grad` is `True`.  Those with `requires_grad` set to `False` are effectively treated as constants, eliminating them from the gradient calculation.  This selective computation is pivotal for efficiency and, crucially, for controlling the optimization process.

The `requires_grad` attribute is typically set during model definition.  When creating a model using `nn.Module`, parameters are automatically initialized with `requires_grad=True` by default. This signifies that they're trainable parameters and their gradients will be computed. However, we possess explicit control over this attribute.  We can manually set it to `False` for parameters we wish to treat as fixed during training, such as those in pre-trained layers during transfer learning or parameters embedded within modules that require only inference.  This selective gradient computation is crucial in scenarios like fine-tuning pre-trained models or implementing specific training strategies such as freezing certain layers.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Linear Regression with Gradient Computation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)

# Define a loss function
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
x = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], requires_grad=False)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [5.0]], requires_grad=False)

# Forward pass
y_pred = model(x)
loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)

# Backward pass (gradients are computed for model parameters)
loss.backward()

# Access gradients
print(model.weight.grad)
print(model.bias.grad)
```

*Commentary:* In this example, both `model.weight` and `model.bias` have `requires_grad=True` by default. The backward pass computes gradients for both, demonstrating the standard scenario where gradients are calculated for all trainable parameters.  The input data (`x` and `y`) has `requires_grad=False` ensuring they are treated as constants.


**Example 2:  Freezing a Layer in a Convolutional Neural Network**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple CNN
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 10) # Assuming 32x32 input

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
model = SimpleCNN()

# Freeze the first convolutional layer
for param in model.conv1.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# ... (rest of training loop) ...
```

*Commentary:* Here, we demonstrate freezing a layer (`conv1`).  By iterating through its parameters and setting `requires_grad` to `False`, we explicitly prevent the autograd engine from computing gradients for those parameters during the training process.  The gradients for `conv2` and `fc` will still be computed.


**Example 3:  Using `with torch.no_grad():` for inference**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Model definition and loading from Example 2) ...

# Inference with no gradient computation
with torch.no_grad():
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
    output = model(input_data)
    print(output)
```

*Commentary:* This example showcases how to selectively disable gradient computation for a specific code block using the context manager `torch.no_grad()`.  Within this block, any operations on tensors will not be recorded by the autograd engine. This is vital during inference, as we are only interested in model predictions, not gradient updates.  This significantly reduces computational overhead during evaluation or deployment.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is invaluable for understanding the intricacies of autograd and tensor manipulation.  Further, explore documentation specific to the `nn.Module` class and delve into the details of various optimization algorithms.  Consider examining introductory and intermediate level texts covering deep learning, paying particular attention to chapters on automatic differentiation and backpropagation.  Finally, review the source code of PyTorch itself; the codebase provides the ultimate reference.  These resources, in conjunction with hands-on practice, will foster a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch's gradient computation mechanisms.
