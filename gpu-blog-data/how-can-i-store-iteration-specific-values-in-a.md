During my experience developing a robust image registration pipeline, managing iteration-specific data within the optimization loop was a recurring challenge. Specifically, when employing gradient-based methods for image alignment, such as those found in MATLAB's `imregister` or built from scratch, you often need to track metrics or intermediate results at each iteration of the optimization process. Direct manipulation of the optimization data structures is often discouraged, and thus a dedicated storage mechanism must be implemented. A matrix provides an effective and accessible solution for this task.

The fundamental concept centers around the creation of a matrix structured to hold the desired values across iterations. Rows typically represent individual iterations, while columns store different parameters or results. This allows for a systematic recording of relevant information during the registration process. This approach contrasts with storing iteration-specific values within the optimization's internal variables because those variables are often private or subject to alteration. Moreover, accessing them in a structured and post-processing manner becomes problematic.

The initial step involves pre-allocating the matrix with dimensions large enough to contain all anticipated iterations. This pre-allocation is crucial for performance, particularly when the number of iterations is not known precisely or may vary. Pre-allocation prevents repeated resizing operations during execution, which would drastically slow down the process. It is also worthwhile to establish a counter to track the current iteration within the optimization loop, this counter will be used to correctly index into the matrix.

Here's a basic code example illustrating this pre-allocation and structured data storage:

```matlab
function [registeredImage, optimizationData] = registerAndStoreData(movingImage, fixedImage)
    % Define the transform type.
    tformType = 'affine';

    % Establish the optimizer and metric configurations.
    optimizer = registration.optimizer.RegularStepGradientDescent;
    metric = registration.metric.MattesMutualInformation;

    % Create a transformation object with initial parameters
    initialTransformation = affine2d;

    % Set optimizer properties
    optimizer.GradientMagnitudeTolerance = 1e-5;
    optimizer.MaximumIterations = 200;
    optimizer.InitialRadius = 0.005;
    optimizer.MinimumRadius = 5e-6;

    % Pre-allocate the matrix for data storage.
    maxIterations = optimizer.MaximumIterations;
    optimizationData = zeros(maxIterations, 6); % Six columns for example: metric value, step size, translation x/y, rotation angle, scale.
    iterationCounter = 1;

    % Define the custom initialization function.
     function [optimizer,metric] = initialize_custom(optimizer,metric)
        % This is a custom initializer that allows modification of the
        % optimizer and metric. In this case, we will just return the original ones.
        % However, other options like pre-computing the metric and updating
        % the parameters based on that pre-computed value can be done here.
     end

    % Execute the image registration.
    [registeredImage, tform] = imregister(movingImage, fixedImage, tformType, optimizer, metric, ...
        'InitialTransformation',initialTransformation, ...
        'PyramidLevels', 3, ...
        'Verbose', false, ...
        'CustomInitializers',@initialize_custom,...
        'Callback', @(optimizer, metric, tform, iteration, metricvalue) recordData(optimizer, metric, tform, iteration, metricvalue, iterationCounter));

   % Nested helper function to record data
    function recordData(optimizer,metric,tform,iteration,metricvalue,iterationCounter)

    % Extract parameters and metric value
    T = tform.T;
    angle = atan2(T(2, 1), T(1, 1)) * 180 / pi;
    scale = sqrt(T(1,1)^2+T(2,1)^2);

    optimizationData(iterationCounter,:) = [metricvalue, optimizer.CurrentStepSize, T(3,1), T(3,2), angle,scale];
    iterationCounter = iterationCounter + 1;
    end
end
```

In this code, the `optimizationData` matrix is pre-allocated with a number of rows corresponding to the `MaximumIterations` of the optimizer. The `Callback` function within `imregister` is employed to capture the `metricValue` at each iteration and parameters of the transformation. These values are then assigned to the current row in the `optimizationData` matrix as determined by the `iterationCounter`. The number of columns is arbitrary, and should be chosen to include all the data that needs to be tracked. In this example, I have decided to include: `metricvalue`, the current `optimizer` step size, the translation in x and y, and finally the rotation angle and the scale. This custom callback function allows for targeted data extraction and storage, circumventing potential issues with direct manipulation of internal optimization structures. The optimizer and metric can also be customized using the `CustomInitializers` parameter to perform custom operations. This method ensures the matrix stores specific metrics.

Another common use case involves tracking not just the final transformation parameters, but also intermediate image representations or even the computed gradients. Expanding the prior example, this involves storing the transformed image at each iteration. Given the size of the image matrix, this requires careful allocation and memory management. Consider the following adaptation:

```matlab
function [registeredImage, optimizationData, iterativeImages] = registerAndStoreDataWithImages(movingImage, fixedImage)
    % Define the transform type.
    tformType = 'rigid';

    % Establish the optimizer and metric configurations.
    optimizer = registration.optimizer.RegularStepGradientDescent;
    metric = registration.metric.MattesMutualInformation;

    % Create a transformation object with initial parameters
    initialTransformation = rigid2d;

    % Set optimizer properties
    optimizer.GradientMagnitudeTolerance = 1e-5;
    optimizer.MaximumIterations = 100;
    optimizer.InitialRadius = 0.01;
    optimizer.MinimumRadius = 1e-5;

    % Pre-allocate matrices.
    maxIterations = optimizer.MaximumIterations;
    optimizationData = zeros(maxIterations, 6);
    iterativeImages = cell(maxIterations,1); %Cell array to store images due to size difference

    iterationCounter = 1;

    % Define the custom initialization function.
     function [optimizer,metric] = initialize_custom(optimizer,metric)
        % This is a custom initializer that allows modification of the
        % optimizer and metric. In this case, we will just return the original ones.
        % However, other options like pre-computing the metric and updating
        % the parameters based on that pre-computed value can be done here.
     end

    % Execute the image registration with verbose callback to record intermediate values.
    [registeredImage, tform] = imregister(movingImage, fixedImage, tformType, optimizer, metric, ...
        'InitialTransformation',initialTransformation, ...
        'PyramidLevels', 3, ...
        'Verbose', false, ...
        'CustomInitializers',@initialize_custom, ...
        'Callback', @(optimizer, metric, tform, iteration, metricvalue) recordData(optimizer, metric, tform, iteration, metricvalue, iterationCounter, movingImage));

    function recordData(optimizer,metric,tform,iteration,metricvalue,iterationCounter, movingImage)
    % Extract parameters and metric value
    T = tform.T;
    angle = atan2(T(2, 1), T(1, 1)) * 180 / pi;
    scale = sqrt(T(1,1)^2+T(2,1)^2);
    optimizationData(iterationCounter,:) = [metricvalue, optimizer.CurrentStepSize, T(3,1), T(3,2), angle, scale];

    % Store the transformed image at each step in a cell array
     iterativeImages{iterationCounter} = imwarp(movingImage,tform,'OutputView',imref2d(size(fixedImage)));
    iterationCounter = iterationCounter + 1;
    end

end
```

In this second example, `iterativeImages` is a cell array, because the size of the images are variable at every iteration depending on the chosen transformation. The `imwarp` command is used to warp the moving image at every iteration using the current transformation, and each warped image is stored in the cell array. This illustrates the flexibility of using a matrix (or cell array when images need to be stored) to track iteration-specific data.

Finally, consider the case where the registration process is highly customized, with a manually implemented optimization loop. In these scenarios, the storage logic is even more under developer control. Hereâ€™s an example:

```matlab
function [registeredImage, optimizationData] = customRegister(movingImage, fixedImage, transformType)
    % Parameters setup.
    maxIterations = 150;
    learningRate = 0.01;
    tolerance = 1e-6;

    % Initial transformation
    if strcmp(transformType,'affine')
        transformation = affine2d;
    elseif strcmp(transformType,'rigid')
         transformation = rigid2d;
    else
         error('Unknown transformation type');
    end
    initialParameters = transformation.T;

    % Pre-allocate data matrix
    optimizationData = zeros(maxIterations, size(initialParameters(:),1) + 1);
    previousMetricValue = inf;
    iterationCounter = 1;
    % Gradient descent optimization.
    for iter = 1:maxIterations
        % Transform the moving image using the current parameters.
         warpedMoving = imwarp(movingImage,transformation,'OutputView',imref2d(size(fixedImage)));

        % Calculate metric.
        metricValue = calculateMattesMutualInformation(warpedMoving, fixedImage);

        % Calculate parameter gradients
         [gradient] = computeGradient(warpedMoving,fixedImage, transformation);


        % Update the parameters
        newParameters = transformation.T(:) - learningRate * gradient(:);
        transformation.T = reshape(newParameters,size(transformation.T));

        % Store data at the end of the iteration
        optimizationData(iterationCounter, :) = [metricValue,newParameters'];
        iterationCounter = iterationCounter + 1;

        % Check for convergence.
        if abs(previousMetricValue - metricValue) < tolerance
            break;
        end
         previousMetricValue = metricValue;
    end
    %Final warp
    registeredImage = imwarp(movingImage,transformation,'OutputView',imref2d(size(fixedImage)));
    function metric = calculateMattesMutualInformation(moving, fixed)
        % Implementation of Mattes Mutual Information
        [jointHistogram, ~, ~] = jointHistogram2D(moving(:),fixed(:), 256);
        jointHistogram = jointHistogram./sum(jointHistogram(:));
        marginalMoving = sum(jointHistogram,2);
        marginalFixed = sum(jointHistogram,1);

        entropy_moving = -sum(marginalMoving .* log(marginalMoving + eps));
        entropy_fixed = -sum(marginalFixed .* log(marginalFixed + eps));
        entropy_joint = -sum(jointHistogram(:) .* log(jointHistogram(:) + eps));
        metric = entropy_moving + entropy_fixed - entropy_joint;

    end
    function [gradients] = computeGradient(moving, fixed, transformation)
      % Implementation of the gradient calculation
      % This is a highly simplified implementation that only computes the gradient with respect to translation
      h = 1e-6;
      gradients = zeros(size(transformation.T));
      for i = 1:size(transformation.T,1)
         for j = 1:size(transformation.T,2)
            originalValue = transformation.T(i,j);
            transformation.T(i,j) = transformation.T(i,j) + h;
            warpedMovingPlus = imwarp(moving,transformation,'OutputView',imref2d(size(fixed)));
            metricPlus = calculateMattesMutualInformation(warpedMovingPlus, fixed);
            transformation.T(i,j) = originalValue-h;
            warpedMovingMinus = imwarp(moving,transformation,'OutputView',imref2d(size(fixed)));
            metricMinus = calculateMattesMutualInformation(warpedMovingMinus, fixed);
           gradients(i,j) = (metricPlus - metricMinus)/(2*h);
           transformation.T(i,j) = originalValue;
         end
      end
    end
end
```

This final code example demonstrates how iteration-specific values are stored in a matrix even when the optimization process is customized. The core principle of pre-allocation and structured storage remains consistent. This includes the storage of the metric value and all parameters of the transformation at each iteration.

For further investigation of best practices for image registration and parameter tracking, I would recommend consulting the MATLAB documentation on `imregister` and its related functions, as well as resources on numerical optimization methods. Texts on medical image analysis and computer vision often contain detailed discussions of image registration algorithms and their implementation. Specifically, resources that delve into the details of iterative optimization algorithms can provide helpful insights. These references and practical experience allowed me to build a robust and adaptable image registration workflow.
