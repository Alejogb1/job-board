Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) offer distinct advantages in text classification, addressing limitations of traditional methods like bag-of-words.  My experience working on sentiment analysis projects for a major e-commerce platform highlighted the significant performance gains achievable by integrating these architectures.  Specifically, I observed that CNNs excel at capturing local n-gram features, while LSTMs effectively model long-range dependencies within sequences, a crucial aspect often missed by simpler models.  Their combined application often results in superior classification accuracy.

**1.  Explanation of CNN and LSTM Contributions in Text Classification:**

Traditional text classification approaches frequently represent text as a bag-of-words, disregarding word order and contextual information.  CNNs alleviate this by employing convolutional filters that scan across the text, detecting patterns within localized windows (n-grams).  This allows the model to learn features representing specific phrases or combinations of words indicative of a particular class.  For instance, a filter might identify the phrase "highly recommended" as a strong indicator of positive sentiment.  The resulting feature maps are then pooled (e.g., max pooling) to reduce dimensionality and highlight the most prominent features before being fed into a fully connected layer for classification.

LSTMs, on the other hand, are designed to handle sequential data effectively.  Unlike Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, LSTMs utilize a sophisticated cell state mechanism that allows them to maintain information over extended sequences.  This is critical for text classification as the meaning of a word often depends on its context across the entire sentence or even paragraph.  LSTMs can learn long-range dependencies between words, capturing relationships that are crucial for accurate classification. For example, in sarcasm detection, the meaning of a seemingly positive statement might be negated by a concluding phrase several words later, a subtle relationship readily captured by an LSTM.

The combined use of CNNs and LSTMs leverages the strengths of both architectures.  A common approach involves using a CNN to extract local features and an LSTM to process the sequence of these features, capturing both local and global context. This hybrid model can effectively handle both short-range and long-range dependencies present in text data.  In my experience, this hybrid approach consistently outperformed models using only CNNs or LSTMs alone.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the application of CNNs, LSTMs, and their combination for text classification using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. Note that these are simplified examples for illustrative purposes and may require adjustments for real-world datasets.

**Example 1: CNN for Text Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This code defines a simple CNN model. The `Embedding` layer converts words into dense vectors.  The `Conv1D` layer applies convolutional filters to learn local patterns.  `MaxPooling1D` reduces dimensionality.  Finally, dense layers perform classification.  `vocab_size`, `embedding_dim`, `max_length`, and `num_classes` are hyperparameters determined by the dataset.


**Example 2: LSTM for Text Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates an LSTM model. The `Embedding` layer is identical to the CNN example. The `LSTM` layer processes the sequential data, capturing long-range dependencies.  Dense layers perform the classification task.


**Example 3: Hybrid CNN-LSTM for Text Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This model combines both CNN and LSTM layers. The CNN layer first extracts local features, and the LSTM layer processes the sequence of these features, leveraging both local and global context for improved classification accuracy.  This often yields superior results, as observed in my own projects involving analyzing customer reviews.  Experimentation with different filter sizes, number of filters, and LSTM units is crucial for optimal performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CNNs and LSTMs in text classification, I suggest exploring comprehensive textbooks on deep learning and natural language processing.  Focus on chapters detailing convolutional and recurrent neural networks, their applications to text data, and techniques for model optimization.  Furthermore, review research papers focusing on hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures for text classification, paying attention to comparative studies that analyze their performance against other methods.  Finally, consider studying the documentation for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, specifically their APIs related to implementing CNNs and LSTMs.  These resources provide a solid foundation for practical implementation and further research.
