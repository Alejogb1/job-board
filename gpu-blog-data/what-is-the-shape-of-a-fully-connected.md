The dimensionality of a fully connected layer's output following a convolutional neural network (CNN) is entirely determined by the output tensor from the preceding convolutional layer and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer itself.  My experience optimizing image classification models for high-throughput systems has frequently highlighted the crucial role understanding this dimensionality plays in avoiding resource bottlenecks and achieving optimal performance.  The key is to accurately map the spatial and channel dimensions of the convolutional output to the flattened vector fed into the fully connected layer.

**1.  Explanation:**

A CNN processes input data (e.g., images) through a series of convolutional and pooling operations.  These operations progressively extract hierarchical features, reducing the spatial dimensions (height and width) while increasing the number of feature channels.  The output of the final convolutional layer is a multi-dimensional tensor. Let's represent this tensor as having dimensions `(N, C, H, W)`, where:

* `N` is the batch size (number of input samples processed simultaneously).
* `C` is the number of feature channels.
* `H` is the height of the feature maps.
* `W` is the width of the feature maps.

A fully connected layer, on the other hand, expects a one-dimensional input vector for each sample in the batch.  Therefore, the convolutional layer's output tensor must be flattened before it can be fed to the fully connected layer. This flattening process transforms the `(N, C, H, W)` tensor into a `(N, C * H * W)` tensor.  This flattened vector represents the input to the fully connected layer.

The fully connected layer then applies a linear transformation to this flattened vector, resulting in an output tensor with dimensions `(N, F)`, where `F` is the number of neurons (or units) in the fully connected layer. This final output represents the layer's features, often passed to a final activation function for classification or regression tasks.  This shape is critical for subsequent layers or for output interpretation; for example, in a multi-class classification problem, F would typically match the number of classes.

Incorrectly determining this shape can lead to errors during model building and execution.  I've personally encountered this during a project involving real-time object detection â€“ neglecting to account for the proper flattening resulted in shape mismatches and ultimately, a non-functional model.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize Python and TensorFlow/Keras for clarity.  Adaptations to other frameworks should be relatively straightforward.


**Example 1:  Simple Image Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the CNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),  # Flattening the convolutional output
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Fully connected layer with 10 output neurons
])

# Example input
input_shape = (1, 28, 28, 1) # Batch size of 1
input_data = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

#Check the output shape
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: (1, 10)

```

This example showcases a straightforward CNN for classifying 28x28 images (like MNIST digits). The `Flatten()` layer is crucial; it transforms the output of the convolutional layers into a 1D vector before the fully connected layer processes it.  The final output shape is (1, 10), representing the probability distribution over 10 classes.


**Example 2:  Handling Variable Input Sizes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the CNN model - Note the use of GlobalAveragePooling2D
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(None, None, 3)), #Accepts variable input size
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(), #Replaces Flatten for variable input
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(100, activation='relu'), #Fully connected layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Example input with varying height and width
input_shape = (1, 100, 100, 3) # Batch size 1, but variable size
input_data = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

#Check the output shape
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: (1, 10)
```

This demonstrates handling variable-sized inputs, a common scenario in image processing.  Instead of `Flatten`, `GlobalAveragePooling2D` is used.  This averages the feature maps across height and width, generating a fixed-length vector independent of the input dimensions. The output shape is still determined by the fully connected layer, resulting in (1, 10).

**Example 3:  Multiple Fully Connected Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'), #First fully connected layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'), #Second fully connected layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') #Output layer
])

# Example input
input_shape = (1, 28, 28, 1)
input_data = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

#Check the output shape
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: (1, 10)
```

This illustrates the use of multiple fully connected layers.  The output of each preceding fully connected layer becomes the input for the subsequent one. The final output shape (1, 10) remains consistent with the number of output neurons in the final layer.  Note that the intermediate fully connected layers can have arbitrary sizes.  I've often employed this strategy for deeper feature learning in object recognition tasks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures and their mathematical underpinnings, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on deep learning.  Furthermore, reviewing the official documentation for the deep learning framework you intend to use (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.) is essential.  Finally, examining well-documented example projects and code repositories can provide valuable insights into practical implementations and best practices.  These resources offer significantly more detailed explanations and examples than I can provide within this response.
