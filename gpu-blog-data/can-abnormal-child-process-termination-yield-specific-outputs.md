Abnormal child process termination, specifically through signals like SIGKILL or SIGSEGV, can indeed yield specific, albeit often limited, outputs depending on the design of the parent and child processes.  My experience debugging multi-process applications in C++ for high-throughput financial modelling has shown that relying solely on the child's exit code for error analysis in such scenarios is frequently insufficient.  The nature of the output is highly dependent on the buffering strategy employed for inter-process communication (IPC) and the signal handling mechanisms implemented in both the parent and the child.

Let's clarify this.  A normal termination involves the child process explicitly exiting via a function like `exit()` or returning from `main()`.  This allows for a controlled shutdown, potentially including the flushing of output buffers.  However, an abnormal termination (via signal) interrupts the process immediately.  Any data in the output buffer might be lost, and any cleanup operations planned by the child will be skipped.  This lack of control is crucial in understanding the potential outcomes.

**1. Explanation:**

The crucial aspect lies in how the parent and child communicate.  Common IPC mechanisms include pipes, shared memory, and message queues.  If pipes are used for output from the child, the parent's `read()` on the pipe may receive a partial or incomplete message if the child is terminated abruptly.  Furthermore, the parent will typically only receive the data that was written to the pipe *before* the signal was received.  Data written subsequently will be lost. The parent process might detect the child's termination through the return value of `waitpid()`, but this only tells the parent *that* the child terminated, not *why* or what the precise state of the child's buffers was at termination.

With shared memory, similar issues arise. If the child was writing to a shared memory segment and was terminated by a signal, the data in that segment will be in an unpredictable state. The parent might read incomplete or inconsistent data.

If message queues are employed, the impact depends on the queue implementation.  A well-designed message queue might have mechanisms to ensure atomicity, where messages are written entirely or not at all.  However, an incompletely written message, if it exists in the queue at termination, could potentially be retrieved by the parent, leading to inconsistent results.

Therefore,  predictable output requires careful design incorporating signal handling in the child to flush buffers before termination (if possible), error handling in the parent to manage partial reads, and robust error detection mechanisms.  Relying solely on the child's exit status is insufficient for comprehending what data the child process may have partially transmitted prior to its forced termination.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Pipes and SIGKILL**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    int pipefd[2];
    pipe(pipefd);

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) { // Child process
        const char* message = "This is a test message.";
        write(pipefd[1], message, strlen(message));
        kill(getpid(), SIGKILL); // Immediate termination
    } else { // Parent process
        char buffer[100];
        waitpid(pid, NULL, 0); // Wait for child to terminate
        ssize_t bytesRead = read(pipefd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        buffer[bytesRead] = '\0';
        std::cout << "Parent received: " << buffer << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates that the parent might receive only a partial message from the child if the child is killed with `SIGKILL` before it finishes writing to the pipe.  The `kill()` function abruptly terminates the child, leaving the pipe's buffer in an undefined state.


**Example 2: Shared Memory and SIGSEGV**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    const int size = 1024;
    void* sharedMemory = mmap(nullptr, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) { // Child process
        char* ptr = (char*)sharedMemory;
        strcpy(ptr, "Partial message");
        // Simulate a segmentation fault:
        *(int*)(ptr + 20) = 10 / 0; // This will likely cause a SIGSEGV
    } else { // Parent process
        waitpid(pid, NULL, 0); // Wait for child's termination
        std::cout << "Parent received from shared memory: " << (char*)sharedMemory << std::endl;
    }
    munmap(sharedMemory, size);
    return 0;
}
```

This example simulates a segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`) in the child. The resulting output from the shared memory is unpredictable; the parent might read only part of the written data or encounter an error trying to access the corrupted memory region.


**Example 3:  Signal Handling and Pipe Cleanup**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <cstring>

void sigHandler(int signum) {
    // Handle signal; clean up resources, etc.
    std::cout << "Child received signal " << signum << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int pipefd[2];
    pipe(pipefd);
    signal(SIGTERM, sigHandler); // Register signal handler
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) { // Child process
        const char* message = "This is a test message.";
        write(pipefd[1], message, strlen(message));
        kill(getpid(), SIGTERM); // More controlled termination
    } else { // Parent process
        char buffer[100];
        waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
        ssize_t bytesRead = read(pipefd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        buffer[bytesRead] = '\0';
        std::cout << "Parent received: " << buffer << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates better handling. The child registers a signal handler to perform cleanup (in this case, simply printing a message),  allowing for a more controlled response to a termination signal than `SIGKILL`.  Even with `SIGTERM`, the result might still show only a part of the message, depending on the timing of the signal and buffer flushing, but itâ€™s more reliable than using `SIGKILL`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, consult advanced texts on operating systems, process management, and concurrent programming in C++.  Specifically, material covering signal handling, inter-process communication, and memory management within the context of concurrent systems will be invaluable.  Look for resources that provide detailed examples and analyses of different IPC mechanisms. The specifics of signal delivery and handling are implementation-defined, so reviewing the documentation for your specific system (e.g., POSIX, Linux, or Windows) is also essential.  Understanding the nuances of `waitpid()`,  `mmap()`, and pipe operations is crucial for correctly interpreting the behavior of multi-process programs.
