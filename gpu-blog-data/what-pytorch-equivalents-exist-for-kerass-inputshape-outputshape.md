The core difference between Keras and PyTorch lies in their architectural philosophies.  Keras, built on top of TensorFlow (or other backends), offers a higher-level, more declarative approach to model building, whereas PyTorch adopts a more imperative, lower-level style.  This fundamental distinction necessitates a nuanced understanding when comparing functionalities.  Direct equivalents for Keras' `input_shape`, `output_shape`, `get_weights`, `get_config`, and `summary` aren't always one-to-one mappings in PyTorch; instead, their counterparts require a more programmatic approach leveraging PyTorch's tensor operations and module attributes.

1. **`input_shape` and `output_shape` Equivalents:** Keras' `input_shape` defines the expected input tensor dimensions during model compilation.  In PyTorch, input shapes aren't explicitly declared during model definition but are inferred during the forward pass.  The `output_shape` is similarly determined dynamically.  Determining the output shape often requires tracing the model's architecture or, for simpler models, calculating it based on layer operations.  For more complex networks, using a test input and observing the output tensor's shape is the most reliable method.  I've frequently debugged models by feeding dummy input data and inspecting the shape of the final output layer using `torch.Size()`.


2. **`get_weights` Equivalent:**  Keras' `get_weights` method returns a list of NumPy arrays representing the model's trainable parameters. In PyTorch, obtaining these weights involves iterating through the model's parameters.  The `state_dict()` method provides a dictionary mapping parameter names to their corresponding tensors.  The actual NumPy arrays can be accessed via `.cpu().numpy()` on each tensor within the state dictionary.  However, direct manipulation of weights within the `state_dict()` should be approached cautiously; it’s more common to work with optimizers' `step()` functions for parameter updates.


3. **`get_config` Equivalent:** Keras' `get_config` provides a dictionary representing the model's architecture, allowing for model reconstruction. PyTorch doesn't have a direct equivalent.  Model reconstruction typically involves re-creating the model architecture using the same layers and hyperparameters.  In my experience, maintaining detailed comments within the model definition code, coupled with version control, is crucial for reproducibility, negating the need for a dedicated `get_config` analogue.  This approach ensures complete traceability of architectural decisions.


4. **`summary()` Equivalent:** Keras' `summary()` provides a concise overview of the model architecture, including layer types, shapes, and parameter counts. PyTorch lacks an in-built function with identical functionality.  However, the `torchinfo` library provides similar capabilities.  Alternatively, I've written custom functions to achieve this; a simple recursive traversal of the model's modules, printing their types and output shapes (obtained using a dummy input as previously described), effectively replicates this function.  This custom solution gives me more granular control over the output's formatting, tailoring it to my specific needs in various projects.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Determining Output Shape**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10) # Batch size 1, input dim 10
output = model(dummy_input)
output_shape = output.shape
print(f"Output shape: {output_shape}") # Output shape will be torch.Size([1, 2])
```

This demonstrates determining the output shape dynamically.  Note that the batch size in the dummy input affects the first dimension of the output shape.


**Example 2: Accessing Model Weights**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = SimpleModel() # Using the SimpleModel from Example 1

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter Name: {name}, Shape: {param.shape}, Data Type: {param.dtype}")
    numpy_weights = param.cpu().numpy() # Convert to NumPy array for further processing
    # ...process numpy_weights...
```

This iterates through the model's parameters, printing their names, shapes, and data types and demonstrates converting a PyTorch tensor to a NumPy array.  Crucially, the `.cpu()` call is essential if using a GPU.


**Example 3: Custom Model Summary (Partial Implementation)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def custom_summary(model, input_size):
    def register_hook(module):
        def hook(module, input, output):
            class_name = str(module.__class__).split('.')[-1].split("'")[0]
            module_info = f"{class_name}: {input[0].shape} -> {output.shape}"
            print(module_info)
        return hook

    for name, module in model.named_modules():
        module.register_forward_hook(register_hook(module))

    dummy_input = torch.randn(1, *input_size) # Adjust based on model input requirements
    with torch.no_grad():
        model(dummy_input)

model = SimpleModel()
custom_summary(model, (10,)) # Input size: 10
```

This provides a rudimentary custom summary function by registering forward hooks to print layer information and output shapes during a forward pass with a dummy input. A complete implementation would also include parameter count calculation.  Note that this approach provides an illustrative example; handling complex layer types and model architectures might require more sophisticated logic.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, several well-regarded PyTorch books, and numerous online tutorials offer in-depth explanations of model building, weight manipulation, and other relevant aspects.  Focusing on practical examples and understanding PyTorch's tensor operations is vital for effective utilization.  Specific focus on using the `torch.nn` module and its various layers is recommended, alongside thorough understanding of `torch.optim` for parameter updates.  Finally, exploring intermediate and advanced concepts within PyTorch’s automatic differentiation mechanism will greatly aid in developing a deeper comprehension of the framework.
