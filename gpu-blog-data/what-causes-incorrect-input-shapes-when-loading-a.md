Loading a Keras model with an incorrect input shape is a frequent point of failure stemming from a fundamental mismatch between the model's expectations, defined during its construction, and the data subsequently fed to it during inference or further training. This discrepancy typically manifests as errors such as ‘ValueError: Input 0 of layer "…" is incompatible with the layer: expected min_ndim=4, found ndim=3. Full shape received: (….)’ or similar, highlighting an issue with the tensor dimensions.

My direct experience, having worked extensively with convolutional neural networks for image analysis, suggests this problem arises most commonly when the initial model architecture definition, data preprocessing, or the data loading pipeline contain subtle inconsistencies. It’s not merely about mismatched numbers; it’s about how those numbers are organized into tensors and understood by Keras layers.

Fundamentally, Keras models, built layer-by-layer, possess rigid expectations concerning the shape of their input tensors. These shapes, defined within layer configurations, dictate the number of dimensions (ndim) and the size of each dimension that a layer is equipped to process. A convolutional layer might anticipate an input tensor of shape (batch_size, height, width, channels), while a dense layer would expect (batch_size, features). When the data presented doesn't conform to these expectations, Keras throws an exception.

Consider a scenario where a model is trained with images of shape (64, 64, 3) representing a batch of images 64 pixels high, 64 pixels wide, with 3 color channels (Red, Green, Blue). If the same model is later used with a single grayscale image of (1, 64, 64), the shape incompatibility will cause an error. The model was trained expecting 4D tensors, but is now receiving 3D. Or suppose you preprocessed an image using a normalization step expecting values to range from [0, 255] and suddenly start sending values in the [0,1] range. This change may not cause an immediate error but may lead to improper performance.

Common causes often trace back to one of these issues:

1. **Incorrect Initial Model Definition:** The `input_shape` parameter in the initial layer, such as a `Conv2D` or `Input` layer, is incorrectly defined during model construction. A user might transpose dimensions or omit a necessary dimension, such as the channels dimension, leading to shape inconsistencies. The model's architecture might be defined to handle, say, 28x28 images, but the actual input data is of different size.

2. **Mismatched Data Preprocessing:** The pre-processing steps applied to training data and inference data might differ. Scaling, normalization, or resizing steps might be applied inconsistently or not applied at all, resulting in the model receiving input of an incorrect range or size. If a model is trained on normalized images and then fed raw images without scaling, the mismatch in value range will degrade performance.

3. **Batching and Single Instance Inconsistencies:** Keras models, by design, typically handle data in batches, with an additional batch dimension to the input tensor. If a single input instance without the batch dimension is directly fed to a model expecting a batch of instances, a shape mismatch arises.

4. **Improper Data Loading:** In data pipelines, such as those using TensorFlow Datasets or custom data generators, errors in data transformation functions can introduce unexpected shape changes prior to model input. For example, images loaded with PIL are sometimes transposed or altered.

5. **Data Format Confusion:** Different libraries may use varying data formats. NumPy arrays may be in (height, width, channels) or (channels, height, width) format, while Keras expects a specific ordering. Misinterpreting or mis-converting between these formats introduces problems.

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Layer Definition:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Incorrectly defined input shape
input_layer = Input(shape=(28, 28))  # Expected input: (batch, 28, 28), missing channels

conv1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
flatten = Flatten()(conv1)
dense1 = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense1)

# Now, let's create a test input
import numpy as np

test_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3) # Test with batch dimension, channels added

try:
    model(test_input)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Corrected input layer definition. Correct `input_shape` parameter.

input_layer = Input(shape=(28, 28, 3)) # Expected input: (batch, 28, 28, 3)
conv1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
flatten = Flatten()(conv1)
dense1 = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense1)

try:
    model(test_input)
    print("Model ran successfully with corrected input shape.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```
This example demonstrates a common mistake: omitting the channel dimension in `input_shape`. The initial `Input` layer was declared to handle an input of shape (28, 28), a two-dimensional tensor. However, the subsequent convolutional layer, `Conv2D`, implicitly expects a 3D tensor (height, width, channels). When I tried running the model with the appropriate 4D tensor representing a batch of images with 3 channels, a ValueError was raised because a shape mismatch had occurred. The corrected code defines `input_shape` as `(28, 28, 3)` to explicitly state that the images are 28x28 pixels with 3 color channels.

**Example 2: Batch vs. Single Instance:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Simple model with an input of 10 features. Expects a batch.
input_layer = Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense1)


single_instance = np.random.rand(10) # Shape: (10,)

try:
    model(single_instance) #Error due to lack of batch dimension
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")


batch_input = np.random.rand(1, 10) # Shape: (1, 10), batch dimension added

try:
   model(batch_input)
   print("Model ran successfully with a batch input")
except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example shows a common scenario where a model trained on batches is mistakenly fed a single instance. The model expects a 2D tensor `(batch_size, features)` but instead receives a 1D tensor `(features)`. The problem is not the number of features but the absence of the batch dimension, therefore the error is not directly related to shape mismatch but to the number of dimensions. The correction involves wrapping the single instance into a batch by adding a new first dimension.

**Example 3: Incorrect Preprocessing:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Model expects normalized input [0, 1]

input_layer = Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense1)

# Input data with incorrect range, will not produce an error but may affect the performance.
raw_input = np.random.rand(1, 10) * 255 # Values are in the range of [0, 255]


try:
    model(raw_input) # No error but bad results
    print("Model ran successfully with raw input. Consider normalizing before input")
except Exception as e:
     print(f"Error: {e}")

normalized_input = raw_input / 255.0 # Values are normalized to [0, 1]

try:
    model(normalized_input)
    print("Model ran successfully with normalized input.")
except Exception as e:
     print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here the problem is not a shape mismatch but a value range mismatch. The trained model expected inputs normalized to the range of [0, 1], but the raw input was in the range of [0, 255]. The first model execution does not throw a runtime error, since the shape is appropriate, however the model performance is compromised. Only after the input is normalized does the model perform to specifications.

To resolve these issues, a structured debugging approach is vital:

1. **Verify `input_shape`:** Carefully examine the `input_shape` argument in the initial layer of your model architecture. Ensure that it matches the dimensions, their order, and the number of channels of your input data as intended. Print the shape of your tensor before and after preprocessing to be sure of the intended structure.

2. **Standardize Preprocessing:** Make sure your pre-processing steps are consistently applied to both training and inference data. If your training data was scaled or normalized, the test and validation data must follow the same process.

3. **Check Batch Dimension:** Ensure that your single instances are reshaped to include a batch dimension when feeding the model. In NumPy, this often involves using `.reshape((1, *data.shape))`. Keras models typically expect a batch dimension.

4. **Use Print Statements:** Employ print statements in your data pipeline to inspect tensor shapes at various stages, pinpointing where mismatches occur.

5. **Consult Layer Documentation:** Carefully consult Keras layer documentation to confirm the expected input shapes of your layers. The layer documentation often contains this information.

6. **Data Augmentation Awareness:** If data augmentation techniques are used during training, make certain that the same augmentation is performed during testing or inference or that the effect is reversed.

For resource recommendations, I would suggest thoroughly examining the official Keras documentation for all layers, particularly `Input`, `Conv2D`, and `Dense`. Textbooks on deep learning such as those from Goodfellow et al, are useful for establishing general principles and expectations. Tutorials on image processing and data preprocessing using libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow and Pillow are also beneficial for debugging data-related issues.
