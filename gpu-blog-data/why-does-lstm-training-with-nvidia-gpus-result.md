The `NotImplementedError` encountered during LSTM training on Nvidia GPUs, particularly using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, frequently stems from an incompatibility between the specified data type and the underlying cuDNN implementation that accelerates computations on these GPUs. Specifically, while CUDA libraries excel with 32-bit floating-point precision (float32), not all operations are fully supported, or equally optimized, for lower precision datatypes such as float16 (half-precision). I've personally encountered this on several projects, initially using TensorFlow with a Volta architecture, and then again while prototyping in PyTorch on a more recent Ampere setup.

The core issue lies in how neural network training, especially with recurrent structures like LSTMs, leverages hardware acceleration libraries. CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) is a library provided by Nvidia that offers highly optimized implementations of common neural network operations. However, these optimizations, while providing substantial speedup compared to CPU computation, are not universally applicable across all numerical precisions. Lower precision, such as float16, can accelerate matrix multiplications and other computations significantly due to reduced memory bandwidth and simpler arithmetic. However, certain operations within the LSTM cell, particularly those involving exponential and hyperbolic tangent calculations, might not have direct cuDNN support for half-precision in all situations. When this occurs, the library defaults to a CPU implementation, or throws `NotImplementedError` because the requested operation lacks a GPU-accelerated path with float16.

Another aspect causing this relates to layer-wise auto-casting. Frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow allow for different parts of the model to have different levels of precision. If some portion of the LSTM, usually the recurrent core, or the initial input projection, isn't explicitly cast or converted to float16 and relies on automatic casting, it may incorrectly assume support for half-precision by cuDNN that doesn't exist. This automatic conversion can sometimes silently introduce inconsistent types within a single LSTM layer leading to unexpected `NotImplementedError` during backpropagation. It’s a subtle error that’s notoriously difficult to pinpoint, especially when initially experimenting with mixed precision.

The issue can also arise from an older version of the cuDNN or CUDA toolkit installed on the system. cuDNN support evolves over time, introducing performance improvements and expanding support for varied operations. A feature available in a recent version may be absent in an older one leading to `NotImplementedError` during model execution, even if the data type used would otherwise be acceptable.

Here are a few examples illustrating how this manifests in Python using common libraries:

**Example 1: TensorFlow with Incorrect Data Type Conversion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a basic LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128, input_shape=(10, 32)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Generate random input data and labels
input_data = tf.random.normal((64, 10, 32), dtype=tf.float16) # Note the explicit float16
labels = tf.random.normal((64, 10))

# Compile the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Attempt to train. This will likely fail with NotImplementedError
# if not handled.
try:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(input_data)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Workaround: Explicitly cast to float32 before LSTM computation
input_data_32 = tf.cast(input_data, dtype=tf.float32)

try:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(input_data_32)
      loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print("Training successful with explicit cast to float32.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error after casting to float32: {e}")

```
*This example shows the error occurs when we feed `float16` data directly into a Keras LSTM layer, which relies on cuDNN. The workaround explicitly casts the input to `float32` before the LSTM computation and training.*

**Example 2: PyTorch with Implicit Type Conversion Issue**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a basic LSTM model
class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) # Get the last sequence output
        return out

# Model parameters
input_size = 32
hidden_size = 128
output_size = 10

# Model instantiation
model = LSTMModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size).cuda()

# Data generation
input_data = torch.randn(64, 10, input_size, dtype=torch.float16).cuda() # Note explicit float16
labels = torch.randn(64, output_size, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()

# Loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# Training loop (will likely fail)
try:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(input_data)
    loss = loss_fn(predictions, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")


# Workaround: Cast data to float32
input_data_32 = input_data.to(dtype=torch.float32)


try:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(input_data_32)
    loss = loss_fn(predictions, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print("Training successful with explicit cast to float32.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error after casting: {e}")

```
*This example demonstrates a similar case in PyTorch, where the input is `float16` while the underlying LSTM expects float32 for supported cuDNN operations. Casting input to `float32` addresses the issue.*

**Example 3: Using torch.cuda.amp for Mixed Precision (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

# Define a basic LSTM model
class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

# Model parameters
input_size = 32
hidden_size = 128
output_size = 10

# Model instantiation and data moved to CUDA
model = LSTMModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size).cuda()
input_data = torch.randn(64, 10, input_size).cuda()
labels = torch.randn(64, output_size).cuda()

# Loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
scaler = GradScaler() # Creates the scaler object

# Training loop using mixed precision. No casting needed.
try:
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  with autocast(): # autocast block does the casting internally
    predictions = model(input_data)
    loss = loss_fn(predictions, labels)
  scaler.scale(loss).backward()
  scaler.step(optimizer)
  scaler.update() # Update the scaler
  print("Training successful with mixed precision.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during mixed precision training: {e}")

```
*This illustrates proper usage of PyTorch's `autocast` with a `GradScaler`. Here, the input and model are not explicitly converted but are implicitly handled by the automatic cast inside the `autocast` context. The `GradScaler` helps ensure stable training, avoiding loss of precision due to very small numbers.*

To resolve these errors, several strategies are recommended. First, always ensure compatibility by verifying that your CUDA and cuDNN versions are aligned with the specific deep learning library used, and that the selected versions support the desired precision for all operations. Second, explicitly cast numerical data to `float32` before entering any layers within the LSTM if you are not using mixed precision training. Frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide mechanisms to do this. For performance, use a mixed-precision approach using the `torch.cuda.amp` or TensorFlow’s equivalent methods, leveraging lower precision where supported and maintaining full precision when required for operations where cuDNN lacks optimization or support. Finally, always monitor for runtime errors and thoroughly examine the stack trace, paying close attention to the specific layer causing the `NotImplementedError`.

For further guidance, consult the documentation of your deep learning framework focusing on mixed-precision training. Read NVIDIA’s documentation on cuDNN and its API to familiarize yourself with the supported data types, and also examine NVIDIA’s best practices for GPU accelerated deep learning. These resources detail how to optimally use available hardware, maximizing throughput and addressing situations like these.
