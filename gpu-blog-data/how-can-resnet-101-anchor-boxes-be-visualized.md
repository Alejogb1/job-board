The challenge in visualizing ResNet-101 anchor boxes in PyTorch stems from the fact that ResNet-101, by itself, doesn't inherently define or generate anchor boxes. Anchor box generation is typically a component of object detection architectures that *utilize* ResNet-101 as a backbone feature extractor. Therefore, the visualization process involves understanding how the detector network interacts with the ResNet-101 features to propose these boxes. In my experience building object detection models, I've found the most effective visualization methods combine understanding the detector's anchor generation scheme and overlaying these on the image alongside the features.

The core idea is that a region proposal network (RPN), commonly used with backbones like ResNet-101, generates anchor boxes based on the feature map produced by the ResNet-101 output. These anchor boxes are predefined, with varying scales and aspect ratios, centered at each pixel of the ResNet-101 feature map. The detector then refines these initial boxes and assigns class probabilities to each proposal. Visualizing these anchor boxes then requires: 1) extracting the relevant feature map from the ResNet-101 output within the full model, 2) understanding the anchor generation parameters used by the RPN, and 3) overlaying the generated boxes onto the original input image.

Here's a breakdown of the process, incorporating code examples for illustration. I'll use a simplified scenario where I assume the RPN generates anchor boxes at each location of the ResNet feature map with three aspect ratios and three scales.

**Code Example 1: Extracting ResNet-101 Feature Map**

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained ResNet-101
resnet101 = models.resnet101(pretrained=True)
resnet101.eval()  # Set to eval mode

# Define a hook to extract feature map
feature_map = None
def hook(module, input, output):
    global feature_map
    feature_map = output

layer_name_to_monitor = "layer4"
resnet101._modules[layer_name_to_monitor].register_forward_hook(hook)

# Load and preprocess the input image
image_path = 'input_image.jpg'
image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")

preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
input_tensor = preprocess(image).unsqueeze(0)

# Perform forward pass to trigger the hook
with torch.no_grad():
    resnet101(input_tensor)

# feature_map now contains the layer4 output
print("Feature map shape:", feature_map.shape)
```

In this first example, I load a pre-trained ResNet-101 model from `torchvision`. I then register a forward hook, a PyTorch mechanism, onto the `layer4` module to capture its output. The choice of `layer4` often corresponds to the location where the RPN in common object detection frameworks consumes features. The image is loaded, preprocessed, and passed through ResNet-101. After the forward pass, the `feature_map` variable holds the feature tensors output by layer4, which we will subsequently use for anchor generation and visualization. The shape of the feature map shows the spatial extent based on the input image, a reduction due to down sampling in the network.

**Code Example 2: Anchor Box Generation**

```python
def generate_anchors(feature_map_size, scales, aspect_ratios, base_size=16, stride=16):
    height, width = feature_map_size
    anchors = []
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            for scale in scales:
                for ratio in aspect_ratios:
                    w = base_size * scale * np.sqrt(ratio)
                    h = base_size * scale / np.sqrt(ratio)
                    x_center = (x + 0.5) * stride
                    y_center = (y + 0.5) * stride
                    x_min = x_center - w / 2
                    y_min = y_center - h / 2
                    x_max = x_center + w / 2
                    y_max = y_center + h / 2
                    anchors.append([x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max])
    return np.array(anchors)

# Define anchor parameters
scales = [8, 16, 32]
aspect_ratios = [0.5, 1, 2]
feature_map_height, feature_map_width = feature_map.shape[2], feature_map.shape[3]
anchors = generate_anchors((feature_map_height, feature_map_width), scales, aspect_ratios)
print("Number of anchors generated:", len(anchors))
```

This second code segment introduces a function, `generate_anchors`, which takes the feature map dimensions, a set of scales, and aspect ratios, and creates a grid of anchor boxes. The anchor centers are calculated based on the feature map grid cells and the stride which reflects the downsampling factor of the ResNet. The sizes of anchor boxes are determined by the specified scales and aspect ratios relative to a base size. I've explicitly set a base size and stride of 16, which would be appropriate for the typical ResNet-101 output at the later layers. The generated anchors are stored as coordinates in the format (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max). The function creates the anchor boxes which are at each location, for all the aspect ratios and scales provided, demonstrating the explosion in the number of anchors.

**Code Example 3: Visualizing Anchors**

```python
def visualize_anchors(image, anchors, num_anchors_to_show=100):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
    ax.imshow(image)
    num_anchors = min(len(anchors), num_anchors_to_show)
    for i in range(num_anchors):
        bbox = anchors[i]
        rect = patches.Rectangle((bbox[0], bbox[1]), bbox[2] - bbox[0], bbox[3] - bbox[1], linewidth=1, edgecolor='r', facecolor='none')
        ax.add_patch(rect)
    plt.show()

# Convert PIL image to numpy array for visualization
image_np = np.array(image)
visualize_anchors(image_np, anchors)
```

The last code example presents `visualize_anchors`, which renders the generated anchor boxes on top of the original input image. I choose to plot a small subset of anchor boxes to avoid cluttering the image. I create a matplotlib figure, overlay the input image, and iteratively draw red rectangular patches for each anchor box on top of the image using the coordinates generated. The function displays the final result with the overlaid boxes.

To extend this visualization, consider adding more information such as the anchor box labels (e.g. whether the anchor is a positive or negative example based on bounding boxes of the labeled objects), or visualizing anchor box transformations and confidence scores. Furthermore, examining the anchor box density within specific image regions would be useful to understand how the network distributes proposals. You could even color-code the boxes based on their respective scale to improve clarity.

For further investigation into the underlying principles, I recommend consulting resources focused on object detection, specifically those outlining the function of region proposal networks such as Faster R-CNN, and general resources on anchor boxes in CNN-based detectors. A deeper understanding of concepts like feature map receptive fields and multi-scale processing will provide a stronger basis. In addition, material explaining the inner workings of PyTorch hooks would enhance debugging skills for visualizing intermediate results like feature maps during network operations. Familiarity with `torchvision` pre-trained models and `matplotlib` drawing tools are also essential.
