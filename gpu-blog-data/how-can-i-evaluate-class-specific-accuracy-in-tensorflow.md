Evaluating class-specific accuracy in TensorFlow requires a nuanced approach beyond simply examining overall model accuracy.  My experience optimizing large-scale image classification models highlighted the critical need for granular performance analysis; a model boasting 90% overall accuracy might severely underperform on specific, crucial classes, rendering it impractical for real-world deployment.  Therefore, directly calculating and analyzing class-wise metrics is paramount.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in understanding that overall accuracy is a macroscopic metric. It masks the performance disparities across different classes within your dataset.  A dataset heavily skewed towards one class, for example, can artificially inflate overall accuracy while concealing poor performance on minority classes. To assess class-specific accuracy, we need to delve into the confusion matrix.  The confusion matrix is a square matrix where each row represents the instances in a predicted class and each column represents the instances in an actual class.  Each cell (i, j) contains the count of instances of class i that were predicted as class j.

From the confusion matrix, we can derive several class-specific metrics:

* **Precision:**  For a given class, precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positive instances.  It answers the question: "Of all the instances predicted as belonging to this class, what proportion was actually correct?"

* **Recall (Sensitivity):**  For a given class, recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total actual positive instances. It answers the question: "Of all the instances that actually belong to this class, what proportion was correctly predicted?"

* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.  A high F1-score indicates both high precision and high recall.

Calculating these metrics requires post-processing the model's predictions against the ground truth labels.  TensorFlow provides tools to facilitate this process, primarily through the `tf.metrics` module (now `tf.keras.metrics` in newer versions) and libraries like Scikit-learn for confusion matrix generation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy` with Class-Specific Aggregation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
y_true = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])
y_pred = np.array([[0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], [0.2, 0.1, 0.7], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9, 0.0]])

num_classes = 3
class_accuracies = []

for i in range(num_classes):
    # Create a mask for the current class
    class_mask = np.where(np.argmax(y_true, axis=1) == i, 1, 0)

    # Apply the mask to filter true and predicted labels
    y_true_class = y_true[class_mask == 1]
    y_pred_class = y_pred[class_mask == 1]

    # Calculate accuracy for the current class
    metric = tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()
    metric.update_state(y_true_class, y_pred_class)
    class_accuracy = metric.result().numpy()
    class_accuracies.append(class_accuracy)

print(f"Class-wise accuracies: {class_accuracies}")
```
This code iterates through each class, creating a mask to select only the relevant samples.  `tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy` then computes accuracy for the filtered subset.  This approach provides a direct measure of accuracy per class.

**Example 2: Leveraging the Confusion Matrix:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 2, 1, 0])
y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 2])

cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

num_classes = cm.shape[0]
class_accuracies = np.diag(cm) / np.sum(cm, axis=1)

print(f"Confusion Matrix:\n{cm}")
print(f"Class-wise accuracies: {class_accuracies}")
```
This example employs Scikit-learn's `confusion_matrix` function. The diagonal elements of the confusion matrix represent correctly classified instances for each class.  Dividing these by the row sums gives the class-wise accuracy.  This method is concise and readily provides a comprehensive view of classification performance.


**Example 3:  Custom Metric within the Keras Model Compilation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def class_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true_class = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=1)
    y_pred_class = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true_class, y_pred_class), tf.float32))

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your model layers ...
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=[class_accuracy]) # Include the custom metric

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```
This approach integrates a custom metric directly into the model's compilation process. The `class_accuracy` function calculates overall accuracy; however, adapting this to a class-specific computation is straightforward by incorporating a class-indexing mechanism similar to Example 1.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections covering metrics and model evaluation, provides comprehensive guidance.  Scikit-learn's documentation on metrics and confusion matrices is also invaluable.  Finally,  exploring academic papers on performance evaluation in machine learning will deepen your understanding of these concepts and their applications.  Focusing on literature related to imbalanced datasets is especially relevant given the context of class-specific accuracy analysis.
