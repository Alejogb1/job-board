Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are foundational to modern computer vision, yet I’ve frequently seen developers express confusion regarding the absence of gradients associated directly with the convolutional layer’s *variables* – often implying input activations – after backpropagation. This perception stems from a misunderstanding of how gradients are calculated and attributed within the computational graph of a neural network. Specifically, the gradients calculated during backpropagation are with respect to the *parameters* of the convolutional layer, not the inputs directly used by the layer.

The core concept revolves around the chain rule of calculus. In essence, the backpropagation algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter in the network by iteratively applying the chain rule from the output layer back to the input layer. A convolutional layer, mathematically, performs a series of convolutions between a set of learnable filter *weights* and the input feature maps. These feature maps are, from the perspective of the specific convolution layer, *activations*. Activations are derived from prior operations in the network and not, themselves, the parameters the convolutional operation is optimizing.

Consider a single convolution operation. The output activation, *O*, at a specific location (x, y) is computed as follows:

*O(x, y) = Σᵢ Σⱼ W(i, j) * I(x+i, y+j)*

Here, *W(i, j)* represents the learnable weights within a filter, and *I(x+i, y+j)* represents the input feature map values in the spatial window corresponding to the filter window. The summation is done over the dimensions of the kernel and applies across all channels. Crucially, backpropagation computes the derivative of the loss function *L* with respect to the weights, ∂L/∂W, and biases of the convolutional layer if applicable; not the input *I* itself for *this* specific layer. The *I* term becomes the *output* of the previous layers and the *input* for *this* layer. These gradients are then used to update the weights during the optimization process.

Therefore, there aren't no gradients for the variables – they exist; instead, these gradients are propagated backwards to the *weights* and biases of the layer, not the feature maps within which the convolution is operating. It is critical to realize that the input feature map is not a parameter; its gradient is indeed calculated but becomes the gradient of the *previous* layer. The convolutional layer gradients are only associated to learnable parameters such as filter weights and biases which will be used to adjust their values with an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent.

To further clarify, let's consider specific code examples. All examples use PyTorch for illustrative purposes but principles remain similar for TensorFlow and other frameworks.

**Example 1: Basic Convolution**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple convolutional layer
conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

# Create dummy input data (batch_size, channels, height, width)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32, requires_grad=True) # Enable gradients

# Pass the input through the layer
output = conv(input_data)

# Define a loss function
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Dummy target tensor for loss calculation
target = torch.randn(1, 16, 32, 32)

# Calculate the loss
loss = loss_fn(output, target)

# Perform backpropagation
loss.backward()

# Examine gradients
print("Input gradient: ", input_data.grad)
print("Conv layer Weight gradient: ", conv.weight.grad)
print("Conv layer Bias gradient: ", conv.bias.grad)
```

In this code example, the input to the convolutional layer, `input_data`, has its gradient computed and populated as `input_data.grad`. However, these gradients are not *local* to the convolutional layer; instead, they represent how that input influenced the loss and will be used by the layer generating the feature map. The convolutional layer’s `conv.weight.grad` and `conv.bias.grad` attributes store the calculated gradients of the weights and biases, which are the layer's parameters. When executing the `loss.backward()` method, these gradients are computed by leveraging the chain rule, essentially saying how a change in W would impact the total loss.

**Example 2: Accessing Input Feature Map Gradients Indirectly**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=16, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32, requires_grad=True)
output = model(input_data)

loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
target = torch.randn(1, 32, 32, 32)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)

loss.backward()

# Access gradient of the activation of first convolutional layer
print("Gradient of conv1 output:", model.conv1(input_data).grad) # this is None, because it's an intermediate tensor
print("Gradient of conv2 input (after relu):", model.relu1(model.conv1(input_data)).grad) # this is also None as it's intermediate
print("Gradient of conv2 parameters", model.conv2.weight.grad)

```

This example builds on the previous one by introducing multiple layers. Critically, note that it is difficult to access the gradients *directly* at the output of `conv1`. That is because a tensor such as the output of the first layer, after it is fed into another operation, is no longer registered in the computation graph. Instead, those gradients are being stored in the `input_data.grad` after the backward pass and propagated backwards through the layers. Therefore, the direct gradient of the intermediate tensor `model.conv1(input_data)` is not directly accessible as a variable. However, the final gradient is indeed propagated back to `input_data` and the weights in the various convolutional layers in the model. The grad attribute of *parameters* such as `model.conv2.weight` stores the computed gradient.

**Example 3: Input Gradient and Parameter Updates**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32, requires_grad=True)
output = conv(input_data)

loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
target = torch.randn(1, 16, 32, 32)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)

optimizer = optim.SGD(conv.parameters(), lr=0.01) # Update parameters

loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()


print("Gradient of input after single step: ", input_data.grad)
print("Updated Conv weight:", conv.weight)

```

This example demonstrates a full optimization step using an SGD optimizer. Notice that the gradient of the `input_data` is populated. After calling `optimizer.step()`, the gradients are used to update the weights of the convolutional layer. It is crucial to call `optimizer.zero_grad()` between each step, otherwise the gradients would accumulate. The parameter `conv.weight`, which was the filter weights, is now updated. The fact that `input_data` has a populated gradient after the backward pass illustrates that gradients are calculated for the inputs, not as gradients of the *parameters* in the layer doing the convolution.

In summary, gradients are computed for all tensors within the computational graph of the network through the chain rule. The convolutional layer's *parameters*, such as filter weights and biases, have gradients associated with them that are used to optimize them through an optimization algorithm. However, gradients are not directly calculated on the activation tensors within the convolutional layer; instead, the gradient of an intermediate activation acts as the input gradient to the previous layer. The input tensor to the layer has its gradient calculated as part of the backward pass and propagated backwards. This understanding is crucial for anyone working with convolutional networks and provides a much better perspective about how backpropagation operates.

For further learning on the topic, I would recommend reviewing foundational textbooks on deep learning such as those by Goodfellow et al., and understanding the mathematics behind the backpropagation algorithm. Official documentation from PyTorch or TensorFlow provides a deeper dive into how autograd works in practice, but the key concepts I've highlighted remain consistent across all deep learning libraries. Additionally, researching different optimization algorithms and their implementation further solidifies this perspective of how gradients and parameters interact in network training.
