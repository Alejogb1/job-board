The `ggpubr` package, while primarily designed for facilitating publication-ready plots and combining multiple plots into arrangements, does not directly handle legend title modifications in the same way `ggplot2` does. Instead, `ggpubr` functions operate on `ggplot2` plot objects. Therefore, changing the legend title requires manipulating the underlying `ggplot2` structure before, or sometimes after, passing it to `ggpubr` functions. Over my years of generating research visualizations, I've encountered this frequently, initially trying to directly modify legend attributes within `ggpubr` calls – a misconception many new users face. The key is to understand that you must modify the ggplot object itself, not through `ggpubr` directly. This involves accessing and changing the `ggplot2` scale related to the aesthetic that generates the legend.

The fundamental concept revolves around ggplot2's aesthetic mappings and scales. When an aesthetic (e.g., color, fill, shape) is mapped to a variable, `ggplot2` automatically creates a scale that governs how the variable’s values are translated to visual attributes and displayed in the legend.  To change the legend title, one modifies this specific scale using `ggplot2` functions like `labs()`, or the more targeted `scale_*_...` functions, where the asterisk (`*`) is replaced by the aesthetic (e.g., `scale_color_manual`, `scale_fill_discrete`). The specific scale chosen depends on the aesthetic mapped and the data type (e.g., discrete vs continuous).

Here’s a detailed breakdown, including several practical examples that demonstrate the correct approach:

**Example 1: Using `labs()` for a Simple Legend Title Change**

This is often the easiest and most straightforward method.  It’s applicable when your legend title should simply be changed for a given aesthetic mapping. Consider a scatter plot where the color aesthetic represents a categorical variable.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample Data
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
    x = rnorm(100),
    y = rnorm(100),
    group = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 100, replace = TRUE)
)

# Create the base ggplot object
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
    geom_point()

# Modify the legend title using labs()
p <- p + labs(color = "Experimental Group")

# Display using ggarrange (a common ggpubr function)
print(ggarrange(p))
```

In this example, we first create a `ggplot2` plot named `p`. The color aesthetic is mapped to the `group` variable, which automatically generates a legend with the default title "group."  We then use `labs(color = "Experimental Group")` to change that title. This command targets the `color` aesthetic and replaces its default title with “Experimental Group”. Importantly, the `ggarrange` call from `ggpubr` renders the plot *after* the legend title has been modified within the ggplot object. `ggarrange` is simply a layout manager; the legend modifications occur prior to its usage.  This makes the plot presentable with the specified title.  Other `ggpubr` functions such as `ggpar` might provide further formatting modifications to the plot after the `ggplot` object is modified, but they do not directly change the title in this case.

**Example 2: Using `scale_color_discrete` with `name`**

When the variable associated with the aesthetic is discrete and you need more control over the scale itself, `scale_color_discrete` (or a similar scale function) provides a structured way to change both the legend title and potentially other scale attributes. This is frequently necessary when dealing with categorical variables and specific visual mappings.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample Data
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
    x = runif(100),
    y = runif(100),
    category = factor(sample(c("High", "Medium", "Low"), 100, replace = TRUE))
)


# Create the base ggplot object
p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = category)) +
    geom_point()

# Modify the legend title and customize scale using scale_color_discrete
p2 <- p2 + scale_color_discrete(name = "Performance Level", labels = c("Top", "Mid", "Bottom"))

# Display using ggarrange
print(ggarrange(p2))
```

Here, `scale_color_discrete(name = "Performance Level", labels = c("Top", "Mid", "Bottom"))` not only changes the legend title to "Performance Level," but the labels displayed in the legend are also customized. The `name` argument precisely modifies the title, while the `labels` argument modifies the displayed labels in the legend.  The function operates upon the mapping of a *discrete* variable to the *color* aesthetic. Using the appropriate `scale_*_...` function is crucial – attempting `scale_fill_discrete` when the mapping is to `color` will not produce the desired result.

**Example 3: Working with `scale_fill_manual`**

For cases where more precise control over the fill colors and their associated legend labels is needed,  `scale_fill_manual` allows explicit assignment of colors and labels. This is often required when using specific color schemes for publications. I frequently use `scale_fill_manual` in situations where I want the legends to reflect specific treatment conditions.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample Data
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:4,
  y = 1,
  grouping = factor(c("Group1", "Group2", "Group3", "Group4"))
)

# Create the base ggplot object
p3 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill = grouping)) +
  geom_col()

# Modify the legend title and define manual fill
p3 <- p3 + scale_fill_manual(name="Treatment Type", 
                            values=c("red", "blue", "green", "purple"),
                            labels=c("Control", "Drug A", "Drug B", "Drug C"))


# Display using ggarrange
print(ggarrange(p3))

```

In this instance, a bar plot is constructed, mapping `grouping` to `fill`. `scale_fill_manual` allows us to both modify the legend title (using the `name` argument) and set the specific fill colors and labels that are displayed in the legend.  This level of control over the scale is vital for ensuring consistency and clarity across multiple visualizations.  I routinely use this approach when presenting data where specific treatment labels need to be explicitly linked to specific colors.

**Key Takeaways and Resource Recommendations**

The core principle is that legend title manipulation in `ggpubr` plots is accomplished by modifying the underlying `ggplot2` plot object, not directly through `ggpubr` calls. `labs()` is usually the simplest and most versatile method for a basic title change. `scale_*_...` functions offer greater control for both categorical and continuous data, allowing for customization of not only the title but also the labels, and mappings in the legend.

For expanding on these techniques, I recommend exploring the following resources:

1.  **ggplot2 Documentation:** The official documentation provides comprehensive explanations of all functions, particularly the documentation surrounding the aesthetics mappings and scales. Specifically focusing on `labs()` and different `scale_*_...` functions (e.g., `scale_color_discrete`, `scale_fill_continuous`, `scale_shape_manual`) will be valuable.
2.  **R Graphics Cookbook:** This cookbook, structured around frequent plotting tasks, will offer practical examples on manipulating ggplot2 plots, including legend modifications.
3. **R for Data Science:** This resource contains a chapter on data visualization with `ggplot2`, covering the principles of the grammar of graphics. Understanding this foundational information is crucial for effectively working with `ggplot2`.

By understanding the inner workings of `ggplot2`’s aesthetic mappings and scales, one can modify legends as desired, even in the context of using `ggpubr` for arranging and finalizing plots. This separation of concerns, where `ggplot2` handles the plotting and `ggpubr` assists in layout, is crucial for mastering effective data visualization in R.
