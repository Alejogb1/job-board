Task instance details in Apache Airflow are rendered through the web UI’s metadata database interaction, which relies on specific data being populated and accessible. When these details are unavailable, it's often due to a disconnect between the executing task and the mechanism used for database updates, frequently involving serialization or database configuration issues. I've encountered this firsthand across several large-scale Airflow deployments, and troubleshooting typically centers around validating task execution integrity and database connectivity.

The core reason you can't view task instance details boils down to the fact that the Airflow webserver relies on entries within the metadata database to populate those views. A task instance represents a specific run of a task within a DAG. Upon a task's scheduled execution, Airflow should create or update a corresponding record in the `task_instance` table of the metadata database. Crucially, this process involves several steps: first, the scheduler determines which tasks to run; second, the executor (e.g., Local, Celery, Kubernetes) executes the tasks; and third, the executor communicates task state back to Airflow via the database. When any of these steps fail or become inconsistent, task instance details can be lost.

There are several potential points of failure contributing to the absence of these details:

1.  **Serialization Issues:** The executor often needs to serialize Python objects representing task arguments and context before submitting them for execution. If these objects are not serializable or exceed the database column limits, the task might still execute, but the database update fails. This prevents creation or updates to the task instance record, leaving the UI without information to render.

2.  **Database Connectivity Problems:** Problems with the database itself – network outages, insufficient user permissions, or incorrect database configuration parameters in `airflow.cfg` – can prevent the executor from logging the state changes. The webserver, while seemingly functioning, can’t display the relevant information if it’s not present in the database. I have personally observed instances where a misconfigured proxy or VPN disrupted database communication, resulting in missing task details.

3.  **Executor Configuration:** The chosen executor's configuration can also be a source of problems. For example, using the Celery executor incorrectly without the required broker or result backend setup will result in tasks executing but never reporting back to Airflow, as it lacks a channel to update the database. This frequently happens in development environments where the setup is incomplete or untested.

4. **Database Migrations:** If Airflow was upgraded recently but the database migrations weren't fully executed, the structure of the tables could be out of sync with what the webserver expects. This can cause a variety of unexpected errors, including the inability to query the task instance data.

5.  **Task Design Issues:** Less common but possible are tasks with complex dependencies or improper use of XCom (cross-communication) which could lead to state inconsistencies that the Airflow system struggles to record.

To illustrate, consider these code examples and their potential issues:

**Example 1: Serialization Problem**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

class UnserializableClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = lambda x: x * 2

def my_task(my_obj):
    print("Task executed")

with DAG(
    dag_id="serialization_example",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task_1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="task_one",
        python_callable=my_task,
        op_kwargs={"my_obj": UnserializableClass()}
    )
```

In this instance, the lambda function inside `UnserializableClass` is not picklable and therefore cannot be serialized, which prevents the task instance from being correctly saved in the database. While `print("Task executed")` would still appear in the logs (assuming a successful executor configuration), the web UI won't show the corresponding task instance. The executor receives the task parameters but fails when attempting to serialize them for database storage, leaving the task instance as "not yet started" or in a state without details.

**Example 2: Database Connectivity Issue**

This is difficult to directly simulate in code, but the concept is as follows. Imagine that the `airflow.cfg` has been configured with an incorrect database URI, like pointing to the wrong hostname or database name.

```python
# This is a configuration issue in airflow.cfg, not python code
# sql_alchemy_conn = "postgresql://airflow:password@wrong_hostname:5432/airflow"
```

If `sql_alchemy_conn` is incorrect, the task might still run (if using a local executor), or it might throw an error in logs if it can’t access the database via the configured connection, but in either case the task execution and state changes will not be saved to the metadata database and thus would not be visible in the webserver. It would appear as if Airflow is missing information about the execution. This could also occur if database permissions have been altered, or if there's network connectivity loss between the executor and the database.

**Example 3: Executor Configuration (Celery)**

```python
# Code remains mostly the same but celery needs a broker
# The following is missing in this scenario
# broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
# result_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
def my_task():
    print("Celery task executed")

with DAG(
    dag_id="celery_example",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task_1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="celery_task",
        python_callable=my_task,
    )

```

In this example, if you’re using a Celery executor, but the necessary configurations (`broker_url`, `result_backend`, etc) are not correctly configured in `airflow.cfg` or the environment, the task will run but won’t have a channel to return its status to the Airflow scheduler and thus update the task instance in the metadata database. The web UI would again lack the necessary information to display the execution, similar to the previous examples. Although the task’s output “Celery task executed” could be visible in the worker's logs, the task instance data will not be present in the Airflow database.

To address these issues, begin by thoroughly reviewing your `airflow.cfg` to ensure database connectivity parameters are correct and that the executor is properly configured, including the broker and backend. The scheduler logs are a vital resource to investigate potential problems regarding serialization. Ensure that your database user has the required privileges to modify tables. I'd suggest verifying the database connection itself outside of Airflow, using command-line clients (such as `psql` for Postgres) to ensure basic connectivity. If you recently performed an upgrade, also double-check that database migration scripts have run successfully and review the database schema for potential inconsistencies.

For serialization problems, consider moving complex objects out of task parameters and utilizing XCom for passing only serializable data between tasks. Consider logging complex objects directly in the worker process using logging module and not passing them as arguments to operators.
To debug executor-specific issues, read the logs generated by the scheduler, workers, and Celery processes (or similar logs for other executors). There will often be error messages or traces pointing to the exact source of the problem.

Finally, consult the official Airflow documentation for in-depth information on database setup, executor configurations, and troubleshooting. The provided tutorials there have been invaluable in numerous scenarios. It's also useful to investigate general database practices and strategies for improving performance and preventing database lockups that could also contribute to these issues.
