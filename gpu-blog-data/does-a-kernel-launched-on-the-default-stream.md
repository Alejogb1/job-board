The kernel launch paradigm in CUDA, and its handling of errors, hinges crucially on the understanding that the default stream is not inherently error-tolerant.  While it provides a convenient mechanism for asynchronous execution, error detection and reporting remain the responsibility of the application.  This is a frequent source of misunderstanding, leading to subtle bugs that can be difficult to track down. In my experience troubleshooting high-performance computing applications, failure to explicitly check for kernel launch errors on the default stream has been a recurring source of seemingly inexplicable failures.

**1.  Explanation:**

CUDA kernels are launched asynchronously.  This means the CPU continues execution while the GPU performs the kernel's task.  The default stream, implicitly used when no explicit stream is specified in `cudaLaunchKernel`, provides a simplified interface for this asynchronous execution. However, this simplicity does not absolve the developer from handling potential errors.  A failed kernel launch, for instance due to insufficient memory or an invalid kernel configuration, will not automatically halt the host code.  Instead, the launch will silently fail, leading to undefined behavior in subsequent operations that rely on the kernel's output. The only indication of failure might be subtly wrong results or unpredictable crashes later in the application.

The CUDA runtime provides a mechanism for error checking via the `cudaGetLastError()` function. This function retrieves the last error code encountered by the CUDA runtime.  Critically, it must be called immediately after any CUDA operation that can potentially fail â€“ including kernel launches.  Ignoring this step leaves the application vulnerable to silent errors.  Ignoring error checking is a common anti-pattern, especially when experimenting or initially developing CUDA applications, yet it's crucial for robust, production-ready code.  My work on the large-scale simulation project at my previous employer underscored the importance of this: a seemingly minor omission in error handling cost us weeks of debugging when a seemingly inconsequential kernel launch failure corrupted a large intermediate data structure.

The nature of the error will depend on the cause of failure.  Typical errors include:

* **`cudaErrorLaunchFailure`:**  Indicates that the kernel launch failed. This could be due to several reasons, including insufficient GPU memory, kernel configuration errors (e.g., incorrect grid or block dimensions), or internal GPU errors.
* **`cudaErrorOutOfMemory`:**  The GPU lacks sufficient memory to allocate resources required for the kernel launch.
* **`cudaErrorInvalidDevice`:**  The specified device is invalid or unavailable.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect (No Error Checking):**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
    // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
    int *data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&data, 1024 * sizeof(int));

    myKernel<<<1, 1>>>(data); // Kernel launch without error checking

    // ... further processing using data ...  This is dangerous!

    cudaFree(data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the risky practice of omitting error checks. The kernel launch could fail silently, leading to unpredictable behavior in subsequent code that uses the `data` array.  The application might produce incorrect results, crash, or even corrupt other parts of the memory.


**Example 2: Correct (With Error Checking):**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
    // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
    int *data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&data, 1024 * sizeof(int));
    cudaError_t err = cudaSuccess;

    err = cudaLaunchKernel((void*)myKernel, 1, 1, 1, 1024, 1024, 0, 0, 0, data, 0);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1; // Indicate failure
    }

    // ... further processing using data ...  Now this is safe.

    cudaFree(data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example incorporates error checking after the kernel launch.  `cudaGetLastError()` is not explicitly used here, instead the return value of `cudaLaunchKernel` is checked.  If an error occurs, the error message is printed to `stderr`, and the program exits with a failure code.  This provides a robust way to handle potential errors at runtime.  This is the preferred method over `cudaGetLastError()` for kernel launch errors, as it directly provides an error code.

**Example 3: Handling Memory Allocation Errors:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
    // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
    int *data;
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void**)&data, 1024 * sizeof(int));
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    err = cudaLaunchKernel((void*)myKernel, 1, 1, 1, 1024, 1024, 0, 0, 0, data, 0);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        cudaFree(data);
        return 1;
    }

    // ... further processing ...

    cudaFree(data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates comprehensive error handling, including checks for memory allocation errors using `cudaMalloc`.   It is essential to check for errors after every CUDA API call that might fail.  Failure to free allocated memory in case of an error (as seen in the previous example), leads to memory leaks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of CUDA error handling and asynchronous operations, I recommend consulting the official CUDA programming guide.  A thorough understanding of the CUDA runtime API is also invaluable.  Finally,  familiarity with debugging tools specific to the CUDA environment will significantly aid in tracking down and resolving subtle errors.  Practice writing robust, error-checked code from the outset; neglecting this will lead to difficulties later.  The benefits of methodical error checking far outweigh the small initial overhead.
