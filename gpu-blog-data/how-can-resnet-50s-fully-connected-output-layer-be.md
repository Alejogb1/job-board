The conversion of ResNet-50's final fully connected (FC) layer to a convolutional (Conv) layer, while preserving its learned parameters, allows for spatially sensitive feature maps and enables the network to process inputs of varying dimensions. This transformation is particularly useful for tasks like semantic segmentation or object detection where spatial context is crucial, contrasting with the inherent global perspective of FC layers.

The fundamental principle underlying this conversion is that an FC layer can be mathematically represented as a 1x1 convolution. An FC layer, when viewed operationally, performs a weighted sum of all inputs. A 1x1 convolution, by design, also performs a weighted sum but over a 1x1 spatial area. This similarity permits direct weight transposition. An FC layer of size `N x M`, where N is the input feature size and M is the number of output classes, can be equivalently expressed as a 1x1 convolutional layer with M output channels and N input channels. This is accomplished by reshaping the FC weights. Instead of being a 2D matrix, they are reshaped into a 4D tensor. The input shape for this reshaped tensor is (M, N, 1, 1), meaning the weights become filters with a kernel size of 1x1. This preserves the weights and biases of the FC layer.

The bias from the FC layer remains directly applicable in the convolutional setting. Each output channel in the equivalent convolutional layer is associated with a single bias term, which matches the bias terms from the fully connected layer's output nodes. Thus the conversion entails only a restructuring of the weights, and the biases are simply carried over. The benefit of converting to convolutional layers lies not in the computation of the original FC layer itself but the additional flexibility it offers for future applications. For instance, using this conversion to perform image localization without retraining or the use of a fully connected layer would require more computationally intensive methods such as sliding window evaluations.

Here's how this transformation could be implemented with a library like PyTorch, assuming the model is loaded, and using a `named_modules` iterator to access layers:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision.models import resnet50

# Load pretrained ResNet-50
model = resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Extract the FC layer
fc_layer = model.fc
in_features = fc_layer.in_features
out_features = fc_layer.out_features

# Create an equivalent 1x1 conv layer
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_features, out_features, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0, bias=True)

# Reshape and transfer weights
conv_layer.weight = nn.Parameter(fc_layer.weight.reshape(out_features, in_features, 1, 1))

# Transfer bias
conv_layer.bias = nn.Parameter(fc_layer.bias)

# Replace the FC layer
model.fc = conv_layer
```

In this example, we first obtain the ResNet-50 model. We then capture the `in_features` and `out_features` parameters of the FC layer. We initialize a `Conv2d` layer with a kernel size of 1, ensuring the number of input and output channels matches the dimensions of the FC layer. Crucially, the FC layer's weights are reshaped into a 4D tensor compatible with a convolution's weight matrix and then loaded into the `Conv2d` weight parameter. Finally, the FC layerâ€™s bias vector is loaded into the `Conv2d` bias parameter. We then replace the original FC layer with the new convolutional layer. The conversion is now complete.

A more robust method would be to traverse the model's layers programmatically, rather than assuming a fixed layer naming convention. This allows the code to work on models that may have slightly different names for the fully connected layer or that have custom implementations with different named parameters.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision.models import resnet50

# Load pretrained ResNet-50
model = resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Find the fully connected layer (assuming it's the last linear layer)
fc_layer = None
for name, module in reversed(list(model.named_modules())):
    if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
      fc_layer = module
      fc_name = name
      break

if fc_layer is None:
   raise ValueError("No fully connected layer found in the model.")

in_features = fc_layer.in_features
out_features = fc_layer.out_features

# Create an equivalent 1x1 conv layer
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_features, out_features, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0, bias=True)

# Reshape and transfer weights
conv_layer.weight = nn.Parameter(fc_layer.weight.reshape(out_features, in_features, 1, 1))

# Transfer bias
conv_layer.bias = nn.Parameter(fc_layer.bias)


# Replace the fully connected layer with the conv layer
parent_name = fc_name.rsplit('.', 1)[0]
parent_module = model
if parent_name:
    for part in parent_name.split('.'):
        parent_module = getattr(parent_module, part)
setattr(parent_module, fc_name.rsplit('.', 1)[-1], conv_layer)
```
In this implementation, the code searches in reverse order for an `nn.Linear` layer by stepping through the model's named modules. This allows the code to locate the FC layer irrespective of the specifics of its name. Once located, the code extracts the `in_features` and `out_features`. The conversion is otherwise identical, however, rather than simply replacing `model.fc`, this code navigates the module tree to locate the parent module and correctly replaces the `fc_layer` with the `conv_layer` in place, avoiding the error of only assigning to the `model.fc` attribute.

The flexibility introduced by this conversion is not limited to simply feeding different sized images. One can now use the convolutionalized network with multiple outputs to compute a class prediction map, or a heatmap of locations for a specific class. Consider an example where you want to predict the class label for each spatial location in the image.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision.models import resnet50
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load pretrained ResNet-50 and convert FC layer as before
model = resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Find and convert the FC layer
fc_layer = None
for name, module in reversed(list(model.named_modules())):
    if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
      fc_layer = module
      fc_name = name
      break

if fc_layer is None:
    raise ValueError("No fully connected layer found in the model.")

in_features = fc_layer.in_features
out_features = fc_layer.out_features
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_features, out_features, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0, bias=True)
conv_layer.weight = nn.Parameter(fc_layer.weight.reshape(out_features, in_features, 1, 1))
conv_layer.bias = nn.Parameter(fc_layer.bias)
parent_name = fc_name.rsplit('.', 1)[0]
parent_module = model
if parent_name:
    for part in parent_name.split('.'):
        parent_module = getattr(parent_module, part)
setattr(parent_module, fc_name.rsplit('.', 1)[-1], conv_layer)


# Prepare an example image
image = Image.open("your_image.jpg") # Replace "your_image.jpg" with the actual image path
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
input_tensor = preprocess(image)
input_batch = input_tensor.unsqueeze(0)

# Pass image through the network
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(input_batch)

# output is now a tensor of size [batch_size, number_of_classes, height, width]
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") # Output should be of the form: torch.Size([1, 1000, 7, 7]) in this case (for Resnet50 and input 224x224).

# Get spatial max class
max_output, class_indexes = torch.max(output,1)
print(f"Max out shape : {max_output.shape}") # Output shape: torch.Size([1, 7, 7])
print(f"Class out shape: {class_indexes.shape}") # Output shape: torch.Size([1, 7, 7])

```

In this final example, I load the image, pre-process it and pass it through the ResNet-50 with the converted FC Layer. This example demonstrates the real value of this transformation - producing a spatial activation map indicating class prediction at various locations within the image. The final output after max reduction has dimensionality [1, 7, 7] because in resnet50 the feature map at that point is 7x7. These examples showcase a typical use case and a clear advantage over the traditional FC output for certain types of processing.

For further investigation, I recommend studying the detailed architectures of common convolutional networks. Specifically, reviewing published resources regarding the implementations of ResNet, VGG and other common convolutional networks will provide a strong understanding of the specific layer configurations. Secondly, the mathematics and implementation of convolution, especially 1x1 convolutions, should be studied. Textbooks and academic courses are particularly useful here. Finally, I would recommend reviewing the tutorials provided by PyTorch, Tensorflow, or other major Deep Learning frameworks on topics such as model modifications, layer manipulation, and transfer learning.  These provide hands on experience that is vital to a deeper understanding of these concepts.
