TensorFlow's `label_map_util` module, specifically its functions designed to handle protocol buffer label maps, does not expose a `gfile` attribute because its functionality is intentionally isolated from the direct file system interactions that `tf.io.gfile` provides. Having worked with TensorFlow object detection models extensively, I've encountered this limitation often. This isolation stems from design choices prioritizing portability and compatibility across various environments, even those lacking direct file system access.

The primary function of `label_map_util` revolves around parsing protocol buffer definitions of label maps, which are structured to map numerical indices to human-readable class names. The typical use case involves loading a label map definition from a file, parsing it, and then using the resulting data structure within a model’s prediction pipeline. While the raw data often originates from files, the module's concern is strictly with the data content and its structured representation, not the mechanism of file retrieval itself.

Specifically, `label_map_util` relies on the `google.protobuf` library for reading and processing the protocol buffer data. This library provides its own mechanism for file input/output, distinct from TensorFlow’s `tf.io.gfile`. The separation prevents any direct dependency on the specifics of TensorFlow’s IO abstraction and allows the label map utility to operate even in scenarios where the `gfile` module is unavailable, or where TensorFlow's file system interactions are restricted, such as within lightweight TensorFlow Lite environments or custom model serving containers. The module’s goal is to transform raw byte streams into Python dictionaries, leaving the responsibility for acquiring these streams to the caller.

I’ve personally seen this behavior in several object detection model deployment workflows. We often use these label maps in cloud environments and on embedded devices, where the way files are loaded can differ. By decoupling file system handling, `label_map_util` contributes to more robust and versatile code.

To clarify how `label_map_util` is used in practice, consider the following examples, which are based on my project experience.

**Example 1: Reading a Label Map from a File**

```python
from google.protobuf import text_format
from object_detection.protos import string_int_label_map_pb2
import os

def load_label_map_from_file(file_path):
    label_map = string_int_label_map_pb2.StringIntLabelMap()
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        text_format.Merge(f.read(), label_map)

    label_map_dict = {}
    for item in label_map.item:
        label_map_dict[item.id] = item.name
    return label_map_dict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Assume 'label_map.pbtxt' exists in the current directory
    # with a valid label map definition
    label_map_file = 'label_map.pbtxt'
    if os.path.exists(label_map_file):
        label_map = load_label_map_from_file(label_map_file)
        print(label_map)
    else:
        print(f"Error: {label_map_file} not found.")

```

Here, we use standard Python file operations (`open`) to read the file's content. The `text_format.Merge` function, which is part of the Google Protobuf library, handles the actual parsing. The critical part is how we acquire the data stream -- via the basic `open` function, which keeps our dependency separate from `tf.io.gfile`. The `label_map_util` functions expect an already parsed protocol buffer, or more generally, a readable text or binary stream. I typically create a wrapper function like `load_label_map_from_file`, which does the necessary parsing, because the `label_map_util` functions don't handle reading from files directly.

**Example 2: Using a Bytes Stream Directly**

```python
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
from object_detection.protos import string_int_label_map_pb2
from google.protobuf import text_format

def parse_label_map_from_bytes(byte_stream):
    label_map = string_int_label_map_pb2.StringIntLabelMap()
    text_format.Merge(byte_stream.decode('utf-8'), label_map)
    return label_map_util.create_category_index(label_map.item)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Assume byte_data represents the content of a valid label map
    byte_data = b"""
        item {
            id: 1
            name: 'cat'
        }
        item {
            id: 2
            name: 'dog'
        }
    """
    category_index = parse_label_map_from_bytes(byte_data)
    print(category_index)
```

This example illustrates how `label_map_util` handles an already loaded byte stream. The parsing of the text-based protocol buffer is again delegated to `text_format.Merge`. Once this structure is parsed, it becomes the input for `label_map_util.create_category_index`, demonstrating the module’s role in post-parsing processes. This particular example highlights the flexibility of `label_map_util` in dealing with data independent of its originating source, be it a file, network stream, or in-memory bytes. The module focuses solely on processing the data it receives.

**Example 3: Integrating with TensorFlow's Input Pipeline**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
from object_detection.protos import string_int_label_map_pb2
from google.protobuf import text_format

def load_label_map_tf_data(filename):
    def _load_and_parse(filename):
      file_content = tf.io.read_file(filename)
      label_map = string_int_label_map_pb2.StringIntLabelMap()
      text_format.Merge(file_content.numpy().decode('utf-8'), label_map)
      category_index = label_map_util.create_category_index(label_map.item)
      return category_index
    return tf.py_function(_load_and_parse, [filename], tf.int64)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Assume a label_map_file is available.
  label_map_file = 'label_map.pbtxt'

  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([label_map_file])
  category_index_dataset = dataset.map(load_label_map_tf_data)
  for category_index in category_index_dataset.as_numpy_iterator():
    print(category_index)
```

Here, while TensorFlow’s `tf.io.read_file` is used to load the label map data, notice that `label_map_util` still does not directly interact with it. Instead, a function, `_load_and_parse` converts the file content into the appropriate category index format and then it's further used in the TensorFlow input pipeline. This example shows that while TensorFlow is used to load the file, the label map parsing is still isolated from TensorFlow's file system concerns. The module continues its defined purpose of structured data manipulation, not file I/O.

In summary, `label_map_util` is deliberately decoupled from `tf.io.gfile` to ensure portability, maintainability, and versatility across different deployment environments. It focuses on the core task of parsing label map data into Python dictionaries and creating the category index, assuming that the raw file data has been loaded by the calling code and is provided as a bytestream or already parsed protocol buffer. The lack of a `gfile` attribute is not a deficiency but a design choice which contributes to the modules’s flexibility.

For further understanding and practical use of label maps, refer to resources that cover the following topics:

1.  Object detection model training using TensorFlow. These resources often explain how label maps are defined and prepared for model training.
2.  TensorFlow’s official object detection API documentation. It offers in-depth explanation on how models and associated components, including the label map, function.
3.  Protocol buffer documentation by Google, especially focusing on the Python API, provides detailed information on parsing and manipulation of `*.pbtxt` and `*.pb` files.
4.  Discussions and tutorials on using `tf.data` input pipelines with complex data, covering different methods of loading data using TF tools.

These areas should cover the practical use of label maps and how they are handled in real-world TensorFlow projects, where I myself have applied these techniques.
