Rounding specific elements within a PyTorch tensor, rather than applying a blanket rounding operation, necessitates selective manipulation based on positional indices. I have encountered this exact requirement during a multi-modal model implementation, specifically when dealing with discrete token embeddings that required selective rounding before concatenation with continuous feature vectors. The primary challenge lies in efficiently targeting and modifying only the intended elements without resorting to computationally expensive iterations over the entire tensor.

The most direct approach involves leveraging PyTorch's indexing capabilities in conjunction with the `torch.round()` function. Essentially, we construct a boolean mask tensor, matching the shape of the tensor we wish to modify, where `True` indicates the elements to be rounded and `False` indicates elements that should remain unchanged. This mask is then applied to create two tensors: one containing the values to be rounded and another containing the values to be preserved. The rounded values are then created, and finally both are then merged to form the resulting tensor. This avoids unnecessary computations of a full tensor rounding and respects the non-destructive nature of tensor operations.

Letâ€™s examine a scenario with a 2D tensor where we need to round specific elements at locations `(0, 1)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(2, 2)`.

```python
import torch

def round_specific_elements(tensor, indices):
    """Rounds specific elements of a PyTorch tensor.

    Args:
        tensor (torch.Tensor): The input tensor.
        indices (list): A list of tuples representing the indices of the elements to round.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The tensor with specific elements rounded.
    """
    mask = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=torch.bool)
    for row, col in indices:
      mask[row, col] = True

    values_to_round = tensor[mask]
    values_to_preserve = tensor[~mask]
    rounded_values = torch.round(values_to_round)
    result = tensor.clone()
    result[mask] = rounded_values

    return result

# Example Usage
tensor = torch.tensor([[1.2, 2.6, 3.1],
                       [4.8, 5.3, 6.9],
                       [7.1, 8.4, 9.7]])

indices_to_round = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 2)]
rounded_tensor = round_specific_elements(tensor, indices_to_round)
print("Original Tensor:")
print(tensor)
print("\nTensor with Specified Elements Rounded:")
print(rounded_tensor)

```

In this example, the `round_specific_elements` function first creates a boolean mask. Then, it extracts the values at the specified indices and the values at other indices. Finally, it rounds the extracted values and inserts them into the result, leaving the remaining values intact. Using `torch.clone()` ensures that the original input tensor remains unaltered. This approach is efficient as it avoids iterating through the entire tensor and performs the rounding operation only on the designated elements. The usage example shows how one would specify which locations within a 2D tensor should have their values rounded.

For a 3D tensor, the principle remains identical, though the mask generation becomes more involved. For instance, assume we have a 3D tensor representing image feature maps where we want to selectively round values in a subset of channels, at specific spatial positions across the entire image.

```python
import torch

def round_specific_elements_3d(tensor, channel_indices, spatial_indices):
  """Rounds elements of a 3D PyTorch tensor across specific channels and spatial locations.

      Args:
          tensor (torch.Tensor): The input tensor (C x H x W).
          channel_indices (list): A list of channel indices (integers) to round.
          spatial_indices (list): A list of (row, column) tuples to round in each channel.

      Returns:
          torch.Tensor: The tensor with specific elements rounded.
  """
  mask = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=torch.bool)
  for channel in channel_indices:
        for row, col in spatial_indices:
            mask[channel, row, col] = True

  values_to_round = tensor[mask]
  values_to_preserve = tensor[~mask]
  rounded_values = torch.round(values_to_round)
  result = tensor.clone()
  result[mask] = rounded_values

  return result

# Example Usage
tensor_3d = torch.rand(3, 4, 5) * 10 # 3 channels, 4x5 spatial
channel_indices = [0, 2] # Round in channels 0 and 2
spatial_indices = [(1, 1), (2, 3)]  # Round at these spatial locations in the specified channels
rounded_tensor_3d = round_specific_elements_3d(tensor_3d, channel_indices, spatial_indices)
print("Original 3D Tensor:")
print(tensor_3d)
print("\nTensor with Specified Elements Rounded:")
print(rounded_tensor_3d)

```
In this case, the `round_specific_elements_3d` function constructs a 3D boolean mask based on both channel and spatial coordinates. The structure follows the logic used in the 2D case, applying the mask to isolate, round, and reintegrate the modified elements. It demonstrates the flexibility of this masked approach to handle tensors of different dimensionality.

Finally, consider a scenario where the indices to round are not directly provided but rather are the results of another operation, for example, when you want to round the top-k elements in a tensor along a specific dimension.

```python
import torch

def round_top_k_along_dimension(tensor, k, dim):
  """Rounds the top-k values along a specific dimension.

    Args:
        tensor (torch.Tensor): The input tensor.
        k (int): The number of top elements to round.
        dim (int): The dimension along which to find top elements.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The tensor with top-k values rounded.
  """
  top_k_values, top_k_indices = torch.topk(tensor, k, dim=dim)

  mask = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=torch.bool)
  mask.scatter_(dim, top_k_indices, 1)

  values_to_round = tensor[mask]
  values_to_preserve = tensor[~mask]
  rounded_values = torch.round(values_to_round)
  result = tensor.clone()
  result[mask] = rounded_values

  return result

# Example Usage
tensor_multi_dim = torch.randn(2, 3, 4) * 10
k_val = 2
dim_val = 2
rounded_multi_dim = round_top_k_along_dimension(tensor_multi_dim, k_val, dim_val)
print("Original Tensor:")
print(tensor_multi_dim)
print("\nTensor with Top-k Along Specified Dimension Rounded:")
print(rounded_multi_dim)
```
In this case, the `round_top_k_along_dimension` function uses `torch.topk` to find the top k indices along the defined dimension. The mask is constructed using a sparse scatter operation, which provides an efficient approach to setting the locations given by `top_k_indices` to `True`. The rest of the approach is consistent with the earlier methods.

For further exploration, I recommend researching more advanced indexing techniques in PyTorch, including the usage of `torch.nonzero()` for extracting indices satisfying a complex condition, and `torch.where()` for more conditional tensor modifications. Further investigation into broadcasting can also simplify situations where the mask needs to be expanded for operations involving tensors of different ranks. Finally, studying the various sparse tensor functionalities can be beneficial for extremely large datasets where the number of targeted elements is significantly smaller than the total number of elements. All of these techniques revolve around efficient selective element access and modification without incurring performance penalties on the overall tensor.
