The core challenge in creating a per-class PyTorch DataLoader lies in efficiently partitioning your dataset based on class labels before feeding it to the `DataLoader`.  Simple slicing won't suffice for large datasets due to memory constraints and potential performance bottlenecks.  My experience optimizing data pipelines for large-scale image classification projects highlighted the importance of a robust and memory-efficient solution.  This involves leveraging dataset transformations and careful management of memory during data loading.

**1.  Explanation:**

The standard approach involves creating a custom dataset class that handles the per-class partitioning. This dataset class will inherit from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and override the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. The `__getitem__` method will be responsible for fetching data for a specific index, while `__len__` provides the dataset's size.  Critically, this custom dataset will internally maintain a mapping between indices and class labels.  This mapping allows for efficient retrieval of data instances belonging to a specific class.  Subsequently, multiple `DataLoader` instances, one for each class, can be initialized, each pointing to the same custom dataset but utilizing different samplers to isolate data points associated with their respective classes.

The choice of sampler is key for efficiency.  Instead of loading the entire dataset into memory to filter by class, we use class-specific samplers.  These samplers directly access the indices corresponding to each class within the custom dataset, minimizing unnecessary data loading. This strategy significantly improves memory efficiency, especially when dealing with datasets containing thousands or millions of samples.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Per-Class DataLoader (Small Dataset):**

This example showcases a basic implementation for smaller datasets where loading the entire dataset into memory isn't prohibitively expensive.  It's suitable for demonstration and educational purposes, but scalability is limited.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, SubsetRandomSampler

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, labels):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx], self.labels[idx]

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = torch.randn(100, 3, 32, 32)  # 100 images, 3 channels, 32x32
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))  # 10 classes

dataset = MyDataset(data, labels)

dataloaders = {}
for i in range(10): #assuming 10 classes
    indices = [idx for idx, label in enumerate(labels) if label == i]
    sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(indices)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, sampler=sampler, batch_size=32)
    dataloaders[i] = dataloader

# Accessing a specific class's dataloader:
for batch in dataloaders[5]: #Dataloader for class 5
    images, labels = batch
    # Process the batch
```

**Commentary:** This code directly uses `SubsetRandomSampler` to select indices for each class. While functional for smaller datasets, its memory usage scales linearly with the dataset size.


**Example 2:  Memory-Efficient Per-Class DataLoader (Large Dataset):**

This example uses a more sophisticated approach, ideal for large datasets where memory efficiency is paramount.  It leverages a custom sampler for direct index access.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, Sampler

class ClassSpecificSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, labels, class_index):
        self.labels = labels
        self.class_index = class_index
        self.indices = [i for i, label in enumerate(labels) if label == class_index]

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.indices)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.indices)

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    # ... (same as Example 1) ...

# Sample data (replace with your actual data loading mechanism)
#Simulating a large dataset -  In reality data would be loaded on demand
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (100000,)) #100,000 samples, 10 classes


dataset = MyDataset(None, labels) #Data is not loaded initially, only labels.

dataloaders = {}
for i in range(10):
    sampler = ClassSpecificSampler(labels, i)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, sampler=sampler, batch_size=32,
                           collate_fn=lambda x: (x[0][0], x[0][1])) #Custom Collate_fn to handle potential missing data
    dataloaders[i] = dataloader

# Accessing a dataloader:  Note that __getitem__ in the dataset will now load a single sample when needed.
for batch in dataloaders[2]:
    images, labels = batch
    # Process the batch
```


**Commentary:** This example avoids loading the entire dataset into memory. The `ClassSpecificSampler` only stores indices, and data is loaded on demand within the `__getitem__` method of the `MyDataset` class (simulated here for illustrative purposes).  The `collate_fn` handles cases where a batch might contain only a single data point.


**Example 3:  Leveraging PyTorch's `IterableDataset` (Extremely Large Dataset):**

For exceptionally large datasets that cannot be held in memory even as indices, `IterableDataset` provides the optimal solution.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import IterableDataset, DataLoader

class ClassSpecificIterableDataset(IterableDataset):
    def __init__(self, data_loader, class_index):
        self.data_loader = data_loader
        self.class_index = class_index

    def __iter__(self):
        for data, label in self.data_loader:
            if label == self.class_index:
                yield data, label

#Assuming a function 'get_data_loader' which returns a dataloader for the entire dataset
main_dataloader = get_data_loader() #This would handle your data loading logic

dataloaders = {}
for i in range(10):
    class_specific_dataset = ClassSpecificIterableDataset(main_dataloader, i)
    dataloader = DataLoader(class_specific_dataset, batch_size=32)
    dataloaders[i] = dataloader

#Accessing the dataloader - Note that the entire dataset is streamed, not loaded initially
for batch in dataloaders[1]:
    images, labels = batch
    #Process batch
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates the use of `IterableDataset`. The `main_dataloader` provides a stream of data, which `ClassSpecificIterableDataset` filters by class.  This approach is crucial for datasets that exceed available RAM.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official PyTorch documentation on datasets and dataloaders.
*   Advanced PyTorch tutorials focusing on memory management and large-scale data handling.
*   Textbooks and online resources covering efficient data structures and algorithms in Python.  Pay particular attention to efficient indexing techniques.



This comprehensive approach addresses the problem of creating per-class PyTorch DataLoaders across various dataset sizes, prioritizing memory efficiency and scalability. Remember to adapt these examples to your specific data format and loading mechanisms.  Always profile your code to identify potential bottlenecks, especially when working with large datasets.
