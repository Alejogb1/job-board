The apparent lack of parallelism in Python's `asyncio` tasks often stems from a misunderstanding of the underlying event loop architecture and the distinction between concurrency and parallelism.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-throughput data processing pipelines has highlighted this consistently.  `asyncio` is fundamentally concurrent, not parallel. This means it efficiently manages multiple tasks, switching between them rapidly, giving the *illusion* of parallelism, but not true simultaneous execution across multiple CPU cores.  True parallelism requires leveraging multiple threads or processes, which `asyncio` doesn't inherently provide.

**1.  Understanding the Event Loop**

`asyncio` employs a single-threaded event loop. This loop continuously monitors a set of tasks, executing each one until it becomes blocked (e.g., waiting for I/O). When a task is blocked, the event loop immediately switches to another ready task, maximizing CPU utilization for I/O-bound operations. However, if a task is CPU-bound (performing intensive calculations), it will monopolize the event loop, preventing other tasks from running concurrently. This is the crux of the issue:  CPU-bound tasks in `asyncio` negate the benefit of its concurrent design.


**2. Code Examples Illustrating the Problem and Solutions**

**Example 1: CPU-Bound Task – No Parallelism**

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def cpu_bound_task(name, duration):
    print(f"Task {name}: Starting")
    start_time = time.time()
    # Simulate CPU-bound operation
    for _ in range(10**7):
        pass  
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Task {name}: Finished in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")


async def main():
    tasks = [cpu_bound_task(f"Task {i}", 1) for i in range(4)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example showcases the issue. Each `cpu_bound_task` performs a computationally intensive operation. Running this will reveal that the tasks execute sequentially, taking approximately four times as long as a single task.  The event loop is held up by each task, preventing true concurrency.


**Example 2: I/O-Bound Task – Apparent Parallelism**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def io_bound_task(name, url):
    print(f"Task {name}: Starting")
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            await response.text()
    print(f"Task {name}: Finished")

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com" for _ in range(4)]
    tasks = [io_bound_task(f"Task {i}", url) for i in range(4) for url in urls] # intentional replication for demonstration
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates the power of `asyncio` with I/O-bound operations.  Each `io_bound_task` makes an HTTP request.  Because the tasks spend most of their time waiting for network I/O, the event loop can efficiently switch between them, creating the impression of parallelism. The total execution time will be significantly less than the sum of the individual task execution times.


**Example 3:  Hybrid Approach – Utilizing `multiprocessing`**

```python
import asyncio
import multiprocessing

async def cpu_bound_task(name, duration):
    # ... (same as Example 1) ...


def run_cpu_bound_in_process(task_args):
    asyncio.run(cpu_bound_task(*task_args))


async def main():
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:
        tasks = [(f"Task {i}", 1) for i in range(4)]
        pool.map(run_cpu_bound_in_process, tasks)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```


This improved example addresses the CPU-bound limitation by utilizing the `multiprocessing` module.  Each CPU-bound task is offloaded to a separate process, enabling true parallelism.  This approach effectively leverages multiple cores to achieve significant speed improvements for CPU-intensive operations.  Note the careful structuring; `multiprocessing` cannot directly interact with `asyncio`'s event loop, requiring a separate function to execute the `asyncio.run()` call within each process.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of `asyncio`, I highly recommend consulting the official Python documentation.  Exploring advanced topics like `asyncio.Semaphore` for rate-limiting and `asyncio.Queue` for inter-task communication is vital for building robust and scalable applications.  Furthermore, studying concurrency patterns and the differences between concurrency and parallelism is crucial to avoid performance bottlenecks.  A good understanding of operating system concepts like process and thread management will also be beneficial.  Finally, profiling tools can help identify performance bottlenecks within your `asyncio` code, guiding optimization efforts.  Effective debugging involves scrutinizing your task definitions; correctly identifying I/O bound vs. CPU bound tasks is the key to choosing the right concurrency strategy.
