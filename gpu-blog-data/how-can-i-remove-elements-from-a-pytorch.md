A core challenge in PyTorch tensor manipulation involves efficiently removing elements, a necessity for tasks ranging from data preprocessing to advanced model output filtering. This process isn't as straightforward as using Python's list methods due to tensors' inherent immutability and optimized structure for numerical computation. Instead, removing elements frequently entails creating new tensors while excluding the targeted data.

The underlying principle I’ve consistently relied on is the generation of a boolean mask which selects the elements *not* to be removed. This mask then facilitates creating a new tensor comprising only the desired elements. I’ve found this mask-based approach allows for the removal of elements based on either their indices or their values, a flexibility which other methods, such as directly manipulating underlying data structures, lack. It avoids in-place modifications, which typically disrupt PyTorch's computational graph, hindering backpropagation for training.

Let's explore the specific techniques. First, consider the removal of elements based on their indices. Suppose I have a tensor representing a sequence, and I need to exclude specific time steps. This calls for indexing-based removal. I achieve this through creating a boolean mask that maps to the indices I intend to retain. Specifically, if the tensor `data` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and I want to remove the element at index 2 (which is `3`), I can create a mask that's `[True, True, False, True, True]`. This boolean mask then filters the original tensor, producing the resulting tensor `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.

```python
import torch

data = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices_to_remove = [2]  # Index of element '3'
mask = torch.ones(data.size(), dtype=torch.bool) # Start with all Trues
mask[indices_to_remove] = False # Set target indices to False

filtered_data = data[mask] # Apply mask to the tensor

print(f"Original Tensor: {data}")
print(f"Mask: {mask}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor: {filtered_data}")
```
In this example, I initialize a mask of boolean `True` values matching the size of the input tensor `data`. I then set to `False` the boolean values corresponding to the indices I plan to remove. This masking procedure is central to this approach. The `filtered_data` is then generated using boolean indexing of the original tensor with this mask. This approach avoids direct modification of the original data tensor and is computationally efficient.

A second prevalent use case, which I encounter frequently, is removing elements based on their values. For instance, I might need to remove all zero-valued elements from a tensor.  This operation cannot rely on index-based masking because I don’t know the locations ahead of time. Instead, the mask needs to be dynamically computed. This computation typically uses a logical operator comparison of the tensor with the target value to be removed. If I have tensor `data = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0])`, and I want to remove all zeros, I compute a mask that results in `[False, True, False, True, True, False]` indicating elements not equal to 0.

```python
import torch

data = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0])
value_to_remove = 0
mask = data != value_to_remove

filtered_data = data[mask]

print(f"Original Tensor: {data}")
print(f"Mask: {mask}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor: {filtered_data}")
```
Here, I use the inequality operator (`!=`) to directly create the boolean mask based on element-wise comparison with `value_to_remove`. This mask correctly identifies which elements of the original tensor are to be retained. The `filtered_data` tensor is generated in the same way as the index based removal using this mask. This approach is highly flexible for removing a range of elements based on different comparison criteria.

Finally, in higher dimensional tensors, the process becomes slightly more nuanced. If I need to remove, say, rows from a 2D tensor, I need to create a mask that applies to the specific dimension I'm targeting. If `data` is a matrix like `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` and I want to remove the second row, I will create a boolean mask that operates on the first dimension of the matrix (rows) by setting its second entry to `False`. This demonstrates the generality of the boolean mask approach.

```python
import torch

data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
rows_to_remove = [1]
mask = torch.ones(data.size(0), dtype=torch.bool) # Creates a 1D mask for row index
mask[rows_to_remove] = False
filtered_data = data[mask]

print(f"Original Tensor: {data}")
print(f"Mask: {mask}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor: {filtered_data}")
```

Here, the mask `mask` is created with the length equal to the number of rows of the input tensor. This allows us to remove rows by selecting appropriate indexes of this mask to `False`. If I were to remove columns instead, I would need to create a mask with a length equal to the number of columns. It’s essential to carefully consider the dimension over which I want to perform the removal and create the mask accordingly.

It’s worth mentioning that the primary benefit of this approach stems from the immutability of tensors; it preserves the original tensor and allows the generation of a new one, leaving the original data unchanged. This is often critical, especially in computational graphs in PyTorch where in-place operations can lead to unexpected backpropagation results and incorrect gradient computation.

For learning further, I would recommend starting with the official PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation and indexing operations. Several online tutorials and books focus on fundamental tensor operations, and studying these can deepen your understanding of boolean masking and related techniques. In my experience, practicing with various examples, particularly with different dimensionalities of tensors, is extremely beneficial. I often find myself creating dummy datasets with varying sizes to practice these operations. A thorough comprehension of how PyTorch's indexing mechanisms operates is key to success with tensor manipulation.
