The `ImportError: cannot import name 'set_random_seed' from 'tensorflow'` arises from a version mismatch between TensorFlow's API and your code's expectation.  `tf.set_random_seed` was deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x and subsequently removed. This isn't merely a matter of a simple function rename; it reflects a fundamental shift in TensorFlow's random number generation strategy.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous projects—from large-scale distributed training to smaller research prototypes—highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's evolution regarding randomness.

**1. Explanation: The Shift from `set_random_seed` to `tf.random.set_seed`**

Prior to TensorFlow 2.x, setting the random seed relied on `tf.set_random_seed`. This function attempted to control randomness across various operations within the graph. However, TensorFlow 2.x adopted eager execution as the default, significantly altering how operations are handled.  The graph-based approach of older versions was replaced with a more immediate, imperative style.  Consequently, controlling randomness requires a different approach.

The core issue lies in the distinct management of randomness at different levels: the Python interpreter, TensorFlow's operation level, and potentially other libraries interfacing with TensorFlow. The function `tf.random.set_seed` is designed to operate within this revised framework.  It doesn't guarantee complete reproducibility across all platforms and hardware configurations due to the inherent complexities of parallel processing and underlying hardware limitations, but it establishes a deterministic starting point within the TensorFlow operations.

Furthermore, true reproducibility often necessitates setting the Python interpreter's random seed using `random.seed()` in conjunction with `tf.random.set_seed`.  This combined approach addresses randomness originating from Python's random number generator and TensorFlow's internal generators, thereby maximizing the chances of reproducible results.  Ignoring this aspect is a common source of further confusion and errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Seed Setting in TensorFlow 2.x**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Set the global TensorFlow seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Generate some random tensors
tensor1 = tf.random.normal((2, 3))
tensor2 = tf.random.uniform((2, 3))

print("Tensor 1:\n", tensor1.numpy())
print("Tensor 2:\n", tensor2.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the correct way to set the seed using `tf.random.set_seed` in TensorFlow 2.x.  Note the use of `.numpy()` to convert the TensorFlow tensors to NumPy arrays for printing.  The output will be consistent across runs with the same seed value because `tf.random.set_seed` is controlling the state of the TensorFlow random number generator.

**Example 2:  Combining Python and TensorFlow Seeds**

```python
import random
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Set the Python random seed
random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# Set the TensorFlow random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Generate random numbers using both Python and TensorFlow
python_random = random.random()
numpy_random = np.random.rand()
tf_random = tf.random.normal((1,))

print("Python random:", python_random)
print("NumPy random:", numpy_random)
print("TensorFlow random:", tf_random.numpy())
```

This code snippet improves reproducibility by addressing randomness at the Python interpreter level and the NumPy level, which is often interfaced with Tensorflow operations. By setting seeds for both the Python `random` module, NumPy's random number generation, and TensorFlow, we increase consistency across different parts of our code.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple GPUs (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Set the global seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# For multi-GPU scenarios, consider setting the seed on each GPU individually.
# This is crucial for consistent results in distributed training.

gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)

# ... your TensorFlow model and training code ...
```

This example addresses a more advanced scenario: parallel training on multiple GPUs.  Independent random number streams may be required on each GPU to ensure that different processes are not interfering with each other's randomness.  The code shows how to check for and handle GPUs (if available), but the crucial point for reproducibility remains setting appropriate seeds within the individual GPU contexts, which will require further modifications to the training loop not shown here. This is where I've seen the most subtle reproducibility problems emerge in my past projects involving distributed training.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation on random number generation.  Relevant chapters in introductory and advanced machine learning textbooks dealing with reproducibility and numerical computation.  Publications on best practices for large-scale machine learning experiments; these frequently address reproducibility in the context of distributed systems and hardware variability.  Carefully examining the release notes for your TensorFlow version.  This will provide an accurate and complete history of changes in API structure.
