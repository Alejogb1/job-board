The discrepancy between your expected 25 outputs and the actual output of your modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) after altering the output layer from 10 to 25 units stems almost certainly from a misunderstanding of how the output layer interacts with the loss function and the training process, particularly regarding the final activation function and potential inconsistencies in data preprocessing.  I've encountered similar issues during the development of a multi-class image classification system for identifying microscopic parasites, and the solution proved to be surprisingly subtle.

**1.  Explanation: The Role of the Output Layer and Loss Function**

A CNN’s architecture culminates in the output layer, which determines the network's prediction.  When dealing with multi-class classification, the output layer commonly uses a softmax activation function.  The softmax function normalizes the raw output of the preceding layer into a probability distribution over all classes.  Each unit in the output layer represents a class, and its corresponding softmax output represents the probability that the input belongs to that class.  Critically, the number of units in this layer directly corresponds to the number of classes your model can predict.  Changing this number – from 10 to 25 in your case – *must* be accompanied by adjustments in several other components.

First, the *number of classes* in your dataset must match the number of output units.  If your dataset only contains labels for 10 classes, simply increasing the output layer to 25 units won't magically produce meaningful predictions for 15 nonexistent classes. The model will still only "learn" about the 10 classes it has data for, even though it has 25 output neurons. The remaining 15 will either be ignored or randomly assigned values.

Second, your *loss function* must be compatible with the multi-class nature of your problem.  Categorical cross-entropy is the standard choice for multi-class classification.  Using a different loss function, such as binary cross-entropy (intended for binary classification), would lead to incorrect training and inaccurate predictions, regardless of the number of output units.  Ensure your code explicitly uses categorical cross-entropy (or a suitable variant like sparse categorical cross-entropy, depending on how your labels are encoded).

Finally, verify that your *data preprocessing* correctly maps your labels to the 25 classes.  If your labels aren't properly adjusted to reflect the 25 class situation, the model will not learn the mapping correctly.  This involves checking for potential errors in data loading, one-hot encoding (or equivalent label transformation), and ensuring that any existing label mapping is updated to accommodate the expanded class count.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate these points with TensorFlow/Keras examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation (10-class model applied to a 25-class dataset)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your convolutional layers ...
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Incorrect: Only 10 output neurons
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', # Correct loss function, but applied incorrectly
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training with a dataset containing 25 classes will lead to poor results
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example showcases a common error: Using an output layer designed for 10 classes with a dataset containing 25 classes. Even though the loss function is correct, the limited output layer restricts the model's capacity to learn all 25 classes.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation (25-class model)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your convolutional layers ...
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(25, activation='softmax') # Correct: 25 output neurons
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training with a correctly preprocessed 25-class dataset
model.fit(x_train, y_train_25, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the correct implementation with 25 output units, aligning the number of units with the number of classes in `y_train_25`.  Assume `y_train_25` is a properly one-hot encoded representation of the 25 classes.


**Example 3:  Handling Sparse Labels**

If your labels are integer indices instead of one-hot encoded vectors, use `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your convolutional layers ...
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(25, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', # Handles integer labels
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training with integer labels (0-24)
model.fit(x_train, y_train_sparse, epochs=10)
```

This example shows how to handle integer labels efficiently, avoiding the need for explicit one-hot encoding.  `y_train_sparse` contains integers from 0 to 24 representing the 25 classes.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures, loss functions, and activation functions, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, and "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop.  Furthermore, the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.) will provide essential details on specific functions and their usage.  Exploring tutorials and code examples related to multi-class image classification will solidify your understanding of practical implementations.  Finally, meticulously reviewing your own code, particularly data loading and preprocessing stages, is crucial for identifying subtle errors.
