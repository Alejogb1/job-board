Tensor structure for convolution hinges fundamentally on the spatial arrangement of data within the tensor, specifically its dimensionality and the organization of feature channels.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for medical image analysis highlighted this crucial point numerous times.  Incorrect tensor structuring leads to inefficient computations, incorrect outputs, or outright code failure.  Therefore, understanding the interplay between tensor dimensions and the convolution operation is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A tensor suitable for convolution must inherently represent spatial data.  This implies at least two dimensions representing the spatial extent (e.g., height and width for a 2D image, height, width, and depth for a 3D volume).  Additionally, a third dimension represents feature channels.  For grayscale images, this channel dimension has size one.  For color images (RGB), this dimension has size three, representing the red, green, and blue channels.  In more complex scenarios such as multi-spectral imaging or feature maps from earlier convolutional layers, this dimension can have significantly larger sizes.  The precise tensor dimensions depend entirely on the input data.

Consider a single color image:  The spatial dimensions might be 256x256 pixels (height x width). The channel dimension would be 3 (RGB). Thus, the tensor representing this image would have shape (256, 256, 3).  This structure is crucial because the convolutional operation inherently operates on these spatial and channel dimensions simultaneously.  A convolutional kernel (filter) also has a spatial extent (e.g., 3x3) and a depth equal to the input channel dimension.  The convolution operation slides this kernel across the input tensor's spatial dimensions, performing element-wise multiplication and summation at each position.  The result is a single output value for that spatial position in the output feature map.  This process is repeated for every spatial position and for every channel in the input tensor.

The output tensor’s spatial dimensions depend on the convolution’s stride, padding, and the kernel size. The output channel dimension is determined by the number of filters used in the convolution. For instance, using 64 filters of size 3x3 on our 256x256 RGB image would produce an output tensor with shape (X, X, 64), where X is the calculated spatial dimension after considering stride and padding.  This output tensor itself can serve as input for further convolutional layers.

Therefore, careful consideration of the spatial and channel dimensions of the input tensor is vital.  Incorrect dimension ordering can lead to runtime errors or subtly incorrect results, as the convolution operation will be applied incorrectly.  In my experience, this frequently manifested as unexpected dimension mismatch errors during model training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  2D Convolution on a Grayscale Image (using NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input tensor: Grayscale image (height, width, channels)
image = np.random.rand(28, 28, 1)  # 28x28 grayscale image

# Convolutional kernel (filter) (kernel_height, kernel_width, input_channels, output_channels)
kernel = np.random.rand(3, 3, 1, 16) # 3x3 kernel, 1 input channel, 16 output channels

# Implementing a simplified convolution (without optimizations)
def conv2d(image, kernel):
    # Handle boundary conditions (padding can be added here)
    output_height = image.shape[0] - kernel.shape[0] + 1
    output_width = image.shape[1] - kernel.shape[1] + 1
    output = np.zeros((output_height, output_width, kernel.shape[3]))
    for i in range(output_height):
        for j in range(output_width):
            for k in range(kernel.shape[3]):
                output[i, j, k] = np.sum(image[i:i+kernel.shape[0], j:j+kernel.shape[1], :] * kernel[:, :, :, k])
    return output

output = conv2d(image, kernel)
print(output.shape)  # Output shape will be (26, 26, 16) without padding
```

This example demonstrates a fundamental 2D convolution.  Note the explicit handling of the kernel and its application across the spatial dimensions.  The absence of sophisticated padding or stride handling simplifies the illustration.

**Example 2:  3D Convolution on a Voxel Data (using TensorFlow/Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor: 3D volume (depth, height, width, channels)
volume = tf.random.normal((16, 64, 64, 3)) # 16 depth slices, 64x64 spatial extent, 3 channels

# Define the convolutional layer
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv3D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')

# Apply the convolution
output = conv_layer(volume)

print(output.shape) # Output shape will be (16, 64, 64, 32). Padding='same' ensures output size matches input size.
```

This example leverages TensorFlow's high-level API for a cleaner implementation.  The `Conv3D` layer automatically handles the complexities of 3D convolution, padding, and stride.  This is significantly more efficient than manually implementing the convolution.  The `padding='same'` argument ensures the output tensor has the same spatial dimensions as the input.

**Example 3:  Convolution with Multiple Input Channels (using PyTorch):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Input tensor:  (batch_size, channels, height, width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 64, 256, 256)  # Batch of 32 images, 64 channels, 256x256 spatial

# Define the convolutional layer
weight = torch.randn(128, 64, 3, 3)  # 128 output channels, 64 input channels, 3x3 kernel

# Perform the convolution
output = F.conv2d(input_tensor, weight, padding=1) # padding=1 adds padding to avoid size reduction

print(output.shape) # Output shape will be (32, 128, 256, 256).
```

This PyTorch example demonstrates convolution with multiple input channels.  The kernel's depth matches the input channel dimension, enabling the convolution to process information from all channels simultaneously.  Padding is used to maintain the spatial dimensions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of tensor operations and convolutional neural networks, I suggest reviewing relevant chapters in standard deep learning textbooks.  Specifically, materials focusing on matrix operations, linear algebra, and the mathematical foundations of CNNs will be invaluable.  Furthermore,  the official documentation of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are extremely helpful for practical implementation details.  Finally, research papers on CNN architectures and their applications can provide valuable insights into advanced tensor manipulations used in state-of-the-art models.
