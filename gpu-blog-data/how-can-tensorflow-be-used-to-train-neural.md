The core challenge in applying TensorFlow to learn evolution equations lies in effectively representing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the system as suitable input and output for a neural network.  My experience working on fluid dynamics simulations at a research lab highlighted the crucial role of careful data preprocessing and architecture selection in achieving accurate and stable results.  This response details effective approaches leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities for this specific application.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Training a neural network to learn evolution equations involves casting the problem as a supervised learning task.  The input to the network typically comprises the system's state at a given time point, potentially including spatial derivatives or other relevant features.  The output is the system's state at a subsequent time point, representing the evolution governed by the unknown equation.  The network learns a mapping between these input and output states, effectively approximating the underlying evolution equation.

This differs significantly from simply fitting a function.  The network must capture the *dynamics* – how the system changes over time – rather than merely interpolating or extrapolating static data.  This requires careful consideration of several factors:

* **Data Generation:**  Synthetic data generation is often crucial, as obtaining sufficient real-world data for complex evolution equations can be challenging.  Numerical solvers, such as finite difference or finite element methods, are commonly used to generate training datasets by simulating the system's evolution under known equations.

* **Network Architecture:**  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), are well-suited for handling sequential data like time series.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be incorporated to process spatial information efficiently, especially for systems with spatial complexity.  Hybrid architectures combining CNNs and RNNs offer a powerful approach for many problems.

* **Loss Function:**  The choice of loss function significantly impacts the training process.  Common choices include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for continuous outputs and other metrics tailored to the specific characteristics of the evolution equation and the nature of the error (e.g., L1 loss for robustness to outliers).

* **Regularization:**  Regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, are essential to prevent overfitting and improve the network's generalization ability, especially with limited training data.  Early stopping and dropout are also valuable strategies.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches using TensorFlow/Keras.  These are simplified for clarity but showcase fundamental concepts.  Real-world applications require more sophisticated architecture and hyperparameter tuning.


**Example 1:  Simple LSTM for 1D Diffusion Equation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data for 1D diffusion equation
def generate_data(size, dt, dx):
    x = np.linspace(0, 1, size)
    u = np.sin(np.pi * x)  # Initial condition
    data = [u]
    for _ in range(100): # Time steps
      u_next = u + dt * (u[1:] - 2*u + u[:-1]) / dx**2
      data.append(u_next)
      u = u_next
    return np.array(data)

# Data parameters
size = 64
dt = 0.01
dx = 1.0 / (size - 1)
data = generate_data(size, dt, dx)

# Reshape data for LSTM
X = data[:-1].reshape(-1,1,size)
y = data[1:].reshape(-1,size)

# Build LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, size)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(size)
])

# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)

# Prediction
prediction = model.predict(X[-1].reshape(1,1,size))
print(prediction)
```

This example demonstrates a simple LSTM applied to a 1D diffusion equation. Synthetic data is generated using a finite difference scheme. The LSTM processes the temporal sequence of states. Note the data reshaping to fit the LSTM input requirements.


**Example 2: CNN-LSTM for 2D Reaction-Diffusion System**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (Synthetic data generation for 2D system using suitable method) ...

# Reshape data for CNN-LSTM
X = data[:-1].reshape(-1, height, width, 1) # Assuming 2D data with one channel
y = data[1:].reshape(-1, height, width, 1)

# Build CNN-LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(height, width, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(height * width, activation='linear')
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape((height, width, 1))
])

# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)

# Prediction
# ... (Prediction and visualization) ...
```

This example leverages a CNN to extract spatial features before feeding the data to an LSTM for temporal processing. This architecture is better suited for systems with spatial complexity.


**Example 3: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Define the PDE using TensorFlow operations) ...

# Define the neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='tanh', input_shape=(2,)),  # 2 input dimensions (x,t)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='tanh'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)  # One output dimension (u(x,t))
])

# Define the loss function (combining data loss and PDE loss)
def loss_function(x, t, u):
  with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
    tape.watch([x,t])
    u_pred = model(tf.stack([x,t],axis=-1))
    u_x = tape.gradient(u_pred,x)
    u_t = tape.gradient(u_pred,t)
    #Calculate PDE residual
    pde_residual = ... #calculate PDE residual based on u_x,u_t,x,t
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(u_pred - u)) + tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(pde_residual))

# Training loop using gradient descent ...
# ...
```

This illustrates a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), where the network's parameters are adjusted to minimize both the data loss and the residual of the governing PDE.  This enforces physical consistency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I suggest consulting advanced texts on numerical methods for PDEs, machine learning for scientific computing, and publications focusing on neural network applications in fluid dynamics and similar fields.  Look for works emphasizing the use of recurrent and convolutional architectures for time-dependent problems.  Explore resources on techniques for dealing with high-dimensional data and efficient training strategies.  Publications on physics-informed neural networks would also be highly beneficial.
