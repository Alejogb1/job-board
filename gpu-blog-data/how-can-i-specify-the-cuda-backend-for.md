The interaction between Thrust's `counting_iterator` and CUDA backend selection isn't explicitly controlled via a direct parameter within the `counting_iterator` constructor itself.  My experience developing high-performance computing applications, particularly those leveraging Thrust for parallel algorithms on GPUs, has shown that backend specification is handled implicitly through the execution policy passed to the Thrust algorithm employing the iterator.  This seemingly subtle point frequently leads to confusion, particularly when migrating code or working with legacy Thrust versions like 1.7.

**1.  Explanation:**

Thrust's core strength lies in its ability to abstract away the underlying parallel execution details.  The library intelligently determines the appropriate execution environment based on the provided execution policy.  For CUDA, this typically means leveraging the CUDA runtime.  Therefore, while you cannot directly tell `counting_iterator` to use CUDA, you can implicitly direct Thrust to utilize the CUDA backend by passing a CUDA execution policy to the algorithm employing the iterator.  This is crucial to understanding the behavior;  `counting_iterator` itself is merely an iterator; its behavior within a parallel context is entirely determined by how it’s used within a parallel algorithm.

The absence of a direct backend specification within `counting_iterator` is a design choice.  The iterator's role is to generate a sequence of values; its location (host or device) and the manner in which it generates the sequence are determined by its usage within a Thrust algorithm governed by the specified execution policy.  Attempts to bypass this mechanism—for instance, trying to manually allocate the iterator on the device—would typically lead to inconsistencies and potential errors.

Failure to utilize a CUDA execution policy will result in the algorithm executing on the host CPU, even if the data being processed by the algorithm is located on the GPU.  This obviously negates the performance benefits of using CUDA and Thrust in the first place.  The performance implications can be substantial, often resulting in orders of magnitude slowdown depending on the algorithm and dataset size.  In my experience debugging such issues, this often manifested as unexpectedly long runtimes, only resolved through careful examination of the execution policies used.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Correct CUDA Execution:**

```c++
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/counting_iterator.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>
#include <thrust/execution_policy.h>

struct square {
  __host__ __device__ int operator()(int x) const { return x * x; }
};

int main() {
  const int N = 1024;

  // Use a device vector; this implicitly directs the transform to the GPU
  thrust::device_vector<int> vec(N);

  //Specify CUDA execution policy here.  Crucial for GPU execution
  thrust::transform(thrust::cuda::par, thrust::counting_iterator<int>(0), 
                    thrust::counting_iterator<int>(N), vec.begin(), square());

  return 0;
}
```
*Commentary:* This example correctly leverages the CUDA execution policy (`thrust::cuda::par`). This explicitly instructs Thrust to perform the `transform` operation on the GPU.  The use of `thrust::device_vector` further reinforces this, ensuring that the output is also stored on the GPU.

**Example 2: Incorrect Host Execution:**

```c++
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/counting_iterator.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>

struct square {
  __host__ __device__ int operator()(int x) const { return x * x; }
};

int main() {
  const int N = 1024;
  thrust::host_vector<int> vec(N);  // Host vector
  thrust::transform(thrust::counting_iterator<int>(0), 
                    thrust::counting_iterator<int>(N), vec.begin(), square());
  return 0;
}
```
*Commentary:* This example, lacking a specific execution policy, defaults to host execution.  Despite the `square` functor being capable of GPU execution, the algorithm will run on the CPU because no CUDA execution policy is specified, resulting in significantly slower performance for larger `N`.


**Example 3:  Illustrative use with a custom allocator:**

```c++
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/counting_iterator.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>
#include <thrust/execution_policy.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Custom allocator for demonstration purposes.  Generally avoid unless necessary.
template <typename T>
struct MyCustomAllocator {
    T* allocate(std::size_t n) {
        T* ptr;
        cudaMalloc(&ptr, n * sizeof(T));
        return ptr;
    }
    void deallocate(T* ptr, std::size_t n) {
        cudaFree(ptr);
    }
};

struct square {
  __host__ __device__ int operator()(int x) const { return x * x; }
};


int main() {
    const int N = 1024;
    thrust::device_vector<int, MyCustomAllocator<int>> vec(N); // Custom allocator
    thrust::transform(thrust::cuda::par, thrust::counting_iterator<int>(0),
                      thrust::counting_iterator<int>(N), vec.begin(), square());
    return 0;
}
```
*Commentary:* This example showcases using a custom allocator with `device_vector`, while maintaining CUDA execution via `thrust::cuda::par`.  However,  it’s important to note that using custom allocators directly with Thrust should be avoided unless absolutely necessary for very specialized memory management scenarios. This example is for illustrative purposes only; relying on Thrust's default memory management is generally recommended for simplicity and efficiency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Thrust documentation provides comprehensive details on execution policies and iterator usage.  Familiarizing yourself with the CUDA runtime API is also essential for deep understanding of GPU memory management and execution.  Furthermore,  a thorough understanding of parallel algorithm design principles will aid in efficiently leveraging Thrust's capabilities.  Finally, consult any available advanced CUDA programming textbooks.  These resources offer valuable context for optimizing parallel computations.
