The core challenge in implementing a multivariate normal distribution in PyTorch lies not in the inherent complexity of the distribution itself, but rather in efficiently handling the covariance matrix, particularly its positive definiteness and its impact on computational performance, especially for high-dimensional data.  My experience working on high-dimensional Bayesian inference problems highlighted this repeatedly. Ensuring numerical stability and avoiding unnecessary computations became paramount.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The multivariate normal distribution, denoted as  N(μ, Σ), is characterized by its mean vector μ (a vector of length *d*, where *d* is the dimensionality) and its covariance matrix Σ (a *d x d* symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix).  In PyTorch, we can't directly instantiate a "MultivariateNormal" object with arbitrary matrices.  The covariance matrix must be handled carefully. PyTorch provides several ways to represent the multivariate normal, each with trade-offs regarding efficiency and flexibility.

The primary approaches are:

* **Using the covariance matrix directly:** This is the most straightforward approach but suffers from performance issues and potential numerical instability, especially when the dimensionality is high, due to the need to invert the covariance matrix for probability density calculations.  Furthermore, ensuring the covariance matrix remains positive definite during any updates or transformations is crucial to avoid errors.

* **Using the precision matrix (inverse covariance):**  This approach is computationally more efficient for high-dimensional data, as it avoids the potentially costly matrix inversion needed when working with the covariance matrix.  However, it requires the precision matrix to be provided directly.

* **Using the lower triangular Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix:**  This is generally the preferred method for high-dimensional data. The Cholesky decomposition factorizes the covariance matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) such that Σ = LL<sup>T</sup>.  This method avoids direct matrix inversion, offering computational advantages and ensuring positive definiteness.

The choice among these approaches depends primarily on the specific application and the dimensionality of the data.  For lower dimensions, the direct use of the covariance matrix might be acceptable; however, for higher dimensions, using the Cholesky decomposition is strongly recommended.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using the Covariance Matrix (Lower Dimensions)**

```python
import torch
from torch.distributions import MultivariateNormal

# Mean vector
mu = torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0])

# Covariance matrix (must be positive definite)
sigma = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 1.0]])

# Instantiate the distribution
mvn = MultivariateNormal(loc=mu, covariance_matrix=sigma)

# Sample from the distribution
samples = mvn.sample((100,))

# Compute the log probability density for a given point
x = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.8])
log_prob = mvn.log_prob(x)

print(f"Samples:\n{samples}\nLog Probability at x: {log_prob}")

```

This example demonstrates the simplest approach.  It's suitable for low-dimensional problems where the computational cost of matrix inversion is negligible. Note the explicit requirement for a positive-definite covariance matrix.  For higher dimensions, this approach quickly becomes inefficient and prone to numerical instability.


**Example 2: Using the Cholesky Decomposition (Higher Dimensions)**

```python
import torch
from torch.distributions import MultivariateNormal

# Mean vector (higher dimension)
mu = torch.randn(5)

# Generate a positive definite covariance matrix (using a Cholesky factor)
L = torch.tril(torch.randn(5, 5))
sigma = L @ L.T

# Instantiate the distribution using the Cholesky factor
mvn_chol = MultivariateNormal(loc=mu, scale_tril=L)

# Sample from the distribution
samples = mvn_chol.sample((100,))

# Compute the log probability density for a given point
x = torch.randn(5)
log_prob = mvn_chol.log_prob(x)

print(f"Samples:\n{samples}\nLog Probability at x: {log_prob}")
```

This example showcases the preferred method for higher-dimensional data. The use of `scale_tril` allows for direct specification of the lower triangular Cholesky factor, significantly improving performance and numerical stability.  Generating the covariance matrix from the Cholesky factor guarantees its positive definiteness.


**Example 3:  Precision Matrix (Specific Applications)**

```python
import torch
from torch.distributions import MultivariateNormal

# Precision matrix (must be positive definite)
precision_matrix = torch.tensor([[2.0,-1.0],[-1.0,2.0]])

# Mean vector
mu = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0])

# Instantiate the distribution using the precision matrix
mvn_precision = MultivariateNormal(loc=mu, precision_matrix=precision_matrix)

# Sample and compute log probability (similar to previous examples)
samples = mvn_precision.sample((100,))
x = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.5])
log_prob = mvn_precision.log_prob(x)

print(f"Samples:\n{samples}\nLog Probability at x: {log_prob}")
```

This example demonstrates the use of the precision matrix.  This approach is particularly advantageous when the precision matrix is readily available or when dealing with specific models where the precision matrix has a natural interpretation (e.g., Gaussian graphical models).  However, it requires a pre-computed precision matrix, which is not always directly accessible.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of multivariate normal distributions and their properties, I recommend consulting standard probability and statistics textbooks.  Furthermore, the PyTorch documentation itself provides detailed explanations of the `MultivariateNormal` class and its functionalities.  Exploring linear algebra resources will significantly enhance understanding of matrix operations relevant to this implementation. Finally, reviewing numerical methods literature will shed light on efficient handling of matrix computations and stability concerns.  These combined resources will provide a comprehensive understanding beyond the scope of this concise response.
