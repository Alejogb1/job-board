The discrepancy between results obtained using TensorFlow's Eager execution and those achieved through `Keras.fit` often stems from how these two modes interact with computation graphs and gradient application, particularly within distributed training scenarios or when custom training loops are employed with Eager mode. Specifically, `Keras.fit` leverages a compiled graph under the hood (even with Eager execution enabled globally), which optimizes the computation, potentially leading to different numerical results compared to direct, unoptimized Eager operations.

Let's first consider the underlying mechanisms. In Eager execution, each operation is executed immediately as it is encountered. This is beneficial for debugging and intuitive development, as it mirrors Python's procedural execution. However, for large-scale models and distributed training, the overhead of dispatching and executing operations individually becomes substantial. `Keras.fit`, despite allowing Eager execution within layers, employs TensorFlow's graph compilation at a higher level for performance optimization. This means that even though you might write your model and call functions using Eager mode, the training loop executed by `Keras.fit` transforms the operations into an optimized graph for execution.

Key differences emerge in how gradients are applied. While both modes use automatic differentiation to compute gradients, the application happens differently. In Eager mode, with a custom training loop, you typically define a forward pass, compute a loss, calculate gradients using `tf.GradientTape`, and then apply the gradients with an optimizer. Each of these steps is explicit and is performed within the Python interpreter. `Keras.fit`, on the other hand, performs these steps within a compiled graph. Within the graph, operations can be optimized by TensorFlow, such as kernel fusion or instruction scheduling, which changes the order and execution of operations, while still maintaining mathematical equivalence. These optimizations, though meant to be beneficial, can contribute to minor differences in computed results due to accumulating floating-point errors or variations in reduction operations across different execution contexts. Moreover, data handling and distribution play a role. `Keras.fit` abstracts away the complexities of batching and potentially distributes training, which can influence results due to differing initialization order of variables and data shuffling within each replica.

Another critical aspect involves numerical precision. While the default data type for TensorFlow is generally 32-bit floating-point, certain operations, particularly reductions like sums, can accumulate errors that differ slightly depending on the graph's optimization and execution strategy. In an Eager environment, these sums and reductions are computed iteratively through the Python interpreter, and the order of reduction is deterministic within a Python loop. When the graph is compiled, TensorFlow may change the order in which sums are computed during training, leading to slightly different results. Although often negligible, these variations in numerical representation can propagate through a model and manifest in different performance after training.

Letâ€™s illustrate with a basic example. The following snippet demonstrates Eager training with a custom loop:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Simple model: one dense layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Dummy training data
X = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Eager training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(X)
      loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Eager Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

print(f"Final weights (Eager): {model.weights[0].numpy()}")
print(f"Final bias (Eager): {model.weights[1].numpy()}")

```
In this code block, the training loop is executed step-by-step within the Python interpreter. Gradient computation and application is entirely under user control. The weights and loss are directly observable. Now, contrast this with `Keras.fit`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 2. Same model, loss, and optimizer
model_fit = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))])
optimizer_fit = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn_fit = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Compile and train with fit
model_fit.compile(optimizer=optimizer_fit, loss=loss_fn_fit)
history = model_fit.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

print(f"Final weights (fit): {model_fit.weights[0].numpy()}")
print(f"Final bias (fit): {model_fit.weights[1].numpy()}")
print(f"Final loss (fit): {history.history['loss'][-1]}")
```

In this example, the `Keras.fit` method hides the explicit training loop. While you configure the optimizer and loss, TensorFlow generates an optimized computational graph. Even with eager mode enabled, the `fit` method will use a compiled graph. The weights and the final loss may differ from the Eager training example, even though they are initialized with the same values and run with the same learning rate and training data. These differences are not errors, but rather consequences of the distinct computation and optimization approaches.

For a more complex scenario involving multiple GPUs, the differences can be amplified. The example below illustrates a toy model with a slightly more complex gradient application using a custom loss:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')
    self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=None)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense1(inputs)
    return self.dense2(x)

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true-y_pred))

def custom_training_loop(model, X, y, optimizer, epochs=100, verbose=False):
  for epoch in range(epochs):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            pred = model(X)
            loss = custom_loss(y, pred)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        if verbose and epoch%20 == 0:
          print(f'Custom Loop Loss @ {epoch}: {loss.numpy()}')

# Data generation
X = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Model init and train using custom loop
custom_model = CustomModel()
custom_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
custom_training_loop(custom_model, X, y, custom_optimizer, verbose=True)
print(f"Final weights (Custom Loop): {[x.numpy().mean() for x in custom_model.trainable_variables]}")


# Model init and train using model.fit
fit_model = CustomModel()
fit_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
fit_model.compile(optimizer=fit_optimizer, loss=custom_loss)
fit_model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
print(f"Final weights (Keras Fit): {[x.numpy().mean() for x in fit_model.trainable_variables]}")

```

Here, the custom training loop again handles the gradient computation manually, using the Eager context. The model uses an Adam optimizer and a custom loss function. The `fit` method also uses the custom loss function, but through the compiled computation graph. The resulting model weights again differ slightly between the two methods due to the reasons discussed above.

In summary, while Eager mode provides immediate execution of operations, and `Keras.fit` appears to operate within the Eager context, the latter still utilizes TensorFlow graph compilation for performance. This difference in execution strategy and gradient application leads to variations in numerical results, particularly in floating-point summation orders, distributed training, and when custom training loops are implemented.

For resources, I recommend referring to the official TensorFlow documentation for detailed insights into Eager execution, graph compilation, and distributed strategies. The "Effective TensorFlow" guide provides practical advice on various aspects of training. Further examination of specific TensorFlow source code related to `Keras.fit` reveals the inner workings of the optimization mechanisms.
Understanding the subtleties of these approaches is crucial for reproducible results, particularly in research settings and where minor differences in numerical outcomes significantly alter network behavior.
