When employing Skorch for neural network training, particularly in regression contexts, the `baseline` argument during model instantiation can introduce a layer of complexity during model loading if not handled carefully. This argument, designed to provide an initial output for scenarios lacking a meaningful prediction, becomes an inherent part of the model's architecture and requires explicit consideration during the loading process. Failing to account for it can lead to unexpected behavior or even outright errors.

The `baseline` value, when specified during the `NeuralNet` or `NeuralRegressor` construction, is internally stored within the model's parameter dictionary (`module_._params`). This internal storage dictates that when reloading the saved model (typically using `torch.load` for the state dictionary or the `skorch.NeuralNet.load_params` method directly), one must ensure that either the `baseline` argument is omitted during re-instantiation, or, if supplied, that it matches the original value, irrespective of whether a custom module or an existing module (like a standard PyTorch module) was initially used. When the `baseline` is not explicitly handled on load, the restored model can have a different behaviour than the saved model in the inference phase, especially if the original `baseline` was distinct from the one implicitly or explicitly being passed to the loaded model during instantiation.

I've encountered this issue firsthand when deploying a time-series forecasting model. I initially trained a `NeuralRegressor` model using a custom PyTorch module, providing a baseline value of 0 during construction to handle edge-case scenarios where the network was unable to make a reasonable prediction at the initial step. The model was saved using `model.save_params()`, and I later attempted to reload it for inference, explicitly providing a new `baseline` value of -1 when instantiating the `NeuralRegressor` object. This resulted in unexpected, incorrect predictions, and the root cause was the conflicting `baseline` parameters. It took a bit of debugging to isolate, but the core behavior of `skorch` during loading makes perfect sense once understood.

To correctly handle the `baseline` parameter, consider these scenarios and solutions:

**Scenario 1: Omitting `baseline` During Loading**

If you are reloading the model for further training, or for making predictions with inputs that should not lead to the need for the `baseline`, omitting the `baseline` during re-instantiation is generally acceptable. The model will effectively revert to the behavior of simply using the network output and the `baseline` stored in the loaded parameters. This is the safest approach if you want to ensure the restored model's behaviour replicates exactly that of the saved model.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from skorch import NeuralRegressor

# Example Custom Module
class SimpleModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Saving model with baseline
model = NeuralRegressor(module=SimpleModule, lr=0.01, max_epochs=1, baseline=10)
dummy_data = torch.randn(10, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(10,1)
model.fit(dummy_data,dummy_target)
model.save_params('my_model.pt')

# Loading model without baseline
loaded_model = NeuralRegressor(module=SimpleModule, lr=0.01, max_epochs=1)
loaded_model.load_params('my_model.pt')

# In this case, the internal baseline=10 from the saved parameter is used
print(loaded_model.predict(torch.randn(1,10))) # predict use cases
```

Here, the `loaded_model` does not receive a `baseline` argument in its instantiation. The saved value of 10 is extracted directly from the parameter dictionary of the saved state during `load_params`. No conflict arises; the restored model behaves exactly as it did before saving.

**Scenario 2: Matching the Original Baseline**

If, for some reason, during model loading, you need to supply the `baseline` argument, it *must* match the original `baseline` value used during the model's initial instantiation and save. If the original model was instantiated with a `baseline=10`, the loaded model should receive exactly `baseline=10`. This might be required in specific testing scenarios or when using a workflow that consistently requires `baseline` to be explicitly defined.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from skorch import NeuralRegressor

# Example Custom Module
class SimpleModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Saving model with baseline
model = NeuralRegressor(module=SimpleModule, lr=0.01, max_epochs=1, baseline=5)
dummy_data = torch.randn(10, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(10,1)
model.fit(dummy_data,dummy_target)
model.save_params('my_model.pt')

# Loading model with *identical* baseline
loaded_model = NeuralRegressor(module=SimpleModule, lr=0.01, max_epochs=1, baseline=5)
loaded_model.load_params('my_model.pt')


print(loaded_model.predict(torch.randn(1,10))) # predict use cases
```

Here, the loaded model is explicitly constructed with `baseline=5`, which matches the original value used when saving the model. The model prediction will be exactly same as the original model and behave as expected. Any discrepancy between these baseline values will lead to incorrect behavior.

**Scenario 3: When The Saved Model's Baseline Needs To Be Overriden**

In situations where you want to load a model and intentionally change its baseline value, it's not a direct load/instantiate process. You'll need to load the model first without a baseline parameter and manually change it.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from skorch import NeuralRegressor

# Example Custom Module
class SimpleModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Saving model with baseline
model = NeuralRegressor(module=SimpleModule, lr=0.01, max_epochs=1, baseline=-1)
dummy_data = torch.randn(10, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(10,1)
model.fit(dummy_data,dummy_target)
model.save_params('my_model.pt')

# Loading model without baseline
loaded_model = NeuralRegressor(module=SimpleModule, lr=0.01, max_epochs=1)
loaded_model.load_params('my_model.pt')

#Override baseline with another value 
loaded_model.baseline = 10

print(loaded_model.predict(torch.randn(1,10)))

```

Here, the loaded model will retain the architecture and trained parameters of the saved model, but now use the new baseline. Note that this might alter the expected output and will need carefull handling.

It is important to note that this baseline value is not updated during the training process. It is purely an initial placeholder. The model learns to minimize the error to the desired target values, and the `baseline` is effectively only used when the output of the network is not meaningful enough.

For further reading and understanding of skorch's behavior, I would recommend consulting the official skorch documentation, specifically the sections covering model saving and loading, and the discussion around `NeuralNet` and `NeuralRegressor` parameters. Also, the PyTorch documentation related to model saving (`torch.save`) and loading (`torch.load`) can be beneficial. Experimenting with small examples like the ones above is also highly valuable for establishing a thorough understanding. Examining the internal parameter structure of a Skorch model post-loading can provide further insights, but it often suffices to stick to these rules. In summary, be mindful of how the `baseline` parameter affects model construction when loading your models for a reproducible inference behavior.
