The consistent, unchanging output from a neural network attempting to play Flappy Bird often points to an issue with training dynamics, specifically a lack of diversity in the learning signal, which leads to a model collapsing into a locally optimal, but ultimately ineffective, solution. I've encountered this exact problem multiple times in my own reinforcement learning experiments and observed it across various projects I've consulted on. This isn't a flaw inherent to the neural network architecture itself; rather, it's typically a manifestation of inadequacies in the reward structure, the exploration strategy, or the data normalization processes during training.

A neural network, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning like playing Flappy Bird, functions by iteratively adjusting its internal parameters (weights and biases) in response to a reward signal. This signal is often quite sparse in games like Flappy Bird: it’s positive only when the agent avoids crashing and, potentially, very positive when a pipe is cleared. If the network initially finds a strategy, however basic, that avoids immediate failure—for example, simply falling to the ground without flapping—the reward signal becomes skewed towards reinforcing this default action, preventing further exploration. The network thus stagnates in this narrow behavioral space, becoming trapped by its initial, suboptimal "success."

Furthermore, the backpropagation algorithm, which is the core mechanism for learning in a neural network, relies on gradients derived from these reward signals. If the gradients are consistently similar, the weight updates will also be similar across training steps, perpetuating the already-converged behavior. This manifests as the network providing the same output—a prediction of the same action—regardless of the input, effectively making it act as a simple lookup table with a single, preferred response.

Let's look at a simplified scenario through some code snippets. Consider a simple policy network using a single hidden layer. The network takes the game state as input (e.g., horizontal distance to the next pipe, vertical distance to the top and bottom of the next pipe, and bird’s vertical velocity) and produces a single output indicating the probability of flapping.

**Example 1: Demonstrating a poorly initialized network's propensity to converge on a single, unproductive action.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import random

class SimplePolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(SimplePolicy, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

# Dummy input data mimicking game state features
input_size = 4
hidden_size = 16
policy = SimplePolicy(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Initial states
states = []
for _ in range (100):
  states.append(torch.rand(input_size))

# Training (simplified, no actual game integration)
for epoch in range(10):
    for state in states:
        output = policy(state) # Predict the flap probability
        # Assume if output > 0.5, the bird flaps
        action = 1 if output > 0.5 else 0
        # Here a dummy reward, if action 0, assume -0.1. If action 1, assume 0.0, as it’s a very basic action set.
        reward = -0.1 if action == 0 else 0.0
        loss = -reward * torch.log(output if action ==1 else 1-output)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    # Check the output after each epoch
    print("Epoch: {} Output: {}".format(epoch, output.item()))
```
In this example, the initial weights are randomized. Given the very basic reward system (no reward for flapping, negative reward for not), the network quickly converges to consistently predicting an output near zero, meaning it will never flap and therefore always produce the same output. This happens because initially, random weights cause the network to output small values more often, which translates to not flapping, which produces the negative reward consistently. Without an exploratory mechanism or a more complex reward system this becomes its permanent state.

**Example 2: Addressing the issue with a naive, but slightly improved reward scheme.**
```python
# Modified reward
# Dummy reward, -0.1 if not flapping and 0.01 if flapping.
for epoch in range(10):
    for state in states:
        output = policy(state) # Predict the flap probability
        action = 1 if output > 0.5 else 0
        reward = 0.01 if action == 1 else -0.1
        loss = -reward * torch.log(output if action == 1 else 1-output)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print("Epoch: {} Output: {}".format(epoch, output.item()))
```
This modified scenario improves the reward system, giving the bird a small reward for each flap. It helps slightly and allows for the model to reach the flapping state once the initial tendency to not flap is overcome, but without a proper exploration strategy or a well-defined reward system it will likely collapse again.

**Example 3: Introducing a basic exploration mechanism via Epsilon-Greedy strategy.**

```python
epsilon = 0.1
for epoch in range(10):
    for state in states:
        if random.random() > epsilon: #Exploit the current best policy.
          output = policy(state)
          action = 1 if output > 0.5 else 0
        else: # Explore randomly.
          output = torch.tensor(random.random())
          action = 1 if output > 0.5 else 0 #Random action
        reward = 0.01 if action == 1 else -0.1
        loss = -reward * torch.log(output if action == 1 else 1-output)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print("Epoch: {} Output: {}".format(epoch, output.item()))
```
This code introduces a simple epsilon-greedy strategy. With a 10% probability, the model will take a random action rather than one suggested by the network. This helps the model to break free of local optima. Although these examples are simplified, they highlight crucial aspects of training neural networks for reinforcement learning tasks.

In addition to these aspects, data preprocessing is also critical. Poorly normalized input data can hinder the learning process as well. The input features describing the game state need to be appropriately scaled (e.g., normalizing to a zero mean and unit variance) to allow the gradients to propagate effectively. If the network receives a broad distribution of input values with large differences in magnitude, the updates to different weights will also vary significantly, preventing uniform learning. The network might be more sensitive to one feature than another, leading to unstable gradients.

To address this issue effectively, several strategies are helpful. Firstly, carefully designing a reward function which incentivizes progress is essential. In the case of Flappy Bird, this could include rewards for moving closer to the next pipe, for clearing pipes, or even a small penalty for staying idle for too long. Exploration strategies like epsilon-greedy or more advanced methods like prioritized experience replay can encourage the network to test different actions and escape local minima. Also, input normalization techniques, as mentioned, are vital. Finally, observing the outputs of the network during training and introducing curriculum learning (gradually increasing difficulty) might also be helpful.

For further reading, I suggest delving into resources covering reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically those dealing with deep Q-learning (DQN) or policy gradient methods, as these are frequently used in similar scenarios. Books on neural network architectures and optimization techniques are also highly relevant for understanding the core components of the training process. Papers and articles discussing the nuances of reward design and exploration are also essential. While specific books and papers change frequently, focusing on the core reinforcement learning techniques should be sufficient to understand and overcome this common problem. Understanding these underlying mechanics is critical for developing models which will successfully learn dynamic, non-trivial tasks like Flappy Bird.
