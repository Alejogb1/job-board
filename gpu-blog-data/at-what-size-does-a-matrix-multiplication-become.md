Matrix multiplication performance characteristics pivot significantly based on the computational architecture employed; a critical threshold exists where GPU acceleration surpasses CPU execution speed, dictated by the matrix dimensions and inherent overheads. In my experience working with numerical simulations for fluid dynamics, specifically in solving large linear systems, I've observed that the crossover point isn't a fixed value but rather a range influenced by factors like GPU architecture, CPU specifications, and the chosen libraries.

Fundamentally, GPUs excel at massively parallel computations. A matrix multiplication, often represented as C = A * B, comprises many independent dot product calculations. CPUs, designed for sequential tasks, can use vector instructions (like AVX) to perform several calculations simultaneously, but their parallel capacity is considerably less than that of a GPU. The key difference lies in the architecture: a CPU features relatively few but powerful cores, while a GPU employs a large number of comparatively weaker cores, operating concurrently. Consequently, for small matrices, the time spent moving data to the GPU and initiating parallel computations can outweigh the benefits of parallel processing, rendering CPU computation more efficient. This overhead includes data transfer across the PCI express bus, kernel launch times, and thread synchronization on the GPU. As matrix dimensions increase, the computational workload explodes; the overhead associated with GPU execution becomes less significant relative to the massive speedup obtainable through parallelization.

The crossover size isn't precisely quantifiable without specific hardware information. However, my observations suggest that, generally, matrices starting at around 500x500 or 1000x1000 often exhibit a noticeable performance advantage when computed on a dedicated GPU. For smaller dimensions, the CPU might remain faster because the execution time on it is already brief and the transfer overhead dominates the performance on GPU. A smaller matrix such as 100x100 is often more rapidly processed on CPU because the overhead for transferring data to and from the GPU becomes a bottleneck. Furthermore, performance scales differently depending on the data type; double-precision floating-point operations are typically slower on most consumer-grade GPUs compared to single-precision calculations. Libraries like CUDA or OpenCL optimize these operations; however, the fundamental cost remains. The efficiency gains are not simply an on/off switch but a gradual transition, with CPU performance eventually plateauing due to core limitations. GPU performance, conversely, exhibits near-linear scaling, within the boundaries of its memory and processing capabilities.

Here are examples using Python and the `numpy` library (CPU implementation) alongside `cupy` (GPU accelerated using CUDA), which demonstrates these differences. Assume that `cupy` is installed with an available CUDA enabled GPU.

```python
import numpy as np
import time
import cupy as cp

def cpu_matrix_mult(size):
    A = np.random.rand(size, size)
    B = np.random.rand(size, size)
    start_time = time.time()
    C = np.dot(A, B)
    end_time = time.time()
    return end_time - start_time

def gpu_matrix_mult(size):
    A = cp.random.rand(size, size)
    B = cp.random.rand(size, size)
    start_time = time.time()
    C = cp.dot(A, B)
    end_time = time.time()
    C.get() # Bring result from GPU to CPU
    return end_time - start_time


size_small = 100
time_cpu_small = cpu_matrix_mult(size_small)
time_gpu_small = gpu_matrix_mult(size_small)

print(f"CPU time (size {size_small}): {time_cpu_small:.6f} seconds")
print(f"GPU time (size {size_small}): {time_gpu_small:.6f} seconds")

size_medium = 500
time_cpu_medium = cpu_matrix_mult(size_medium)
time_gpu_medium = gpu_matrix_mult(size_medium)

print(f"CPU time (size {size_medium}): {time_cpu_medium:.6f} seconds")
print(f"GPU time (size {size_medium}): {time_gpu_medium:.6f} seconds")

size_large = 1000
time_cpu_large = cpu_matrix_mult(size_large)
time_gpu_large = gpu_matrix_mult(size_large)

print(f"CPU time (size {size_large}): {time_cpu_large:.6f} seconds")
print(f"GPU time (size {size_large}): {time_gpu_large:.6f} seconds")


```

In this first example, `cpu_matrix_mult` computes matrix multiplication using `numpy`, and `gpu_matrix_mult` uses `cupy` for GPU computation. The timings reveal that for the `size_small = 100` case, CPU usually outperforms GPU. As the matrix size increases ( `size_medium = 500` and `size_large = 1000`), we will notice that GPU performance becomes superior, due to its massive parallelism capabilities. The `C.get()` operation transfers data from the GPU back to the host CPU; while critical for proper evaluation, it contributes to overhead.

The next example will demonstrate this by explicitly tracking data movement for GPU execution.

```python
import numpy as np
import time
import cupy as cp

def gpu_matrix_mult_explicit_transfer(size):
    A_cpu = np.random.rand(size, size)
    B_cpu = np.random.rand(size, size)

    start_time_transfer = time.time()
    A_gpu = cp.asarray(A_cpu)
    B_gpu = cp.asarray(B_cpu)
    end_time_transfer = time.time()

    start_time_computation = time.time()
    C_gpu = cp.dot(A_gpu, B_gpu)
    end_time_computation = time.time()

    start_time_transfer_back = time.time()
    C_cpu = C_gpu.get()
    end_time_transfer_back = time.time()

    return end_time_transfer - start_time_transfer, end_time_computation - start_time_computation, end_time_transfer_back - start_time_transfer_back


size_large_explicit = 1000

transfer_time, computation_time, transfer_back_time = gpu_matrix_mult_explicit_transfer(size_large_explicit)

print(f"Transfer to GPU time (size {size_large_explicit}): {transfer_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"GPU computation time (size {size_large_explicit}): {computation_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Transfer from GPU time (size {size_large_explicit}): {transfer_back_time:.6f} seconds")

```

This modified code shows the explicit transfer of data from CPU to GPU and back via `cp.asarray` and `.get()`. The timings will reveal that the computation portion of the GPU routine dominates the overall processing time for large matrices, while the transfer times remain a smaller fraction. For small matrices, it is likely that the sum of transfer times will dominate.

The final example below explores matrix dimensions that lead to GPU memory issues.

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp
import time

def gpu_matrix_mult_memory(size):
    try:
        A = cp.random.rand(size, size)
        B = cp.random.rand(size, size)
        start_time = time.time()
        C = cp.dot(A, B)
        end_time = time.time()
        C.get()
        return end_time - start_time, False
    except cp.cuda.runtime.CUDARuntimeError as e:
        return None, True

size_memory_issue = 15000 # Attempt to create a large matrix

time_gpu_memory, is_memory_error = gpu_matrix_mult_memory(size_memory_issue)

if is_memory_error:
    print(f"GPU Memory error encountered for size: {size_memory_issue}")
else:
    print(f"GPU time (size {size_memory_issue}): {time_gpu_memory:.6f} seconds")
```
This example demonstrates a critical constraint of GPU computation: memory limitations. With sufficiently large matrices, a `CUDARuntimeError` is raised, highlighting that GPUs have finite memory. The exact size that triggers this error varies on the GPU memory, but as matrix size grows quadratically, the memory limitations will become evident.

When seeking further understanding of these concepts, several resources can be invaluable. Books on High-Performance Computing and Parallel Programming delve into the theoretical underpinnings of GPU acceleration and optimization techniques. Textbooks on Linear Algebra and Numerical Methods provide a strong foundation for the mathematical context surrounding matrix operations. Software documentation of libraries such as `CUDA`, `OpenCL`, and `cupy` are indispensable for practical implementation and optimization. Consulting research papers within computational mathematics and high-performance computing will yield the cutting-edge techniques.  These resources provide more exhaustive detail and specific guidance for various computational needs.
