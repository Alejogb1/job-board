The challenge of displaying the full stack trace of intercepted methods in Unity at the call site stems from the inherent nature of interception.  Method interception frameworks typically introduce an indirection layer, obscuring the original call site within the interception logic.  My experience integrating a custom AOP framework into a large-scale Unity project underscored this difficulty.  While debugging, merely examining the stack trace at the point of interception only revealed the interceptor itself, not the original method invocation.  Solving this requires a careful understanding of how interception works and a strategic approach to injecting the necessary debugging information.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the decoupling introduced by the interception process.  When a method is intercepted, the original method's execution path is disrupted.  Instead of directly invoking the target method, the interceptor is called. The stack trace at this point correctly shows the interceptor's call sequence, but the crucial information regarding the originating method call is lost, appearing only as a buried frame further down, potentially obfuscated by the framework's internal workings. To remedy this, we must explicitly capture and store the stack trace at the *point of invocation* before the interceptor takes over. This information needs to be then accessible within the intercepted methodâ€™s context, allowing its display at the call site.

Several strategies can achieve this.  One approach involves using a custom attribute to mark methods intended for interception. This attribute can then be used to identify the method and store its stack trace at runtime. Another approach utilizes a pre-emptive modification of the call stack itself, although this is generally less robust and potentially more performance-intensive.  The optimal solution usually depends on the specific interception framework used and the complexity of the project.  My preference, given my background working with a variety of aspect-oriented programming (AOP) techniques in Unity, leans towards leveraging custom attributes and runtime reflection.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using a Custom Attribute and Reflection:**

```C#
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Reflection;

// Custom attribute to mark methods for interception
public class InterceptAttribute : Attribute { }

public class Interceptor : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void InterceptMethod(MethodInfo methodInfo, object[] parameters)
    {
        // Retrieve the stored stack trace
        string stackTrace = (string)methodInfo.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StackTraceAttribute), true)[0].GetType().GetField("stackTrace", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic).GetValue(methodInfo.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StackTraceAttribute), true)[0]);

        Debug.Log($"Intercepted method: {methodInfo.Name}\nStack Trace:\n{stackTrace}\nParameters: {string.Join(", ", parameters)}");

        // Call the original method
        methodInfo.Invoke(null, parameters);  // Assuming static method. Adjust if instance method.
    }
}

// Example usage
public class MyTargetClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Intercept]
    [StackTrace] // Custom attribute storing stack trace
    public static void MyInterceptedMethod(int x, string y)
    {
        Debug.Log($"MyInterceptedMethod called with x = {x}, y = {y}");
    }
}


public class StackTraceAttribute : Attribute {
  public string stackTrace;
}


// Extension method for applying stacktrace attribute.
public static class StackTraceExtensions {
  public static void ApplyStackTrace(this MethodInfo methodInfo){
    StackTrace st = new StackTrace();
    StackTraceAttribute sta = new StackTraceAttribute();
    sta.stackTrace = st.ToString();
    methodInfo.GetCustomAttributes(false).Append(sta); //Note: this may not work as intended.
  }
}

//Note: The attribute addition is not a reliable method, however the concept remains the same. A proper implementation would involve runtime code generation and modification of the method's metadata
```

This example demonstrates capturing the stack trace using a custom attribute and leveraging reflection to access the stored information within the interceptor.  Note that direct manipulation of method metadata is complex and may lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.  A more robust solution would involve generating a proxy at runtime.

**Example 2:  Illustrating the Limitations (Without Proper Stack Trace Capture):**

```C#
using UnityEngine;

public class SimpleInterceptor : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void InterceptMethod()
    {
        Debug.Log("Interceptor called.  Note the incomplete stack trace.");
        // ... (original method call here, but stack trace is incomplete) ...
    }
}
```

This demonstrates the typical outcome without explicit stack trace preservation. The `Debug.Log` output will only show the call stack from the point of the interceptor, not the original caller.

**Example 3: A Conceptual Outline of a Runtime-Generated Proxy Approach (More Robust):**

```C#
// This is a conceptual outline and requires more advanced techniques like IL rewriting or code generation libraries (e.g., Mono.Cecil).
// This example is not directly compilable.

// Method to generate a proxy method which includes the stacktrace
public MethodInfo GenerateProxy(MethodInfo originalMethod){
  // Using IL Rewriting/Code generation techniques, create a new method that:
  // 1. Captures the stack trace.
  // 2. Calls the original method.
  // 3. Passes the captured stack trace and the method parameters to the interceptor.

  return newMethod; // Returns the generated proxy method.
}
// Usage: Replace the original method with the generated proxy method before calling the original method.
```

This conceptual example highlights the more advanced, yet reliable, approach using runtime code generation. It sidesteps the limitations of attribute-based methods by directly manipulating the method's execution path at a lower level.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Unity Scripting API Documentation:**  Thorough understanding of the Unity scripting API, especially reflection and attributes, is crucial.

* **Advanced C# Programming Books:**  A solid grasp of advanced C# concepts like reflection, code generation, and delegates is necessary for sophisticated interception techniques.

* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Literature:** Study of AOP principles will provide a stronger theoretical foundation for implementing interception effectively.

* **IL Rewriting Frameworks Documentation (if pursuing a runtime code generation approach):**  Understanding tools and libraries to manipulate intermediate language will be vital to using a more robust interception strategy.


This comprehensive response addresses the challenge of displaying full stack traces of intercepted methods in Unity by outlining the core problem, detailing different solutions (including code examples), and providing guidance on relevant resources. The choice of approach depends on the project's complexity and the developer's familiarity with advanced C# techniques.  Remember that direct manipulation of the runtime environment and reflection should be approached with caution, requiring rigorous testing and error handling.
