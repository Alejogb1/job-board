Eager execution in TensorFlow, while offering immediate feedback and intuitive debugging, presents challenges when attempting to capture intermediate tensor computations outside the context of a defined function.  My experience working on large-scale distributed training pipelines highlighted this limitation.  Directly accessing and capturing EagerTensors outside a `tf.function` decorated function requires leveraging TensorFlow's internal mechanisms and understanding its execution graph construction.  It cannot be achieved through a simple assignment; it necessitates a more nuanced approach.

The fundamental constraint stems from TensorFlow's optimized execution strategy. When eager execution is enabled, operations are evaluated immediately.  This contrasts with graph mode where the computation is defined symbolically before execution.  Without the structured environment of a `tf.function`, TensorFlow lacks the explicit node representation needed for readily capturing intermediate tensors.  Thus, any attempt to capture an EagerTensor outside a function requires simulating some aspects of graph construction.

One viable approach involves utilizing `tf.GradientTape`.  While primarily intended for automatic differentiation, `GradientTape` implicitly constructs a computational graph of the operations performed within its context.  This graph, though ephemeral, allows retrieval of intermediate tensor values.  This method, however, is indirect and imposes overhead, especially for complex computations.  It's best suited for scenarios where gradient calculation is already required.

Another approach leverages `tf.compat.v1.Session`.  This is a legacy approach but remains functional. It allows capturing the tensor's value after explicitly executing a TensorFlow operation within a session. While functional, this method is explicitly not recommended for new projects, being marked as deprecated.  It's crucial to remember that this approach is primarily relevant for compatibility with existing codebases and should be avoided in new developments given the shift towards eager execution.

Finally, and perhaps the most robust and general solution for capturing EagerTensors outside a function, relies on creating a custom context manager. This context manager mimics the functionality of `tf.function`, recording the operations performed within its scope. This approach provides the most granular control and offers better performance compared to the `tf.GradientTape` approach, especially for capturing multiple intermediate tensors.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.GradientTape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True) # Ensure eager execution

x = tf.constant(2.0)
y = tf.constant(3.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    z = x * y
    captured_z = tape.gradient(z, x) # z is implicitly captured for gradient computation

print(f"Captured z (implicitly from gradient calculation): {captured_z}")

# Direct capture of 'z' is not possible here in a reliable manner outside the tape
```

This example demonstrates how `tf.GradientTape` can be leveraged.  The tensor `z` is implicitly captured during the gradient computation. Direct capture of `z` is not possible outside the `GradientTape` context in a reliable manner without introducing the overhead of creating a full tape recording. This approach is efficient only if gradients are needed.


**Example 2: Using `tf.compat.v1.Session` (Deprecated)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior() # Enable v1 behavior

x = tf.compat.v1.constant(2.0)
y = tf.compat.v1.constant(3.0)

z = x * y

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    captured_z = sess.run(z)

print(f"Captured z using tf.compat.v1.Session: {captured_z}")
```

This illustrates the deprecated `tf.compat.v1.Session` approach. This method explicitly executes the computation within the session, allowing capture of the tensor's value.  However, the use of `tf.compat.v1` is strongly discouraged in new projects due to its deprecated status and the performance advantages offered by modern TensorFlow functionalities.


**Example 3: Custom Context Manager**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class EagerTensorCapture:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tensors = {}
        self.count = 0

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def capture(self, tensor, name):
        self.tensors[name] = tensor
        self.count +=1
        return tensor

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        return False # Don't suppress exceptions


tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)

x = tf.constant(2.0)
y = tf.constant(3.0)

with EagerTensorCapture() as capturer:
    z = capturer.capture(x * y, "z")
    w = capturer.capture(tf.math.sin(z), "w")


print(f"Captured tensors: {capturer.tensors}")
print(f"Value of z: {capturer.tensors['z']}")
print(f"Value of w: {capturer.tensors['w']}")

```

This example showcases a custom context manager.  The `capture` method allows explicit recording of tensors, providing named access for retrieval.  This method is more flexible and efficient for capturing multiple intermediate tensors without reliance on gradient calculation or deprecated functionality.  It offers a superior balance of control and efficiency compared to the previous methods.  It necessitates more manual coding, but the advantage in flexibility justifies this approach for projects with complex tensor manipulation outside of functional contexts.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow documentation.  Thorough understanding of TensorFlow's core concepts is essential.
* Books and online courses focusing on advanced TensorFlow topics.  Deep dives into computational graphs and eager execution are crucial.
* Research papers related to automatic differentiation and computational graph optimization.  This will provide valuable background on the underlying mechanics.


By utilizing these approaches, particularly the custom context manager, one can effectively capture EagerTensors outside the confines of a `tf.function`, overcoming the limitations inherent in TensorFlow's eager execution mode.  The choice among these methods depends on the specific application requirements and the extent of integration with gradient computations.  Always favor the most modern and supported TensorFlow features in new development efforts.
