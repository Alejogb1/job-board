The crux of successfully configuring CMake to utilize Clang for CUDA C++17 compilation lies not in a single flag, but in the orchestrated interplay between CMake's find_package mechanism, compiler identification, and the correct specification of CUDA architecture targets.  My experience resolving similar issues in large-scale HPC projects highlights the need for precise control over the compiler invocation.  Simply setting `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` isn't sufficient; the CUDA compiler invocation needs explicit management.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

CMake's ability to handle CUDA projects relies heavily on the `FindCUDA` module. This module, when invoked correctly, locates the CUDA toolkit's installation and exposes variables defining the necessary compiler paths and flags.  However, `FindCUDA` defaults to the NVIDIA nvcc compiler. To leverage Clang, we must override these defaults while simultaneously ensuring the CUDA backend integration remains functional.  This requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Compiler Selection:**  We explicitly set the host compiler (Clang for C++17) and manage the CUDA compilation step independently.  `FindCUDA` will still locate the CUDA toolkit, but we'll directly control the compiler used for the device code.

* **C++ Standard Specification:**  We'll use the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` and `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` variables to enforce C++17 compliance for the host code.

* **CUDA Architecture Specification:** We must specify the target CUDA architectures for code generation via the `CUDA_ARCH` variable.  Failure to do this results in compilation errors, especially when using a non-default compiler like Clang.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic CMakeLists.txt (Minimal CUDA Kernel)**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(ClangCUDAExample)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

add_executable(mykernel mykernel.cu)
target_link_libraries(mykernel ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS "--std=c++17") # important for device code compilation
set(CUDA_ARCH "compute_75;compute_80") # Example architectures; Adjust as needed

#Note: No explicit compiler setting for nvcc is necessary when using nvcc as default with CUDA_ARCH
```

`mykernel.cu`:

```cuda
__global__ void myKernel(int *a, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    a[i] *= 2;
  }
}
```

This example showcases the basic setup.  The crucial line is `set(CUDA_ARCH "compute_75;compute_80")`, specifying the target GPU architectures.  Note that using nvcc as the default is implied.


**Example 2: CMakeLists.txt Using Clang for Host Code and nvcc for Device Code**

This example shows a more controlled approach, where we explicitly invoke the correct compiler for host and device code even though both are using `FindCUDA`. This example better mirrors real-world situations.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(ClangCUDAExample)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

add_executable(mykernel mykernel.cu)
target_compile_options(mykernel PRIVATE -std=c++17) #Force C++17 for Host compilation
target_link_libraries(mykernel ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
set(CUDA_ARCH "compute_75;compute_80")
```

`mykernel.cu`: Remains the same as Example 1.

In this example, the `target_compile_options` line explicitly sets the C++ standard for host compilation using Clang (detected by CMake). NVCC is still handling the device compilation via `FindCUDA`.


**Example 3:  CMakeLists.txt â€“ Advanced Control (Hypothetical External Clang-based CUDA Compiler)**

In a truly advanced scenario, one might want to use a hypothetical external clang-based CUDA compiler. This is extremely unlikely and not generally recommended, but its inclusion shows the flexibility of CMake.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(ClangCUDAExample)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

#Assume a hypothetical clang-based CUDA compiler
set(CLANG_CUDA_COMPILER "/path/to/clang-cuda") #Replace with actual path

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED) # Still required to locate CUDA libraries.

add_executable(mykernel mykernel.cu)
set_target_properties(mykernel PROPERTIES
    CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "75;80"
    COMPILE_FLAGS "-std=c++17" #For host code
)

set(CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS "--std=c++17 -fcuda-is-device")
target_link_libraries(mykernel ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})


```

This example, while hypothetical, illustrates how CMake allows for customization beyond the standard `FindCUDA` interaction. However, using an external compiler requires thorough testing and is less portable than using `nvcc`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **CMake Documentation:**  The official CMake documentation is your primary resource for understanding the intricacies of the build system. Pay close attention to the `FindCUDA` module description and the sections on compiler specification.

* **CUDA Toolkit Documentation:** Understanding the CUDA architecture specifics and compilation options is crucial for optimizing your code. The CUDA toolkit documentation provides a detailed overview of these aspects.

* **C++ Standard Library Reference:**  A comprehensive C++17 standard library reference is essential for ensuring correct usage of the language features.


Successfully configuring CMake for Clang and CUDA C++17 necessitates a clear understanding of how CMake interacts with the CUDA toolkit and how to properly specify compiler flags and CUDA architecture targets. The examples provide a progression of complexity illustrating different approaches to achieving this.  Remember to adjust CUDA architecture values to match your hardware capabilities.  Thorough testing is also vital to ensure proper functionality.
