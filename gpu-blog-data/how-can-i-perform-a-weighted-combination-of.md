The core challenge in performing a weighted combination of two tensors with learnable weights lies in efficiently managing the gradient flow during backpropagation.  Simple element-wise multiplication followed by summation isn't sufficient; the weights themselves must be differentiable parameters within an optimization framework, allowing the model to learn the optimal weighting scheme during training.  My experience working on deep learning models for hyperspectral image analysis frequently required this exact operation for fusing data from different spectral bands, hence the focus on gradient flow efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution necessitates representing the weights as tensors themselves, typically initialized randomly and subsequently updated by an optimizer (like Adam or SGD) based on the loss function.  These weight tensors should have a shape compatible with the element-wise multiplication with the input tensors.  If the input tensors represent multiple feature channels or data points along a given dimension, the weight tensors will need to reflect this dimensionality to allow for channel-wise or instance-wise weighted combinations. The overall process involves three distinct steps:

* **Weight Initialization:**  Creating tensors for the weights, typically using a method suitable for the activation function used later (e.g., Xavier/Glorot initialization for ReLU).  The shape of these weight tensors is crucial and must align with the dimensionality of the input tensors along the dimension requiring weighted averaging.  A scalar weight is insufficient for multi-channel data.

* **Weighted Combination:**  Performing element-wise multiplication between each input tensor and its corresponding weight tensor.  This operation scales each element of the input tensor according to its learned weight.

* **Weighted Summation:**  Summing the weighted tensors. This produces a single tensor representing the weighted combination of the inputs, which can then be fed into subsequent layers or used directly as output.  Depending on the problem, additional activation functions might be necessary after the summation.


It is imperative to understand the broadcasting rules of your chosen deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX etc.).  Incorrect broadcasting can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect gradients.  Careful attention to tensor shapes is critical throughout this process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple scalar weights (for tensors with matching shapes):**

This example assumes the input tensors (`tensor_a` and `tensor_b`) have identical shapes.  A single learnable weight controls the combination.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Input tensors
tensor_a = torch.randn(3, 3)
tensor_b = torch.randn(3, 3)

# Learnable weight
weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1))  # Scalar weight

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam([weight], lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for i in range(1000):
    weighted_sum = weight * tensor_a + (1 - weight) * tensor_b #Note: (1-weight) ensures weights sum to one

    # Loss calculation (replace with your actual loss function)
    loss = torch.mean((weighted_sum - torch.ones_like(weighted_sum))**2) #Example MSE loss

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Learned weight: {weight.item()}")
```

This code demonstrates a basic weighted average. The loss function is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with a task-specific loss. The (1-weight) ensures the weights sum to one, but this is not always necessary.

**Example 2: Channel-wise weights (for tensors with different channel dimensions):**

This example assumes `tensor_a` and `tensor_b` have the same spatial dimensions but different numbers of channels.  A separate weight is learned for each channel.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Input tensors
tensor_a = torch.randn(3, 5, 5) #3 channels
tensor_b = torch.randn(1, 5, 5) #1 channel

# Learnable weights
weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3)) # One weight per channel of tensor a

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam([weight], lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for i in range(1000):
    weighted_a = tensor_a * weight.view(3, 1, 1) # Broadcasting to match tensor_a shape
    weighted_sum = weighted_a + tensor_b # Assumes tensor_b's one channel is appropriately added to each channel of tensor_a

    # Loss calculation (replace with your actual loss function)
    loss = torch.mean((weighted_sum - torch.ones_like(weighted_sum))**2)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Learned weights: {weight}")
```


The `view()` operation reshapes the weight tensor for proper broadcasting.  This ensures each channel of `tensor_a` is scaled individually.

**Example 3: Instance-wise weights (for tensors with different number of instances/samples):**

Here, we consider the case where each instance requires a unique weight. This scenario often appears in time series analysis or with individual data samples.  This will require weights with dimensions corresponding to the batch size.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Input tensors (batch size = 4)
tensor_a = torch.randn(4, 10)
tensor_b = torch.randn(4, 10)

# Learnable weights (one weight per instance)
weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(4))

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam([weight], lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for i in range(1000):
    weighted_a = tensor_a * weight.view(-1, 1) # Broadcasting along the feature dimension
    weighted_sum = weighted_a + tensor_b

    # Loss calculation (replace with your actual loss function)
    loss = torch.mean((weighted_sum - torch.ones_like(weighted_sum))**2)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Learned weights: {weight}")
```

Here, the weight vector directly scales each instance within the batch.  The `view(-1, 1)` function dynamically adapts the weight shape for broadcasting.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and backpropagation, I recommend reviewing relevant chapters in established machine learning textbooks.  Furthermore, the official documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow) will prove invaluable.   Finally, research papers focusing on neural network architectures and optimization techniques frequently utilize learnable weights in various contexts â€“ studying these can offer broader insight.  Understanding linear algebra, particularly matrix multiplication and broadcasting, is also paramount.
