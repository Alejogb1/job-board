GPU memory management within TensorFlow, particularly concerning the release of resources after intensive computations, is a recurring challenge I've encountered frequently while developing and deploying deep learning models. Failing to properly address this can lead to 'out-of-memory' errors and slow down further training. The core issue stems from TensorFlow's resource allocation mechanisms and the need for explicit deallocation when it is no longer required. I've seen this play out time and again in large-scale model training experiments.

The crux of the matter lies in understanding how TensorFlow manages GPU memory. By default, TensorFlow attempts to allocate memory as needed. This typically works well for smaller models, but as models grow in complexity, the allocated GPU memory may not be automatically released when a specific operation completes. The allocated memory then persists even if it's no longer being actively used in the computation graph, creating memory fragmentation over time and the eventual inability to allocate further resources. While TensorFlow does have mechanisms to attempt to release unused memory, these are not always aggressive enough for complex workflows and may not trigger consistently. Simply exiting a Python script or a notebook doesn't always guarantee a complete release of allocated GPU resources; the TensorFlow runtime might hold on to them. Therefore, explicit memory cleaning becomes a crucial part of any robust deep learning pipeline.

One primary strategy involves leveraging TensorFlow’s `tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()`, followed by starting a new session. `reset_default_graph()` clears the existing computation graph within a single session.  However, it’s important to note this does not itself guarantee that GPU memory is deallocated. The allocated memory is tied to the session. Therefore, after resetting the graph, the crucial step is to close the existing session object using its `.close()` method. Once the session is closed, TensorFlow is freed to release any resources associated with that session. After closing, a new session can be created, effectively starting with a clean slate of resources. This is a relatively drastic step since the entire computation graph and associated session are disposed of, but in many cases, this is the most effective method to guarantee a complete memory reset. I've used this extensively when prototyping new model architectures within a single notebook environment where iterative adjustments to the model design can lead to increasing resource usage.

Here's a code snippet illustrating this technique:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example Function for heavy computation
def some_computation(size):
    a = tf.random.normal((size, size))
    b = tf.random.normal((size, size))
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    return c

# Start an initial session and computation
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() # disable eager if not using tf 2.x
session = tf.compat.v1.Session()

tensor_op = some_computation(5000) # large tensor for demonstration
result = session.run(tensor_op)
print("First Computation Done")
# Memory is now occupied

# Closing current session and clearing graph
session.close()
tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()

# Starting a fresh session and performing a new computation
session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
tensor_op = some_computation(100) # small tensor for comparison
result2 = session.run(tensor_op)
print("Second Computation Done")

session.close() # close new session
```

This example demonstrates the process. First, a large tensor operation is performed within an initial session. Next, the session is closed, and the computation graph is reset. Then, a new session is created, and a much smaller tensor operation is computed. After completion, the session is closed again. While this does not guarantee immediate memory release, it signals to the TensorFlow runtime that the resources associated with the closed session are no longer needed, facilitating eventual GPU memory release. Note the initial use of `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` - this is important if not using TensorFlow 2.x since session management is different in eager mode. Without disabling eager execution, sessions are managed implicitly, and the user will not have the control of opening and closing sessions demonstrated.

Another strategy, particularly useful within a more contained computational unit such as a function or a class method, involves explicitly deleting any large tensor variables created during the computation.  In Python, deleting a variable using the `del` keyword can trigger garbage collection for the tensor object which, under normal circumstances, also signals deallocation for any GPU memory tied to that tensor. However, simply deleting the tensor variable within Python might not always be sufficient because the underlying TensorFlow runtime might still maintain a reference to the GPU memory, especially when dealing with multiple operations or with the same tensor being used in further computation. Therefore, deleting the Python variable should be combined with an explicit unreferenced action from TensorFlow's side. The primary way to signal that a tensor is no longer needed within TensorFlow is to avoid referencing it and relying on garbage collection after the variable has been deleted in Python. If one operation is dependent on the result of another operation, ensure you have not kept a reference to that prior result. I often structure data processing in distinct functions to avoid persistent references, facilitating better garbage collection and memory management.

Here’s the corresponding code example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

def computational_unit():
    session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    a = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
    b = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    result = session.run(c)

    del a  # Delete the Python variable 'a'
    del b # Delete the Python variable 'b'
    del c # Delete the Python variable 'c'
    del result # Delete the Python result variable. No more access

    # No more references to large tensor objects.
    session.close()

computational_unit()
print("Computation Unit Completed and deleted references")

session_new = tf.compat.v1.Session()
test_tensor = tf.random.normal((100,100))
result_test = session_new.run(test_tensor)
session_new.close()
print("Second small test done - memory available")
```

This example places tensor operations within a dedicated function, `computational_unit()`. After performing the calculations and using `session.run()`, all references to the generated tensors are explicitly deleted using `del`, and finally, the session is closed. The absence of further references allows Python's garbage collection to free up the associated memory. After that, a new test tensor is created within another session and ran, showing the memory is now available.

Thirdly, for more granular control, particularly during the training phase of a deep learning model, the use of memory-saving techniques is critical. One is to break larger training runs into smaller batch sizes. Smaller batches not only reduce memory consumption but also allow for more frequent garbage collection, which helps release previously used GPU memory. Instead of allocating memory for a huge batch of, say 10,000 samples, a model may be trained on batch sizes of, say 128 samples.  This allows for intermediate variable deallocation on each iteration, rather than after a huge batch. Another technique involves using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` method, which acts similarly to `tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()` by clearing the current Keras session (and thus, the underlying TensorFlow graph) in a Keras-centric environment. I’ve often employed a combination of these techniques when working with memory constrained hardware setups.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

# Simulate dataset
dataset_size = 1000
batch_size = 128

def train_model(dataset, batch_size):
    session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 10))
    y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 1))

    # Simple model (single dense layer for illustration)
    W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((10,1)), name='weight')
    b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((1,)), name='bias')
    y_pred = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y-y_pred))
    optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01)
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)


    session.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    for i in range(0, dataset_size, batch_size):
      batch_x = dataset[i:i+batch_size]
      batch_y = np.random.rand(len(batch_x), 1) # Simulate random labels.
      _, loss_val = session.run([train_op, loss], feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y})

      print(f"Loss at batch {i}: {loss_val}")

    session.close()
    tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph() # reset graph after training
    return

# Create dataset and run the training
dataset = np.random.rand(dataset_size,10)
train_model(dataset, batch_size)
print("Model training finished - memory released via session management")


session_test = tf.compat.v1.Session()
tensor_test = tf.random.normal((100,100))
result_test = session_test.run(tensor_test)
session_test.close()
print("New Session created - showing memory available")
```

This final code demonstrates the use of smaller batch sizes, and the associated memory released by doing so, and also closes the session at the end of each training run. The dataset is broken into batches before training, and the graph is reset, before the final memory check by creating a new session and tensor operation.

To effectively manage GPU memory within TensorFlow, one should become adept with explicit session management, object deletion techniques, and batch size control. Furthermore, resources such as TensorFlow’s documentation on resource management, guides on optimizing training loops, and community forums on memory management, can be highly beneficial for further knowledge. These approaches, implemented in a controlled and deliberate way, have helped me navigate complex computational pipelines and prevent memory-related errors when developing large deep learning models. The key is to always be aware of the TensorFlow session object and how it ties into resource management on a GPU.
