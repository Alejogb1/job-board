PyTorch data loaders, fundamentally designed for efficient batching and shuffling of datasets during training, inherently support multiple iterations. The misunderstanding often arises from an assumption that once a DataLoader is exhausted (i.e., it has yielded all batches once), it becomes unusable, whereas, in practice, the iterator returned by the DataLoader can be reinitialized to provide another epoch of data. I've routinely used this in my development of deep learning models, particularly when evaluating performance across several epochs or performing iterative training algorithms where datasets need to be repeatedly accessed.

The core mechanism enabling multiple iterations stems from the iterable nature of the `DataLoader` object. When we iterate over a `DataLoader` using a `for` loop, we're not directly accessing the DataLoader itself, but rather an iterator object that the DataLoader generates. After one full pass through the dataset – where all batches have been yielded – this particular iterator is exhausted. However, we can readily obtain a new iterator, and thereby iterate over the data again, simply by re-entering the `for` loop or by explicitly creating a new iterator via the Python `iter()` function on the DataLoader.

The `DataLoader`'s behaviour is tightly coupled with the underlying dataset and the `shuffle` parameter. If `shuffle` is set to `True`, each new iterator generated will produce a new ordering of the dataset's elements before creating the batches. This provides an invaluable randomness for stochastic gradient descent algorithms, preventing the model from memorizing a particular ordering and thus improving generalization. If `shuffle` is `False`, the order of samples within the dataset will remain constant across multiple iterations, which can be useful for specific controlled experiments or debugging phases.

Beyond basic looping, one can also employ `itertools.cycle()` for infinite looping, which might be relevant in reinforcement learning setups or when generating data on the fly, though that scenario is a slightly different case from multi-epoch training using predefined dataset. The DataLoader also allows for flexible batching strategy with `batch_size` parameter. Data can be prepared with other techniques to use with the data loader. For example data augmentation can be done on the dataset level using the `transforms` argument in `torchvision.datasets`, or inside `__getitem__` of custom `Dataset`.

Here are three code examples demonstrating how the `DataLoader` facilitates multiple iterations along with commentary:

**Example 1: Basic Iteration across Two Epochs**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

# Custom Dataset
class DummyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100):
        self.data = torch.randn(size, 10)
        self.labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (size,))

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx], self.labels[idx]

# Setup
dataset = DummyDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

# Iterate over the dataset twice
for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}")
    for batch_idx, (batch_data, batch_labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
        print(f"  Batch: {batch_idx+1}, data shape: {batch_data.shape}, labels shape: {batch_labels.shape}")
```
*Commentary:* In this example, a basic dummy dataset is created along with corresponding labels. The `DataLoader` is configured to return batches of size 10, and shuffle data in each iteration. The dataset is iterated twice using a `for` loop that controls the number of epochs. Each time the inner loop is entered, the data loader internally creates a new iterator. The output demonstrates a new shuffled ordering of data in every epoch. The shape of each batch confirms batching is taking place as expected.

**Example 2: Manual Iterator Creation and Exhaustion**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import time

# Custom Dataset
class SlowDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=10):
        self.data = torch.arange(size).reshape(size,1)
        time.sleep(0.1) # adding slow-down to better show iteration
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Setup
dataset = SlowDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False)

# Manual iterator and exhaustion
data_iterator = iter(dataloader)
print("First iteration")
for _ in range(len(dataset)):
    print(next(data_iterator))
try:
    next(data_iterator) #exhausting data_iterator
except StopIteration:
    print("First iterator exhausted")

data_iterator = iter(dataloader)
print("Second iteration")
for _ in range(len(dataset)):
    print(next(data_iterator))
```

*Commentary:* Here, a basic dataset is created with a small batch size of 1 to easily trace the values of each item being fetched. Also, the dataset has `time.sleep` included in the constructor to further highlight the iterator process during running. A data iterator is explicitly created using `iter(dataloader)`. After iterating over the length of the dataset, we expect to see a `StopIteration` exception. We then create a new iterator and iterate through the same dataset. The output clearly demonstrates the exhaustion of one iterator and the subsequent creation of a new one to enable access to the same underlying dataset content.

**Example 3: Unshuffled Iterations for a Controlled Experiment**
```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

# Custom Dataset
class ControlledDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=5):
        self.data = torch.arange(size).reshape(size, 1)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Setup
dataset = ControlledDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False)

# Unshuffled Iterations
for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}")
    for batch_idx, batch_data in enumerate(dataloader):
        print(f"  Batch: {batch_idx+1}, data: {batch_data}")
```

*Commentary:* In this example, we configure the dataloader with `shuffle=False`, resulting in a consistent ordering of elements each time we enter the `for` loop. This is useful in scenarios that require deterministic data access such as testing a specific model performance. Each time we iterate through, the order is identical. The output demonstrates that the batches are retrieved in the same sequence during the second iteration as they were during the first.

For more in-depth understanding and customization options with PyTorch data handling, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections related to `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. Additionally, many online tutorials and books on PyTorch delve into data preprocessing and loading, offering further insights. Specifically the book 'Deep Learning with PyTorch' by Eli Stevens et al is a helpful resource that explains the PyTorch data ecosystem in detail. Exploring community forums can further expose specific solutions to data loading challenges, which can be useful for niche situations encountered during model development.
