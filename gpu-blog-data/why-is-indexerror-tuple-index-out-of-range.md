In my experience debugging machine learning pipelines, `IndexError: tuple index out of range` consistently surfaces when there's a mismatch between the expected structure of data and the actual structure being fed into functions, particularly within the `train_test_split` process. This error often indicates that we're attempting to access an element within a tuple using an index that exceeds the tuple's boundaries.

The `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn is designed to partition data into training and testing sets. It expects input data as either a single array-like structure (e.g., a NumPy array or a pandas DataFrame) representing the features, or two separate array-like structures: one for features (conventionally named 'X') and another for target variables (conventionally named 'y'). The `IndexError` we're discussing arises specifically when the function receives a single tuple where it expects either a single array-like object or two separate ones, and it tries to access the tuple's second element (at index 1) or, less often, the third (index 2), while the tuple might only contain one element. This occurs because internal logic assumes a split tuple structure.

The root cause often lies in how the data is preprocessed or loaded before being passed to `train_test_split`. When data loading or feature engineering inadvertently returns a single tuple containing the entire dataset, instead of the feature and target variable data being separate, the `train_test_split` function misinterprets it. The function’s internal operations treat the entire tuple as the ‘features’ (X) and then attempts to fetch ‘target variables’ (y) at index one, causing the error if there isn't an element there.

I've encountered scenarios where this happens when using custom data loading functions. Let's consider a scenario where, in an attempt to keep data within a singular object, I returned a single tuple.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def load_data():
    # Simulate loading data as a tuple
    features = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 5 features
    targets = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # 100 binary targets
    return (features, targets)

# Incorrect usage leading to the error
all_data = load_data()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(all_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

In this first example, the `load_data` function correctly returns two separate arrays within a tuple. However, the `train_test_split` function receives the entire tuple `all_data` as the input. It is internally programmed to understand that if single tuple is provided it should treat the tuple at index zero as ‘features’, and the next, if exists at index one, as ‘targets’ which it is designed to expect when passed as a single argument. Thus, it attempts to index into the tuple with an index `1`, but because it thinks the input to be only features, that is single parameter, the input tuple only has one element which the `train_test_split` interprets as features only, the second expected tuple element, the targets, does not exist, generating an `IndexError`.

To correct this, we have two primary approaches. Firstly, we can directly unpack the returned tuple of the `load_data` function into separate X and y variables before sending them to `train_test_split`. This ensures that each function receives the expected structure. The second approach is to correct how the data is being returned from the `load_data` function, so we can avoid tuple unpacking.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def load_data():
    # Simulate loading data as a tuple
    features = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 5 features
    targets = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # 100 binary targets
    return features, targets # Returns tuple unpacked for correct use


# Correct usage with manual unpacking
features, targets = load_data()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

```
In the second example, the `load_data` function returns features and targets directly, no longer wrapping them in a tuple, or tuple unpacking is done manually. The output from this function is correctly structured as required by `train_test_split`. The `train_test_split` function now correctly interprets the provided features and targets without producing an `IndexError` due to the change in function output.

Alternatively, we can modify `load_data` to return a dictionary, which also prevents the misinterpretation. This method is preferable in scenarios where we may have more data objects which requires to be included into the dataset loading function, especially where we need to maintain clarity.
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def load_data():
    # Simulate loading data as a tuple
    features = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 5 features
    targets = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # 100 binary targets
    return {'features': features, 'targets': targets}


# Correct usage with dictionary unpacking
data = load_data()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['features'], data['targets'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

In this third example, we have altered the return format of `load_data` function to return a dictionary rather than a tuple. Here the `train_test_split` function receives `data['features']` and `data['targets']`, which resolves the previously encountered `IndexError` because it now operates using the correct structured data, which is no longer a tuple being misread as a single input parameter. This illustrates an effective strategy of using dictionaries to organize data objects.

Debugging such an error requires a systematic approach. First, print statements immediately before the call to `train_test_split` that show the structure (shape and type) of your data. It helps verify that the data structure is what you expect. Second, ensure your data loading or preprocessing functions output the data in the expected format: separate feature and target data, or an array-like structure. Third, if you're using custom data loading, methodically review them to ensure the data structure aligns with function expectations. In cases with multiple preprocessing steps, it is a good practice to debug step by step and ensure there are no unforeseen changes in data type.

The scikit-learn documentation for `train_test_split` is indispensable and contains specific details about data format expectations. Reading detailed examples and studying the source code for a better understanding of its internal logic can also resolve any arising issues. Additionally, resources from online data science communities often have detailed tutorials and troubleshooting examples related to common errors when working with `train_test_split`.
