In my experience, a common point of confusion for PyTorch users arises when applying random affine transformations to a dataset: the underlying dataset appears unchanged despite the transformations being applied. This stems from a misunderstanding of how PyTorch's `torchvision.transforms` library operates and how datasets are typically handled within the framework. Specifically, transformations, particularly those from `torchvision.transforms`, are not applied *in-place* to the original dataset, rather, they're applied *on-the-fly* each time a data sample is accessed.

The primary reason for this behavior is that loading the entire dataset into memory, transforming it, and then keeping multiple versions (original and transformed) would be highly memory-inefficient, especially for large datasets common in deep learning. Instead, transformations within PyTorch are lazily evaluated. When you define a sequence of transformations, using `transforms.Compose` for instance, you are not modifying the data immediately. Instead, you are creating a transformation pipeline. This pipeline is then applied to each data item when that item is requested from the dataset, such as during training or inference. This deferred execution, also known as *lazy evaluation*, enables significant performance benefits by performing transformations only on the necessary subset of data.

Consequently, examining the raw data after a transformation pipeline has been set will not reveal any changes. The original data remains untouched. The transformations only take effect during the data loading process; typically within the `__getitem__` method of a custom PyTorch dataset or the `DataLoader`’s iteration process. The `DataLoader` leverages the provided dataset's `__getitem__` function during batch creation to apply those defined transformations, so that they only take place right before the batch is provided to the network.

Consider this example illustrating the basic principle of lazy evaluation. Let's imagine a dataset consisting of simple numerical values.

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import random

class MyCustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Sample dataset
my_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Define a transformation that multiplies by a random factor
class RandomMultiplier:
    def __call__(self, sample):
        factor = random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)
        return sample * factor


# The transformation
random_transform = RandomMultiplier()


# Initialize the dataset
dataset = MyCustomDataset(my_data)

# Before transformation (raw data)
print("Raw Dataset:", dataset.data) # Prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Get an example with a direct call to __getitem__ (no transform is applied)
print("Dataset[0] before transform:", dataset[0]) # Prints 1

# Example of directly applying the transformation
print("Transform Applied directly:", random_transform(dataset[0])) # Prints a random number between 0.5 and 1.5

# Get an example after the creation of a DataLoader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1)
for batch in dataloader:
    print("Batch during iteration with no transformation:", batch) #Prints tensor([1]), [2], [3], [4], [5]
```

In this first example, I show how the raw dataset remains unchanged, and the transform doesn't act unless called explicitly. Neither the dataset's `__getitem__` method nor the dataloader apply the transform. Let's look at a more practical case where we create a `transforms.Compose` and see how that will work together with the dataset and the dataloader.

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import random

class MyCustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, transform=None):
        self.data = data
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        sample = self.data[idx]
        if self.transform:
            sample = self.transform(sample)
        return sample

# Sample dataset
my_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Define a transformation that multiplies by a random factor
class RandomMultiplier:
    def __call__(self, sample):
        factor = random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)
        return sample * factor


# The transformation
random_transform = transforms.Compose([RandomMultiplier()])

# Initialize the dataset with the transformation applied
dataset = MyCustomDataset(my_data, transform=random_transform)

# Before transformation (raw data)
print("Raw Dataset:", dataset.data) # Prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Get an example directly from the dataset, this time with the transform applied
print("Dataset[0] after transform setup:", dataset[0]) # Prints a random number between 0.5 and 1.5

# Get an example after the creation of a DataLoader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1)
for batch in dataloader:
    print("Batch during iteration with transformation:", batch) # Prints transformed values in batch

```

In this example, by modifying the `__getitem__` to include a conditional transform we start to see the intended behavior, this will be applied during access to the dataset via dataset indexing and the dataloader iteration. The raw data remains unaltered; however, samples are transformed each time they are requested. It's important to note the `transforms.Compose` can hold multiple transform operations in series and each one will get applied to the returned sample in that sequence. Now, let's see how these principles work with real image data.

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from torchvision.datasets import FakeData
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Define transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=15, translate=(0.1, 0.1), scale=(0.9, 1.1), shear=10),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])


# Use FakeData as an example dataset, this returns a tensor
dataset = FakeData(size=10, image_size=(3, 32, 32), num_classes=2, transform=transform)

# Access the first item (notice the transformation)
print("First Dataset element:", dataset[0][0].shape) # Prints torch.Size([3, 32, 32])
print("First Dataset element:", dataset[0][0][0][0][0]) # Prints a number transformed by the RandomAffine and the ToTensor operation

#Iterate over the loader to see the transformation in batches
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2)
for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
    print(f"Batch {i+1} images shape:", images.shape) # Prints torch.Size([2, 3, 32, 32])
    print(f"Batch {i+1} first pixel:", images[0][0][0][0]) # Prints a number transformed by the RandomAffine and the ToTensor operation


# Check that the underlying dataset is unchanged
original_dataset = FakeData(size=10, image_size=(3, 32, 32), num_classes=2)

print("First raw dataset element shape", original_dataset[0][0].shape) # Prints torch.Size([3, 32, 32])
print("First raw dataset element:", original_dataset[0][0][0][0][0]) # Prints a number between 0 and 255


```

In this final example, I demonstrate the use of `torchvision.transforms.RandomAffine` with a `FakeData` dataset. The crucial point here is that each time a sample is accessed through the dataset or the dataloader, the defined affine transformation is newly generated and applied. This demonstrates that it’s not a single transformation that's applied and held, but a transformation method that gets executed lazily and on every data request. Notice, also, how the original dataset hasn't been changed. This is a direct consequence of lazy execution.

To deepen your understanding, I recommend exploring these topics further by referring to the official PyTorch documentation on datasets and data loaders, and specifically the `torchvision.transforms` documentation. Additionally, understanding lazy evaluation principles as they relate to functional programming is useful. Finally, examining examples from well-known PyTorch based open-source projects can further concretize these concepts. This should provide you a foundational understanding to use transforms safely.
