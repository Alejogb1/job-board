The fundamental determinant in CUDA thread block-to-SM mapping is not a deterministic, one-to-one assignment, but rather a dynamic scheduling process influenced by occupancy, resource constraints, and the underlying hardware's runtime conditions.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications, particularly those involving large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, has underscored this variability.  Understanding this non-deterministic aspect is crucial for effectively utilizing the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.

**1.  Clear Explanation of CUDA Thread Block Mapping:**

CUDA threads are organized into blocks, and blocks are scheduled onto Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  The process isn't a simple, static allocation; rather, it involves a sophisticated scheduler within the GPU runtime.  When a kernel launch occurs, the CUDA driver divides the launched thread blocks into groups and assigns them to available SMs.  The number of blocks that can reside on a single SM concurrently is constrained by several factors:

* **Occupancy:**  This represents the ratio of active warps (a group of 32 threads) to the maximum number of warps an SM can support simultaneously.  High occupancy is desirable, as it maximizes the utilization of the SM's resources.  Occupancy is influenced by the size of the thread block, the register usage per thread, and shared memory usage per block.  A larger block size doesn't automatically translate to higher occupancy; exceeding resource limits can lead to lower occupancy.

* **Shared Memory Usage:**  Each SM possesses a limited amount of shared memory. If a thread block demands more shared memory than available on a single SM, fewer blocks can reside concurrently.  Efficient shared memory usage is, therefore, essential for achieving high occupancy and performance.

* **Register Usage:**  Similar to shared memory, the number of registers used per thread directly impacts occupancy.  High register usage limits the number of concurrent threads on an SM.  Careful code design to minimize register usage per thread is crucial.

* **Hardware Context Switching Overhead:**  Switching between different thread blocks incurs overhead. The scheduler attempts to minimize these context switches by strategically assigning blocks to maintain continuous execution as far as possible.

The scheduler's algorithm is not publicly documented in detail; it's a proprietary component of the NVIDIA driver. However, the aforementioned factors significantly influence its decisions. The runtime dynamically adapts to changing conditions, potentially reassigning blocks between SMs during kernel execution to optimize overall performance.  This makes predicting the precise mapping of thread blocks to SMs difficult, even with detailed knowledge of the kernel and hardware.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how different block sizes and memory usage impact occupancy and performance.  These examples are simplified for clarity but reflect core principles observable in my past projects.

**Example 1:  Impact of Block Size:**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel_example1(int *data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        data[i] *= 2;
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... data allocation and initialization ...

    // Try different block sizes
    int blockSize[] = {32, 64, 128, 256, 512};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        kernel_example1<<<(N + blockSize[i] - 1) / blockSize[i], blockSize[i]>>>(data, N);
        // ... performance measurement ...
    }

    // ... data deallocation ...
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the effect of varying the block size.  Experimenting with different `blockSize` values reveals the optimal size for the specific hardware and problem size.  Larger block sizes can lead to higher throughput if occupancy remains high, but excessive block sizes might reduce occupancy due to register or shared memory limitations.

**Example 2: Impact of Shared Memory:**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel_example2(int *data, int N) {
    __shared__ int sharedData[256]; // Vary this size for experimentation

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = data[i];
        // ... processing using sharedData ...
        data[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x];
    }
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases the influence of shared memory. Modifying the size of `sharedData` directly impacts the number of threads that can share memory concurrently within a block.  Increasing shared memory usage can improve performance by reducing global memory access, but it can also decrease occupancy if the shared memory demand exceeds the capacity of an SM.

**Example 3:  Register Usage Optimization:**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel_example3(float *a, float *b, float *c, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        // Optimized for register usage
        float temp = a[i] * b[i];
        c[i] = temp + a[i];
    } else {
        //Avoid unnecessary register usage outside the bounds
        return;
    }
}
```

**Commentary:** This example focuses on minimizing register usage.  Avoiding redundant variables and temporary storage in registers improves occupancy by allowing more threads to reside on a single SM.  Careful consideration of data reuse and computation ordering are crucial for efficient register utilization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and the NVIDIA CUDA Occupancy Calculator for comprehensive information on occupancy calculation and optimization strategies.  Furthermore, studying performance analysis tools like NVIDIA Nsight Compute and Nsight Systems can provide valuable insights into your kernel's execution behavior, including block-to-SM mapping dynamics and resource utilization patterns, helping to fine-tune for optimal performance.  Understanding the limitations and potential bottlenecks of memory access patterns – coalesced vs. non-coalesced – is crucial for performance tuning.  Finally, exploring advanced topics such as warp divergence and its effect on instruction throughput will contribute to advanced optimization.
