The inability of TensorFlow to directly "restore" vocabulary during evaluation stems from a fundamental design principle: the model graph, which includes learned weights and the operational structure, is separate from the preprocessing steps necessary to convert raw text into numerical inputs usable by the model. Vocabulary, in this context, isn’t a trainable parameter residing within the model's graph; rather, it’s a component of the data pipeline crucial for preparing the input data. I encountered this constraint quite acutely during a project involving sentiment analysis, where a mismatch between the training and evaluation vocabularies led to nonsensical results.

The model, at its core, is a network of interconnected operations that receive numerical tensors as inputs and produce numerical tensors as outputs. It doesn't understand words or tokens directly. Instead, it depends on a structured mapping from textual tokens (words, subwords, characters) to numerical indices. This mapping is what we refer to as the vocabulary. During training, this vocabulary is implicitly established by the input data and is either explicitly constructed, such as with a tokenizer, or implicitly determined using mechanisms like text vectorization layers. This is a crucial step, but these mapping mechanisms aren't directly serialized as part of the TensorFlow model graph itself, nor are they typically stored inside checkpoint files, which predominantly save trained parameters.

The process of preparing text for a model involves several steps: tokenization (splitting text into individual units), potentially lowercasing, removing punctuation, and mapping these tokens to integer IDs based on the vocabulary. This vocabulary might be derived from an initial corpus, learned through a pretraining process, or built dynamically during training from the seen input data. The model, once trained, has adapted to a specific set of these integer indices and associated input embeddings. Trying to simply “restore” a vocabulary without re-establishing the full processing pipeline would introduce a misalignment: the model might be expecting integer ID 5 to correspond to the word “cat”, but a new, “restored” vocabulary might have ID 5 linked to an entirely different token or even not present in the new dataset.

The evaluation process, therefore, cannot merely load a trained graph and then expect an "automatically synchronized" vocabulary. Instead, it requires that the same preprocessing steps, using the exact same vocabulary mappings, are applied to the new evaluation data as were applied to the training data. If the evaluation input data is preprocessed using a different vocabulary, the resulting numerical indices fed into the model during evaluation won't have the corresponding meanings that the model's weights were trained for, leading to incorrect predictions.

Consider the following code examples to understand these concepts more concretely.

**Code Example 1: Illustrating Incorrect Vocabulary Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import TextVectorization

# 1. Simulate vocabulary from a training dataset
training_data = ["the cat sat on the mat", "a dog barked loudly"]
vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode='int')
vectorizer.adapt(training_data)
vocabulary = vectorizer.get_vocabulary()

# 2. Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(vocabulary), output_dim=8),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Convert training data to input tensors
train_inputs = vectorizer(training_data)
train_labels = tf.constant([0, 1], dtype=tf.float32) # Example labels
model.fit(train_inputs, train_labels, epochs=1)


# 3. Prepare evaluation data with the *same* vectorizer

eval_data = ["the dog jumped high"]
eval_inputs = vectorizer(eval_data)
print("Evaluation output:", model.predict(eval_inputs))


# 4. Attempt to use a *different* vectorizer on *same* data
another_vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode='int')
another_vectorizer.adapt(eval_data)
eval_inputs_incorrect = another_vectorizer(eval_data)
print("Incorrect eval output:", model.predict(eval_inputs_incorrect))
```

In this example, I demonstrate the correct way to use the same `TextVectorization` layer during training and evaluation, along with the wrong method of using a new layer, which could potentially generate a mismatched vocabulary. The first evaluation produces reasonable output, whereas the second evaluation that uses a differently trained tokenizer fails and gives a potentially nonsensical output, illustrating the problem directly. The model expects indices based on the vocabulary built from the training dataset; using another vocabulary mapping fails.

**Code Example 2: Saving and Loading a Model and Vocabulary**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import TextVectorization
import pickle

# 1. Create and Adapt the vectorizer as before

training_data = ["the cat sat on the mat", "a dog barked loudly"]
vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode='int')
vectorizer.adapt(training_data)
vocabulary = vectorizer.get_vocabulary()

# 2. Define and train the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(vocabulary), output_dim=8),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
train_inputs = vectorizer(training_data)
train_labels = tf.constant([0, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
model.fit(train_inputs, train_labels, epochs=1)

# 3. Save the model and vectorizer *separately*
model.save("my_model")

with open("vectorizer.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(vectorizer, f)

# 4. Load the model and vectorizer
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_model")
with open("vectorizer.pkl", "rb") as f:
    loaded_vectorizer = pickle.load(f)

# 5. Prepare evaluation data with the *loaded* vectorizer
eval_data = ["the dog jumped high"]
eval_inputs = loaded_vectorizer(eval_data)
print("Loaded model eval:", loaded_model.predict(eval_inputs))

```

This example showcases the crucial process of saving and loading both the trained model and the fitted vectorizer. Notice the separation of saving the model weights and the preprocessor. The use of `pickle` (or other serialization methods) is necessary to preserve the vectorizer since it is not stored as part of the model graph. During evaluation, the loaded vectorizer correctly transforms the new data into a format the loaded model can process effectively.

**Code Example 3: Using a Custom Preprocessing Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import StringLookup
import numpy as np

# 1. Define the vocabulary manually
vocabulary = ['the', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'mat', 'a', 'dog', 'barked', 'loudly', '[UNK]']
index_to_token = dict(enumerate(vocabulary))
token_to_index = {token: index for index, token in index_to_token.items()}

# 2. Custom preprocessing function
def preprocess(text):
    tokens = text.lower().split()
    indices = [token_to_index.get(token, token_to_index['[UNK]']) for token in tokens]
    return np.array(indices, dtype=np.int32)

# 3. Model setup and training
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(vocabulary), output_dim=8),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

training_data = ["the cat sat on the mat", "a dog barked loudly"]
train_inputs = [preprocess(text) for text in training_data]
train_inputs_padded = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(train_inputs, padding="post")
train_labels = tf.constant([0, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
model.fit(train_inputs_padded, train_labels, epochs=1)


# 4. Evaluation using the *same* preprocessing function
eval_data = ["the dog jumped high"]
eval_inputs = [preprocess(text) for text in eval_data]
eval_inputs_padded = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(eval_inputs, padding="post", maxlen=train_inputs_padded.shape[1])
print("Custom prep. evaluation:", model.predict(eval_inputs_padded))
```

This final example employs a custom preprocessing function, explicitly managing the vocabulary mappings. This mirrors a situation where external tokenizers might be used or where more specialized preprocessing is required. The crucial part here is that the `preprocess` function (which encapsulates the vocabulary knowledge) must remain consistent across both training and evaluation. I used a simple padding here to allow all the sequences to be fed into the Embedding layer which requires inputs of a fixed shape. Note that this method makes it very clear that vocabulary is not something that is in the model weights.

In summary, the inability of TensorFlow to directly "restore" vocabulary during evaluation isn't a limitation but a consequence of how model inputs are structured. The vocabulary, a part of the data preprocessing pipeline, is outside the model’s architecture and is not automatically included during model saving or loading from checkpoint files. Reusing a vocabulary and corresponding preprocessing steps is an essential part of the data pipeline and needs explicit attention when transitioning from training to evaluation.

For more in-depth understanding, resources covering TensorFlow's text processing layers, data pipeline construction using `tf.data.Dataset`, and model serialization techniques provide valuable context. Material specifically on text embedding and vocabulary management often helps. I often consulted these during my projects and found the official TensorFlow documentation to be particularly helpful in this area along with books and courses on advanced deep learning techniques for NLP.
