The challenge with achieving satisfactory training results on FrozenLake-v0 using REINFORCE stems primarily from the inherent instability and high variance associated with Monte Carlo policy gradient methods when applied to sparse reward environments. I've encountered this exact issue repeatedly while working on reinforcement learning projects, and the difficulties are not atypical, especially for beginners.

Fundamentally, REINFORCE updates its policy based on the *entire* episode's trajectory and the cumulative reward obtained. This mechanism, while theoretically sound, presents a practical hurdle in environments like FrozenLake-v0, where the rewards are exceedingly sparse. Only reaching the goal provides a reward of 1, while all other steps receive a reward of 0. This sparsity creates situations where the agent can, for several episodes in a row, never see a positive reward signal. As a result, gradient updates become highly variable; sometimes they're heavily influenced by noise, and at other times, there might be no gradient signal at all if the goal isn’t reached. The network essentially learns nothing for long periods.

The core issue isn’t the REINFORCE algorithm itself. Rather, the problem is the nature of the environment coupled with the way REINFORCE is implemented. The algorithm hinges on the expectation of total reward, which is approximated through Monte Carlo sampling. This process has high variance. When the agent makes an action that is, by chance, good but is statistically infrequent, the one time it succeeds may lead to a change of direction based on that single successful episode rather than a true learned tendency. In a small environment such as FrozenLake-v0, the random nature of exploration might occasionally lead to the goal just by random movement, but the policy gradients based on these rare events often aren’t representative of optimal behaviour across many trials.

Secondly, the discrete action and state space of FrozenLake-v0, while simplifying the simulation, exacerbates this variance problem with policy gradients. The policy is a lookup table or approximation mapping state to probability of actions. The gradients are used to nudge this table toward more successful actions; in our case, movements toward the goal state. However, the one-hot encoding of states and actions results in a large, sparse parameter space for the policy, meaning that any successful episode disproportionately influences the few parameters that led to the observed reward. This can cause instability in training and lead to wildly oscillating behavior.

Let's illustrate this with some code examples.

**Example 1: Basic REINFORCE Implementation (Problematic)**

```python
import gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.distributions import Categorical
import numpy as np

class Policy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(Policy, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(state_size, action_size)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = self.fc(state)
        return Categorical(logits=x)

def reinforce(env, policy, optimizer, gamma=0.99, n_episodes=1000):
    for episode in range(n_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        log_probs = []
        rewards = []
        done = False

        while not done:
            state_tensor = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float)
            action_probs = policy(state_tensor)
            action = action_probs.sample()
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())
            log_probs.append(action_probs.log_prob(action))
            rewards.append(reward)
            state = next_state

        G = []
        R = 0
        for r in reversed(rewards):
            R = r + gamma * R
            G.insert(0, R)
        G = torch.tensor(G)
        G = (G - G.mean()) / (G.std() + 1e-8)  # Normalization of returns for stability

        policy_loss = 0
        for log_prob, r in zip(log_probs, G):
            policy_loss += -log_prob * r

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        policy_loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if (episode+1) % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Episode: {episode+1}, Total Reward: {np.sum(rewards)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
    state_size = env.observation_space.n
    action_size = env.action_space.n

    policy = Policy(state_size, action_size)
    optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    reinforce(env, policy, optimizer)
```

This example provides a basic implementation of REINFORCE. The code defines a simple linear policy network, calculates the returns (G) at the end of the episode, and performs the policy updates. While the reward normalization reduces the variance, it is not sufficient on its own to make this training stable. You will observe that, more often than not, the agent fails to learn optimal behavior with this basic implementation of REINFORCE. The total reward fluctuates quite significantly throughout training, often ending up with performance no better than random chance.

**Example 2: Introducing a Baseline (Improved but not always stable)**

```python
import gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.distributions import Categorical
import numpy as np

class Policy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(Policy, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(state_size, action_size)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = self.fc(state)
        return Categorical(logits=x)

class ValueNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size):
        super(ValueNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(state_size, 1)

    def forward(self, state):
        return self.fc(state)

def reinforce_with_baseline(env, policy, value_network, policy_optimizer, value_optimizer, gamma=0.99, n_episodes=1000):
    for episode in range(n_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        log_probs = []
        rewards = []
        values = []
        done = False

        while not done:
            state_tensor = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float)
            action_probs = policy(state_tensor)
            action = action_probs.sample()
            value = value_network(state_tensor)
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())

            log_probs.append(action_probs.log_prob(action))
            rewards.append(reward)
            values.append(value)
            state = next_state

        G = []
        R = 0
        for r in reversed(rewards):
            R = r + gamma * R
            G.insert(0, R)
        G = torch.tensor(G)
        G = (G - G.mean()) / (G.std() + 1e-8)

        advantages = G - torch.cat(values).squeeze()
        policy_loss = 0
        for log_prob, advantage in zip(log_probs, advantages):
           policy_loss += -log_prob * advantage
        policy_optimizer.zero_grad()
        policy_loss.backward()
        policy_optimizer.step()

        value_loss = (torch.cat(values).squeeze() - G).pow(2).mean()
        value_optimizer.zero_grad()
        value_loss.backward()
        value_optimizer.step()

        if (episode+1) % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Episode: {episode+1}, Total Reward: {np.sum(rewards)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
    state_size = env.observation_space.n
    action_size = env.action_space.n

    policy = Policy(state_size, action_size)
    value_network = ValueNetwork(state_size)
    policy_optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    value_optimizer = optim.Adam(value_network.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    reinforce_with_baseline(env, policy, value_network, policy_optimizer, value_optimizer)
```

This example introduces a value network to estimate the baseline, which helps reduce variance in the policy gradient updates. Instead of using the raw return as a critic, the advantage is used (the difference between the return and baseline), which measures the expected gain of an action compared to the average return. The addition of the baseline generally improves performance. The baseline effectively centers the returns around zero, making it easier for the policy to discern good actions. However, even with a value baseline, instability remains a challenge, especially in early stages of learning. The value network itself can be unstable early on. The learning process can still produce a highly fluctuating reward behavior with long periods of poor or no learning.

**Example 3: Using an Alternative Algorithm (Comparison for Context)**

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import random

def q_learning(env, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.1, n_episodes=10000):
    q_table = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))
    for episode in range(n_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            if random.uniform(0,1) < epsilon:
                action = env.action_space.sample()
            else:
                action = np.argmax(q_table[state,:])
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            q_table[state, action] = q_table[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(q_table[next_state, :]) - q_table[state,action])
            state = next_state
        if (episode+1) % 1000 == 0:
          print(f"Episode: {episode+1}, Total Reward: {np.sum(reward)}")

    return q_table


if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
    q_table = q_learning(env)
    print("Q-table:", q_table)
```

This third example demonstrates the use of Q-learning on FrozenLake. Q-learning, a value-based method, is often much more stable than REINFORCE because it updates its value function in a more immediate manner at each step based on the observed reward and Q-value of the next state. The Q-table effectively maps each state-action pair to an expected value which provides a direct measure of the quality of a specific action in a specific state. The policy can be derived from the Q-table by greedily selecting the action with the highest value for the current state. The stochastic exploration mechanism, epsilon greedy, works to balance exploration and exploitation. Due to these attributes, Q-learning is much more robust when compared to the high variance of REINFORCE in this environment. This serves as a useful comparison, and highlights that the choice of algorithm is important in relation to the environment.

In summary, while REINFORCE is a powerful algorithm, its high variance nature, combined with the sparse reward structure of FrozenLake-v0, makes stable training challenging. The issue is not about a single error in implementation, but rather the inherent properties of the environment and the REINFORCE algorithm working together.

For further exploration of these topics, I would recommend consulting texts that cover policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning, particularly those focusing on variance reduction techniques. Also, literature that details more model-free reinforcement learning algorithms and their application in environments with various reward structures would prove beneficial. Lastly, resources emphasizing the limitations of Monte Carlo-based methods and their alternatives, such as temporal difference learning and actor-critic methods, may offer deeper insight into the issues at play. Specifically, explore works on:

*   Monte Carlo Methods in Reinforcement Learning
*   Policy Gradient Methods in Reinforcement Learning
*   Actor-Critic Methods in Reinforcement Learning.

Understanding the underlying theory and these different algorithms would help greatly in this specific case, as well as in future reinforcement learning projects.
