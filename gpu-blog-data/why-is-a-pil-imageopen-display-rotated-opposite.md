The discrepancy between the perceived orientation of an image loaded via PIL's `Image.open()` and its actual orientation stems from the EXIF metadata embedded within the image file itself.  Specifically, the `Orientation` tag within the EXIF metadata dictates how the image should be displayed to appear correctly, and PIL, by default, does *not* automatically apply this correction. This means that if the `Orientation` tag indicates a rotation, PIL will load the raw image data without rotating it, leading to an apparent mismatch.  Over the years, troubleshooting similar issues in image processing pipelines for high-resolution satellite imagery and medical scans has reinforced this understanding.

My experience has shown that neglecting the EXIF orientation data is a common pitfall, frequently leading to unexpected image rotations, particularly when dealing with images originating from mobile devices or digital cameras.  A robust image processing workflow must explicitly handle this metadata to ensure consistent and correct image display regardless of the source.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The EXIF standard defines eight possible orientation values, each specifying a different rotation and/or mirroring transformation.  When an image is captured, the camera's sensor might be oriented differently from the intended viewing orientation. The `Orientation` tag records this difference.  PIL's `Image.open()` loads the raw pixel data without interpreting this orientation information.  Therefore, if the EXIF data indicates a rotation (e.g., 90 degrees clockwise), the image will appear rotated relative to its expected orientation.  To correct this, one must explicitly extract the orientation tag from the EXIF metadata and apply the appropriate transformation using PIL's image manipulation functions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic EXIF Extraction and Rotation:**

```python
from PIL import Image, ExifTags

def correct_orientation(image_path):
    try:
        img = Image.open(image_path)
        exif = img._getexif()

        if exif is not None:
            orientation = exif.get(0x0112) # Orientation tag

            if orientation == 3: # 180 degrees rotation
                img = img.rotate(180, expand=True)
            elif orientation == 6: # 90 degrees counter-clockwise rotation
                img = img.rotate(270, expand=True)
            elif orientation == 8: # 90 degrees clockwise rotation
                img = img.rotate(90, expand=True)

        return img

    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error opening image: {e}")
        return None

# Usage
corrected_image = correct_orientation("image.jpg")
if corrected_image:
    corrected_image.show()
    # corrected_image.save("corrected_image.jpg") # Uncomment to save
```

This example demonstrates a basic approach. It checks for the presence of EXIF data and applies rotations based on common orientations.  The `expand=True` argument ensures that the rotated image has sufficient space to accommodate the rotation without cropping.  Error handling is included to gracefully manage file opening failures.  Note this is a simplified version; a production-ready function should handle all eight orientation values.

**Example 2:  Using Pillow-Exif:**

```python
from PIL import Image
from pillow_heif import register_heif_opener
register_heif_opener()
from PIL.ExifTags import TAGS, GPSTAGS

def get_exif(image):
    image.verify()
    return image._getexif()

def get_geotagging(exif):
    if not exif:
        raise ValueError("No EXIF metadata found")
    geotagging = {}
    for (idx, tag) in TAGS.items():
        if tag == 'GPSInfo':
            if idx not in exif:
                raise ValueError("No EXIF geotagging found")
            for (key, val) in GPSTAGS.items():
                if key in exif[idx]:
                    geotagging[val] = exif[idx][key]
    return geotagging


def correct_orientation_enhanced(image_path):
    try:
        img = Image.open(image_path)
        exif = get_exif(img)
        if exif:
            orientation = exif.get(0x0112)
            if orientation:
                if orientation in [3, 6, 8]:
                    img = img.rotate( (orientation - 1) * 90, expand=True)

        return img

    except (IOError, ValueError) as e:
        print(f"Error processing image: {e}")
        return None

# Usage:
corrected_image = correct_orientation_enhanced("image.jpg")
if corrected_image:
    corrected_image.show()
```

This example leverages `pillow_heif` (for HEIF support) and expands on the EXIF extraction to provide a more complete and robust solution, checking for the presence of EXIF data and handling potential errors during extraction.  This demonstrates a more advanced technique compared to the basic approach.

**Example 3:  Handling all Eight Orientations:**

```python
from PIL import Image, ExifTags

def correct_orientation_comprehensive(image_path):
    try:
        img = Image.open(image_path)
        exif = img._getexif()

        if exif:
            orientation = exif.get(0x0112)

            if orientation:
                if orientation == 2: # Mirror horizontally
                    img = img.transpose(Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT)
                elif orientation == 3: # Rotate 180 degrees
                    img = img.rotate(180, expand=True)
                elif orientation == 4: # Mirror vertically
                    img = img.transpose(Image.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM)
                elif orientation == 5: # Mirror horizontally and rotate 90 degrees clockwise
                    img = img.transpose(Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT).rotate(90, expand=True)
                elif orientation == 6: # Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise
                    img = img.rotate(270, expand=True)
                elif orientation == 7: # Mirror horizontally and rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise
                    img = img.transpose(Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT).rotate(270, expand=True)
                elif orientation == 8: # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
                    img = img.rotate(90, expand=True)

        return img

    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error opening image: {e}")
        return None

# Usage:
corrected_image = correct_orientation_comprehensive("image.jpg")
if corrected_image:
    corrected_image.show()

```

This improved example explicitly handles all eight orientation values defined in the EXIF standard, providing the most complete solution.  It leverages PIL's `transpose()` method for mirroring operations, improving efficiency and clarity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PIL documentation; a comprehensive textbook on image processing; a specialized publication on digital image metadata and EXIF standards.  Exploring these resources will provide a deeper understanding of image manipulation techniques and EXIF metadata handling.  Further, studying the source code of established image processing libraries can provide valuable insights into robust error handling and efficient implementation strategies.
