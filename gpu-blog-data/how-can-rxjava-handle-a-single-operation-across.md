The core challenge in orchestrating a single operation across multiple threads, each contingent on independent conditions, lies in the efficient management of asynchronous execution and the synchronization required for final aggregation.  My experience with high-throughput data processing pipelines taught me the value of RxJava's reactive approach in addressing this precisely.  Instead of relying on explicit thread management and synchronization primitives, RxJava offers elegant solutions through operators that handle asynchronous operations and backpressure effectively.

Specifically, the `Observable.zip` operator, coupled with appropriate `Observable` sources representing each thread's asynchronous task, provides a robust mechanism.  Each `Observable` source emits a value only when its associated condition is met. `Observable.zip` then waits for all sources to emit before combining their results and emitting a final value. This ensures that the single operation doesn't proceed until all contributing threads have completed their respective tasks.  However, naively using `zip` without careful consideration of backpressure and error handling can lead to performance bottlenecks or unpredictable behavior.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution hinges on constructing an `Observable` for each threadâ€™s asynchronous operation.  Each of these Observables represents the completion of a specific task, contingent on its individual condition.  These conditions could range from network requests to database queries or complex computations.  Crucially, the `Observable` will only emit a value when the condition is successfully met.  This is achieved by employing operators such as `flatMap`, `map`, or `fromCallable` depending on the nature of the asynchronous operation.  Once these Observables are defined,  `Observable.zip` is used to combine their emissions.  `zip` waits for all Observables in the provided list to emit a single value, then emits a single combined result. This synchronized execution ensures that the single operation, represented by the function applied within `zip`, operates on results only after all conditions across all threads are fulfilled. Error handling must be integrated using operators like `onErrorResumeNext` or `retryWhen` to ensure robustness.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Condition Check across Three Threads**

```java
Observable<Boolean> thread1Condition = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
    // Simulate a long-running operation with a condition check
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some work
    return checkCondition1(); // Returns true if condition is met, false otherwise
});

Observable<Boolean> thread2Condition = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1500); // Simulate some work
    return checkCondition2();
});

Observable<Boolean> thread3Condition = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate some work
    return checkCondition3();
});

Observable.zip(thread1Condition, thread2Condition, thread3Condition, (c1, c2, c3) -> {
    if (c1 && c2 && c3) {
        return performSingleOperation(); // Perform the single operation if all conditions are true
    } else {
        return "Conditions not met";
    }
}).subscribe(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));

// Helper functions (replace with actual condition checks)
boolean checkCondition1() { return true; }
boolean checkCondition2() { return true; }
boolean checkCondition3() { return true; }

//The operation to be performed once all conditions are met
String performSingleOperation(){ return "Operation completed successfully"; }
```

This example demonstrates a basic scenario. Three threads check independent conditions. `Observable.zip` combines their boolean results.  The final lambda function within `zip` executes the single operation only if all conditions evaluate to `true`. Error handling is omitted for brevity but should be included in a production environment.


**Example 2: Handling Errors with `onErrorResumeNext`**

```java
Observable<Integer> thread1Result = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
    // Simulate network request
    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        throw new Exception("Network Error");
    }
    return performNetworkOperation1();
}).onErrorResumeNext(throwable -> Observable.just(-1)); // Return -1 on error


Observable<Integer> thread2Result = Observable.fromCallable(() -> performDatabaseOperation2());

Observable<Integer> thread3Result = Observable.fromCallable(() -> performComputation3());


Observable.zip(thread1Result, thread2Result, thread3Result, (r1, r2, r3) -> r1 + r2 + r3)
        .subscribe(sum -> System.out.println("Sum: " + sum),
                error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage()));


// Placeholder functions
int performNetworkOperation1() { return 10; }
int performDatabaseOperation2() { return 20; }
int performComputation3() { return 30; }

```
This example incorporates error handling using `onErrorResumeNext`. If any of the Observables throw an exception, `onErrorResumeNext` substitutes a default value (-1 in this case), preventing the `zip` operator from failing prematurely.


**Example 3:  Using `flatMap` for Asynchronous Operations:**

```java
Observable<String> thread1Result = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
    return performAsynchronousOperation("Thread 1");
}).flatMap(result -> Observable.just(result));


Observable<String> thread2Result = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
    return performAsynchronousOperation("Thread 2");
}).flatMap(result -> Observable.just(result));


Observable.zip(thread1Result, thread2Result, (r1, r2) -> r1 + " and " + r2)
    .subscribe(result -> System.out.println("Combined Result: " + result));

String performAsynchronousOperation(String threadName) throws InterruptedException {
    Thread.sleep(1000); //Simulate asynchronous operation
    return "Operation completed by " + threadName;
}
```

Here, `flatMap` is used to handle asynchronous operations that return Observables themselves. This scenario is common when dealing with asynchronous network calls or database queries that already return observable objects.  The `flatMap` operator flattens the nested observables produced by `performAsynchronousOperation` to ensure the correct flow within the `zip` operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Reactive Programming with RxJava:** A comprehensive guide covering RxJava's core concepts, operators, and best practices.  Focus on the chapters detailing asynchronous operations and error handling.
* **Effective Java (Joshua Bloch):** Relevant sections on concurrency and exception handling provide valuable context for designing robust and efficient reactive applications.
* **Java Concurrency in Practice (Brian Goetz et al.):**  While not directly focused on RxJava, this book's in-depth discussion of concurrency principles enhances your understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  This helps in selecting the most appropriate RxJava operators for specific scenarios.


These examples and resources should provide a solid foundation for managing a single operation across multiple threads with RxJava, where each thread awaits independent conditions before proceeding. Remember that careful consideration of error handling and backpressure is crucial for building robust and scalable applications.  My experience has shown that well-designed RxJava pipelines dramatically simplify the complexities of multi-threaded programming compared to traditional approaches using explicit locks and wait/notify mechanisms.
