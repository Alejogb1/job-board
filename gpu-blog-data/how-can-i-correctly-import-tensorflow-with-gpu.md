TensorFlow's GPU support hinges on the availability and proper configuration of the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library, a fact I've learned from countless debugging sessions over the years.  Ignoring this fundamental dependency, even with a seemingly correct import statement, will invariably result in CPU-only execution, negating the performance benefits of a dedicated GPU.  Therefore, verifying this prerequisite is the first critical step before addressing import issues.


**1.  Verifying CUDA and cuDNN Installation:**

Before attempting any TensorFlow import, I rigorously check for the presence and compatibility of the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library.  This involves several steps:

* **CUDA Toolkit:**  Confirm the installation of a CUDA toolkit version compatible with your TensorFlow version.  This information is readily available in the TensorFlow documentation for your specific release.  The version mismatch is a prolific source of errors.  A simple check on the command line (`nvcc --version`) will reveal the installed CUDA version.  I often maintain separate environments (using tools like `conda` or `virtualenv`) for different CUDA/TensorFlow versions to avoid conflicts.

* **cuDNN Library:**  cuDNN, the CUDA Deep Neural Network library, provides optimized routines for deep learning operations.  It must be installed and configured correctly.  Again, compatibility with the CUDA toolkit and TensorFlow is crucial.  The cuDNN installation usually requires placing its libraries in a specific directory, which is detailed in the NVIDIA documentation.  Failure to do so leads to TensorFlow being unable to find these optimized kernels.

* **Driver Compatibility:**  Ensure your NVIDIA GPU driver is up-to-date and compatible with both the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN.  Outdated drivers frequently cause cryptic errors or outright failures during TensorFlow initialization.  Checking for updates on the NVIDIA website is a crucial part of my pre-import routine.


**2. TensorFlow Import and GPU Detection:**

With the CUDA and cuDNN prerequisites satisfied, importing TensorFlow with GPU support involves a simple import statement, but carefully checking for successful GPU detection is essential:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This code snippet utilizes the `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` function to enumerate the available GPUs.  If the output is zero, it indicates TensorFlow isn't detecting any GPUs, despite your best efforts. This commonly results from issues in the CUDA/cuDNN setup or path configurations, even if the libraries are technically installed.  The absence of an error message can be particularly misleading.


**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating different aspects of TensorFlow GPU usage, showcasing various approaches to handling GPU configuration and potential error scenarios:

**Example 1: Basic GPU Usage:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Define a simple tensor operation
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
z = x + y

# Execute the operation on the GPU (if available)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): #Explicit device assignment
    result = tf.reduce_sum(z)

print("Result:", result.numpy())
```
This demonstrates basic addition on the GPU.  The `tf.device('/GPU:0')` context manager explicitly assigns the operation to the first available GPU (index 0).  I've learned to include explicit device placement to avoid relying on TensorFlow's automatic device placement, which can lead to unexpected CPU execution.

**Example 2: Handling Multiple GPUs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# List available GPUs
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(gpus))

# Configure TensorFlow to use multiple GPUs (if available)
if gpus:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus, 'GPU')
        logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)


# Define a simple model (e.g., a single dense layer)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Distribute training across available GPUs (requires TensorFlow's distribution strategy)
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # or other strategies like MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy for distributed training
with strategy.scope():
    # redefine model within strategy scope for distribution
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,))])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# ... training code ...

```

This example showcases the use of `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` for distributing model training across multiple GPUs.  I've often encountered subtle errors when not explicitly defining the model within the `strategy.scope()`, leading to unexpected single-GPU execution.


**Example 3: Error Handling and fallback to CPU:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpus:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True) #dynamic memory allocation
        print("GPU available, using GPU")
        with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
            # GPU computations
            pass #Replace with your GPU computation
    else:
        print("GPU not available, falling back to CPU")
        # CPU computations
        pass #Replace with your CPU computation
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error configuring GPU: {e}")
    # fallback to CPU
    pass #Replace with your CPU computation

```

This emphasizes robust error handling.  In my experience, unexpected exceptions during GPU configuration are common.  Gracefully falling back to CPU execution avoids abrupt program termination and ensures some level of functionality even in the face of GPU-related issues.  I've also included `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth`, a vital step for dynamic memory allocation, which improves resource utilization and prevents out-of-memory errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  the NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN documentation; a good book on deep learning frameworks.  Thorough understanding of linear algebra and Python is invaluable.  Exploring various online forums and communities dedicated to TensorFlow and GPU programming is highly beneficial for resolving specific issues.


In conclusion, successfully importing TensorFlow with GPU support requires meticulous attention to the CUDA and cuDNN installation and compatibility.  The provided examples demonstrate best practices for GPU detection, utilization, and error handling, highlighting techniques I've found crucial throughout my work.  Remember that consistent validation of the setup and systematic debugging are key to achieving reliable GPU acceleration in your TensorFlow projects.
