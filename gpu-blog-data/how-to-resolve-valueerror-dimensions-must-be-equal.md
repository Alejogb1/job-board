The `ValueError: Dimensions must be equal` in Keras RNNs frequently stems from a mismatch between the expected input shape and the actual shape of the data fed to the recurrent layer.  This is often exacerbated by subtle inconsistencies in data preprocessing or a misunderstanding of how Keras handles time series data.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects involving sentiment analysis and time series forecasting, this error almost always points to a problem in the input tensor's dimensions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras RNN layers, such as `LSTM` and `GRU`, expect input data in a specific three-dimensional format: `(samples, timesteps, features)`.  `samples` represents the number of independent sequences in your dataset. `timesteps` signifies the length of each sequence (the number of time steps or observations within a single sequence).  `features` corresponds to the number of features at each time step.

The error arises when the dimensions of the input tensor don't conform to this expected structure. For instance, if your input data has shape `(100, 20)` intending 100 samples with 20 features each but is interpreted by the RNN layer as having only one timestep, you'll encounter this error.  This is because the RNN layer will try to perform element-wise operations (like addition or concatenation) between mismatched dimensions during the forward pass. Similarly, inconsistencies between the output dimensions of a preceding layer and the input expectations of the RNN layer will lead to the same error.

The solution requires careful examination of your data preprocessing steps and the architecture of your Keras model.  You must ensure that the input tensor's shape aligns perfectly with the `input_shape` parameter of your RNN layer (or that `input_shape` is correctly inferred if you use the `Sequential` model).  Furthermore, intermediate layer outputs need to be carefully checked to guarantee compatibility.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Input Shape with `Sequential` Model:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: 100 sequences, each 20 timesteps long, with 3 features per timestep
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Binary classification

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(20, 3), return_sequences=False), # input_shape explicitly defined
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)
```

In this example, the `input_shape` parameter of the `LSTM` layer is explicitly set to `(20, 3)`, matching the shape of the input data.  The `return_sequences=False` argument specifies that the LSTM layer should return only the output of the last timestep. This is crucial for ensuring dimensionality compatibility with the subsequent `Dense` layer.  If you were building a many-to-many architecture, you would set `return_sequences=True`.

**Example 2: Reshaping Input Data:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Incorrectly shaped data: 100 samples, 60 values (mistaken as features)
incorrect_data = np.random.rand(100, 60)

# Reshape the data to the correct format (assuming 20 timesteps, 3 features)
data = incorrect_data.reshape(100, 20, 3)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(20, 3)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates how to handle data that is initially not in the correct format.  The `reshape()` function from NumPy is employed to transform the `incorrect_data` into the required `(samples, timesteps, features)` structure before passing it to the model.  Careful consideration of the number of timesteps and features is essential for this reshaping.

**Example 3:  Handling Variable-Length Sequences with Padding:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Data with variable-length sequences
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
labels = [0, 1, 0]

# Pad sequences to the maximum length
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post')

# Reshape to (samples, timesteps, features) - assuming 1 feature per timestep
data = padded_sequences.reshape(len(sequences), max_len, 1)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(max_len, 1)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)
```

This final example addresses the common scenario of variable-length sequences. The `pad_sequences` function from Keras is used to pad shorter sequences with zeros to ensure uniform length. The resulting padded sequences are then reshaped into the appropriate three-dimensional format before being fed into the LSTM layer. The `padding='post'` argument adds padding at the end of sequences.  Consider `padding='pre'` for alternative padding strategies.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly the sections on RNN layers and data preprocessing, are invaluable resources.  A thorough understanding of NumPy array manipulation is also crucial for data preparation.  Textbooks on deep learning, focusing on recurrent neural networks, will offer a comprehensive theoretical foundation.  Furthermore, examining example code repositories and tutorials focusing on RNN implementations will offer practical insights.  Finally, consult the Keras FAQ section to address common issues that might arise during model building and training.
