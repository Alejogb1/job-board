The inability of TensorFlow to locate `cusolver64_10.dll` during GPU operation stems fundamentally from a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit version expected by TensorFlow and the version actually installed on the system.  This discrepancy frequently arises from inconsistent or incomplete installations, particularly when multiple CUDA toolkits coexist or when attempting to leverage pre-built TensorFlow wheels incompatible with the present environment.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across various projects – including a large-scale medical image processing pipeline and a real-time anomaly detection system for industrial robotics – highlights the critical need for meticulous environment management.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's GPU support relies heavily on CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA.  The `cusolver64_10.dll` file is a crucial component of the CUDA library, specifically the cuSOLVER library, which provides highly optimized routines for solving linear systems. TensorFlow leverages cuSOLVER for various operations, particularly those involving matrix operations and linear algebra, integral to many deep learning computations.  If TensorFlow cannot find this DLL, it indicates that the runtime environment lacks either the necessary CUDA libraries or that the version mismatch prevents proper linkage.

Several factors contribute to this problem.  First, the version number (10 in this case) denotes a specific CUDA toolkit version.  If your system has CUDA 11 or a later version installed, TensorFlow built for CUDA 10 will fail to find the appropriate `cusolver64_10.dll`. Conversely, installing CUDA 10 after building TensorFlow with a newer CUDA version will also lead to failure. Second, incorrect installation paths can prevent TensorFlow from locating the library even if it's present on the system.  Third, the DLL may be corrupted or missing entirely, requiring a reinstallation of the CUDA toolkit.  Finally, conflicts between different CUDA installations, especially when dealing with multiple versions simultaneously, are a frequent source of this problem.  My experience suggests that carefully uninstalling conflicting versions prior to installing the correct CUDA toolkit is the most effective preventative measure.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples illustrate different approaches to diagnosing and resolving the `cusolver64_10.dll` issue.  These examples assume familiarity with Python and TensorFlow.  They are simplified for clarity and might require adjustments based on the specific environment.


**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Installation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import subprocess

try:
    # Check CUDA version via command line.  Adapt the command as needed for your OS.
    process = subprocess.run(['nvcc', '--version'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    cuda_version = process.stdout.strip().split('\n')[-1].split()[2] #Extract version string, might need modification based on nvcc output.
    print(f"CUDA Version: {cuda_version}")

    # Verify TensorFlow GPU support
    print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("nvcc not found. CUDA toolkit is likely not installed or incorrectly configured.")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
    print("Error executing nvcc. Check your CUDA toolkit installation.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This code snippet first attempts to locate `nvcc`, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler.  Its presence is a strong indicator of a CUDA installation.  It then proceeds to check the CUDA version via `nvcc --version`.  The output parsing needs adjustment depending on your `nvcc` version's output format. Finally, it verifies TensorFlow's access to GPUs using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`.


**Example 2:  Checking TensorFlow's CUDA Configuration:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("TensorFlow version:", tf.version.VERSION)
print("TensorFlow CUDA is enabled:", tf.test.is_built_with_cuda())
print("TensorFlow GPU available:", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))

try:
    #Attempt a simple GPU operation to trigger potential errors
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], shape=[1, 3])
        y = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1])
        z = tf.matmul(x, y)
        print("Matrix multiplication successful on GPU.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error during GPU operation: {e}")
    # The error message here can provide more specific hints to the problem
```

This example provides information about the TensorFlow installation, highlighting whether CUDA is enabled and whether TensorFlow can detect available GPUs.  Critically, it attempts a simple matrix multiplication on the GPU, forcing TensorFlow to utilize `cusolver64_10.dll` (or its equivalent for other CUDA versions). Any `RuntimeError` during this operation often provides detailed error messages pinpointing the cause, including DLL issues.


**Example 3: Environment Variable Check (Windows):**

```python
import os

print("CUDA_PATH:", os.environ.get("CUDA_PATH"))
print("PATH:", os.environ.get("PATH"))
```

On Windows, environment variables play a critical role in locating DLLs.  This short example displays the `CUDA_PATH` and `PATH` environment variables.  The `CUDA_PATH` should point to the root directory of your CUDA installation, and the `PATH` should include the CUDA bin directory containing `cusolver64_10.dll`. Incorrectly set or missing environment variables can lead to DLL loading failures.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation related to GPU setup and troubleshooting.  The NVIDIA CUDA documentation provides comprehensive details about the CUDA toolkit, installation, and troubleshooting.  Review the release notes for your specific TensorFlow version to confirm compatibility with your CUDA toolkit.  Refer to your system's documentation concerning environment variable management.  Investigate any available TensorFlow community forums or Stack Overflow threads related to GPU setup issues.  Consider using a virtual environment for your TensorFlow projects to isolate dependencies and avoid potential conflicts.


In summary, successful GPU operation with TensorFlow requires precise alignment between TensorFlow's CUDA expectations and the system's actual CUDA configuration.  Careful installation procedures, verification of environment variables, and meticulous attention to version compatibility are crucial to avoid the `cusolver64_10.dll` loading issue and similar problems.  Through systematic troubleshooting, combining the code examples provided with diligent consultation of official documentation, the underlying cause of such failures can be effectively diagnosed and resolved.
