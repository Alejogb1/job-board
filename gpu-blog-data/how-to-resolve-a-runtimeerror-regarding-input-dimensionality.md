The `RuntimeError: input_size != hidden_size` in PyTorch RNNs almost always stems from a mismatch between the expected input feature dimension and the recurrent layer's hidden size configuration.  This frequently arises during the initial model construction or when feeding data of incompatible shape.  Over the years, troubleshooting this issue for various NLP and time-series forecasting projects has highlighted the importance of precise input tensor manipulation.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's RNN modules (like `RNN`, `LSTM`, `GRU`) expect input tensors of a specific shape. This shape is fundamentally defined by three dimensions:  `(sequence_length, batch_size, input_size)`.  `sequence_length` represents the temporal length of each input sequence (e.g., number of words in a sentence, time steps in a time series). `batch_size` is the number of independent sequences processed concurrently. `input_size` dictates the dimensionality of the features at each time step within a sequence.  Crucially, this `input_size` must precisely match the `hidden_size` parameter specified during the RNN layer's instantiation.  A mismatch triggers the `RuntimeError`.  The hidden size determines the dimensionality of the hidden state vectors the RNN maintains internally.

The error often manifests when `input_size`, derived from your input data, differs from the `hidden_size` you explicitly defined in your `nn.RNN`, `nn.LSTM`, or `nn.GRU` layer.  This discrepancy can arise from several sources: incorrect data preprocessing, an oversight in the model definition, or a combination of both.  It's vital to meticulously check the shapes of your input tensors and the configuration of your recurrent layer.  Additionally, the error can also occur if your input data is not correctly batched or if you're applying linear transformations that inadvertently change the input feature dimensionality before it reaches the RNN.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the RNN model
class MyRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyRNN, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)  # batch_first=True for (batch, seq, feature)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        # out shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) # Taking the last hidden state
        return out

# Input data
input_size = 20  # Example: 20-dimensional word embeddings
hidden_size = 20 # Must match input_size
output_size = 2 # Example: Binary classification
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 10

input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)

# Initialize and run the model
model = MyRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([32, 2])
```

This example showcases a correctly configured RNN.  The `input_size` and `hidden_size` are identical, preventing the runtime error.  Note the use of `batch_first=True` which rearranges the tensor dimensions for easier handling.


**Example 2: Incorrect Input Dimensionality**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (MyRNN class definition from Example 1 remains the same) ...

# Incorrect input data:  input_size mismatch
input_size = 20
hidden_size = 10 # Incorrect: hidden_size != input_size
output_size = 2
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 10

incorrect_input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)


model = MyRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
try:
    output = model(incorrect_input_data)
    print(output.shape)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught RuntimeError: {e}")
```

This deliberately introduces the error. The `hidden_size` (10) doesn't align with `input_size` (20) from the input data, leading to the `RuntimeError`. The `try-except` block gracefully handles the exception.


**Example 3: Resolving the Mismatch Through Linear Transformation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (MyRNN class definition from Example 1 remains the same) ...

# Input data with different dimensionality
input_size = 30
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 2
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 10

input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)

# Define a linear layer to reduce dimensionality
linear_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

# Modified model forward pass
class MyRNNModified(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyRNNModified, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x) # Dimensionality reduction before RNN
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

model = MyRNNModified(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([32, 2])
```

This example demonstrates a solution.  When the input dimensionality cannot be easily altered, a linear transformation (a fully connected layer) is used to project the input features down to the desired `hidden_size` before feeding the data to the RNN.  This ensures compatibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on recurrent neural networks is invaluable.  Thoroughly reviewing the sections on RNN, LSTM, and GRU modules, paying close attention to input and output tensor shapes, will be critical.  Furthermore, consulting a comprehensive PyTorch textbook will provide a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation and model construction within the PyTorch framework.  Finally, exploring online tutorials and code examples focusing on RNN implementation in PyTorch can offer practical guidance and illustrative solutions to common issues.
