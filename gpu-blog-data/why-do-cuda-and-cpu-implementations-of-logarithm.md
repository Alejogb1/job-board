Discrepancies between CUDA and CPU implementations of the logarithm function, specifically when dealing with floating-point numbers, stem fundamentally from differing levels of precision and the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic itself.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications has repeatedly highlighted this issue, particularly in computationally intensive scientific simulations. The crux of the problem lies in the representation of floating-point numbers and the algorithms employed for computation.  While both CPUs and GPUs aim for IEEE 754 compliance, subtle variations in hardware architecture, compiler optimizations, and library implementations lead to these observable differences.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The IEEE 754 standard defines formats for representing floating-point numbers, most commonly single-precision (float, 32-bit) and double-precision (double, 64-bit).  Both CPUs and GPUs adhere to this standard, but the internal implementation details differ.  CPUs typically utilize specialized floating-point units (FPUs) with varying levels of precision and rounding modes.  GPUs, conversely, employ massively parallel architectures with potentially simpler FPUs, each operating independently.  These differences become significant when dealing with operations like the logarithm, which are inherently complex and susceptible to rounding errors.

The logarithm function is not calculated directly; rather, it utilizes approximation methods.  Common techniques include polynomial approximations, CORDIC algorithms, or table lookups combined with interpolation.  These algorithms introduce inherent errors due to the truncation or rounding of intermediate results. The specific algorithm used, the number of iterations in iterative algorithms, and the internal representation of intermediate values all influence the final result.

Compiler optimizations play a crucial role.  Compilers employ various techniques to optimize code for performance, including loop unrolling, instruction scheduling, and vectorization.  These optimizations, while beneficial in terms of speed, can subtly alter the order of operations and consequently affect the accumulation of rounding errors.  The optimization level chosen (e.g., -O2, -O3) can significantly influence the observed discrepancy between CPU and GPU outputs.

Finally, the underlying mathematical libraries used (e.g., libm on CPUs, cuBLAS on GPUs) also contribute to the variations. Each library might employ a different algorithm, possess its own rounding behaviors, and have varying degrees of optimization.  These factors collectively lead to the observed differences in the logarithm's output between CPU and GPU implementations.  The magnitude of the discrepancy typically depends on the input value, the precision of the floating-point type used, and the specific hardware and software environment.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the issue across different platforms and precisions.  I have observed similar behavior in various projects involving large-scale simulations and machine learning models.

**Example 1: Single-Precision Discrepancy**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void log_kernel(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        output[i] = logf(input[i]); // Single-precision logarithm
    }
}

int main() {
    int N = 1024;
    float* h_input;
    float* h_output_cpu;
    float* h_output_gpu;
    float* d_input;
    float* d_output;

    h_input = (float*)malloc(N * sizeof(float));
    h_output_cpu = (float*)malloc(N * sizeof(float));
    h_output_gpu = (float*)malloc(N * sizeof(float));

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, N * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, N * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize input data
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        h_input[i] = i + 1.0f; // Example input data
    }
    cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // CPU calculation
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        h_output_cpu[i] = logf(h_input[i]);
    }

    // GPU calculation
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    log_kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, N);
    cudaMemcpy(h_output_gpu, d_output, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Compare results (expecting small differences)
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        std::cout << "CPU: " << h_output_cpu[i] << " GPU: " << h_output_gpu[i] << std::endl;
    }

    free(h_input);
    free(h_output_cpu);
    free(h_output_gpu);
    cudaFree(d_input);
    cudaFree(d_output);
    return 0;
}
```

This example directly compares single-precision logarithm results between CPU and GPU.  The small differences observed are typical and attributable to the factors discussed above.

**Example 2: Double-Precision Comparison**

Replacing `float` with `double` in Example 1 and `logf` with `log` will demonstrate that using double-precision arithmetic reduces, but does not eliminate, the discrepancies.  The increased precision of `double` leads to smaller errors, but the fundamental limitations of floating-point arithmetic and algorithmic variations persist.

**Example 3:  Impact of Compiler Optimization**

This example highlights the influence of compiler optimization levels. By recompiling the code in Example 1 with different optimization flags (e.g., `-O0`, `-O2`, `-O3`), you will observe variations in the output due to changes in instruction scheduling and other compiler-level optimizations.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of floating-point arithmetic and its limitations, I recommend consulting the IEEE 754 standard documentation.  Further exploration of numerical analysis texts focusing on error analysis and approximation methods will provide valuable insight.  Finally, the documentation for your specific compiler and math libraries (e.g., CUDA documentation, compiler-specific optimization guides) will be invaluable in interpreting and mitigating these discrepancies.  Thorough investigation of the algorithm employed by the libraries is also essential.  Focusing on the underlying mathematical libraries' implementation details in conjunction with examining assembly output for specific computations can help pin down the root of variations.
