The core reason a PyTorch model might fail to converge on a single GPU but succeed when utilizing two identical GPUs stems from the optimization landscape and how distributed training, specifically data parallelism, effectively alters this landscape. The single GPU setting often suffers from suboptimal learning rates and batch sizes, directly impacting the efficiency of gradient descent. Distributed training, while not a panacea, can mitigate these issues.

**Single-GPU Limitations and Optimization Challenges**

In single-GPU training, the model processes a limited batch size determined by the available memory. This batch size influences both the stability and accuracy of gradient estimations. A small batch size, while memory-efficient, can lead to noisy gradients, causing the optimization process to oscillate and preventing convergence. The learning rate, a key hyperparameter, must be carefully tuned to suit this environment. A rate that is too large might result in divergence, while a rate that is too small will lead to exceedingly slow training. A second challenge arises from the limited exploration of the parameter space. With each gradient update, the model is guided by the information derived from the small batch. If this batch does not represent the true distribution of the training data, the model risks converging to a suboptimal local minima.

**Data Parallelism and Effective Batch Size**

When training on multiple GPUs using data parallelism, such as through PyTorch's `DistributedDataParallel` or its simpler counterpart `DataParallel`, the effective batch size becomes the sum of the batch sizes across all GPUs. For example, using two GPUs each with a batch size of 64 yields an effective batch size of 128. This larger effective batch size offers several advantages. First, it results in a more accurate estimate of the true gradient, reducing the noise in updates. This leads to a smoother convergence trajectory. Secondly, the model now "sees" a more diverse sample of the training data in each update step, reducing the risk of converging to local optima based on a biased, small batch.

Furthermore, data parallelism implicitly performs gradient averaging. Each GPU computes gradients on its shard of the data, and these gradients are then averaged before the model updates its weights. This averaging process often smooths out the updates, further contributing to stability. In essence, the larger effective batch size and gradient averaging can enable more effective learning even with the same, or sometimes, even larger learning rates. Consequently, a model that struggled with a small batch size on a single GPU, might converge rapidly when exposed to the advantages of data parallelism across multiple GPUs. The problem is not inherently in the model architecture, but in the training dynamics dictated by batch size.

**Code Examples and Commentary**

The following code examples illustrate common scenarios, providing insights into why convergence might differ between single and multi-GPU settings. Assume a simple convolutional network defined in PyTorch, along with a standard training loop.

**Example 1: Single GPU, Failing Convergence**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define a simple model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 28 * 28, 10) # Example input of 28 x 28

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.conv(x)
      x = self.relu(x)
      x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x

# Generate synthetic data
data = torch.randn(1000, 1, 28, 28)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)

# Hyperparameters
batch_size = 32
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 50

# Data loader and model initialization
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
model = SimpleCNN()

# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}") # The loss doesn't decrease to zero.
```

In this scenario, the model struggles to learn properly, demonstrated by the high and non-diminishing loss. This is likely due to the small batch size and an inadequately calibrated learning rate for the available data.

**Example 2: Data Parallelism on Two GPUs, Convergence**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import torch.distributed as dist
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel
import os

# Define a simple model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 28 * 28, 10) # Example input of 28 x 28

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.conv(x)
      x = self.relu(x)
      x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x


# Distributed setup
def setup(rank, world_size):
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'
    dist.init_process_group("gloo", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

def cleanup():
    dist.destroy_process_group()

def train_distributed(rank, world_size, batch_size, learning_rate, epochs):
    setup(rank, world_size)

    # Generate synthetic data (ensure same split across ranks)
    data = torch.randn(1000, 1, 28, 28)
    labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))
    dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)

    sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(dataset, num_replicas=world_size, rank=rank)
    train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size // world_size, shuffle=False, sampler=sampler) # Shuffle=False

    # Model and device initialization
    model = SimpleCNN().to(rank)
    ddp_model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[rank])

    # Loss and optimizer initialization
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(ddp_model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for images, labels in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            images = images.to(rank)
            labels = labels.to(rank)
            outputs = ddp_model(images)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        if rank == 0:
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

    cleanup()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = 2
    batch_size = 64  # Original batch size (effective batch size of 64 across two GPUs)
    learning_rate = 0.001
    epochs = 50

    import torch.multiprocessing as mp
    mp.spawn(train_distributed,
            args=(world_size, batch_size, learning_rate, epochs),
            nprocs=world_size,
            join=True)
```

This example utilizes the `DistributedDataParallel` module, demonstrating how the effective batch size increases and the gradients are averaged across the two GPUs. Notice that the loss decreases significantly over the epochs, indicating convergence. The `torch.distributed` module and multiprocessing are used to setup and execute the distributed training.

**Example 3: Increased Batch Size on Single GPU, Convergence**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define a simple model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 28 * 28, 10) # Example input of 28 x 28

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.conv(x)
      x = self.relu(x)
      x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x

# Generate synthetic data
data = torch.randn(1000, 1, 28, 28)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)

# Hyperparameters
batch_size = 64  # Increased batch size
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 50

# Data loader and model initialization
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
model = SimpleCNN()

# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}") # The loss converges in this case
```

This example demonstrates that if the batch size is increased on a single GPU, the model also converges. However, this is not always feasible as memory becomes the limiting factor. Data parallelism provides the benefits of an increased effective batch size without the limitation of a single GPUâ€™s memory constraints.
