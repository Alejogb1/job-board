The primary cause of `TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting` during model training, specifically when dealing with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, arises from an incompatibility between the data types provided as arguments to format strings (typically using the `%` operator or the `.format()` method) and the format specifiers defined in the string itself. This discrepancy often manifests within custom training loops or logging functions where data intended for display is inadvertently interpreted as formatting parameters. Having spent considerable time optimizing various deep learning models, I've frequently encountered this error, usually stemming from subtle mismatches between tensors, scalars, and expected formatting string types.

This error signifies that the Python interpreter attempted to convert the provided arguments to match the expected data types (e.g., integer, float, string) indicated by the format specifiers within the formatting string, but failed because some arguments did not conform to those expectations. The classic `%` style formatting (e.g., `"%d" % 3.14`) is particularly vulnerable to this problem. However, the `.format()` method is less likely to fail outright, often producing a less intuitive result if the data types are mismatched, sometimes even silently succeeding with incorrect conversions. The root cause invariably traces to either improperly formatted strings, where format specifiers are out of sync with actual arguments, or data types being passed that do not correspond to their intended format. This typically surfaces during training when, for example, a tensor is inadvertently passed where a scalar is expected.

Let's explore this issue through some practical code examples. Consider a scenario where we are tracking training progress by logging metrics at each epoch.

```python
# Example 1: Incorrect Type Passing with % operator
import tensorflow as tf

def train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(data)
      loss = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

def train_model(model, train_dataset, optimizer, epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
      epoch_loss = 0.0
      num_batches = 0
      for data, labels in train_dataset:
          loss = train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels)
          epoch_loss += loss
          num_batches +=1
      avg_loss = epoch_loss / num_batches
      print("Epoch %d: Loss = %f" % (epoch, avg_loss)) # Vulnerable point

# Example dataset and setup (simplified)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,))])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
train_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,784))
train_labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data, train_labels)).batch(10)

train_model(model, train_dataset, optimizer)
```

In Example 1, the vulnerable point is the `print` statement within `train_model`.  The `avg_loss` variable is, in TensorFlow 2.x and later, a TensorFlow tensor, not a native Python float or integer. The format string `"%f"` expects a native float, not a tensor, which cannot be directly interpreted by the `%` operator in this case. This results in the `TypeError`. TensorFlow operations, including division, will always return tensor objects. Therefore, we must explicitly convert the tensor to a numeric primitive using `.numpy()`.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Example 1: Incorrect Type Passing with % operator (Corrected)
import tensorflow as tf

def train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(data)
      loss = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

def train_model(model, train_dataset, optimizer, epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
      epoch_loss = 0.0
      num_batches = 0
      for data, labels in train_dataset:
          loss = train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels)
          epoch_loss += loss
          num_batches +=1
      avg_loss = epoch_loss / num_batches
      print("Epoch %d: Loss = %f" % (epoch, avg_loss.numpy())) # Corrected Point

# Example dataset and setup (simplified)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,))])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
train_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,784))
train_labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data, train_labels)).batch(10)

train_model(model, train_dataset, optimizer)
```

Now, let's look at a similar issue, but using Python's more modern `.format()` method:

```python
# Example 2: Incorrect Type Passing with .format() method
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

def train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(data)
    loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(predictions, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return loss

def train_model(model, train_dataset, optimizer, epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        epoch_loss = 0.0
        num_batches = 0
        for data, labels in train_dataset:
            loss = train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels)
            epoch_loss += loss
            num_batches +=1
        avg_loss = epoch_loss / num_batches
        print("Epoch {}: Loss = {}".format(epoch, avg_loss)) # Vulnerable Point

# Simplified dataset and setup
model = nn.Linear(784, 10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
train_data = torch.randn(100, 784)
train_labels = torch.randint(0, 9, (100,))
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(train_data, train_labels)
train_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=10)

train_model(model, train_dataloader, optimizer)
```

In Example 2, the `print` statement using the `.format()` method doesn’t explicitly throw a `TypeError`, at least at first. Instead, it prints a string that includes the Tensor object's representation which is not the same as the floating-point value that is required to properly log progress. Unlike the `%` operator, `.format()` is more lenient with types, attempting to convert them to strings by default. While it avoids a direct crash, the logged output is not as desired and it’s crucial to handle the type conversions manually.

Corrected Code:

```python
# Example 2: Incorrect Type Passing with .format() method (Corrected)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

def train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(data)
    loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(predictions, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return loss

def train_model(model, train_dataset, optimizer, epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        epoch_loss = 0.0
        num_batches = 0
        for data, labels in train_dataset:
            loss = train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels)
            epoch_loss += loss
            num_batches +=1
        avg_loss = epoch_loss / num_batches
        print("Epoch {}: Loss = {:.4f}".format(epoch, avg_loss.item())) # Corrected Point

# Simplified dataset and setup
model = nn.Linear(784, 10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
train_data = torch.randn(100, 784)
train_labels = torch.randint(0, 9, (100,))
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(train_data, train_labels)
train_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=10)

train_model(model, train_dataloader, optimizer)
```

In the corrected version of example 2, I have used the `.item()` method to convert the loss from a PyTorch Tensor to a float before formatting. I've also added `.4f` to the `.format()` string, which formats the output to have four decimal places.

Finally, consider an edge case where formatting is done deep inside library functions.

```python
# Example 3: Indirect Error Due to Library Usage
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def process_data(data):
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df.describe()  # Internally uses format strings

data = np.random.rand(10, 3)
try:
    description = process_data(data)
    print(description)
except Exception as e:
  print("Encountered an error: ", e)
```

In Example 3, pandas' `describe()` method, used for descriptive statistics, internally utilizes format strings. If input data are not numeric, the default string representation of the object is used in the description table. However, if the data is a numpy array with a mixture of different types that do not easily translate into strings the formatting can break and will result in an internal `TypeError` which, in some circumstances, might be obscured or difficult to debug as it occurs within the pandas library. In most cases, pandas handles non-numeric data gracefully, but there are edge cases with specific data types. It is very important to ensure that the input data for pandas is as expected.

To address this particular edge case, one would need to pre-process and validate the input data, possibly ensuring data type consistency or conversion of mixed-type data prior to passing to the DataFrame constructor.

In summary, resolving the `TypeError` related to format strings requires a careful examination of the format strings and the data being passed to them. The root of the issue generally resides in type mismatches. Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Pandas often use these strings internally, so one must be very careful to check data types when calling these functions and passing data into these libraries. Always convert tensors to their numeric primitives (.numpy() for TensorFlow and .item() for PyTorch) before formatting them.

For further reading on type handling in Python, I would highly suggest reviewing the official Python documentation on string formatting and data types. Specifically, the sections on the `%` operator and the `str.format()` method would be extremely beneficial. In addition, familiarity with the Tensor type in TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other deep learning frameworks is essential. Understanding the data types that these frameworks produce and expect will significantly improve one’s ability to identify and address these issues in the future.
