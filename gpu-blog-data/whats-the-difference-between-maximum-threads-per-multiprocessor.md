The fundamental distinction between `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` and `maxThreadsPerBlock` in CUDA device queries lies in their architectural scope within the GPU.  `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` reflects the upper limit of concurrent threads a single Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) can handle, whereas `maxThreadsPerBlock` denotes the maximum number of threads that can cooperate within a single kernel launch's block.  Understanding this difference is crucial for optimizing CUDA kernel performance and avoiding resource contention.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects for seismic data processing heavily relied on this distinction.  Improperly configuring thread block sizes directly impacted computation times, sometimes by orders of magnitude.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A CUDA GPU comprises multiple Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), each capable of executing many threads concurrently.  However, an SM's capacity is finite.  `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor`, retrieved using `cudaDeviceGetAttribute()`, specifies this limit. This attribute determines the maximum number of threads an SM can manage simultaneously, considering its register file capacity and other internal resources.  It's a hardware limitation inherent to the specific GPU architecture.

On the other hand, `maxThreadsPerBlock` represents the largest number of threads that can form a single cooperative thread block.  A thread block is the fundamental unit of execution launched by a CUDA kernel. Threads within a block can synchronize using built-in synchronization primitives like `__syncthreads()`, allowing for efficient inter-thread communication and data sharing.  This value is also obtained via `cudaDeviceGetAttribute()`, and while partially influenced by hardware (e.g., shared memory capacity), it also reflects software considerations regarding warp size and register allocation.

The relationship between these two attributes is indirect but essential.  While a single block is limited by `maxThreadsPerBlock`, the total number of active blocks concurrently processed by the GPU is constrained by the number of SMs and the `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` attribute.  Effectively utilizing the GPU requires careful consideration of both limitations to ensure optimal occupancy, which refers to the ratio of active warps to the total number of warps an SM can handle. Low occupancy leads to underutilized SM resources, resulting in slower execution.

A simple analogy, although I generally avoid such simplifications in technical explanations, could be a multi-core CPU. `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` is like the number of threads a single core can handle, while `maxThreadsPerBlock` is similar to the maximum number of threads in a single process.  Multiple processes (blocks) can run concurrently across multiple cores (SMs), but each core has its own limitation on the number of threads it can manage simultaneously.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Querying Device Attributes**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int device = 0; // Choose device 0
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);

    std::cout << "Device Name: " << prop.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max Threads Per MultiProcessor: " << prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max Threads Per Block: " << prop.maxThreadsPerBlock << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic retrieval of device properties, including `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` and `maxThreadsPerBlock`, using the CUDA runtime API.  I've added error handling for cases where no CUDA-capable device is found, a common issue during development and deployment on diverse systems. Note the explicit selection of device 0; in a multi-GPU system, appropriate device selection is paramount.

**Example 2: Kernel Launch with Block Size Consideration**

```c++
__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        data[i] *= 2; // Example computation
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (Device property retrieval as in Example 1) ...

    int blockSize = 256; // Example block size – needs adjustment based on device properties
    int gridSize = (N + blockSize -1) / blockSize; // Ensure all elements are processed

    myKernel<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(dev_data, N);

    // ... (Error checking and data transfer) ...

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the kernel launch utilizes a block size (`blockSize`).  A critical step omitted for brevity is determining an appropriate `blockSize` based on `maxThreadsPerBlock` and other device characteristics.  Simply using a constant value like 256 may be inefficient or even cause compilation errors on certain devices.  Dynamic block size selection, adjusted according to the queried `maxThreadsPerBlock` is a more robust strategy, particularly when deploying code across various GPU architectures.  The grid size calculation ensures complete data processing, avoiding partial computation.

**Example 3: Occupancy Calculation (Illustrative)**

```c++
// ... (Device property retrieval) ...

int warpSize = prop.warpSize;
int maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor = prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor;
int maxThreadsPerBlock = prop.maxThreadsPerBlock;

int blockSize = 256; // Example, should be optimized

int numBlocksPerSM = maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / blockSize;
if (numBlocksPerSM * blockSize > maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor) numBlocksPerSM--;

float occupancy = (float)(numBlocksPerSM * blockSize) / maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor;

std::cout << "Occupancy: " << occupancy << std::endl;
```

This example provides a simplified calculation of occupancy.  Real-world occupancy analysis requires a more nuanced understanding of factors like shared memory usage and register pressure. This calculation demonstrates the direct relationship between the maximum threads per multiprocessor, the chosen block size, and the resulting occupancy. An occupancy close to 1.0 is desirable, indicating efficient utilization of the SMs.

CUDA C++ Programming Guide.  CUDA Best Practices Guide.  NVIDIA's documentation on CUDA architecture.  A good textbook on parallel programming principles.


Throughout my career, I’ve observed many developers neglecting the importance of device query and proper block size selection. This often leads to suboptimal performance.  The presented examples offer a starting point for more advanced techniques involving dynamic kernel configurations, which significantly improve the adaptability and efficiency of CUDA applications across different GPU hardware.  Remember that careful analysis and experimentation are crucial for achieving peak performance in GPU programming.
