The issue of `fit_generator` (and its successor `fit`) prematurely terminating after a single epoch often stems from a mismatch between the generator's output and the model's expectations, specifically regarding the number of steps per epoch.  In my experience troubleshooting Keras and TensorFlow models, I've encountered this problem numerous times, primarily due to miscalculations in the generator's `__len__` method or an inaccurate `steps_per_epoch` argument supplied to the `fit` function.  This can lead to the training process believing it has completed a full epoch prematurely.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `fit_generator` (and now `fit` with a generator) method requires explicit specification of how many batches of data it should process per epoch.  If this number is incorrect, the training loop will halt prematurely.  The generator, responsible for yielding batches of data, needs to consistently return the expected number of batches for each epoch.  The `steps_per_epoch` argument dictates how many batches the model expects from the generator in each epoch. This value must precisely reflect the total number of samples divided by the batch size.  If the generator yields fewer batches than expected, the training will stop.  Conversely, if the generator yields more batches than specified, it will also be truncated.  Furthermore, issues within the generator itself, such as exceptions during data processing or an incorrectly implemented `__len__` method that doesn't accurately reflect the total number of batches, can also cause early termination.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `steps_per_epoch`**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def data_generator(data, batch_size):
    num_samples = len(data)
    while True:
        for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
            yield data[i:i+batch_size], np.zeros(batch_size) #Simplified target

# Incorrect steps_per_epoch calculation
data = np.random.rand(100, 10) # 100 samples, 10 features
batch_size = 10
steps_per_epoch = 5 # Incorrect; should be 100/10 = 10

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

try:
  model.fit(data_generator(data, batch_size), steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch, epochs=5)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates the problem of incorrect `steps_per_epoch`.  Using 5 instead of 10 causes the training to prematurely conclude believing an epoch is finished after only processing 5 batches, even though the data has more samples.  The `try...except` block is added as a best practice, and can help in debugging in various situations. The error encountered will be an indication that it hasn't iterated through all the expected data.

**Example 2: Incorrect `__len__` Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class DataGenerator(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, data, batch_size):
        self.data = data
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        # Incorrect length calculation - it should be len(self.data) // self.batch_size
        return 5

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        i = index * self.batch_size
        return self.data[i:i + self.batch_size], np.zeros(self.batch_size)

data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
batch_size = 10
generator = DataGenerator(data, batch_size)

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

try:
  model.fit(generator, epochs=5)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Here, the `__len__` method of the custom data generator is explicitly set to 5, regardless of the actual data size. This directly misleads the `fit` method, making it think only 5 steps (batches) constitute an epoch, resulting in premature termination. The `try...except` block will help capture any errors that might be generated here as well.

**Example 3: Exception within the Generator**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def faulty_generator(data, batch_size):
    num_samples = len(data)
    for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
        try:
            # Simulate an error after the second batch
            if i == batch_size:
                raise ValueError("Simulated data error")
            yield data[i:i+batch_size], np.zeros(batch_size)
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error in generator: {e}")
            break #Handles the exception

data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
batch_size = 10
steps_per_epoch = len(data) // batch_size

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(faulty_generator(data, batch_size), steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch, epochs=5)
```

This example highlights how exceptions within the generator can disrupt the training.  The `try...except` block within the generator catches the `ValueError` and halts the generator's operation. This leads to `fit` receiving fewer batches than `steps_per_epoch` specifies, causing it to finish prematurely.  The key difference here is that the generator itself is failing, unlike the previous examples where the issue lies in the configuration of the `fit` or the `__len__` method.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation is essential for understanding `fit` and data handling.  Furthermore, textbooks on deep learning, particularly those focusing on TensorFlow or Keras, provide in-depth explanations of data generators and model training.  Finally, reviewing relevant Stack Overflow threads and discussions on similar issues is always valuable. Thoroughly examining error messages provided by the `fit` method during execution is crucial for effective debugging.  Understanding the nuances of exception handling in Python is also beneficial in dealing with issues like the one presented in Example 3.
