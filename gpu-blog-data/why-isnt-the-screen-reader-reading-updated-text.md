Screen readers' failure to update dynamically when radio button states change stems from a fundamental mismatch between the browser's DOM (Document Object Model) update mechanisms and the screen reader's event listening capabilities.  My experience debugging accessibility issues in large-scale web applications has consistently highlighted this challenge.  The core problem lies in the timing and nature of the updates;  the browser might update the DOM, but doesn't always trigger events that adequately inform assistive technologies of the change.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Screen readers typically rely on events – notably `DOMSubtreeModified` (deprecated but still relevant in some older browsers) and `MutationObserver` – to monitor the DOM for changes.  However, the act of changing a radio button's `checked` attribute, while modifying the DOM, often doesn't automatically dispatch these events in a way screen readers reliably interpret.  This is particularly true when the text update is coupled with the radio button state change. The browser might efficiently update the visual representation of the text, but the event signaling the meaningful update to the accessibility tree is missing or delayed.  Further complicating this, different browsers handle these events with varying levels of consistency, making cross-browser compatibility a significant hurdle.  Furthermore, the specific implementation of the screen reader and its interaction with the browser's accessibility APIs (like AT-SPI, UIA, or IAccessible2) plays a critical role.  A poorly implemented screen reader or an incompatibility between the browser and screen reader can amplify the problem.

The challenge is not necessarily in updating the displayed text. The problem lies in informing the screen reader that the displayed text, contextually linked to the radio button selection, has changed in a way that necessitates an immediate screen refresh.  Simply modifying the text content isn't enough; the screen reader needs a clear, programmatic signal to recognize and announce the altered text.  This signal needs to be both timely and consistently triggered across different browsers and assistive technologies.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Approach (Passive Update):**

```html
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="option" value="option1" onchange="updateText(this)"> Option 1
</label>
<p id="dynamicText">Default Text</p>

<script>
  function updateText(radio) {
    if (radio.checked) {
      document.getElementById('dynamicText').textContent = 'Text for Option 1';
    }
  }
</script>
```

This approach directly manipulates the DOM. While visually functional, it lacks robust accessibility.  The `onchange` event doesn't reliably signal the screen reader that the associated text has changed significantly enough to warrant an announcement. The screen reader might miss the update entirely, especially if it's not actively listening for DOM changes with high frequency or if the `onchange` event isn't suitably interpreted by the screen reader.


**Example 2:  Improved Approach (using `aria-labelledby` and `aria-live`):**

```html
<label id="labelOption1">
  <input type="radio" name="option" value="option1" aria-labelledby="labelOption1 descriptionOption1"> Option 1
</label>
<p id="descriptionOption1" aria-live="assertive">Default Text</p>
<script>
  const radio = document.querySelector('input[name="option"]');
  const description = document.getElementById('descriptionOption1');

  radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
    description.textContent = radio.checked ? 'Text for Option 1' : 'Default Text';
  });
</script>
```

This approach leverages ARIA attributes. `aria-labelledby` connects the radio button to its descriptive text, enabling the screen reader to associate the two elements. Critically, `aria-live="assertive"` instructs the screen reader to immediately announce any changes within the associated element (`descriptionOption1`).  This provides the explicit signal needed.  While more sophisticated, relying solely on `aria-live` isn't always sufficient across all screen readers and browsers.  It's a significant improvement, however, over the passive approach.


**Example 3:  Robust Approach (Custom Event with `MutationObserver`):**

```html
<label id="labelOption1">
  <input type="radio" name="option" value="option1" aria-labelledby="labelOption1 descriptionOption1"> Option 1
</label>
<p id="descriptionOption1">Default Text</p>

<script>
  const radio = document.querySelector('input[name="option"]');
  const description = document.getElementById('descriptionOption1');

  radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
    const event = new CustomEvent('textUpdated', { detail: { newText: radio.checked ? 'Text for Option 1' : 'Default Text' }});
    description.dispatchEvent(event);
    description.textContent = event.detail.newText;
  });

  const observer = new MutationObserver(mutations => {
    mutations.forEach(mutation => {
      if (mutation.type === 'characterData' && mutation.target.parentNode.id === 'descriptionOption1') {
        const textUpdatedEvent = new CustomEvent('screenReaderUpdate');
        document.body.dispatchEvent(textUpdatedEvent);
      }
    });
  });

  observer.observe(description, { characterData: true, subtree: true});
</script>
```

This example combines the strengths of ARIA attributes with a custom event and `MutationObserver`.  The `MutationObserver` specifically targets changes to the `descriptionOption1` element's text content.  Dispatching a custom `screenReaderUpdate` event, while not a universally guaranteed solution, provides an extra layer of signaling for screen readers that might not reliably react to the `characterData` mutation alone.  The combined use of `aria-live`, custom events, and `MutationObserver` offers a more robust solution, improving reliability across different screen readers and browsers.  My experience shows that this multi-pronged approach offers the highest degree of success in ensuring consistent accessibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines.  Specifically, focus on ARIA authoring practices and understanding the nuances of accessible rich internet applications (ARIA).
*  Comprehensive books and documentation on ARIA and assistive technologies.  These resources often include detailed explanations of event handling and screen reader interaction.
*  Technical specifications related to browser accessibility APIs.  Understanding how these APIs work will provide insight into the complexities of screen reader integration.



By understanding the event handling limitations and leveraging appropriate ARIA attributes in conjunction with robust event dispatching and observation techniques, developers can build more accessible web applications and improve the user experience for individuals relying on screen readers. The code examples illustrate a progression towards robustness, highlighting the complexities involved in ensuring consistent accessibility across platforms and assistive technologies. My experience working with a diverse range of screen readers and browsers underscores the importance of employing multiple strategies for reliable updates.
