Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Nets, while architecturally distinct, share fundamental mechanisms regarding weight and activation visualization.  My experience optimizing medical image segmentation models has underscored the critical role of these visualizations in understanding model behavior and identifying potential issues.  Specifically,  understanding the spatial distribution of activations reveals the model's focus within the input, while weight visualization offers insight into learned feature detectors.  This is especially crucial in U-Nets, where the skip connections significantly influence feature propagation.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Weight and Activation Visualization:**

Weight visualization primarily focuses on the convolutional kernels within each layer. Each kernel is a multi-dimensional array representing a learned filter.  For a grayscale image, a kernel might be a 3x3 matrix; for a color image, it would be a 3x3x3 matrix (3 for RGB channels).  Visualizing these kernels involves representing the array values as grayscale or color images, where higher values are represented by brighter pixels and lower values by darker pixels.  This allows us to observe the patterns the network has learned to detect.  For example, in a model trained on images of cats, one might observe a kernel that highlights edge features, another detecting textures, and so on.  Analyzing the kernels can help identify if the network is learning meaningful features or if there are problems like overfitting, where the kernels are overly specialized to the training data.

Activation visualization, on the other hand, maps the output of a convolutional layer or a specific neuron within a layer.  These activations represent the response of the network to the input image at various stages of the processing pipeline.   The visualization usually represents the activation map as a grayscale or color image where pixel intensity reflects the activation strength.  Areas with high activation signify regions of the input image that strongly activate specific filters, revealing which parts of the input the network focuses on.  High activation in irrelevant areas can indicate noise sensitivity or poor feature extraction.  In U-Nets, visualizing activations at various levels (encoder and decoder) helps understand the flow of information and how the network combines contextual information (from the encoder) with detailed local information (from the decoder).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples use Python with the TensorFlow/Keras framework.  I've chosen this due to its prevalence and ease of visualization. Remember that direct kernel visualization requires careful handling of potentially negative values, often involving normalization and scaling to the [0,1] range for display as images.

**Example 1: Visualizing Convolutional Kernels:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Assume 'model' is a compiled CNN or U-Net model
layer_name = 'conv2d_1' # Replace with the layer you want to visualize
layer = model.get_layer(layer_name)
weights = layer.get_weights()[0] # weights[0] is the kernel; weights[1] is the bias

# Normalize weights to [0, 1] range for visualization
weights_min = np.min(weights)
weights_max = np.max(weights)
normalized_weights = (weights - weights_min) / (weights_max - weights_min)

# Visualize the kernels
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=4, ncols=4, figsize=(10,10))
for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):
    if i < len(normalized_weights[0]): #Check against number of kernels
        ax.imshow(normalized_weights[0, :, :, i], cmap='gray')
        ax.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
This code snippet extracts the weights of a specific convolutional layer ('conv2d_1'), normalizes them, and displays them as grayscale images.  The code handles potential cases where the number of kernels is less than the number of subplots.

**Example 2: Visualizing Activations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'model' is a compiled CNN or U-Net model
layer_name = 'conv2d_1' # Replace with the layer you want to visualize
model_intermediate = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)

# Input image (replace with your image)
image = np.expand_dims(np.random.rand(256,256,3), axis=0)  #Example 256x256 RGB image
intermediate_output = model_intermediate.predict(image)

# Visualize activations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(intermediate_output[0, :, :, 0], cmap='gray') #show the first channel's activations.
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This example utilizes Keras's functional API to create a model that outputs the activations of a specific layer. Then, it feeds an input image to this intermediate model to generate the activation maps and displays the first channel for illustration.  Remember to adjust channel selection based on the layer's output shape.


**Example 3: Visualizing U-Net Activations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'model' is a compiled U-Net model

# Define layers of interest (replace with actual layer names from your model)
encoder_layer = 'encoder_conv_1'
decoder_layer = 'decoder_conv_1'
skip_connection_layer = 'skip_connection_1'

intermediate_encoder = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.get_layer(encoder_layer).output)
intermediate_decoder = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.get_layer(decoder_layer).output)
intermediate_skip = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.get_layer(skip_connection_layer).output)

# Input image (replace with your image)
image = np.expand_dims(np.random.rand(256,256,3), axis=0)

encoder_activation = intermediate_encoder.predict(image)
decoder_activation = intermediate_decoder.predict(image)
skip_activation = intermediate_skip.predict(image)


#Plot activations (simplified for brevity)
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
plt.imshow(encoder_activation[0, :, :, 0], cmap='gray')
plt.title('Encoder Activations')
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
plt.imshow(decoder_activation[0, :, :, 0], cmap='gray')
plt.title('Decoder Activations')
plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
plt.imshow(skip_activation[0, :, :, 0], cmap='gray')
plt.title('Skip Connection Activations')
plt.show()
```

This example extends the activation visualization to U-Nets, specifically showing activations from the encoder, decoder, and a skip connection layer. The key is creating separate intermediate models for each target layer.  This visualization helps in understanding information flow within the U-Net architecture.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures, consult established textbooks on deep learning.  For practical implementation and visualization techniques, explore the official documentation of TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.  Reviewing research papers focusing on CNN visualization and interpretability methods can provide advanced techniques and insights.  Finally, exploring visualization libraries beyond Matplotlib, like Seaborn or Visdom, can enhance the presentation of your results.
