The core behavior of PyTorch tensor addition dictates that direct element-wise addition is only defined between tensors of compatible shapes. This implies that tensors involved in addition must either be the same size or adhere to broadcasting rules, a mechanism that expands lower-dimensional tensors to match higher dimensions when specific size compatibility conditions are met. Attempting direct addition with mismatched shapes, outside of these broadcasting rules, will result in an error. My practical experience in developing deep learning models, specifically in the image processing domain, has frequently exposed me to shape inconsistencies, requiring careful attention to tensor dimensions before performing any arithmetic operations.

Specifically, PyTorch’s underlying operations are implemented to work efficiently by performing calculations in parallel. In order to achieve this parallelization, each element in the tensor must correspond to the correct location in the result tensor. Element-wise operations such as addition or subtraction require this direct correspondence, and when shapes are incompatible, a valid correspondence is not possible. Consequently, PyTorch prevents the operation rather than resulting in undefined or inconsistent behavior. This strictness, while sometimes challenging to beginners, is fundamental to the predictability and reliability of PyTorch.

When the shapes of two tensors are identical, the addition operation is straightforward. Each corresponding element from the two tensors is added to produce the corresponding element in the resulting tensor. For instance, a tensor representing a grayscale image of 28x28 pixels can be directly added to another tensor representing a 28x28 pixel image. If, however, you attempt to add that same 28x28 image tensor to a 32x32 tensor, or even a 28x29 tensor, a shape mismatch error will be thrown. This is regardless of whether the underlying data type is float or integer.

Broadcasting is where things get slightly more nuanced. Broadcasting allows PyTorch to perform element-wise operations on tensors with different shapes, provided that the shapes are *compatible*. The rules of broadcasting are based on the following principles:
1. Tensors with fewer dimensions are *prepended* with dimensions of size 1, making them the same length as tensors with more dimensions. For instance, a tensor of shape (3,) would be considered as a tensor of shape (1, 3) when adding to a tensor of shape (5, 3).
2. The size of a dimension in the tensors must be either the same or equal to 1. If both have non-1 size, they must be equal.
3. After broadcasting, the size of each output dimension is the maximum size of the corresponding input dimensions.

Let’s consider a practical example to demonstrate these concepts: adding a bias vector to a matrix representing a batch of image features. Imagine a batch of 64 feature maps each of size (128 x 128). The feature map will thus have the shape (64, 128, 128), and you are training a model to adjust the magnitude of each feature map using one single learnable bias (or offset). The bias vector would then have the shape (128,128) or more compactly (1, 128, 128), with one per element in the feature map. The shape will broadcast successfully to the (64, 128, 128) feature map. The bias will be added to each feature map in the batch.

I encountered situations like this regularly when building segmentation models, and careful debugging of tensor shapes was crucial to ensure the final accuracy of my models. Incorrect shape assumptions invariably resulted in runtime errors.

Here are a few code examples and commentary illustrating various scenarios:

**Example 1: Direct Addition with Compatible Shapes**

```python
import torch

# Creating two tensors of the same shape
tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=torch.float)
tensor_b = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]], dtype=torch.float)

# Performing direct addition
result = tensor_a + tensor_b
print("Tensor A:\n", tensor_a)
print("Tensor B:\n", tensor_b)
print("Result of Addition:\n", result)
```

In this example, `tensor_a` and `tensor_b` have the same shape (2x2), making element-wise addition straightforward. The output reflects that each element in `tensor_a` was added to the corresponding element in `tensor_b`. This demonstrates the fundamental use case of tensor addition when shape compatibility is guaranteed. The output shows that each element in the final tensor contains the sum of each corresponding element in tensors A and B.

**Example 2: Addition with Broadcasting**

```python
import torch

# Creating a 1D bias tensor
bias_vector = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.float)

# Creating a 2D tensor
data_matrix = torch.tensor([[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=torch.float)

# Performing addition with broadcasting
result = data_matrix + bias_vector
print("Bias Vector:\n", bias_vector)
print("Data Matrix:\n", data_matrix)
print("Result of Addition with Broadcasting:\n", result)

```
In this example, a 1D tensor, `bias_vector`, is added to a 2D tensor, `data_matrix`. The shape of `bias_vector` is (3), and the shape of `data_matrix` is (2, 3). Broadcasting allows the bias to be implicitly expanded to match the 2nd dimension of `data_matrix`. Each element in `bias_vector` is effectively added to the entire respective column in `data_matrix`. This showcases how broadcasting facilitates more compact operations by eliminating the explicit need to reshape or duplicate tensors. The output shows that elements within each row of the resulting tensor are equal to the sum of the input row elements and elements of `bias_vector`.

**Example 3: Addition with Incompatible Shapes and Error Handling**

```python
import torch

# Creating two tensors with incompatible shapes
tensor_c = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=torch.float)
tensor_d = torch.tensor([[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]], dtype=torch.float)

try:
    # Attempting addition with incompatible shapes
    result = tensor_c + tensor_d
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Error Encountered:", e)

```

Here, we intentionally create two tensors `tensor_c` of shape (2,2) and `tensor_d` of shape (2, 3). Attempting to add these directly triggers a `RuntimeError`, as their shapes are not compatible, nor do they adhere to broadcasting rules. This illustrates the strict shape requirements enforced by PyTorch and emphasizes the importance of verifying tensor dimensions when performing operations. This runtime error helps to prevent incorrect behavior, which is important during model development.

Regarding resources, the official PyTorch documentation is invaluable. The “Broadcasting semantics” section within the documentation provides a detailed explanation of the rules of broadcasting. Additionally, many online courses focused on deep learning with PyTorch contain sections dedicated to tensors and their manipulation, often offering a slightly less abstract perspective compared to pure documentation. Textbooks that cover PyTorch in detail would also provide excellent context to better understand tensor operations. Further, many tutorial blog posts exist which provide examples of practical applications of tensor broadcasting in context, which has consistently proven invaluable in my work. I recommend exploring multiple resources to gain a more holistic understanding of these concepts.
