Sequential file processing necessitates a careful approach when removing rows containing specific text, primarily due to the inherent inability to directly modify data in place.  My experience working on large-scale log analysis projects has taught me the crucial importance of employing efficient algorithms and avoiding in-memory bottlenecks when handling potentially massive datasets stored in this format.  The solution invariably involves reading the file, filtering out undesired rows, and then writing the modified content to a new file.  This process necessitates careful handling of file I/O and efficient string manipulation for optimal performance.

**1.  Explanation of the Process**

The algorithm for deleting rows based on specific text in a sequential file generally follows these steps:

1. **File Opening and Initialization:** The input sequential file is opened in read mode. An output file is created in write mode to store the filtered data.  Error handling is critical here; anticipating potential file access issues is paramount.

2. **Row-by-Row Processing:**  The input file is processed line by line using an appropriate method (e.g., `readline()` in Python, `fgets()` in C, or equivalent methods in other languages).  Each line represents a row in the file.

3. **Text Matching and Filtering:**  Each row is checked for the presence of the specified text using a suitable string matching technique (e.g., `str.find()` or regular expressions).  If the text is found, the row is discarded; otherwise, it is written to the output file.  The choice of string matching method depends on the complexity of the search pattern.  Regular expressions offer flexibility for more intricate patterns, but might introduce a performance overhead compared to simpler string functions.

4. **Output File Writing:**  Rows that do not contain the target text are written to the output file. This operation ensures that the modified data is persistently stored.

5. **File Closing:**  Both the input and output files are closed after processing to release system resources and ensure data integrity.  This step prevents data corruption and unexpected behavior.

This approach avoids the complexity of in-place modification, inherently simpler for sequential files.  The efficiency of the process depends heavily on the chosen string matching algorithm and optimized file I/O operations.  Minimizing repeated disk access is particularly beneficial when handling large files.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Here are three examples demonstrating the process using different programming languages and string matching techniques:

**a) Python using `str.find()`:**

```python
def delete_rows_with_text(input_file, output_file, target_text):
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as infile, open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
            for line in infile:
                if target_text not in line:
                    outfile.write(line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


input_filename = "my_data.txt"
output_filename = "filtered_data.txt"
text_to_delete = "error"

delete_rows_with_text(input_filename, output_filename, text_to_delete)

```

This Python example utilizes the simple and efficient `str.find()` method for string matching. The `try-except` block handles potential file errors gracefully.  It's straightforward and suitable for simpler scenarios.

**b) C using `strstr()` and manual file handling:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    FILE *infile, *outfile;
    char line[256];
    const char *target_text = "error";

    infile = fopen("my_data.txt", "r");
    if (infile == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening input file");
        return 1;
    }

    outfile = fopen("filtered_data.txt", "w");
    if (outfile == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening output file");
        fclose(infile);
        return 1;
    }

    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), infile) != NULL) {
        if (strstr(line, target_text) == NULL) {
            fputs(line, outfile);
        }
    }

    fclose(infile);
    fclose(outfile);
    return 0;
}
```

This C example demonstrates manual file handling and utilizes `strstr()` for string matching.  Error handling is explicitly implemented, demonstrating best practices for robust file operations in C.  It's more verbose but provides finer control over memory management.

**c)  Perl using regular expressions:**

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input_file = "my_data.txt";
my $output_file = "filtered_data.txt";
my $pattern = qr/error/; # Using a regular expression for flexibility

open(my $IN, "<", $input_file) or die "Could not open input file '$input_file' $!";
open(my $OUT, ">", $output_file) or die "Could not open output file '$output_file' $!";

while (my $line = <$IN>) {
    next if $line =~ $pattern;  # Skip lines matching the pattern
    print $OUT $line;
}

close $IN;
close $OUT;
```

This Perl script leverages Perl's powerful regular expression engine for pattern matching. The `qr//` operator creates a compiled regular expression for efficiency.  The `next` statement elegantly skips lines matching the pattern.  Perl's concise syntax makes this a relatively compact solution.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding of file I/O and string manipulation, I recommend consulting standard textbooks and documentation on your chosen programming language.  Thorough examination of your language's standard library functions related to file handling and string manipulation is crucial.  Additionally, resources detailing efficient algorithm design and data structures will prove invaluable for optimizing the process, especially when working with exceptionally large files.  Familiarizing yourself with error handling best practices will improve the robustness of your code.
