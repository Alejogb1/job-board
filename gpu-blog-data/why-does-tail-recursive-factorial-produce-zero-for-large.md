Tail recursion, while theoretically capable of optimizing factorial calculations, frequently encounters limitations in practice, particularly concerning stack overflow errors for large inputs. This is not inherently a flaw within the tail-recursive algorithm itself, but rather a consequence of the implementation details within the compiler or interpreter.  My experience debugging embedded systems code highlighted this issue repeatedly. The problem stems from the finite nature of the call stack, even when utilizing tail call optimization.

**1. Explanation:**

A tail-recursive function is one where the recursive call is the very last operation performed.  Optimizing compilers *can* transform this into iterative code, effectively eliminating the need for a new stack frame for each recursive call.  The function’s return value is directly determined by the recursive call.  This contrasts with non-tail-recursive functions, where additional operations follow the recursive call (e.g., adding the result of the recursive call to another value).  In those cases, a stack frame is necessary to store intermediate values before the function can return.

The factorial function, defined recursively as `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)`, is not inherently tail-recursive.  The multiplication `n *` occurs *after* the recursive call to `factorial(n-1)`.  To make it tail-recursive, we need to refactor it.  We typically achieve this by accumulating the result in an accumulator parameter, passed along with the recursive call.  This accumulator holds the intermediate product at each step.

However, even with a perfectly tail-recursive factorial implementation, a limit exists. While the theoretical benefit of eliminating stack growth for each call is there, the *practical* realization depends on the compiler's optimization capabilities and the system's available stack space. If the compiler *doesn't* perform tail call optimization (TCO) – a common occurrence in some languages or compiler configurations – the stack still grows with each recursive call, leading to a stack overflow for sufficiently large inputs.  The zero result you're observing is often a consequence of this overflow, causing unpredictable behavior, which in my past experience manifested as seemingly arbitrary return values, including zero.  Sometimes, a segmentation fault or other abrupt program termination is encountered instead.

**2. Code Examples:**

Here are three examples demonstrating this behavior, written in Python, Scheme, and C++.  Note that Python and C++ often do *not* perform TCO aggressively, while Scheme implementations often do.

**Example 1: Python (Non-tail-recursive, demonstrating stack overflow):**

```python
def factorial_non_tail(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial_non_tail(n - 1)

try:
    result = factorial_non_tail(1000)  # Likely to cause RecursionError
    print(result)
except RecursionError as e:
    print(f"RecursionError: {e}")
```

This Python example is inherently non-tail-recursive.  The multiplication `n *` is performed after the recursive call, requiring a new stack frame for each step, resulting in a `RecursionError` for sufficiently large `n`.


**Example 2: Scheme (Tail-recursive, often optimized):**

```scheme
(define (factorial-tail n acc)
  (if (= n 0)
      acc
      (factorial-tail (- n 1) (* n acc))))

(display (factorial-tail 1000 1))  ;May or may not work depending on the Scheme implementation
(newline)
```

Scheme, known for its functional programming paradigm and support for tail call optimization, offers a cleaner, tail-recursive implementation. The `factorial-tail` function utilizes an accumulator `acc`.  However, even in Scheme, there's a practical limit to the size of the integer that can be handled, leading to potential overflow errors before the stack limit is reached.  The outcome depends on whether the Scheme interpreter optimizes tail calls and the size limits of its integer representation.


**Example 3: C++ (Tail-recursive, may not be optimized):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

long long factorial_tail(long long n, long long acc) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return acc;
    } else {
        return factorial_tail(n - 1, n * acc);
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        long long result = factorial_tail(1000, 1);
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ example is tail-recursive, but standard C++ compilers might not perform TCO reliably.  The `long long` data type is used to increase the range of representable integers, mitigating the risk of integer overflow for moderately large inputs. Still, the stack could overflow for extremely large values of `n`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of tail recursion and its optimization, I recommend consulting advanced texts on compiler design and functional programming languages. Look into materials discussing the specifics of stack frames, activation records, and call conventions, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanism of function calls and the limitations of TCO implementations. Studying the language-specific documentation for your compiler is essential as the details of tail call optimization (whether it is implemented, its limitations, and potential configurations) vary across implementations.  Exploring the intricacies of different programming language runtimes will provide further insights into how function calls are managed and the potential for optimization.  Finally, investigating the theoretical models of computation, such as lambda calculus, can provide an abstract but illuminating view on the essence of recursion and its implications for program execution.
