The "starting container failed: su…" error during Docker stack deployment almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the user specified in the Dockerfile's `USER` instruction and the user expected by the application running within the container.  This often arises from a failure to correctly manage user and group IDs within the image's context, leading to permission errors during execution.  My experience debugging similar issues across hundreds of microservices deployments has consistently highlighted this as the root cause, even when seemingly unrelated error messages initially obfuscate the problem.


**1.  A Clear Explanation**

The `su` command, which stands for "substitute user," is frequently used within Dockerfiles or entrypoint scripts to switch to a non-root user after the initial setup phase.  This is a crucial security best practice, limiting the potential damage from vulnerabilities within the running application. However, if the specified user doesn't exist within the container's filesystem, or lacks the necessary permissions for accessing files or directories, the `su` command will fail, resulting in the "starting container failed: su…" error.


This failure can manifest in several ways. The most common scenarios include:

* **Non-existent user:** The Dockerfile might specify a user that hasn't been created within the image.  This is often due to incorrect `RUN useradd` commands or missing steps in the Dockerfile's build process.
* **Incorrect user ID/GID:** The `useradd` command might create the user with a different numerical ID than expected by the application.  This can happen if the ID is hardcoded within the application's configuration files or scripts without corresponding changes in the container's user management.
* **Permission issues:** Even if the user exists, it may lack ownership or execute permissions on necessary files or directories. This often surfaces after a Dockerfile updates file permissions without sufficient attention to the user context.
* **Incorrect `USER` instruction placement:**  The `USER` instruction in the Dockerfile must be placed after all commands requiring root privileges.  Placing it too early will result in subsequent commands failing due to insufficient privileges.

Troubleshooting requires careful examination of the Dockerfile, the application's configuration, and the container's filesystem.  Inspecting the container's logs using `docker logs <container_id>` is essential to understanding the precise nature of the failure beyond the generic error message.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect User Creation**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# INCORRECT: missing group creation
RUN useradd -m appuser

# ... other commands ...

USER appuser

CMD ["/app/my-application"]
```

This Dockerfile attempts to create a user `appuser`, but misses a crucial step: creating the associated group.  This will often lead to permission errors when the application attempts to write to files or directories.  The corrected version should include group creation:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN groupadd -g 1001 appgroup && useradd -m -g appgroup -u 1001 appuser

# ... other commands ...

USER appuser

CMD ["/app/my-application"]
```

This revised version explicitly creates the `appgroup` with GID 1001 and adds the `appuser` to it, ensuring consistent user and group management. The use of explicit IDs avoids potential conflicts with other users in the system.


**Example 2: Incorrect User ID/GID Mismatch**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser

COPY my-application /app

# ... other commands ...

USER appuser

CMD ["/app/my-application"]
```

This Dockerfile creates `appuser` with UID 1000. If `my-application` expects a different UID,  it will fail.  For instance, if `my-application`'s configuration assumes UID 1001, the container will fail to start. The solution involves consistently managing the UID throughout the application's configuration and the Dockerfile's `useradd` command.


**Example 3: Permission Issues**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN useradd -m appuser
COPY my-application /app
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app

# ... other commands ...

USER appuser

CMD ["/app/my-application"]
```

Even with a correctly created user, permissions can still be an issue.  In this example, the `chown` command is crucial for setting correct ownership of the application directory. Omitting this or incorrectly specifying ownership could prevent the `appuser` from executing the application.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

To further solidify your understanding, I recommend consulting the official Docker documentation on Dockerfiles and user management.  The relevant sections on `USER`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `chown`, and `useradd` are fundamental.  Thoroughly review best practices for container security, especially related to running applications as non-root users. Finally, consult documentation on your specific application's deployment requirements, paying close attention to user and permission configurations.  Careful analysis of log files and error messages, coupled with a methodical approach to troubleshooting, will be your most valuable tools in resolving such deployment issues.  The importance of rigorous testing and validation in a staging environment before production deployment cannot be overstated.
