The "Could not compute output KerasTensor" error in a multi-input Keras model typically stems from an inconsistency between the expected input shapes and the shapes of the data actually fed to the model during inference or prediction.  This is a problem I've encountered frequently in my work on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects, often masked by seemingly correct model architecture.  The core issue lies in the precise definition and handling of input tensors, and failing to address this leads to propagation errors within the computational graph.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Keras models, especially those with multiple inputs, rely heavily on consistent data dimensionality.  The `model.predict()` method expects a list or tuple of NumPy arrays, each corresponding to a specific input branch defined during model compilation.  The shape of each array in this list must precisely match the `input_shape` parameter specified when defining each input layer.  A mismatch, even in a single dimension (batch size is often a source of discrepancy), leads to the “Could not compute output KerasTensor” error.  The error doesn't explicitly point to the specific input causing the problem; the underlying computation graph simply fails due to shape incompatibility preventing any meaningful operation.

Further complicating the issue is the way Keras handles batch processing.  While a single input sample might have a shape that aligns with the expected input shape of an individual layer, the same model applied to a batch of samples needs to be provided with a batch dimension prepended to each input array.  This is a frequent source of confusion and a major cause of this specific error.  For instance, if an image input layer expects `(height, width, channels)`, then the input for a batch of `n` images should have a shape of `(n, height, width, channels)`.  Similar principles apply to other data types.

Furthermore, the problem can also arise from incorrect data preprocessing. If your input data undergoes transformations (e.g., normalization, scaling, one-hot encoding) that alter the shape or type of the tensors, and these transformations aren't consistently applied across all inputs or during both training and prediction, you'll almost certainly encounter this error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Batch Size:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple multi-input model
input_a = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = keras.Input(shape=(20,))
x = keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Incorrect input: Single sample instead of a batch
input_a_data = tf.random.normal((10,))  # Shape (10,) - Missing Batch Dimension
input_b_data = tf.random.normal((20,))  # Shape (20,) - Missing Batch Dimension

try:
    predictions = model.predict([input_a_data, input_b_data])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #This will produce the "Could not compute output KerasTensor" error.

# Correct input: Batch of samples
input_a_data = tf.random.normal((32, 10))  # Shape (32, 10) - Correct Batch Dimension
input_b_data = tf.random.normal((32, 20))  # Shape (32, 20) - Correct Batch Dimension
predictions = model.predict([input_a_data, input_b_data])
print(predictions.shape)  # Output: (32, 1)

```
This example highlights the crucial role of the batch dimension.  Failing to include it results in a shape mismatch, leading to the error.


**Example 2: Mismatched Input Shapes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_a = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = keras.Input(shape=(20,))
x = keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Incorrect input: Mismatched shapes
input_a_data = tf.random.normal((32, 10))
input_b_data = tf.random.normal((32, 15))  # Incorrect shape: should be (32, 20)

try:
    predictions = model.predict([input_a_data, input_b_data])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # This will produce the error


# Correct input: Matching shapes
input_a_data = tf.random.normal((32, 10))
input_b_data = tf.random.normal((32, 20))
predictions = model.predict([input_a_data, input_b_data])
print(predictions.shape)  # Output: (32, 1)

```

Here, the shapes of the input arrays don't conform to what the model expects.  Input `b` has an incorrect second dimension, causing the error.


**Example 3: Data Preprocessing Discrepancy:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Define the model
input_a = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training data
train_a = np.random.rand(100, 10)
train_b = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Prediction data with incorrect scaling
test_a = np.random.rand(10, 10) * 2 #Scaled differently
test_b = np.random.rand(10, 10)

try:
    predictions = model.predict([test_a, test_b])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #This may or may not produce the error depending on Keras version and how it handles this case.  In practice it could be more subtle, perhaps with poor predictions rather than an immediate error.


# Correct prediction data (ensure consistent scaling and preprocessing)
test_a = np.random.rand(10, 10)
test_b = np.random.rand(10, 10)
predictions = model.predict([test_a, test_b])
print(predictions.shape)  # Output: (10, 1)
```

This example showcases how inconsistent preprocessing (scaling in this case) can indirectly lead to unexpected behavior, which may manifest as this error, particularly if there are numerical stability issues in the model's underlying calculations. While not a guaranteed cause, it highlights the potential for data handling problems to surface in this manner.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation provides comprehensive details on model building, input handling, and troubleshooting.  Consult the section specifically on multi-input models.  Examining tutorials and examples focusing on building and using multi-input models with various data types will be highly beneficial.  Moreover, carefully reviewing TensorFlow's documentation on tensor manipulation and the specifics of the `tf.data` API for efficient data handling will contribute to a deeper understanding.  Finally, mastering basic NumPy array manipulation and understanding its broadcasting rules is crucial for efficiently handling input data and avoiding shape-related errors.
