The consistent output from your PyTorch RNN across distinct time series inputs strongly suggests a problem within the model's architecture or training process, rather than inherent limitations of recurrent networks themselves.  In my experience debugging similar issues over the past five years developing financial time series prediction models, the most common culprits are a lack of proper state initialization, an inappropriate activation function within the recurrent layer, or insufficient training data leading to collapsed gradients.  Let's examine these possibilities systematically.

**1.  State Initialization:**

RNNs maintain an internal hidden state that evolves across time steps.  Incorrect initialization can lead to all inputs converging to the same final state, regardless of their individual characteristics.  A common mistake is initializing the hidden state to a constant value for every input sequence.  This eliminates the ability of the RNN to differentiate between inputs, as the initial conditions are identical. The hidden state should instead be initialized randomly or to a zero vector *for each new sequence*.  Failing to do so effectively renders the recurrent connections useless.

**2. Activation Function Selection:**

The choice of activation function in the recurrent layer significantly influences the model's ability to learn complex temporal dependencies.  Certain activation functions, particularly those with a limited range or a tendency towards saturation, can hinder gradient flow during training.  If gradients consistently vanish or explode, the network struggles to update its weights effectively, leading to identical outputs for diverse inputs.   In this case, the model effectively memorizes only its initial conditions rather than learning the temporal patterns of the input.  The tanh activation, while common, can be prone to this effect if the network isn't carefully designed or trained.  Relu, while potentially addressing the vanishing gradient problem, can suffer from "dying ReLU" which causes some neurons to effectively stop updating.  A careful evaluation of the activation function and potential alternative functions, like sigmoid, and the effect on the training process is necessary.


**3. Insufficient Training Data or Poor Data Characteristics:**

An inadequate dataset might be insufficient to train the RNN effectively.  If the training data lacks sufficient diversity or contains redundant patterns, the RNN may learn a trivial solution that produces identical outputs, regardless of input variations. This scenario usually manifests as consistently low loss values during training, despite the model performing poorly on unseen data, suggesting overfitting to a limited set of input features. Similarly, high variance in the data, without proper normalization or standardization, can also lead to difficulties in training and similar outputs as the network struggles to discern meaningful patterns amidst the noise.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct State Initialization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Initialize hidden state for each sequence.  Crucially, this is done within the forward pass.
        h0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)  
        out, _ = self.rnn(x, h0) # Pass h0 to RNN
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) # Only take the output from the last timestep.
        return out

# Example usage
input_size = 1
hidden_size = 32
output_size = 1
model = MyRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
input_seq = torch.randn(10,1, input_size) #batch size of 10, sequence length 1
output = model(input_seq)
```

In this example, the crucial line `h0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)` ensures that a zero vector is used to initialize the hidden state for each new sequence in a batch.  The `.to(x.device)` ensures the hidden state is on the same device (CPU or GPU) as the input tensor.  This is vital for preventing unexpected behavior.  Without this, the model will not be able to distinguish between sequences in a batch, leading to identical predictions.


**Example 2: Exploring Different Activation Functions**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, activation):
        super(MyRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, nonlinearity=activation, batch_first=True) # Allow activation specification
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        out, _ = self.rnn(x, h0)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

# Experiment with different activation functions
model_tanh = MyRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, 'tanh')
model_relu = MyRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, 'relu')
model_sigmoid = MyRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, 'sigmoid')

#Train and compare the performance of each model
```
Here, the `nonlinearity` argument within `nn.RNN` allows you to experiment with different activation functions ('tanh', 'relu', 'sigmoid').  Systematic comparison of their impact on training and prediction accuracy is critical for identifying the optimal choice for your specific problem. The training and performance comparison is not explicitly shown here for brevity, but is a crucial step in the debugging process.

**Example 3: Data Preprocessing and Batching**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data - replace with your actual data
data = np.random.rand(100, 10) # 100 samples, each with 10 timesteps

# Normalize data using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1,1)).reshape(data.shape)

# Convert to PyTorch tensor
data_tensor = torch.from_numpy(data_scaled).float()

# Reshape data for RNN input (sequences, batch_size, input_size)
data_tensor = data_tensor.view(100, 10, 1) # Assuming 10 timesteps per input


# ... (rest of your RNN model and training loop) ...
```

This example demonstrates proper data preprocessing.  Before feeding your data to the RNN, it's crucial to normalize or standardize it using techniques like `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn. This prevents features with larger scales from dominating the learning process and helps to ensure the gradients do not blow up during training.  The reshaping operation converts the data into the format required by the RNN: (sequence length, batch size, input size).  Incorrect data formatting can lead to unexpected behaviors. Note that here, we assume 10 timesteps per input, a key aspect of RNN data prep.



**Resource Recommendations:**

* PyTorch documentation.
*  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning.
*  Research papers on RNN architectures and training strategies.


Addressing these points – proper state initialization, suitable activation function, and adequate data preprocessing – should significantly improve the RNN's ability to discriminate between distinct time series inputs and produce meaningful, differentiated outputs.  Remember to monitor training loss and performance metrics meticulously to identify any persisting issues.  Systematic debugging and careful attention to detail are crucial in building robust and effective RNN models.
