The inability of GCC to locate `cuda_runtime.h` despite an explicitly provided include path typically stems from a misalignment between GCC's compilation context and the structure of the CUDA toolkit installation. I've encountered this issue multiple times during GPU-accelerated research projects, and debugging it always boils down to understanding how GCC resolves include paths versus how the CUDA toolkit organizes its headers. This isn't simply a matter of adding the path; the toolkit's include structure and the nuances of GCC's preprocessing come into play.

The root cause is frequently that the directory containing `cuda_runtime.h` isn’t itself the correct include path. The CUDA toolkit often places the relevant header files within a subdirectory of the primary include directory. For instance, the path specified to GCC might be `/usr/local/cuda/include`, but `cuda_runtime.h` resides at `/usr/local/cuda/include/cuda`. Therefore, GCC will fail to find it if it's not pointed at the specific location. Furthermore, symbolic links or incorrect installation settings can also mislead the compiler. It’s critical to verify the exact location of the `cuda_runtime.h` file and to ensure the included path precisely matches the path it’s located on.

The resolution involves identifying the accurate include directory and including that in the compiler command. This isn't always as straightforward as it might seem. The CUDA toolkit, particularly across various versions, can change the directory structure, leading to confusion if not accounted for. We also must distinguish between compilation and linking stages which utilize the include paths at different junctures. Therefore, simply providing include paths to a compiler will not inherently guarantee the availability of the necessary libraries during the linking stage, which we will not be addressing as the question centers on the header file not being found.

Consider the following scenarios and code examples to illustrate the issue and how to correct it.

**Example 1: Incorrect Include Path**

Suppose my CUDA toolkit is installed at `/opt/cuda-12.2/`. My initial compilation attempt might resemble this:

```bash
gcc -I/opt/cuda-12.2/include -c my_cuda_code.c
```

And my `my_cuda_code.c` file includes:

```c
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  // Some CUDA code
  return 0;
}
```

Running this will produce an error stating that `cuda_runtime.h` cannot be found. This is because the actual include directory for CUDA is located within a subdirectory called "cuda".

The correct compilation command is:

```bash
gcc -I/opt/cuda-12.2/include/cuda -c my_cuda_code.c
```

The change here, explicitly referencing `/opt/cuda-12.2/include/cuda`, provides the compiler with the correct location of the `cuda_runtime.h` file which is in the 'cuda' folder below the main include folder. This will resolve the compiler error.

**Example 2: Environment Variable Incorrectly Set**

A common issue, especially when setting up build systems, involves using an environment variable for the include path which might be inaccurate, or even not set. I've seen configurations like:

```bash
export CUDA_INC_DIR=/opt/cuda-12.2/include
gcc -I$CUDA_INC_DIR -c my_cuda_code.c
```

Again, this will fail for the same reasons as the previous example, unless the `CUDA_INC_DIR` variable is correctly set to contain the subdirectory containing 'cuda'. The better approach is to either directly specify the full path including the 'cuda' directory or use a variable that reflects that more directly such as:

```bash
export CUDA_INC_DIR=/opt/cuda-12.2/include/cuda
gcc -I$CUDA_INC_DIR -c my_cuda_code.c
```
or, to remove dependency on an environment variable:

```bash
gcc -I/opt/cuda-12.2/include/cuda -c my_cuda_code.c
```

This demonstrates that while environment variables can simplify builds, they must accurately represent the physical location of the required files. This is not just about CUDA, it applies broadly to other libraries and frameworks. It is also critical to correctly expand these variables. For example, when using Makefiles, the same error can occur if they do not properly reference an environment variable.

**Example 3: Using `-isystem` Instead of `-I`**

While `-I` adds a directory to the include search path, `-isystem` specifies a system include path. The difference is subtle, but crucial for compilation behavior. Using `-isystem` implies that the included files are system headers, changing how the compiler issues warnings and searches for header files. Incorrectly using `-isystem` when `-I` is required can lead to `cuda_runtime.h` not being found due to differences in how these flags inform the preprocessor.

For example, changing the previous examples to use `-isystem`:
```bash
gcc -isystem /opt/cuda-12.2/include/cuda -c my_cuda_code.c
```
In most cases will also result in an error, since `cuda_runtime.h` is not considered a ‘system’ header file and so is not processed. The proper flag for this is `-I` which informs the preprocessor of user header files. Thus, for our purposes, the `-I` flag must be utilized here.

```bash
gcc -I/opt/cuda-12.2/include/cuda -c my_cuda_code.c
```

When working with third-party libraries, including CUDA, it is better to employ `-I`, allowing control over the search path. If you find system headers within the same path, using `-isystem` at the top of your search path may be appropriate.

In my experience, meticulously checking the CUDA toolkit's installation path and ensuring that the compiler is given the full, correct include path is the primary way to prevent these errors. Using a combination of direct file path verification and consistent environment variable usage ensures the build process proceeds smoothly. This practice reduces the debugging overhead significantly.

To ensure a robust development process, several resources can provide deeper understanding of include paths, and best practices.  Consulting the GCC documentation detailing include search paths and options can provide a comprehensive understanding of the compiler's behavior. The official CUDA toolkit documentation includes detailed descriptions of header file locations and correct environment variables, along with information on building CUDA applications. Furthermore, exploring standard C/C++ textbooks will clarify preprocessor directives and the role of include paths in the overall compilation process. These resources provide a strong base of knowledge for handling library include paths and other related issues.
