The core challenge in using one image per color channel as input for ResNet50 lies in the network's expectation of a standard RGB image format.  ResNet50, and most convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are designed to process images represented as a three-dimensional tensor where the dimensions correspond to height, width, and channels (typically RGB).  Providing three separate images necessitates a preprocessing step to combine them into a single, appropriately formatted input tensor.  This isn't a trivial task, as naive concatenation or averaging will likely lead to poor performance and inaccurate results.  My experience working on hyperspectral image classification projects highlights the importance of careful channel alignment and potential for data augmentation to mitigate inherent biases arising from this unconventional input method.

**1.  Explanation:**

The solution involves constructing a composite image from the three individual input images, one for each R, G, and B channel.  Directly feeding three separate images to ResNet50 will result in an error because the network's input layer is designed for a single three-channel image.  We must therefore create this single image.  Simple averaging or concatenation is inadequate because it ignores the inherent spatial relationships between the information contained within each image.  Instead, the process should ensure each image correctly populates its respective channel within the final RGB image.

This requires careful consideration of the spatial alignment of the three input images.  Imperfect alignment, even slight variations, will introduce artifacts and negatively impact the network's ability to learn meaningful features.  Preprocessing steps to ensure pixel-perfect alignment, possibly using image registration techniques, are crucial.  Furthermore,  if the input images are not of the same size, resizing or padding is necessary prior to combination, maintaining consistent aspect ratios to prevent distortions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize Python with libraries like OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy.  I've utilized these extensively in my past projects for their efficiency and broad applicability.  Note that error handling and more robust alignment techniques are omitted for brevity, but are critical in real-world applications.


**Example 1: Basic Channel Combination (Assuming perfect alignment and equal dimensions):**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def combine_channels(red_img_path, green_img_path, blue_img_path):
    red = cv2.imread(red_img_path)
    green = cv2.imread(green_img_path)
    blue = cv2.imread(blue_img_path)

    #Check for size consistency.  A more robust solution would handle different sizes.
    if red.shape != green.shape or red.shape != blue.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input images must have the same dimensions")


    #Convert to RGB.  Assumption: images loaded in grayscale. Adjust as needed.
    red = cv2.cvtColor(red, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    green = cv2.cvtColor(green, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    blue = cv2.cvtColor(blue, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)

    # Extract individual channels
    b, g, r = cv2.split(red)
    b1, g1, r1 = cv2.split(green)
    b2, g2, r2 = cv2.split(blue)

    # Construct RGB image; assuming each input image represents one channel.
    merged_image = cv2.merge([b, g1, r2])

    return merged_image

#Example usage:
combined_image = combine_channels("red_image.jpg", "green_image.jpg", "blue_image.jpg")
cv2.imshow("Combined Image", combined_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```

This example demonstrates a straightforward approach. The critical step is `cv2.merge()`, which combines the channels into a single RGB image.  Error handling for size inconsistencies and different color spaces should be incorporated in a production environment.


**Example 2: Handling Size Discrepancies using resizing:**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def combine_channels_resize(red_img_path, green_img_path, blue_img_path, target_size=(224, 224)):
    red = cv2.imread(red_img_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    green = cv2.imread(green_img_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    blue = cv2.imread(blue_img_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

    # Resize images to target size
    red = cv2.resize(red, target_size)
    green = cv2.resize(green, target_size)
    blue = cv2.resize(blue, target_size)

    #Replicate Example 1's merging logic here.
    red = cv2.cvtColor(red, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    green = cv2.cvtColor(green, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    blue = cv2.cvtColor(blue, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    b, g, r = cv2.split(red)
    b1, g1, r1 = cv2.split(green)
    b2, g2, r2 = cv2.split(blue)
    merged_image = cv2.merge([b, g1, r2])

    return merged_image

# Example Usage
combined_image = combine_channels_resize("red_image.jpg", "green_image.jpg", "blue_image.jpg")
cv2.imshow("Combined Image", combined_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```

This example addresses size inconsistencies by resizing all images to a common `target_size`, a parameter that needs careful consideration based on the ResNet50 architecture and expected input dimensions.  Bicubic or other high-quality interpolation methods should be preferred over nearest-neighbor for better image quality.


**Example 3: Incorporating Data Augmentation:**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# ... (combine_channels function from Example 1 or 2) ...

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

# Assuming 'combined_image' is the result from combine_channels
combined_image = np.expand_dims(combined_image, axis=0) #Add batch dimension

it = datagen.flow(combined_image, batch_size=1)

for i in range(5): # Generate 5 augmented images
    augmented_image = it.next()[0]
    cv2.imshow(f"Augmented Image {i+1}", augmented_image.astype(np.uint8))
    cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This expands upon the previous examples by integrating Keras' ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation.  This is crucial for improving model robustness and generalisation, especially when dealing with limited training data or potential biases introduced by the three-separate-image input method.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of CNN architectures, I recommend "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  For OpenCV and image processing techniques, any comprehensive OpenCV tutorial would be beneficial.  Finally, the Keras documentation provides excellent resources for data augmentation and image preprocessing within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra and image processing fundamentals will also prove highly valuable.
