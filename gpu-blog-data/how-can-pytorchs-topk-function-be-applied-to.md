PyTorch's `topk` function, while powerful for retrieving the largest (or smallest) k elements within a tensor, operates across the entire tensor or along a single, specified dimension. Applying it to *every* tensor along a specific dimension requires a different approach involving tensor manipulation, typically involving iteration or a more efficient vectorized operation. I've encountered this need while working on time-series analysis, where I had to identify the top 'k' peaks within each individual time series.

The core problem stems from `torch.topk`'s fundamental design. When applied directly along a single dimension, say dimension `n`, it returns *one* set of top 'k' values and indices, effectively collapsing the other dimensions. For example, given a tensor of shape `(batch, time, channels)`, calling `torch.topk(input, k, dim=1)` would return the top 'k' time steps *aggregated* across the entire batch and channel dimensions. If we want the top 'k' along time for *each* batch and channel combination individually, further steps are required.

The most straightforward approach, which I used early in my project, involves explicit iteration. We iterate through all other dimensions *except* the one where we want to apply `topk`, slicing the input tensor along that dimension, applying `topk`, and storing the results. While conceptually simple, this approach suffers from performance drawbacks, particularly for large tensors, as it introduces considerable Python overhead. The key here is to understand that tensor slicing generates *views* to the original tensor, and therefore, while you are indexing and operating within a slice, this does not cause duplication of data.

Here's an initial code example demonstrating this iterative approach:

```python
import torch

def topk_per_dim_iterative(input_tensor, k, dim):
  """
  Applies torch.topk to each tensor along the specified dimension iteratively.

  Args:
    input_tensor: The input tensor.
    k: The number of top elements to retrieve.
    dim: The dimension to apply topk along.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the top values and their indices, each shaped 
    the same as the input tensor with the target dimension reduced to k.
  """

  dims = list(range(len(input_tensor.shape)))
  dims.pop(dim)
  output_values = []
  output_indices = []

  for indices in torch.cartesian_prod(*[torch.arange(input_tensor.shape[d]) for d in dims]):
    indexed_slice = input_tensor[tuple(indices.tolist() + [slice(None)])]
    values, indices_k = torch.topk(indexed_slice, k)
    output_values.append(values)
    output_indices.append(indices_k)

  output_values = torch.stack(output_values).reshape(input_tensor.shape[:dim] + (k,) + input_tensor.shape[dim+1:])
  output_indices = torch.stack(output_indices).reshape(input_tensor.shape[:dim] + (k,) + input_tensor.shape[dim+1:])
  return output_values, output_indices

# Example Usage
tensor = torch.randn(2, 5, 3)
k = 2
dim_to_apply = 1
top_values, top_indices = topk_per_dim_iterative(tensor, k, dim_to_apply)

print("Input Tensor Shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Top Values Shape:", top_values.shape)
print("Top Indices Shape:", top_indices.shape)
```

In this example, the `topk_per_dim_iterative` function calculates the cartesian product of indices for the dimensions we're *not* applying topk to. It then uses each combination of those indices to get a 1-D slice along the specified dimension `dim`. The `torch.topk` function is applied to this 1-D slice. These top-k values are then stacked and reshaped back to match the input with the dimension `dim` replaced by `k`. While this works, the performance is significantly constrained by the explicit for-loop in Python.

A more efficient approach that I transitioned to in my project, avoids explicit Python loops by leveraging PyTorch’s vectorized operations using `torch.reshape` and `torch.topk`. The idea is to first reshape the tensor such that the target dimension where we want to apply `topk` becomes the last dimension, while combining all other dimensions into a single dimension. Then, `topk` is called once across this combined dimension. Finally, we undo the initial reshape to restore the tensor to its original structure. This allows us to fully exploit the underlying, optimized C++ implementations of PyTorch’s core operations.

Here's an example demonstrating this vectorized approach:

```python
import torch

def topk_per_dim_vectorized(input_tensor, k, dim):
  """
  Applies torch.topk to each tensor along the specified dimension in a vectorized manner.

  Args:
    input_tensor: The input tensor.
    k: The number of top elements to retrieve.
    dim: The dimension to apply topk along.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the top values and their indices, each shaped
    the same as the input tensor with the target dimension reduced to k.
  """
  original_shape = list(input_tensor.shape)
  dim_size = original_shape[dim]
  new_shape = original_shape[:dim] + original_shape[dim+1:]

  permuted_tensor = input_tensor.permute(
        [d for d in range(len(original_shape)) if d != dim] + [dim])
  reshaped_tensor = permuted_tensor.reshape(-1, dim_size)

  top_values, top_indices = torch.topk(reshaped_tensor, k, dim=1)

  output_values = top_values.reshape(new_shape + (k,))
  output_indices = top_indices.reshape(new_shape + (k,))
  
  output_values = output_values.permute(
       [len(output_values.shape) -1] + [d for d in range(len(output_values.shape) - 1) if d < dim] + [d for d in range(len(output_values.shape) - 1) if d >= dim])
  output_indices = output_indices.permute(
       [len(output_indices.shape) - 1] + [d for d in range(len(output_indices.shape) - 1) if d < dim] + [d for d in range(len(output_indices.shape) - 1) if d >= dim])

  return output_values, output_indices

# Example usage
tensor = torch.randn(2, 5, 3, 4)
k = 2
dim_to_apply = 2
top_values, top_indices = topk_per_dim_vectorized(tensor, k, dim_to_apply)

print("Input Tensor Shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Top Values Shape:", top_values.shape)
print("Top Indices Shape:", top_indices.shape)
```

Here, `topk_per_dim_vectorized` first moves the `dim` to be the last in the tensor by using `.permute`. It then reshapes the tensor to have dimensions other than the target dimension along the first axis, and the target dimension along the second. The function then calls `torch.topk` on axis 1 (which was the `dim` of the original tensor). It then undoes the reshape and the permutation to restore the dimensions in the proper place.  This is significantly faster as `torch.topk` is done with batch-based tensor operations.

An alternative, which I found particularly useful when using CUDA tensors due to specific memory layout optimizations, is to use `torch.vmap`. The `vmap` function vectorizes operations over a dimension, applying the function to the slices of the dimension rather than to the entire tensor.

Here's a third example, this time incorporating `torch.vmap`:

```python
import torch

def topk_per_dim_vmap(input_tensor, k, dim):
    """
    Applies torch.topk to each tensor along the specified dimension using vmap.

    Args:
      input_tensor: The input tensor.
      k: The number of top elements to retrieve.
      dim: The dimension to apply topk along.

    Returns:
      A tuple containing the top values and their indices, each shaped 
      the same as the input tensor with the target dimension reduced to k.
    """

    def topk_fn(x):
      return torch.topk(x, k)

    output_values, output_indices = torch.vmap(topk_fn, in_dims=dim)(input_tensor)

    return output_values, output_indices

# Example Usage
tensor = torch.randn(2, 5, 3, 4)
k = 2
dim_to_apply = 1
top_values, top_indices = topk_per_dim_vmap(tensor, k, dim_to_apply)

print("Input Tensor Shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Top Values Shape:", top_values.shape)
print("Top Indices Shape:", top_indices.shape)
```

This `topk_per_dim_vmap` function uses `torch.vmap` which maps the function `topk_fn` which is just a simple wrapper around `torch.topk` across dimension `dim` of the input tensor. This is a more high-level way to specify the batching structure of the `topk` operation, which may be more readable in certain contexts.

For further study into efficient tensor operations, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation, especially functions related to reshaping, permuting, and advanced indexing. Specific information regarding vectorization techniques within PyTorch (including `vmap`) would also be useful. Furthermore, resources that discuss performance optimization for deep learning models, which often involve working with large tensors, can also provide a good conceptual framework for approaching these kinds of problems.
