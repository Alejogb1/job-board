The crucial aspect in structuring a Keras LSTM model for multiclass classification lies in appropriately handling the output layer.  While the recurrent nature of LSTMs excels at processing sequential data, the final classification necessitates a specific output activation and loss function tailored for multiple classes.  I've spent considerable time optimizing such models for sentiment analysis tasks involving nuanced emotional classifications, and this experience highlights the critical importance of this detail.  Ignoring it often leads to suboptimal performance and misinterpretations of the model's predictions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Keras LSTM model for multiclass classification involves three principal components: the input layer, the recurrent LSTM layers, and the output layer.  The input layer accepts sequential data, typically represented as a NumPy array of shape (samples, timesteps, features).  'Samples' refers to the number of data points, 'timesteps' denotes the length of each sequence, and 'features' represents the dimensionality of each time step.  For example, in text classification, each sample might be a sentence, each timestep a word, and each feature a word embedding dimension.

The LSTM layers process this sequential data, learning temporal dependencies within the sequences.  Multiple LSTM layers can be stacked to capture more complex patterns.  Each LSTM layer consists of numerous LSTM cells, each performing computations to update its internal state based on the current input and previous states.  These layers are crucial for extracting meaningful representations from the input sequences.  Hyperparameter tuning, particularly the number of LSTM units (neurons) per layer and the number of layers, is critical for model performance and requires experimentation based on dataset characteristics.

The output layer is the key differentiator for multiclass classification.  It must produce a probability distribution over the possible classes. This necessitates a dense layer with the number of units equal to the number of classes. The activation function of this layer must be 'softmax'.  The 'softmax' function normalizes the output into a probability distribution, ensuring that the sum of probabilities across all classes equals 1.  This is vital for interpreting the model's predictions as class probabilities. The loss function should be 'categorical_crossentropy', which measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true class labels (represented using one-hot encoding).

Using other activation functions, like sigmoid (binary classification) or linear (regression), in the output layer will lead to incorrect results for multiclass classification. Similarly, employing loss functions such as binary_crossentropy (binary classification) or mean_squared_error (regression) will yield improper training dynamics and inaccurate predictions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Multiclass LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=64, input_length=100), # Example embedding layer
    keras.layers.LSTM(128),
    keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax') # num_classes represents the number of classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward LSTM model. An embedding layer converts integer sequences (like word indices) into dense vector representations.  The LSTM layer processes the embedded sequences, and the dense layer with softmax activation produces class probabilities.  'categorical_crossentropy' is the appropriate loss function for multiclass classification with one-hot encoded labels.

**Example 2: Stacked LSTM with Dropout**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128, input_length=200),
    keras.layers.LSTM(256, return_sequences=True),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2), #Adding dropout for regularization
    keras.layers.LSTM(128),
    keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Here, we use stacked LSTMs to capture higher-order dependencies. `return_sequences=True` in the first LSTM layer is crucial for passing the full sequence output to the subsequent layer.  Dropout is included to prevent overfitting, a common problem in deep learning models.  The optimizer is changed to RMSprop, known for its effectiveness in recurrent neural networks.


**Example 3: Bidirectional LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=5000, output_dim=64, input_length=150),
    keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.LSTM(64)),
    keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example employs a bidirectional LSTM.  A bidirectional LSTM processes the sequence in both forward and backward directions, capturing contextual information from both past and future time steps.  This is particularly useful when temporal context is crucial for accurate classification.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd suggest consulting the official Keras documentation.  Furthermore, studying published research papers on LSTM applications in multiclass classification would be beneficial.  Textbooks dedicated to deep learning and sequence modeling also offer comprehensive information.  Finally, exploring online tutorials and code repositories that demonstrate similar model implementations can provide valuable insights and practical guidance.  Remember to carefully examine the data preprocessing steps, as these significantly impact model performance.  Proper handling of imbalanced datasets, if encountered, requires special attention.  Experimenting with different hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search is also crucial for achieving optimal results.  Thorough validation and testing are indispensable for ensuring the model's generalizability.
