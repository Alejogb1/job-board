Expanding a tensor's dimensionality in PyTorch, specifically from a shape of [a, b] to [a, b, k], fundamentally involves adding a new dimension of size 'k' along the existing tensor's last axis.  This is a common operation in many deep learning applications, particularly when preparing data for convolutional layers or manipulating feature representations. My experience working on large-scale image classification projects has frequently necessitated this type of tensor manipulation.  The efficiency and correctness of this operation are critical for performance optimization.

The most straightforward and generally preferred method involves leveraging PyTorch's `unsqueeze()` function in conjunction with broadcasting or `repeat()`.  Unsuitable approaches include reshaping without proper consideration of memory allocation, as this can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially erroneous computations.  The selected approach must accurately reflect the desired replication or expansion strategy, as simply changing the shape declaration without copying values can lead to unintended sharing of memory, compromising the integrity of further operations.

**1.  Utilizing `unsqueeze()` and Broadcasting:**

This technique leverages PyTorch's broadcasting mechanism. Broadcasting automatically expands dimensions of tensors to make operations compatible.  `unsqueeze()` adds a new dimension at a specified position.  Combining it with the inherent broadcasting behavior allows for efficient expansion without explicit replication.

```python
import torch

a = 2  # Example value for 'a'
b = 3  # Example value for 'b'
k = 4  # Example value for 'k'

# Create a sample tensor
tensor_2d = torch.randn(a, b)

# Expand the tensor to [a, b, k] using unsqueeze() and broadcasting
tensor_3d = tensor_2d.unsqueeze(2) * torch.ones(1, 1, k)

# Verify the shape and values (values will be broadcasted)
print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor_2d.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor shape: {tensor_3d.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor:\n{tensor_3d}")

```

The `unsqueeze(2)` adds a singleton dimension at index 2, effectively creating a shape of [a, b, 1].  The multiplication with `torch.ones(1, 1, k)` then leverages broadcasting to replicate the values along this newly created dimension, resulting in the final [a, b, k] shape.  This approach is memory-efficient because it does not perform explicit data duplication. It directly leverages broadcasting to achieve the dimensionality increase.


**2.  Employing `repeat()` for Explicit Replication:**

In scenarios where broadcasting might be less intuitive or where explicit control over value replication is needed, the `repeat()` function provides a more direct approach.  This method explicitly replicates the data along the new dimension, resulting in a potential increase in memory consumption.

```python
import torch

a = 2
b = 3
k = 4

tensor_2d = torch.randn(a, b)

# Expand the tensor using repeat()
tensor_3d = tensor_2d.repeat(1, 1, k)

print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor_2d.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor shape: {tensor_3d.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor:\n{tensor_3d}")
```

This code uses `repeat(1, 1, k)`. The first two `1`s indicate no replication along the existing dimensions, while `k` specifies the replication count along the newly added dimension. This approach is more transparent if you need to replicate each element `k` times, but it is less efficient concerning memory usage than broadcasting.


**3.  Combining `reshape()` with `unsqueeze()` (for specific expansion cases):**

While generally less preferable due to its potential to introduce subtle errors in data management and its increased complexity, there might be niche cases where a combined approach using `reshape()` and `unsqueeze()` is beneficial, particularly if expansion is coupled with other tensor manipulations.  This approach is more complex and should be approached with caution.

```python
import torch

a = 2
b = 3
k = 4

tensor_2d = torch.randn(a, b)

#Reshape to prepare for efficient unsqueeze operation
tensor_intermediate = tensor_2d.reshape(a, b, 1)

# Expand using unsqueeze to create the desired shape without broadcasting
tensor_3d = tensor_intermediate.repeat(1, 1, k) #Still needs repeat for full expansion


print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor_2d.shape}")
print(f"Intermediate tensor shape: {tensor_intermediate.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor shape: {tensor_3d.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor:\n{tensor_3d}")
```

In this advanced example, I first reshape the original tensor to add a singleton dimension, preparing it for the later `repeat` operation. Although `unsqueeze` is used, a `repeat` is still needed to achieve the complete expansion.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive details on tensor manipulation functions.  Thorough exploration of the `torch` module's functionalities, particularly focusing on functions related to tensor reshaping, indexing, and broadcasting, is crucial.  Reviewing examples in introductory PyTorch tutorials and understanding the nuances of tensor operations is equally important.  Practical experience in implementing and debugging tensor manipulations within larger projects will further enhance your understanding.  These practical exercises combined with thorough documentation reviews offer the best educational path.
