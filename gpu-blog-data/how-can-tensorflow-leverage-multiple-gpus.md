TensorFlow's ability to distribute computation across multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is fundamental for scaling complex deep learning models. I’ve personally witnessed training times reduced from days to hours by effectively leveraging this feature in large-scale image recognition projects. The core mechanism relies on distributing different parts of the model or the data itself across available GPUs, enabling parallel processing and significant speed enhancements.

Essentially, the process involves mapping TensorFlow operations to specific devices. These devices are identified by strings such as `/GPU:0`, `/GPU:1`, etc., representing individual GPUs. TensorFlow's device placement algorithm will often automatically handle this, especially in simple cases, but for more nuanced scenarios, explicit control becomes crucial. This control allows fine-tuning the distribution strategy based on specific network architectures, batch sizes, and available resources.

There are two primary approaches for multi-GPU training: data parallelism and model parallelism. Data parallelism, the more common method, involves replicating the entire model across multiple GPUs, with each GPU processing a distinct subset of the training data. Model parallelism, on the other hand, splits the model itself across different GPUs, which is often utilized when the model is too large to fit on a single GPU.

Data parallelism in TensorFlow is often facilitated through the use of a `tf.distribute.Strategy`. TensorFlow offers different strategies, like `MirroredStrategy` for synchronous training across multiple GPUs on a single machine or `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` for distributed training across multiple machines. When using a `MirroredStrategy`, TensorFlow essentially creates a replica of the model on each GPU. During each training step, gradients are computed on each GPU, aggregated, and then the model weights are updated in synchrony across all replicas. This is a crucial detail; the synchronized updates ensure that all replicas stay consistent throughout training.

Model parallelism, while less common, becomes essential when dealing with massive models that exceed the memory capacity of a single GPU. It requires a deeper understanding of the model architecture and is significantly more complex to implement than data parallelism, involving manually assigning different portions of the model's computational graph to different GPUs. This approach often introduces communication bottlenecks, as data needs to move between devices to complete forward and backward passes, and it typically requires highly specialized code.

Let's explore some practical code examples illustrating data parallelism.

**Example 1: Basic MirroredStrategy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Define the distribution strategy
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# 2. Build the model within the strategy's scope
with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])

  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

# 3. Compile the model (usually not necessary if using custom training loop)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])

# 4. Generate synthetic data for demonstration
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)

# 5. Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=2)
```

This first example demonstrates the most straightforward approach. We define a `MirroredStrategy` which handles the distribution details. By placing the model creation and compilation within the `strategy.scope()`, all subsequent computations are automatically distributed across available GPUs. The `fit` function now seamlessly operates in parallel. In practice, this method works effectively for many workloads where model sizes are manageable.

**Example 2: Using a Custom Training Loop with MirroredStrategy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])

  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

# Convert data into tensorflow datasets
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(128)
distributed_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(dataset)

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(inputs)
      loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

for epoch in range(2):
  for inputs, labels in distributed_dataset:
     loss = strategy.run(train_step, args=(inputs, labels))
     print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss}")
```

Here, a custom training loop provides more flexibility. Crucially, we use `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset` to distribute the input dataset across GPUs. The `tf.function` decorator enables TensorFlow to optimize the computation graph, and the `strategy.run` function ensures that the `train_step` function is executed on each GPU. This structure provides fine-grained control over the training process. This pattern is often preferred for research or when custom manipulations are required within the training loop.

**Example 3: Data Parallelism with Model Checkpointing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])

  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "ckpt")
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model)

(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(128)
distributed_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(dataset)

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(inputs)
      loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

for epoch in range(2):
  for inputs, labels in distributed_dataset:
    loss = strategy.run(train_step, args=(inputs, labels))
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss}")

  checkpoint.save(file_prefix=checkpoint_prefix)
  print(f"Checkpoint saved at {checkpoint_prefix}-{epoch}")

latest = tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)
checkpoint.restore(latest)
print("Checkpoint restored.")
```
This final example incorporates model checkpointing into the multi-GPU training process. This is essential for practical workflows to ensure progress is preserved in case of interruptions and to enable evaluation or further training from specific points. The `tf.train.Checkpoint` class simplifies this process, and restoring a checkpoint works seamlessly, maintaining the distributed state of the model and optimizer. It shows how crucial it is to build practical training pipelines considering interruptions and long periods of training.

In terms of choosing an appropriate strategy, `MirroredStrategy` serves well for single-machine setups with multiple GPUs. When dealing with training over multiple machines, `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` becomes necessary. Additionally, `CentralStorageStrategy` is advantageous when dealing with GPUs that have limited memory as it avoids creating full copies of the model for each replica. Understanding the characteristics of each strategy is fundamental when facing different computational environments. For model parallelism, however, TensorFlow’s direct built-in solutions are less readily available; custom manual device placement and potentially using `tf.device` are often involved.

While TensorFlow streamlines a significant portion of the multi-GPU handling, optimizing performance often necessitates careful consideration of batch sizes. A batch size too small may result in underutilization of the GPUs while an excessively large one may lead to memory overflow. Fine tuning the batch size relative to the memory capacity of each GPU and the specific network architecture remains crucial. Additionally, the choice of communication protocol between GPUs can affect performance. For example, using NVLink for communication instead of PCIe on NVIDIA GPUs can significantly reduce communication bottlenecks.

To enhance one’s knowledge on this topic, it is beneficial to consult official TensorFlow documentation. The TensorFlow website contains comprehensive guides on distributed training and available strategies, and often details best practices for performance optimization. Furthermore, exploring tutorials on the TensorFlow Hub can provide practical implementation insights and real world usage examples. Papers on model parallel training approaches also provide detailed theoretical and practical knowledge on techniques such as pipelining model layers for more efficient parallel training. Additionally, the official TensorFlow tutorial series often contains detailed examples of these practices and may help understand the full scope of the library's capabilities. By combining theoretical understanding with practical application, one can effectively utilize TensorFlow's capabilities for multi-GPU computation.
