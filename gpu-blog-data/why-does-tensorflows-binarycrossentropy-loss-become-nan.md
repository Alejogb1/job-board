TensorFlow’s `BinaryCrossentropy` loss function, a cornerstone for training binary classification models, can surprisingly output `NaN` (Not a Number) values during training, often halting the learning process. This primarily stems from issues arising when the predicted probabilities from your model approach either 0 or 1 extremely closely, particularly in conjunction with the logarithmic operation intrinsic to the cross-entropy calculation. Specifically, the logarithm of zero is undefined, and in a numerical context, approaching zero leads to values that approach negative infinity, which after further calculations can result in `NaN`.

Let me elaborate, drawing from my experience debugging numerous models experiencing this issue. `BinaryCrossentropy` computes the loss based on the following formula for a single data point:

`- (y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p))`.

Here, 'y' represents the true label (0 or 1), and 'p' denotes the predicted probability output by the model for the class associated with label '1'. As you can see, when the predicted probability 'p' becomes close to 0 for a true label of '1' (or close to 1 for a true label of '0'), the `log(p)` (or `log(1 - p)`) term can rapidly diverge to large negative values. These extremely large numbers are problematic, especially given the fixed-precision nature of computer floating-point representations, which can cause them to become undefined during intermediate calculations, resulting in a NaN. Furthermore, these numerical issues are compounded during backpropagation, where gradients are computed; a `NaN` value in the loss function will result in `NaN` gradients, which will render training useless.

Another factor is the numerical instability of standard floating-point operations when dealing with very small values. Consider the `1 - p` term when `p` is very close to 1. Due to how computers represent numbers, the result of this subtraction can be so close to 0 that floating-point errors can further exacerbate the logarithmic issue. TensorFlow, like many numerical computation libraries, does use techniques to mitigate these problems, however these safeguards are not foolproof, and in certain circumstances, `NaN` loss can still emerge.

Now, let's illustrate this with specific code examples.

**Example 1: Unbounded Output**

This first example demonstrates the issue when the raw output from the model isn’t properly bounded between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid activation function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Initialize the model, no sigmoid at the output.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, use_bias=True)
])

# Sample data with extreme predictions (close to 0 and close to a high value)
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Using raw outputs from the linear layer (no sigmoid).
logits = model(x) # logits are the raw predictions

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
loss = loss_fn(y, logits)

print(f"Loss: {loss.numpy()}") # Expect NaN
```
Here, the model predicts unconstrained values; a random initialized weight may result in a very large or small output value on the first pass. When BinaryCrossentropy, using default ‘from_logits’ setting, sees a value that isn't passed through a sigmoid, its assumption about the provided values being probabilities, breaks. It will try to calculate the logarithm of an out-of-range value and fail, resulting in `NaN` output. The lack of a sigmoid layer, which ensures probabilities are within the [0, 1] range is the problem.

**Example 2: Clipping to Avoid Extremes (Improper)**

This demonstrates a misguided attempt to fix this issue using explicit clipping. While clipping values may appear as a fix, it can produce issues for other reasons, notably loss of information and gradient issues.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Sigmoid activation
])

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

logits = model(x)

# Incorrect clipping.
clipped_logits = tf.clip_by_value(logits, clip_value_min=1e-7, clip_value_max=1-1e-7)

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
loss = loss_fn(y, clipped_logits)


print(f"Loss: {loss.numpy()}") # Expect loss but with potential issues
```
In this example, we’ve added the necessary sigmoid activation but then explicitly tried to prevent the values to get to 0 or 1. Using clip_by_value is, while possibly preventing `NaN` loss, not a good solution, due to the following reasons: the gradients will become zero when the clipping occurs, which stops learning, and it may result in a model that's overly biased in its predictions due to the artificial clipping and inability to learn extreme (yet valid) probabilities. This method does prevent the `NaN`, but at the expense of performance.

**Example 3: The Proper Implementation**

This final example illustrates the correct approach using the `from_logits` parameter.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, use_bias=True) # Raw linear output
])

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

logits = model(x)

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
loss = loss_fn(y, logits)

print(f"Loss: {loss.numpy()}") # Expect a valid loss
```

This code uses a raw linear output which is passed directly to the `BinaryCrossentropy` loss. Note the usage of `from_logits=True`, which informs the loss function that the input are unscaled logits and thus the loss function will compute the necessary sigmoid and logarithm in a numerically stable way. This will not result in `NaN`, nor will it interfere with the model's ability to learn.

In summary, the NaN output with `BinaryCrossentropy` loss arises from numerical instability in the computation of `log(p)` when `p` is close to 0 or 1. To address this, *it's crucial to not use any clipping methods*, rather, employ the sigmoid activation function in your model's final layer when using `from_logits=False` or, better, set `from_logits=True` and not use an activation function in the model's final layer allowing TensorFlow to use more numerically stable computation.

For additional information, I would recommend studying resources that explain numerical computation, and specifics related to floating-point errors. Examining the TensorFlow documentation and the source code can also offer further insights. A good book on neural network training, specifically on loss function usage, is invaluable. Studying resources relating to backpropagation can be very helpful in understanding how `NaN` propagate and break the learning process. Lastly, studying numerical optimization will help in understanding numerical issues encountered during training.
