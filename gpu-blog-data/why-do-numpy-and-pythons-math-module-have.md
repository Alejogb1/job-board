The discrepancy in implementation between NumPy's mathematical functions and those found in Python's built-in `math` module stems fundamentally from their target audiences and underlying design philosophies.  While both offer mathematical operations, NumPy is explicitly designed for numerical computation on arrays, prioritizing performance and vectorization, whereas the `math` module focuses on individual scalar operations, emphasizing ease of use for general-purpose programming.  This difference dictates their respective implementations, even when superficially performing similar operations.  In my experience working on large-scale scientific simulations and data analysis projects, understanding this core distinction has been crucial for optimizing performance and selecting the appropriate tool for the task.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `math` module is part of Python's standard library. Its functions are implemented primarily in C, aiming for straightforward functionality and broad accessibility. It operates on single numerical values (scalars) and returns scalar results.  Error handling tends to be simpler, often raising exceptions like `ValueError` or `OverflowError` for invalid input.  This approach prioritizes clarity and ease of use in general-purpose scripting.

Conversely, NumPy leverages highly optimized libraries, most notably BLAS and LAPACK, under the hood.  Its functions are designed for efficient array-based computations.  This necessitates a different approach to implementation.  Instead of handling individual scalar operations, NumPy's functions are written to process entire arrays simultaneously, exploiting vectorization capabilities for significant performance gains.  This parallelism allows for considerable speed improvements, particularly for large datasets, but introduces a layer of complexity in both the implementation and the handling of potential errors (e.g., `nan` values).  Furthermore, NumPy often provides multiple versions of a function, potentially optimized for specific data types or hardware architectures.

The observed differences in results, especially concerning edge cases and handling of non-numeric data, stem directly from these contrasting design goals.  The `math` module might throw an exception for invalid input, while NumPy might propagate `NaN` values, allowing the computation to proceed but flagging problematic elements. The choice between using `math` and NumPy depends entirely on whether you're working with individual numbers or collections of them.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Trigonometric Functions**

```python
import math
import numpy as np

angle_scalar = math.pi / 4
angle_array = np.array([math.pi / 4, math.pi / 2, math.pi])

# math module: scalar operation
result_scalar = math.sin(angle_scalar)  # result: a single float
print(f"Math module sin: {result_scalar}")

# NumPy: array operation
result_array = np.sin(angle_array)  # result: a NumPy array
print(f"NumPy sin: {result_array}")

#Observe that NumPy automatically applies the sine function element-wise to the array, while the math module needs a scalar as input.
```

**Example 2: Logarithmic Functions**

```python
import math
import numpy as np

negative_number = -1.0
numbers = np.array([-1, 0, 1, 2])

# math module: throws ValueError for negative input
try:
    math.log(negative_number)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Math module log error: {e}")

# NumPy: returns complex numbers (or NaN depending on setting) for negative input.
result_np = np.log(numbers)
print(f"NumPy log: {result_np}")
#NumPy's behavior is potentially useful in certain scenarios (complex analysis for example) but requires careful handling. The math module's explicit error is often safer in general-purpose code.
```

**Example 3: Power Function**

```python
import math
import numpy as np

base_scalar = 2
exponent_scalar = 3
base_array = np.array([2, 3, 4])
exponent_array = np.array([3, 2, 1])

# math module: scalar power
result_scalar = math.pow(base_scalar, exponent_scalar)
print(f"Math module pow: {result_scalar}")

# NumPy: element-wise array power
result_array1 = np.power(base_array, exponent_scalar) # Array raised to scalar power
result_array2 = np.power(base_scalar, exponent_array) #Scalar raised to array power
result_array3 = np.power(base_array, exponent_array) #Element-wise array power.

print(f"NumPy array pow (array to scalar): {result_array1}")
print(f"NumPy array pow (scalar to array): {result_array2}")
print(f"NumPy array pow (element-wise): {result_array3}")

# NumPy provides more flexibility by allowing both scalar and array arguments, offering various options for power operations.

```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's internals and performance optimizations, I would recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation, particularly sections dedicated to array operations and data types.  Thorough study of the BLAS and LAPACK libraries, which underpin much of NumPy's numerical computation, is also valuable.   A comprehensive text on numerical methods and linear algebra will further solidify understanding of the underlying mathematical algorithms. For more advanced topics, delving into specialized texts on high-performance computing and parallel algorithms would provide substantial insight.  Finally, studying the source code of both the `math` module and NumPy, while challenging, is the ultimate resource for gaining a detailed comprehension of their inner workings.
