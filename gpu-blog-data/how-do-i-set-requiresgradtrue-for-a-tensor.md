The core difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch regarding gradient tracking lies in their fundamental approaches to automatic differentiation.  PyTorch employs a dynamic computation graph, building the graph on the fly during the forward pass.  TensorFlow, conversely, defaults to a static computation graph (though eager execution modifies this behavior significantly).  Therefore, directly mirroring PyTorch's `requires_grad` attribute with a simple TensorFlow equivalent is inaccurate; the mechanisms differ.  Instead, the focus should be on controlling gradient computation within TensorFlow's context, particularly using `tf.GradientTape`.

My experience working extensively with both frameworks—specifically while developing a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm involving complex policy gradients—highlighted this distinction.  Initial attempts at a direct translation often resulted in incorrect gradient calculations or unexpected behavior. The solution lies not in mimicking the attribute directly but in leveraging TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation features strategically.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

In TensorFlow 2.0 and beyond, eager execution is the default.  This means operations are executed immediately, and the computation graph isn't explicitly defined beforehand.  However, gradient computation requires tracking the operations performed. This is achieved using `tf.GradientTape`.  To ensure a tensor's gradients are calculated, it must be *watched* by the `GradientTape` context.  This "watching" effectively mimics the effect of PyTorch's `requires_grad=True`.  Note that setting the `requires_grad` attribute directly on a TensorFlow tensor is not analogous, as TensorFlow's gradient tracking is managed differently.

The `tf.GradientTape` context manager records all operations performed within its scope. When `gradient()` is called, it uses the recorded operations to compute the gradients.  Any tensor not explicitly watched by the `GradientTape` will not have its gradients computed, even if it participates in operations within the context.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.constant([2.0, 3.0]), dtype=tf.float32)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x * x
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(dy_dx)  # Output: tf.Tensor([4. 6.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental use of `tf.GradientTape`. The `tf.Variable` ensures that the tensor `x` is tracked.  The `GradientTape` watches `x` implicitly because it is a `tf.Variable`. The gradient of `y` with respect to `x` is then calculated using `tape.gradient()`.

**Example 2:  Selective Gradient Tracking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x) # Explicitly watch x
    z = x * y
dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx)  # Output: tf.Tensor([1. 2.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)
```

Here, `x` is a `tf.constant`, which isn't automatically tracked. Using `tape.watch(x)`, we explicitly tell the `GradientTape` to track `x`, enabling gradient calculation with respect to it.  `y` is not watched and therefore is treated as a constant during gradient computation.

**Example 3:  Gradient Calculation with Multiple Tensors and Persistent Tape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0]), dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.Variable(tf.constant([3.0, 4.0]), dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
  z = x * y
  w = tf.math.sin(z)

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
dw_dx = tape.gradient(w, x)
dw_dy = tape.gradient(w, y)
del tape

print(dz_dx)  # Output: tf.Tensor([3. 4.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)
print(dw_dx)  # Output: tf.Tensor([0.9899925  0.14112001], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)
print(dw_dy)  # Output: tf.Tensor([0.41211848 0.5440211 ], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)

```

This advanced example showcases the `persistent=True` argument, allowing reuse of the `GradientTape` for multiple gradient calculations. This is crucial when dealing with complex models or multiple loss functions where computing gradients multiple times from the same forward pass is more efficient.  We calculate gradients of `z` and `w` with respect to both `x` and `y`, demonstrating the flexibility of `tf.GradientTape` for managing complex gradient computations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow documentation:  The official documentation provides comprehensive details on `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation in TensorFlow.  Focus on the sections detailing eager execution and gradient computation.
*  A textbook on deep learning or machine learning: These often cover the underlying mathematical principles of automatic differentiation and how different frameworks implement it.
*  TensorFlow tutorials: Explore tutorials focusing on building and training custom models, as these often involve detailed examples of gradient calculation using `tf.GradientTape`.


In summary, while a direct equivalent to PyTorch's `requires_grad=True` doesn't exist in TensorFlow, utilizing `tf.GradientTape` along with `tf.Variable` or `tape.watch()` effectively controls which tensors are included in gradient calculations, providing the necessary functionality for gradient-based optimization in TensorFlow 2.0.  Understanding the underlying differences between static and dynamic computation graphs is paramount to successfully transitioning between these frameworks.
