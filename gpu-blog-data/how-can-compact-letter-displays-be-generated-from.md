Generating compact letter displays from pairwise comparison p-values requires careful consideration of multiple comparison correction and effective visualization techniques.  My experience in developing statistical software for agricultural research has frequently involved this precise challenge, particularly when analyzing treatment effects across multiple crop varieties.  The critical insight is that while pairwise p-values indicate significant differences between individual pairs, a compact letter display provides a concise summary of all significant groupings. This avoids the visual clutter and interpretation difficulties associated with a large matrix of p-values.

The core process involves three key steps: 1) adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons, 2) determining groupings based on adjusted p-values, and 3) generating the letter display itself.  The choice of multiple comparison correction method significantly impacts the results, and the appropriate method depends heavily on the experimental design and research questions.

**1. Multiple Comparison Correction:**  Ignoring the multiplicity of tests when interpreting pairwise p-values leads to an inflated Type I error rate (false positives).  Therefore, correcting for multiple comparisons is paramount. I’ve found three methods to be particularly useful: the Bonferroni correction, the Holm-Bonferroni method, and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

* **Bonferroni Correction:** This is a simple and conservative method that multiplies each p-value by the number of comparisons. While easy to understand and implement, it can be overly conservative, leading to a higher Type II error rate (false negatives), especially with a large number of comparisons.

* **Holm-Bonferroni Method:** This method improves upon the Bonferroni correction by sequentially adjusting p-values. It maintains the family-wise error rate (FWER) at or below α while generally being less conservative than the Bonferroni correction.

* **Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure:** This procedure controls the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected proportion of false positives among the significant results. It is less conservative than methods controlling the FWER and is particularly useful when a higher rate of false positives is acceptable to increase the power of detecting true differences.

The choice among these methods is context-dependent.  For highly conservative studies where a low FWER is crucial, Bonferroni or Holm-Bonferroni are preferred.  When prioritizing power and a controlled FDR is sufficient, the Benjamini-Hochberg method is a better option.


**2. Determining Groupings:** After adjusting p-values, we determine which treatments or groups are significantly different. This typically involves creating an adjacency matrix, where a 1 indicates a significant difference between two groups and a 0 indicates no significant difference.  From this matrix, connected components are identified, representing groups of treatments that are not significantly different from each other.

**3. Generating the Letter Display:**  Finally, the connected components are assigned letters to create the compact letter display.  Groups with no significant difference share the same letter.  Groups with significant differences are assigned different letters, usually alphabetically in ascending order of means.  This provides a simple, visual representation of the treatment effects.


**Code Examples:**

The following examples utilize R, a powerful statistical computing language frequently used in my past projects.  Each example builds upon the previous one to demonstrate the entire process.

**Example 1:  Basic Data and Pairwise Comparisons:**

```R
# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data <- data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(rep(LETTERS[1:4], each = 5)),
  Response = c(10, 12, 11, 13, 11, 15, 17, 16, 18, 16, 20, 22, 21, 23, 22, 25, 27, 26, 28, 27)
)

# Perform pairwise t-tests
pairwise.t.test(data$Response, data$Treatment, p.adjust.method = "none")
```

This example performs pairwise t-tests without any correction for multiple comparisons.  The `p.adjust.method = "none"` argument is crucial here.  The results are preliminary and should not be interpreted directly due to the inflated Type I error.


**Example 2: Incorporating Multiple Comparison Correction and Groupings:**

```R
# Load necessary package
library(agricolae)

# Perform pairwise t-tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction
PT <- pairwise.t.test(data$Response, data$Treatment, p.adjust.method = "holm")

# Extract significant differences (p-value < 0.05)
significant_diff <- PT$p.value < 0.05

# Create adjacency matrix
adjacency_matrix <- matrix(as.numeric(significant_diff), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)

#  This section would require a more sophisticated graph algorithm (beyond the scope of this example) to identify connected components based on the adjacency matrix and generate groupings.  A custom function or a dedicated package would handle this.

```
This example demonstrates the incorporation of the Holm-Bonferroni correction.  The next logical step (omitted for brevity, but crucial in practice) would be to use graph theory algorithms to determine which treatments belong to the same group based on the adjusted p-values (represented here by the `significant_diff` matrix).


**Example 3: Generating the Letter Display (Conceptual):**

```R
# Assuming groupings are determined (e.g., using a graph algorithm as mentioned above)
groupings <- list(c("A", "B"), c("C"), c("D")) # Example groupings

# Assign letters to groups
letter_display <- sapply(groupings, function(x) paste0(letters[length(groupings)], collapse = ""))

# Print letter display
print(letter_display)
```

This example conceptually shows the final step of assigning letters.  The actual implementation would involve a function to automatically assign letters based on the determined groupings and potentially sort by means for alphabetical ordering. Note that this example requires the previous grouping step, which involves more advanced algorithm than the scope of a concise example here allows. This would typically be implemented using either a graph traversal algorithm or a specialized R package designed for post-hoc analysis.



**Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting standard statistical textbooks covering multiple comparison procedures and analysis of variance.  Several R packages, dedicated to statistical analysis and post-hoc tests, provide functions for performing these analyses and generating compact letter displays directly.  A good understanding of graph theory concepts, specifically connected component analysis, will be very beneficial for implementing custom grouping algorithms.  Furthermore, reviewing established literature using compact letter displays in similar research areas will provide valuable insight into established methodologies.
