The discrepancy in the currency of OpenCL C++ bindings between CUDA 11.6 and CUDA 10.1 stems primarily from NVIDIA's strategic shift in focusing development resources on CUDA's own parallel computing model and away from supporting OpenCL.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, specifically involving large-scale simulations and image processing, across several CUDA versions revealed this trend firsthand. While CUDA 10.1 benefited from relatively robust OpenCL support, likely as a transitional phase,  subsequent versions like 11.6 saw a prioritization of features and optimizations directly benefiting the CUDA ecosystem. This wasn't a sudden abandonment, but rather a gradual decline in feature parity and update frequency for the OpenCL bindings.


**1. Explanation:**

NVIDIA's OpenCL implementation has always been a secondary offering compared to their flagship CUDA.  OpenCL's specification is managed by the Khronos Group, an independent consortium, requiring NVIDIA to adhere to external standards and potentially accommodate diverse hardware architectures. This introduces complexity and overhead compared to developing and optimizing features directly within the CUDA framework.  Furthermore, the increasing prevalence and sophistication of CUDA-optimized libraries and tools incentivized NVIDIA to further consolidate their development efforts.  The return on investment for maintaining parity in OpenCL features is likely lower than focusing on advancing CUDA's core capabilities.  This is evident in the observation that many CUDA features, particularly those introduced in later releases, lack equivalent OpenCL counterparts within the NVIDIA driver.

Another factor contributing to this observation is the evolving landscape of heterogeneous computing.  While OpenCL aimed for broader hardware support, CUDA's dominance in NVIDIA GPUs makes it the preferred choice for many developers.  This shifts the demand and thus the resource allocation towards optimizing the native CUDA development experience.  OpenCL's appeal is reduced in cases where optimized CUDA libraries are readily available, rendering the effort to maintain updated OpenCL bindings less economically justifiable for NVIDIA.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the potential differences one might encounter when migrating from CUDA 10.1's OpenCL bindings to CUDA 11.6.  Note that these are simplified illustrations based on my experiences; specific function names and availability may vary.

**Example 1: Kernel Launch Differences**

```cpp
// CUDA 10.1 (Hypothetical - functionality may have existed but was removed)
cl::Kernel kernel(program, "myKernel");
cl::EnqueueArgs args(queue, ndrange);
queue.enqueueNDRangeKernel(kernel, global_work_size, local_work_size, nullptr, &event);

// CUDA 11.6 (More likely approach)
// Direct CUDA kernel launch, bypassing OpenCL entirely.
myKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(...);
```

Commentary:  In CUDA 10.1, OpenCL provided a reasonably well-integrated method for kernel launches.  However, the migration to CUDA 11.6 might necessitate a direct CUDA kernel launch, as shown in the second part of the example.  This highlights the shift towards prioritizing the CUDA API.


**Example 2:  Memory Management Discrepancies**

```cpp
// CUDA 10.1 (Hypothetical - Illustrative)
cl::Buffer buffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_WRITE, size, nullptr, &err);

// CUDA 11.6 (Common CUDA approach)
cudaMalloc(&buffer, size);
```

Commentary: Memory management in OpenCL through the `cl::Buffer` object might have been more seamless in CUDA 10.1. In CUDA 11.6, direct usage of CUDA's `cudaMalloc` is more common, reflecting the diminished OpenCL integration.  The OpenCL approach might even be entirely unavailable due to reduced functionality.

**Example 3:  Missing Functionality:**

```cpp
// CUDA 10.1 (Hypothetical Function)
cl::Event profileEvent = queue.enqueueReadBuffer(buffer, CL_TRUE, 0, size, ptr, nullptr, &profileEvent);
long long startTime = profileEvent.getProfilingInfo<CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START>();


// CUDA 11.6 (Function may not exist in OpenCL binding)
cudaEventRecord(startEvent, stream);
cudaEventSynchronize(startEvent);
cudaEventElapsedTime(&ms, startEvent, stopEvent);
```

Commentary: Certain profiling or advanced functionalities might have been present in the OpenCL bindings of CUDA 10.1, potentially for easier performance analysis. However, these functions might be absent or deprecated in the CUDA 11.6 OpenCL bindings, forcing the programmer to rely on the more direct CUDA profiling tools, thereby further diminishing the use case for OpenCL.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections detailing the OpenCL interaction (if available for the given version), is a crucial resource.  Further, focusing on relevant CUDA programming guides and tutorials will prove more efficient given the reduced emphasis on OpenCL within the NVIDIA ecosystem.  Additionally, exploring community forums focused on high-performance computing can offer insights from developers facing similar challenges.  Understanding the underlying differences between OpenCL and CUDA programming models will prove valuable for adapting codebases.
