The paradoxical error “Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but got tensors on device …” while all involved tensors seemingly reside on the same device, often stems from a subtle discrepancy in how PyTorch handles device representations, particularly within the context of custom modules or when working across multiple Python processes. The core issue is not necessarily that tensors reside on different *physical* devices, such as CPU vs. GPU, but rather on different *logical* representations of the same device within PyTorch's framework. I encountered this frequently while debugging distributed training pipelines for large language models, where nuanced device handling is critical.

The error message typically surfaces during operations that expect strict device uniformity, like element-wise arithmetic (addition, multiplication), concatenations, or model forward passes. While each tensor might appear, when inspected individually, to be on, say, "cuda:0," PyTorch's internal checks are more granular than this. Two common situations give rise to this:  Firstly, when tensors are generated by different means within the training loop, it can lead to subtle inconsistencies in the associated device objects. Secondly, during data parallelism with `torch.nn.DataParallel`, or when utilizing `torch.distributed`, these different logical device representations can propagate across processes or threads, leading to the error. PyTorch uses internal device metadata within the `torch.device` object to manage these operations, and the discrepancies usually mean two tensors might have identical visible device strings, such as `cuda:0` but have differences in their internal device objects (specifically their numerical IDs).

The primary problem arises from the creation of different `torch.device` instances even when referencing the same hardware.  For example, if I create a tensor directly using `torch.randn(10, device="cuda:0")` and then later access the same device indirectly (perhaps through a model’s `.device` attribute), the internal representation can differ. This disparity is not always visible but is strictly enforced by the underlying C++ implementation when combining tensors.

Let’s examine this concept with code. Consider a scenario in which I am implementing a custom layer with cached parameters.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, device):
        super().__init__()
        self.cache = torch.randn(10, device=device)
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10))

    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.cache + self.weight

device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
try:
  model = CustomLayer(device)
  input_tensor = torch.randn(10, device=device)
  output = model(input_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, I am creating `self.cache` using a string (`device="cuda:0"` or `device="cpu"`) as input to `torch.randn()`. The model's parameter `self.weight`, though not explicitly moved, will also adopt the device, but potentially with a distinct `torch.device` object representation. This subtle difference could lead to the observed error during the addition operation in the `forward` method. This happens because the `weight` parameter gets its device based on being a member of an `nn.Module` instantiated on the device. It’s not the same device object passed to `torch.randn()`.

Here's a version where the issue is addressed, emphasizing consistent device object usage:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, device):
        super().__init__()
        self.device = torch.device(device)  # Ensure a specific torch.device object
        self.cache = torch.randn(10, device=self.device)
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10, device=self.device))

    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.cache + self.weight

device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = CustomLayer(device)
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, device=model.device)
output = model(input_tensor)
print("Output:", output)
```
Here, by constructing a `torch.device` object instance and using that same object across all tensor creations, I ensure device object consistency. Note that when creating an `nn.Parameter` with a `device` keyword, the tensor is initialized on the given device. By storing the `torch.device` object and using it for all tensor creation we ensure we get the same internal device representation. I obtain consistent device objects, preventing this error.

A third example considers a data-parallel context. In a simplified example, without proper device handling the following may throw the error:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.parallel import DataParallel

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
        device = "cuda:0"
        model = SimpleModel()
        model = DataParallel(model)
        model.to(device)
        input_tensor = torch.randn(10, device=device)
        try:
            output = model(input_tensor)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

```
In a DataParallel setup, tensors are scattered across GPUs then the computation is performed on these scattered sub-tensors. Then the results are gathered, and the resulting tensor is returned.  Here the `input_tensor` and the model’s parameters are on ‘cuda:0’ but within `DataParallel`’s scope the tensors are treated internally as different device objects. Although not technically necessary in this simplified example where tensors are moved to the GPU using the model's `.to()` method, this can manifest in more complicated scenarios, particularly within custom `forward()` methods. The crucial point is ensuring consistent handling of the device objects to avoid mismatches. Even though `model` and `input_tensor` appear to both be on `cuda:0`, DataParallel creates multiple logical copies of `cuda:0` to do its thing and this can lead to unexpected behavior if not well-handled.

Key strategies to combat this issue include: 1) Centralizing device object creation, using a single `torch.device` object throughout your application. Avoid using strings as device identifiers when performing tensor operations or initializations. 2) Explicitly moving all tensors and model parameters to the same device object, instead of relying on implicit behavior. This is crucial for complex operations. 3) When using data parallelism, pay careful attention to the `forward` method. Use `input_tensor.to(model.device)` to ensure all input is on the same logical device as the model, particularly when doing additional tensor manipulations inside your `forward` call. Use `model.device` to reference the canonical device. 4) Thoroughly review the interactions of your custom modules with external functions, ensuring that all tensors used together are on logically identical devices. Finally, it is helpful to utilize PyTorch's debugging utilities, particularly those dealing with tensor devices to identify the source of discrepancies.

I recommend exploring the following resources to further enhance understanding: the official PyTorch documentation sections on tensor devices and parallel processing, along with tutorials and examples that illustrate distributed training practices. Additionally, review forum posts and discussions about common error scenarios associated with PyTorch’s device management, which should give a better understanding of practical resolutions to this issue. Careful attention to device object representations and a clear coding practice is key.
