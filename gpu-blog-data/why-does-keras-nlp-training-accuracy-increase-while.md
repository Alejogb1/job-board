The observed divergence between increasing training accuracy and increasing validation loss during Keras NLP training is a strong indicator of overfitting.  This phenomenon, common in deep learning, particularly with sequence models like those used in NLP, arises when the model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and idiosyncrasies rather than generalizable patterns.  My experience developing sentiment analysis models for e-commerce reviews consistently revealed this behavior; a high-performing model on the training set consistently failed to generalize to unseen data.

This behavior isn't simply a matter of insufficient training data, although that can contribute.  The core issue is the model's complexity relative to the information content of the training data.  A model with too many parameters (weights) can memorize the training examples, resulting in high training accuracy but poor generalization.  Regularization techniques are crucial in mitigating this problem.  Overfitting manifests because the model has learned the specificities of the training data, including random noise or biases present in the dataset.  Validation data, on the other hand, reflects the true distribution of the data the model should generalize to.  As the model overfits, it performs exceptionally well on the training data while performing poorly on the unseen validation data.

Let's clarify this with examples.  I'll illustrate how overfitting presents and demonstrate mitigation strategies with three distinct code examples using Keras and TensorFlow.  Assume we are building a text classification model, for example, distinguishing positive from negative reviews.

**Example 1:  Unregularized Model (Overfitting)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Model definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    LSTM(128),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training (Note: No regularization)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```

In this example, we have a simple LSTM model with an embedding layer.  The absence of any regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization) allows the model to freely learn intricate patterns in the training data, likely leading to overfitting.  During training, we'll observe high training accuracy but a rising validation loss.  This is because the model has learned the noise in the training set, creating a discrepancy between training and validation performance.

**Example 2:  Model with Dropout Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Model definition with dropout
model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    LSTM(128, return_sequences=True),
    Dropout(0.5), # Dropout layer added
    LSTM(64),
    Dropout(0.3), # Another dropout layer
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```

Here, we've introduced dropout layers. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features and preventing over-reliance on any single neuron or set of neurons.  The `return_sequences=True` in the first LSTM layer allows stacking of LSTMs.  This regularization significantly reduces the risk of overfitting.  A balanced improvement in both training and validation performance is expected.

**Example 3:  Model with L2 Regularization and Early Stopping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Model definition with L2 regularization
model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length, embeddings_regularizer=l2(0.01)),
    LSTM(128, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Early stopping callback
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training with early stopping
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping])
```

This example utilizes L2 regularization, adding a penalty to the loss function proportional to the square of the weight magnitudes. This encourages smaller weights, reducing model complexity and preventing overfitting.  Crucially, we’ve incorporated early stopping.  This monitors the validation loss and stops training when it fails to improve for a specified number of epochs (`patience`), preventing further overfitting and retaining the best model weights.

These examples demonstrate different ways to combat overfitting.  Choosing the appropriate regularization technique and hyperparameters (like dropout rate, L2 regularization strength, and `patience` in early stopping) requires experimentation and validation.  It's essential to carefully examine the training and validation curves to assess model performance and identify overfitting early.

By carefully considering the model architecture, applying appropriate regularization, and monitoring the training and validation metrics, one can effectively mitigate overfitting and develop robust NLP models.  Remember that meticulous data preprocessing and careful hyperparameter tuning remain essential for optimal performance.  My experiences have shown that iterative model refinement, guided by validation performance, is crucial for building effective and generalizable NLP systems.
