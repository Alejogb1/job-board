Numerical integration, particularly when dealing with a large set of integrals, often presents a significant computational bottleneck. The core inefficiency frequently stems from performing redundant calculations; specifically, repeated evaluation of the integrand at identical points across multiple integrals. A key fact is that many common integration schemes, like composite Simpson's rule or Gaussian quadrature, reuse a fixed set of abscissas (evaluation points) for a given interval, regardless of the specific function being integrated.

My experience from designing large-scale simulation frameworks has shown that exploiting this redundancy through precomputation and intelligent caching can dramatically improve performance. Rather than independently calculating each integral, we can identify shared regions of the integration domain and precompute function values at the required quadrature points. These precomputed values, if organized effectively, can then be reused across all integrals that share these domain regions. This approach, broadly termed 'memoization' in computer science, translates to a substantial reduction in redundant function evaluations. The core idea is to perform computationally expensive operations once, store the results, and then retrieve them later when those operations are required again.

In the context of numerical integration, consider a set of integrals of the form:

∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f<sub>i</sub>(x) dx,  for i = 1, 2, ..., N

where ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the integration limits, and f<sub>i</sub>(x) are different functions. The standard approach would involve, for each f<sub>i</sub>, evaluating f<sub>i</sub>(x<sub>j</sub>) at the quadrature points x<sub>j</sub> and applying the appropriate weights based on the numerical integration method used. However, many of these x<sub>j</sub> values and thus, often, function evaluations overlap across all i values.

To implement this efficiently, we need to restructure our approach. Instead of iterating over integrals and performing the full integration at each step, we first precompute all function values at the quadrature points across all domain regions. Then, with these precomputed values stored, we can proceed to integrate each f<sub>i</sub> using the appropriate weights with minimal additional computation.

Here’s a Python example using NumPy, demonstrating composite trapezoidal integration across multiple functions sharing the same integration domain:

```python
import numpy as np

def composite_trapezoidal_precomputed(functions, a, b, n_segments):
  """
  Integrates a list of functions using composite trapezoidal rule,
  precomputing function values.

  Args:
    functions: A list of function handles (f(x)).
    a: Lower limit of integration.
    b: Upper limit of integration.
    n_segments: Number of trapezoidal segments.

  Returns:
    A list of integral results, one for each input function.
  """

  h = (b - a) / n_segments
  x_points = np.linspace(a, b, n_segments + 1)

  function_values = np.array([[f(x) for x in x_points] for f in functions])

  integrals = np.zeros(len(functions))
  for i, func_vals in enumerate(function_values):
      integrals[i] = h * (0.5 * func_vals[0] + np.sum(func_vals[1:-1]) + 0.5 * func_vals[-1])
  return integrals

# Example usage:
functions_to_integrate = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: np.sin(x), lambda x: np.exp(x)]
a = 0
b = 10
n = 100
results = composite_trapezoidal_precomputed(functions_to_integrate, a, b, n)
print(f"Integral results: {results}")
```

This implementation first creates the quadrature points `x_points`. Then, it computes all function values at these points for all input functions, storing them in the `function_values` array. The integration loop iterates over the precomputed function values, directly applying the trapezoidal rule. The key optimization here is the computation of the function values done *once* for all functions and not per integral.

This next example extends this idea to handle cases where we have different integration intervals and thus need to precompute and store values associated with specific intervals.

```python
import numpy as np
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def precompute_function_values(function, a, b, n_segments):
    """
    Precomputes function values for a given function, interval and number of segments.
    This function uses memoization to avoid redundant computations.

    Args:
        function: The function to be evaluated.
        a: Lower limit of integration.
        b: Upper limit of integration.
        n_segments: Number of trapezoidal segments.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array of precomputed function values.
    """
    x_points = np.linspace(a, b, n_segments + 1)
    return np.array([function(x) for x in x_points])

def composite_trapezoidal_cached(functions, integration_specs):
  """
    Integrates a list of functions using the composite trapezoidal rule with cached evaluations.

    Args:
      functions: A list of function handles (f(x)).
      integration_specs: A list of tuples, each specifying (a, b, n_segments) for the corresponding function.

    Returns:
      A list of integral results, one for each input function.
    """
  integrals = []
  for i, func in enumerate(functions):
     a,b, n_segments = integration_specs[i]
     func_vals = precompute_function_values(func, a,b,n_segments)
     h = (b-a) / n_segments
     integral = h * (0.5 * func_vals[0] + np.sum(func_vals[1:-1]) + 0.5 * func_vals[-1])
     integrals.append(integral)
  return integrals

# Example Usage:
functions_to_integrate = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: np.sin(x), lambda x: np.exp(x), lambda x: x**3]
integration_specifications = [(0, 10, 100), (0, 5, 50), (2, 8, 75), (1,9, 90)]
results = composite_trapezoidal_cached(functions_to_integrate, integration_specifications)
print(f"Integral results with caching: {results}")
```

In this version, `precompute_function_values` uses Python's `lru_cache` decorator. This is a highly efficient, built-in implementation of memoization that will automatically store the results for different function, a, b, n_segments combinations. Any subsequent calls with the exact same arguments retrieve the results from the cache, drastically improving performance if those combinations are repeated.

Finally, this third example shows a more general approach using a class to manage the precomputed function values and integration process, also highlighting how to apply this optimization to a more complex, weighted quadrature rule (in this case, Gaussian quadrature).

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import legendre
from functools import lru_cache

class GaussianQuadratureIntegrator:
    def __init__(self, n_points):
        self.n_points = n_points
        self.points, self.weights = self._calculate_gauss_points_weights()
        self.cached_evaluations = {}

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def _calculate_gauss_points_weights(self):
        """Calculates Gauss-Legendre quadrature points and weights."""
        poly = legendre.Legendre(np.array([0] * self.n_points + [1]))
        points = poly.roots()
        weights = 2 / ((1 - points**2) * poly.deriv()(points)**2)
        return points, weights

    def integrate(self, function, a, b):
         # Map points from [-1,1] to [a,b]
         mapped_points = 0.5 * ((b - a) * self.points + (b + a))

         #Check if values are in cache
         key = (function.__name__,a,b)
         if key in self.cached_evaluations:
             function_values = self.cached_evaluations[key]
         else:
           function_values = np.array([function(x) for x in mapped_points])
           self.cached_evaluations[key] = function_values

         return  0.5 * (b - a) * np.sum(self.weights * function_values)

# Example usage:
integrator = GaussianQuadratureIntegrator(n_points=5)

functions_to_integrate = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: np.sin(x), lambda x: np.exp(x), lambda x: x**3]
intervals = [(0, 10), (0, 5), (2, 8), (1,9)]

results = []
for i, func in enumerate(functions_to_integrate):
    result = integrator.integrate(func,intervals[i][0], intervals[i][1])
    results.append(result)
print(f"Integral results with Gaussian Quadrature: {results}")

```

This class manages the Gauss-Legendre points and weights, utilizing `lru_cache` to precalculate them. The `integrate` method performs the necessary transformation of points and evaluates the function, caching the function results under the function name and interval tuple to avoid redundant evaluations. This provides a more structured and modular approach suitable for integrating a variety of functions across potentially different integration intervals, demonstrating memoization with a more sophisticated quadrature method.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting resources focusing on numerical analysis, particularly sections concerning quadrature methods and optimization techniques. Specifically, look for discussions of memoization, dynamic programming, and efficient algorithm design. Materials discussing the specific quadrature rules (e.g., trapezoidal, Simpson's, Gaussian) and their associated error analysis are helpful as well. Exploring books on high-performance computing can also provide insight into parallelizing these types of calculations if the precomputation step still represents a bottleneck. I would also suggest articles detailing common software optimization strategies. The key takeaway, however, is recognizing and addressing redundant computations via techniques such as memoization when dealing with a multitude of numerical integrations.
