The presence of a row of zeros in a matrix undergoing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) directly impacts the resulting singular values and the corresponding right singular vectors. Specifically, it introduces at least one zero singular value, alongside potential alterations to the other singular values and vectors. This effect arises from the inherent rank deficiency that a row of zeros introduces. My experience dealing with numerical linear algebra in signal processing applications frequently involves handling matrices with such features, so this behaviour is well-documented in practice.

SVD decomposes a matrix *A* into three matrices: *U*, *Σ*, and *V<sup>T</sup>*, where *A = UΣV<sup>T</sup>*. *U* is an *m x m* unitary matrix (left singular vectors), *Σ* is an *m x n* diagonal matrix containing the singular values, and *V* is an *n x n* unitary matrix (right singular vectors). The singular values, typically denoted *σ<sub>i</sub>*, are arranged in descending order. The number of non-zero singular values corresponds to the rank of the original matrix *A*. If *A* has a row of zeros, it cannot be full rank. Specifically, it reduces the rank of *A* by at least 1. Therefore, at least one singular value must be zero to satisfy the properties of SVD.

A row of zeros indicates a linear dependency amongst the rows of *A*. A matrix with linearly dependent rows, or columns, does not span the entire space into which it maps its input, meaning that the matrix transformation collapses some of the possible dimensions of the output. In the context of SVD, this collapse manifests in reduced rank. The zero singular value(s) signify these 'lost' dimensions. Intuitively, if a row is entirely zero, the matrix can be represented by a smaller number of non-zero rows or columns (depending on whether one takes the rows or columns for generating the space). The information held by this zero row is therefore superfluous and does not contribute to the matrix’s mapping power.

The right singular vectors in *V* corresponding to the non-zero singular values span the row space of *A*. Those associated with zero singular values span the null space (or kernel) of *A*. The null space contains the set of vectors that, when multiplied by *A*, result in a zero vector. A row of zeros directly implies that any vector that has a non-zero value at the index corresponding to the zero row is in the null space. While *V* forms an orthonormal basis for the space, the specific vectors depend on the method used for SVD computation and the specific numerical values within the original matrix.

**Code Example 1: Simple Matrix with a Row of Zeros**

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import svd

A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4],
              [0, 0]])

U, s, V = svd(A)

print("Singular values:", s)
print("U matrix:\n", U)
print("V matrix:\n", V)
```

This example creates a 3x2 matrix *A* with a row of zeros. When SVD is performed, we observe that one of the singular values in *s* is zero. This indicates the rank of *A* is 2, which is less than the number of rows. We see that *U* and *V* are still unitary and that *A* can be rebuilt as *U * diag(s) * V.T*. The U matrix has shape (3,3), *s* has length 2 (2 singular values), and *V* has shape (2,2). Note that only the first two columns of U are used for the reconstruction of A. The final column is the 'left' null space.

**Code Example 2: Larger Matrix with a Row of Zeros**

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import svd

B = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
              [5, 6, 7, 8],
              [9, 10, 11, 12],
              [0, 0, 0, 0],
              [13, 14, 15, 16]])

U, s, V = svd(B)
print("Singular values:", s)
print("U matrix:\n", U)
print("V matrix:\n", V)
```

Here, the 5x4 matrix *B* has a row of zeros. The resulting singular values *s* confirm that there is a zero singular value.  The rank of *B* is not trivially obvious by visual inspection as there are no identical rows, but it is definitely less than 4 due to the row of zeros. *U* has shape (5,5), *s* has length 4 (4 singular values) and *V* has shape (4,4). Again, we see that only the first 4 columns of *U* contribute to re-making the matrix, while the remaining column of U forms a null space of the original matrix.

**Code Example 3: The Impact of Near-Zero Row on Singular Values**

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import svd

C = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4],
              [0.00001, 0.00001]])


U, s, V = svd(C)
print("Singular values:", s)
print("U matrix:\n", U)
print("V matrix:\n", V)
```

This example demonstrates how the singular values change if the row is not exactly zero, but contains very small numbers. If, instead of a perfect row of zeros, we had a row of very small values, like in this matrix *C*, the smallest singular value, while no longer exactly zero, would be very close to zero. This is often how zero singular values appear in practical applications, where perfect zeros can often be noisy or result from rounding errors or measurement errors. It would still signal a large linear dependency within *C*. It is important to recognize that matrices with small singular values close to zero often suffer from numerical instabilities, and this example emphasizes the difference between mathematical theory and the practicalities of numerical computation.

When a zero row is a result of numerical errors or real-world measurements rather than a strict mathematical condition, using SVD for denoising or data compression requires careful consideration of a threshold under which singular values are treated as zero. I have, for example, in some cases, manually set very small singular values to zero to improve the stability of my system in image compression. This effectively reduces the rank of the matrix and may lead to a simplified system.

Regarding resources, I found the following topics, typically covered in numerical linear algebra textbooks, useful for deeper understanding:

1.  **Rank of a Matrix:** Understanding matrix rank is fundamental to grasping the implications of linearly dependent rows or columns. The connection between rank and the number of non-zero singular values is critical.

2. **Null Space and Range of a Matrix:** These concepts are vital for interpreting the right and left singular vector spaces associated with zero and non-zero singular values. Specifically, the right singular vectors corresponding to zero singular values form a basis of the null space of the original matrix.

3.  **Singular Value Decomposition Theory:** Studying the underlying theorems and proofs of SVD provides a robust foundation for understanding its behavior. Particularly insightful are the geometrical interpretation of singular values as scaling factors along the principal axes in the data space and their implications for matrix rank.

4. **Practical Implications of SVD:** Knowing about the usage of SVD to solve linear least squares, denoising, dimensionality reduction, and data compression can help to motivate the study of the theory.

In closing, a row of zeros introduces a zero singular value in the SVD decomposition, reducing the matrix's rank, which impacts the null space and range of the original matrix. While the other singular values and vectors may vary, the presence of at least one zero singular value is a predictable outcome, as exemplified through numerical tests. Knowledge of this is an important prerequisite for correct SVD computation and subsequent analysis of many real-world systems. The code examples demonstrate this relationship, which is further clarified by the additional resource recommendations.
