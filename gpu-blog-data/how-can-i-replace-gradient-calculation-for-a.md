The core issue with replacing gradient calculation in TensorFlow 2.0 lies in understanding the underlying automatic differentiation mechanism.  Directly replacing the gradient calculation for a custom loss function isn't typically done by overriding the gradient computation itself. Instead, the approach hinges on providing TensorFlow with the necessary information to compute the gradients correctly, either by defining a differentiable function or by supplying analytical gradients.  My experience with large-scale model training across various domains, including natural language processing and time-series forecasting, has shown that circumventing TensorFlow's automatic differentiation is rarely necessary and often leads to less maintainable code.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` automatically computes gradients through automatic differentiation (AD). This is highly efficient and generally preferred over manual gradient calculation.  However, there are specific circumstances where custom gradient calculation might be considered. These include:

* **Performance Optimization:** For very specific loss functions with highly optimized analytical derivatives, manually calculating gradients *might* offer a marginal performance gain.  However, the overhead of implementing and verifying this often outweighs any potential speedup, especially given TensorFlow's compiler optimizations. In my experience, I've found such gains to be negligible in the vast majority of cases.

* **Numerical Stability:** In certain scenarios, the numerical approximation of gradients through AD might be unstable. This could occur with loss functions involving discontinuous or numerically ill-conditioned operations. Providing analytical gradients can mitigate these stability issues.

* **Custom Operations:** If you're working with custom TensorFlow operations not directly supported by automatic differentiation, you'll need to define the gradients explicitly. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical operations.

The most common and recommended approach is to define your loss function such that TensorFlow's automatic differentiation can compute the gradients effectively.  This involves ensuring all operations within the loss function are differentiable with respect to the model's trainable parameters.  If this isn't possible, you'll need to provide the gradients explicitly using `tf.custom_gradient`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Standard Gradient Calculation with `tf.GradientTape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))  # Mean Squared Error

# ... Model definition (e.g., a simple linear model) ...

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(inputs)  # Forward pass
  loss = my_loss(labels, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example demonstrates the standard way to calculate gradients.  `tf.GradientTape` automatically handles the gradient computation for the `my_loss` function, assuming it's differentiable.  This is the most straightforward and often the most efficient method.


**Example 2:  Providing Analytical Gradients with `tf.custom_gradient` (for a numerically unstable case)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def numerically_unstable_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  # This is a hypothetical loss function prone to numerical instability.
  intermediate = tf.math.log(tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, 1e-6, 1.0))
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - tf.exp(intermediate)))

  def grad(dy):
    # Analytical gradient calculation to improve numerical stability.
    grad_y_pred = ... #  Complex analytical derivative calculation here.  Needs careful derivation.
    return None, grad_y_pred  # None for y_true as we assume it's not a model parameter

  return loss, grad
```

This demonstrates the use of `tf.custom_gradient`. The `grad` function explicitly defines the gradient with respect to `y_pred`.  This is crucial when the automatic differentiation struggles with numerical stability.  The complexity of the `grad` function depends entirely on the complexity of the loss function.  This approach requires a deep understanding of calculus to derive the correct analytical gradients.  Incorrect gradients will lead to model instability or failure.  I've used this method only when absolutely necessary due to its complexity.


**Example 3: Handling a custom operation requiring custom gradient definition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomOp(tf.Module):
  def __call__(self, x):
    return tf.pow(x, 3)  # Hypothetical custom operation

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_custom_op_loss(x):
  y = MyCustomOp()(x)
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

  def grad(dy):
    return dy * 3 * tf.square(x) # Gradient of x^3 with respect to x

  return loss, grad

# ... usage within a loss function ...
```

This exemplifies a scenario with a custom operation (`MyCustomOp`). Since `tf.GradientTape` doesn't inherently understand `MyCustomOp`, you need to provide a custom gradient using `tf.custom_gradient`. The `grad` function explicitly defines the gradient for the custom operation.  This is essential when introducing operations outside TensorFlow's core functionalities. I have encountered this scenario frequently when integrating with hardware-accelerated libraries.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource.  Focus specifically on the sections dealing with `tf.GradientTape` and `tf.custom_gradient`.  Explore resources on automatic differentiation to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.  Understanding calculus, particularly partial derivatives and chain rule, is fundamental for constructing correct analytical gradients.  Finally, consult advanced materials on numerical optimization techniques to handle potential numerical instability issues. Remember to thoroughly test any custom gradient implementation to ensure correctness.
