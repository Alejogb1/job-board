Real-time analysis of video requires precise frame extraction; inefficient methods drastically hinder performance. I've spent considerable time optimizing this process, moving away from simplistic looping to methods leveraging libraries like OpenCV and potentially GPU acceleration through frameworks such as PyTorch, which are crucial for any substantial deep learning pipeline. My experience involves tasks ranging from gesture recognition to real-time object tracking, where reliable frame access is non-negotiable.

The process, at its core, involves several key steps: establishing a live video feed, efficiently capturing frames, selecting desired frames based on a predefined strategy (e.g., every nth frame, frames matching a timestamp, etc.), and preparing these frames for input into a PyTorch model. The selection process is where optimized techniques are most beneficial, as naively capturing every frame quickly overwhelms memory and introduces unnecessary computational overhead. Further, data type conversion and normalization become critical steps when integrating with PyTorch tensors.

Let's begin with establishing the video feed. This can be achieved using OpenCV’s `VideoCapture` class. This class provides a consistent interface regardless of the underlying video source (webcam, file, or network stream). However, its default behavior can sometimes introduce bottlenecks, specifically when dealing with high frame rate streams. The primary challenge here is avoiding the full decoding of all frames when only a subset is needed. OpenCV's API gives us access to methods that can advance the capture to a specific frame, but we still need to carefully orchestrate our requests.

Here’s a code example that showcases efficient frame extraction using a time-based selection strategy, assuming a 30 frames-per-second video stream and selecting a frame roughly every 1 second:

```python
import cv2
import time
import torch
import numpy as np

def extract_time_based_frames(video_source, interval_seconds, target_width, target_height):
    """
    Extracts frames at specific time intervals from a video stream.

    Args:
        video_source: Path to video file or camera ID.
        interval_seconds: Time interval between extracted frames (seconds).
        target_width: Target width for resizing the frame.
        target_height: Target height for resizing the frame.

    Returns:
        A list of PyTorch tensors representing extracted frames.
    """
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        raise IOError("Error opening video stream or file")

    frame_rate = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    interval_frames = int(interval_seconds * frame_rate)
    frame_count = 0
    extracted_frames = []
    start_time = time.time()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        if frame_count % interval_frames == 0 :
            frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (target_width, target_height))
            normalized_frame = resized_frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
            tensor_frame = torch.from_numpy(normalized_frame).permute(2,0,1) # Convert to tensor and change to CHW format
            extracted_frames.append(tensor_frame.unsqueeze(0)) # Add batch dimension

        frame_count+=1

    cap.release()
    return torch.cat(extracted_frames, dim=0) # Concatenate all tensors
```

This function directly reads and processes every Nth frame, determined by `interval_seconds` and the video's frame rate, minimizing unnecessary calculations. The frame is then converted from OpenCV's BGR to RGB, resized to the network's required dimensions, normalized to a [0,1] range by dividing by 255, and converted to a PyTorch tensor with the expected channel-first format (CHW, or channel, height, width) before a batch dimension is added via `unsqueeze(0)`. Finally, these tensors are concatenated into a single tensor, representing the entire sequence of frames in the correct format.

For a different use case, consider selecting frames at fixed intervals (every third frame, for instance) regardless of time. This scenario demands a simple modulo-based frame selection approach. The following code example highlights this:

```python
import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np

def extract_nth_frame(video_source, nth_frame, target_width, target_height):
    """
    Extracts every nth frame from a video stream.

    Args:
        video_source: Path to video file or camera ID.
        nth_frame: The interval between extracted frames.
        target_width: Target width for resizing the frame.
        target_height: Target height for resizing the frame.

    Returns:
        A list of PyTorch tensors representing extracted frames.
    """
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        raise IOError("Error opening video stream or file")

    frame_count = 0
    extracted_frames = []

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        if frame_count % nth_frame == 0:
            frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (target_width, target_height))
            normalized_frame = resized_frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
            tensor_frame = torch.from_numpy(normalized_frame).permute(2,0,1)
            extracted_frames.append(tensor_frame.unsqueeze(0))

        frame_count+=1
    cap.release()
    return torch.cat(extracted_frames, dim = 0)
```

The `extract_nth_frame` function extracts every `nth_frame` using the modulus operator to determine which frames to process and includes the same data preparation logic for integration with a PyTorch model. This method is useful when the frame rate is less crucial than simply having a spaced sampling across the entire video.

In more complex scenarios where specific events trigger frame selection, you can build a selective extraction logic. Let us imagine that you want to extract frames that have some changes between them. The simple example checks the frame difference to determine this:

```python
import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np


def extract_frames_based_on_difference(video_source, threshold, target_width, target_height):
    """
    Extracts frames based on a difference threshold with respect to the previous frame.

    Args:
        video_source: Path to video file or camera ID.
        threshold:  The minimum difference between frames to extract.
        target_width: Target width for resizing the frame.
        target_height: Target height for resizing the frame.

    Returns:
        A list of PyTorch tensors representing extracted frames.
    """

    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        raise IOError("Error opening video stream or file")

    previous_frame = None
    extracted_frames = []

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        current_gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

        if previous_frame is not None:
          frame_difference = cv2.absdiff(current_gray, previous_frame)
          avg_difference = np.mean(frame_difference)

          if avg_difference > threshold:
            frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (target_width, target_height))
            normalized_frame = resized_frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
            tensor_frame = torch.from_numpy(normalized_frame).permute(2,0,1)
            extracted_frames.append(tensor_frame.unsqueeze(0))
        else:
            frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (target_width, target_height))
            normalized_frame = resized_frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
            tensor_frame = torch.from_numpy(normalized_frame).permute(2,0,1)
            extracted_frames.append(tensor_frame.unsqueeze(0))


        previous_frame = current_gray

    cap.release()
    return torch.cat(extracted_frames, dim = 0)
```
Here, we compare the current frame against the previous using mean of the absolute difference between two consecutive greyscale frames. We extract a frame only if that difference is greater than a certain `threshold`. This is only an example of how to incorporate custom conditions in the frame selection logic. The same function also takes care of processing the selected frames.

Regarding resources for further exploration, consulting the OpenCV documentation provides comprehensive details on the `VideoCapture` class and image manipulation functions. Similarly, exploring PyTorch's official documentation on tensors and data loading can be highly beneficial, particularly those sections discussing data normalization and manipulation. Finally, seeking out computer vision textbooks or courses that cover video processing can deepen understanding of the underlying principles. I have found these resources invaluable when tackling challenging real-time video analysis tasks. Proper handling of video stream is the crucial step that has the most impact on performance of the machine learning pipeline.
