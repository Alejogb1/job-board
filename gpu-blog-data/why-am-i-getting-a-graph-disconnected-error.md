The core issue causing a graph disconnection error when visualizing feature maps from a nested model, specifically in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, stems from the way backpropagation and computational graphs are constructed within nested model architectures. Specifically, when you attempt to directly access and visualize intermediate tensors within a sub-model during inference, rather than during training, you often bypass the gradient tracking mechanisms necessary for a functional computational graph.

During the training phase, these frameworks meticulously maintain a graph representing all operations required to calculate gradients, allowing for efficient backpropagation. This graph is usually dynamic; it's built on-the-fly based on the operations performed. During inference, however, the framework often optimizes for speed, typically disabling gradient tracking to save computational resources. This optimization is controlled by context managers such as `torch.no_grad()` in PyTorch and TensorFlow's `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`. When you attempt to extract feature maps from a nested model and visualize them during this inference phase, you are essentially trying to pluck a node out of a graph that hasn’t been fully constructed for gradient computation, or has been modified, leading to the disconnection error. These errors manifest as ‘operation not in graph,’ or ‘attempt to access an intermediate tensor without a valid gradient context’.

Nested models, such as models within models, recurrent networks, or autoencoders, create hierarchies of operations where the forward pass of the outer model depends on the output of the inner model. This creates distinct sub-graphs. The inner model’s computations and their associated tensors, especially intermediate ones, are typically internal to its forward pass and might not be automatically registered within the outer model's overall graph during inference, if you're not explicitly recording them. The gradient information relevant for backpropagation isn't saved or tracked during inference which is why it would lead to a disconnection error. When you're working with a model structure that uses layers, activation functions and other operations with multiple outputs, that may not all be tracked, especially if you attempt to access them later.

Here are three examples to illustrate this, focusing on PyTorch due to its explicit gradient context management:

**Example 1: Basic Nested Model with In-Place Modification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class InnerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

class OuterModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.inner = InnerModel()
        self.linear_out = nn.Linear(5, 2)


    def forward(self, x):
      inner_out = self.inner(x)
      return self.linear_out(inner_out)

model = OuterModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)


with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(input_tensor)

# Attempting to access the intermediate output directly now will NOT result in an error in this example, 
# because the tensors were generated during the forward pass
# during the torch.no_grad context, where no computational graph is actually saved. 
inner_output = model.inner.relu(model.inner.linear(input_tensor))
print(f"Intermediate inner model output shape {inner_output.shape}")
```

In this first example, we construct a basic nested model where `InnerModel` is an attribute of the `OuterModel`. The crucial part here is the `torch.no_grad()` context. When we evaluate `model(input_tensor)`, it runs in inference mode where no gradient information is recorded for the tensors being generated during the forward pass. In the following line, when we are evaluating inner layers we are again running them during inference with `torch.no_grad`, which doesn't save any computational graph.  Because no graph was constructed, no disconnection error will occur. This example highlights that during inference operations are still evaluated.

**Example 2: Correctly Accessing Intermediate Tensor During Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class InnerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

class OuterModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.inner = InnerModel()
        self.linear_out = nn.Linear(5, 2)
        self.intermediate_output = None # For storing feature map

    def forward(self, x):
      inner_out = self.inner(x)
      self.intermediate_output = inner_out
      return self.linear_out(inner_out)

model = OuterModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_tensor)
# Accessing inner output is safe because it's stored as an attribute of the model during training
print(f"Intermediate inner model output shape: {model.intermediate_output.shape}")

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
target = torch.randn(1,2) # Dummy target for training
loss = criterion(output, target)

optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward() # Backpropagation is carried out correctly
optimizer.step()

# After training
with torch.no_grad():
  output_after_training = model(input_tensor)
# Attempting to access the intermediate output again during inference will NOT cause an error, but also it
# might not match the intermediate output generated during training, due to model updates.
print(f"Intermediate output after training, but no graph associated {model.intermediate_output.shape}")
```

Here, we introduce a mechanism for capturing an intermediate output by storing it within the model as an attribute: `self.intermediate_output`. By assigning the result of the inner model's computation to this attribute within the forward pass, we can access it after the forward pass is complete, during both training and inference. Critically, during the training phase, when `loss.backward()` is called, the graph needed for gradient calculation is built and all nodes, including `self.intermediate_output`, are associated with it. We have to be careful in this case though because after the backpropagation updates the parameters of the model and the new intermediate output will be different from the previous one.

**Example 3: Attempting to Access the Intermediate Tensor Without Proper Storage**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class InnerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

class OuterModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.inner = InnerModel()
        self.linear_out = nn.Linear(5, 2)


    def forward(self, x):
        inner_out = self.inner(x)
        return self.linear_out(inner_out)

model = OuterModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(input_tensor)
    
    #The following line will produce no error, because we are running operations in inference mode
    intermediate_output = model.inner.relu(model.inner.linear(input_tensor))

    print(f"Intermediate output after inference no error because graph was not tracked {intermediate_output.shape}")

# We can't backpropagate, because we are outside of training, no error will happen
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
target = torch.randn(1,2) # Dummy target for training
loss = criterion(output, target)

#Trying to extract inner output of a sub-model will cause no error if it is performed directly as above
#However, if we tried to use a variable we stored, it might cause a disconnection error. 
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
# optimizer.zero_grad() # we're not tracking gradients because we're inside torch.no_grad context.
# loss.backward()
# optimizer.step()


```

This final example returns to the problematic case. We run inference using `torch.no_grad`. Note that even if you define variables, if you are accessing parts of the model in inference mode, the gradients are not tracked by the framework. There is no error in this case, because we are directly accessing the layers and operations and computing their outputs. 

To avoid disconnection errors, it is better to explicitly store intermediate outputs within the model's forward function or hook into the computation using PyTorch's `register_forward_hook`. Accessing the tensors after the forward pass will work during inference, but it won't let you backpropagate or compute gradients. The method you should use depends on how you plan to use the feature maps, whether during training or only for visualization during inference.

For further learning about computational graphs, gradients, and model debugging, I recommend exploring the following resources. For PyTorch, focus on the official documentation for `torch.nn`, `torch.autograd`, and the explanations on how forward and backward passes operate. There are also resources explaining how to hook into model layers. A strong understanding of backpropagation is also important. For TensorFlow, focus on the Keras and TensorFlow core documentation focusing on tf.GradientTape, tf.function and the differences between Eager Execution and Graph Execution. Several high quality tutorials by the libraries are available online. Additionally, research papers on model debugging, visualization techniques, and the specific libraries you are using will increase your overall understanding of these concepts.
