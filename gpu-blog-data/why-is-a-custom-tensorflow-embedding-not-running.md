TensorFlow's GPU acceleration relies heavily on proper data type and tensor manipulation within the computational graph.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues points to a common oversight:  inconsistent data types between the custom embedding layer and the underlying TensorFlow operations.  This often manifests as unexpected CPU usage despite having a CUDA-enabled GPU available.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A custom TensorFlow embedding layer, unlike pre-built layers, necessitates meticulous attention to data type management.  TensorFlow's GPU kernels are highly optimized for specific data types, primarily `float32` and `float16` for numerical computation.  If your custom layer employs a different type, for instance, `int32` or `int64` for indexing or internal calculations, the computation falls back to the CPU. This is because the GPU lacks optimized kernels for those types in the context of embedding lookups.  Furthermore, type mismatches during data transfer between your custom layer and the rest of the model can disrupt GPU acceleration.  The GPU needs data in a format it can efficiently process; type coercion performed on the CPU during data transfer negates the speed advantage.

Another frequent source of GPU incompatibility is the improper use of `tf.Variable` within your custom layer. If the embedding matrix is not declared as a `tf.Variable` with appropriate constraints (such as `tf.float32`), or if it's created outside the `tf.function` decoratorâ€™s scope, the GPU might not recognize it as part of the computation graph suitable for parallelization. Finally, memory allocation is crucial; if your embedding matrix exceeds available GPU memory, TensorFlow will silently resort to CPU computation without any warning message, unless explicitly checking GPU memory usage during runtime.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    super(MyEmbedding, self).__init__()
    # INCORRECT: Using int32 for the embedding matrix
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim], dtype=tf.int32))

  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.embedding, inputs)

# ... model definition ...
```

In this example, the embedding matrix is declared as `tf.int32`. This prevents GPU acceleration because the GPU's optimized matrix multiplication kernels expect floating-point data.  The correct approach is to use `tf.float32` or `tf.float16` (depending on your GPU capabilities and precision requirements):

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    super(MyEmbedding, self).__init__()
    # CORRECT: Using tf.float32 for the embedding matrix
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim], dtype=tf.float32))

  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.embedding, inputs)

# ... model definition ...
```


**Example 2:  Improper Variable Creation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    super(MyEmbedding, self).__init__()
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim]))

  @tf.function
  def call(self, inputs):
    # INCORRECT:  Variable created outside tf.function
    #  GPU optimization will likely fail.
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim]))
    return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.embedding, inputs)

# ... model definition ...
```

Here, the `tf.Variable` is recreated within the `call` method, which is problematic even within the `@tf.function` decorator.  The correct approach is to create and initialize the variable in the `__init__` method:


```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    super(MyEmbedding, self).__init__()
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim], dtype=tf.float32))

  @tf.function
  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.embedding, inputs)

# ... model definition ...

```

**Example 3:  Data Type Mismatch During Input Handling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    super(MyEmbedding, self).__init__()
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim], dtype=tf.float32))

  @tf.function
  def call(self, inputs):
    #INCORRECT:  Type mismatch between input and embedding lookup
    inputs = tf.cast(inputs, tf.int64) #Casting inside the call method.
    return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.embedding, inputs)

# ... model definition ...
```

Casting the input type within the `call` function can lead to inefficiencies.  The optimal approach involves ensuring consistent data types throughout the pipeline, ideally converting inputs to `tf.int32` before passing them to the embedding layer.  This prevents unnecessary type conversions during runtime.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    super(MyEmbedding, self).__init__()
    self.embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim], dtype=tf.float32))

  @tf.function
  def call(self, inputs):
    #CORRECT: Assume inputs are already tf.int32.  Adjust preprocessing if needed.
    return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.embedding, inputs)

# ... model definition ...

```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on custom layer development and GPU optimization strategies.  Thorough understanding of TensorFlow's data flow mechanisms and the nuances of GPU-accelerated computation is crucial.  Familiarization with CUDA programming concepts is beneficial for advanced optimization, particularly when dealing with low-level tensor manipulations.  Finally, examining profiling tools integrated into TensorFlow can help pinpoint performance bottlenecks and identify areas for improvement.  Systematic debugging, focusing on data types and memory allocation, will resolve most GPU acceleration issues.
