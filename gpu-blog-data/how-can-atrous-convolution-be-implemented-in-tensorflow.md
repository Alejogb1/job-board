Atrous convolution, also known as dilated convolution, is fundamentally about increasing the receptive field of convolutional filters without increasing the number of parameters or the computational cost associated with a larger filter kernel.  This is achieved by introducing gaps, or "holes," between the filter weights. My experience optimizing deep learning models for high-resolution satellite imagery heavily involved leveraging this technique to capture contextual information from large spatial regions efficiently.  This response will detail its implementation within the TensorFlow 2 Keras framework.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Standard convolution operates by sliding a kernel across the input feature map, performing element-wise multiplication and summation at each position.  Atrous convolution modifies this process by inserting spaces (dilations) between the kernel weights. The dilation rate, often denoted as *r*, determines the spacing. A dilation rate of 1 corresponds to standard convolution. A dilation rate of 2 means there's one "hole" between each kernel weight, effectively doubling the receptive field without increasing the kernel size.  This is crucial for handling long-range dependencies in data without the computational burden of excessively large kernels.  Larger dilation rates exponentially increase the receptive field while maintaining a compact kernel.

Mathematically, given an input feature map *X* and a kernel *K* with dilation rate *r*, the atrous convolution operation at a specific position *i* can be expressed as:

Y[i] = Î£<sub>j</sub> K[j] * X[i + r*j]

where *j* indexes the kernel weights.  Note the multiplication of the index *j* by the dilation rate *r* in accessing the input feature map *X*. This introduces the "holes" in the kernel's effective footprint.

The primary advantage lies in capturing wider contextual information without significantly increasing computational cost.  This contrasts with using larger kernels directly, which would quadratically increase the number of parameters and computations.  Atrous convolutions are particularly valuable in tasks involving high-resolution imagery, time-series analysis with long temporal dependencies, and tasks needing to balance high resolution with computational constraints.  However, they can introduce checkerboard artifacts in certain circumstances, which must be carefully considered.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.nn.atrous_conv2d`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor shape: (batch_size, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 100, 100, 32))

# Kernel shape: (kernel_height, kernel_width, in_channels, out_channels)
kernel = tf.random.normal((3, 3, 32, 64))

# Dilation rate
rate = 2

# Atrous convolution
output_tensor = tf.nn.atrous_conv2d(input_tensor, kernel, rate=rate, padding='SAME')

# Output tensor shape: (batch_size, height, width, out_channels)
print(output_tensor.shape)
```

This example directly utilizes TensorFlow's built-in `tf.nn.atrous_conv2d` function.  It's straightforward and efficient.  The `padding='SAME'` argument ensures output dimensions are consistent with input dimensions (except for potential minor changes due to the dilation).


**Example 2:  Custom Keras Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class AtrousConv2D(Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size, rate, **kwargs):
        super(AtrousConv2D, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.filters = filters
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.rate = rate
        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='SAME', use_bias=False)


    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv(inputs)
        return tf.nn.atrous_conv2d(x, self.conv.kernel, rate=self.rate, padding='SAME')


# Example Usage:
layer = AtrousConv2D(64, (3, 3), rate=2)
output = layer(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)

```

This builds a custom Keras layer for more control.  This allows you to encapsulate the atrous convolution within a more structured Keras architecture. Note that the bias is removed from the internal `Conv2D` layer to ensure consistency;  bias is handled implicitly within the `tf.nn.atrous_conv2d` function. This approach is beneficial for integrating atrous convolutions seamlessly within complex models.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` with `dilation_rate`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 100, 100, 32))

# Atrous convolution using dilation_rate
atrous_conv = Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), dilation_rate=(2,2), padding='same')(input_tensor)

print(atrous_conv.shape)

```

This most concise approach utilizes the built-in `dilation_rate` argument within the standard `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` layer.  It's the most direct and often the preferred method for its simplicity and integration within the Keras ecosystem.  Setting the `dilation_rate` tuple allows for different dilation rates along height and width dimensions, providing flexibility if needed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of atrous convolutions, I would recommend consulting relevant chapters in established deep learning textbooks focusing on convolutional neural networks.  Additionally, review papers specifically addressing the application of atrous convolutions in various computer vision and signal processing tasks provide invaluable practical insights and advanced techniques.  Finally, exploring the TensorFlow documentation on the `tf.nn.atrous_conv2d` function and the Keras `Conv2D` layer's parameters will solidify your grasp of their functionalities.  These resources combined offer a comprehensive foundation for effective implementation and optimization.
