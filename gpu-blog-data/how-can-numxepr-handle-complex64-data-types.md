NumExpr's handling of complex64 data types is fundamentally determined by its reliance on optimized vectorized operations, which directly impacts performance and the types of operations supported.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations for computational fluid dynamics heavily leveraged NumExpr, and I encountered numerous scenarios requiring precise control over complex number manipulation.  Crucially, while NumExpr does not explicitly define a dedicated `complex64` type, its support stems from its underlying NumPy integration, where `complex64` is a standard dtype.  The key is understanding this indirect relationship to correctly utilize the library's capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NumExpr operates by translating expressions into optimized C code that utilizes vectorized instructions for significantly enhanced performance, particularly with larger arrays. This translation process inherently relies on NumPy's data structures and type handling. When you supply a NumPy array with `dtype=complex64`, NumExpr leverages NumPy's internal functions to handle the complex arithmetic.  It does not perform any special internal casting or type conversion specifically for `complex64`.  Therefore, all standard arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`) and many NumPy ufuncs (universal functions) will work correctly, provided they are compatible with complex numbers.  However, the behavior is strictly dictated by NumPy's rules for complex arithmetic.

The limitation lies in operations not directly supported by NumPy's ufuncs for complex numbers.  For instance, highly specialized functions might require explicit handling using NumPy itself before or after passing to NumExpr.  In such cases, the efficiency gain from using NumExpr might be limited or even negated by the overhead of pre- and post-processing.  Always benchmark to determine if NumExpr offers a performance advantage for a specific complex number operation.

Another important consideration is memory usage.  `complex64` uses 8 bytes per element, double the size of a float32.  Large arrays will consequently consume more memory.  This should be taken into account when planning computations and allocating resources, especially in resource-constrained environments.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Arithmetic**

```python
import numpy as np
import numexpr as ne

a = np.array([1+2j, 3+4j, 5+6j], dtype=np.complex64)
b = np.array([7+8j, 9+10j, 11+12j], dtype=np.complex64)

c = ne.evaluate("a + b")
d = ne.evaluate("a * b")
e = ne.evaluate("a / b")

print("Addition:\n", c)
print("Multiplication:\n", d)
print("Division:\n", e)
```

This example demonstrates straightforward arithmetic operations on `complex64` arrays. NumExpr seamlessly handles the complex arithmetic, relying on NumPy's underlying functionality.  The output will correctly reflect the complex number results.  The `ne.evaluate` function is central to leveraging NumExpr's capabilities.


**Example 2:  NumPy Ufuncs**

```python
import numpy as np
import numexpr as ne

a = np.array([1+2j, 3+4j, 5+6j], dtype=np.complex64)

b = ne.evaluate("abs(a)") #Absolute value
c = ne.evaluate("np.conjugate(a)") #Complex conjugate
d = ne.evaluate("np.angle(a)") #Phase angle


print("Absolute values:\n", b)
print("Conjugates:\n", c)
print("Angles:\n", d)
```

This illustrates the use of NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs) within NumExpr expressions.  Functions like `abs`, `conjugate`, and `angle` are inherently designed to handle complex numbers, ensuring correct results when used with NumExpr.  The `np` prefix correctly imports and references the NumPy functions within the NumExpr context.


**Example 3:  Conditional Logic with Complex Numbers (Illustrating Limitations)**

```python
import numpy as np
import numexpr as ne

a = np.array([1+2j, 3+4j, 5+6j, 0+0j], dtype=np.complex64)

#Direct comparison of complex numbers to zero can be problematic due to floating-point imprecision
# This necessitates explicit handling for robust comparison
real_parts = np.real(a)
imaginary_parts = np.imag(a)

#Condition applied only on magnitudes
magnitudes = ne.evaluate("sqrt(real_parts**2 + imaginary_parts**2)")

b = ne.evaluate("where(magnitudes > 1, a, 0+0j)")

print("Result of conditional operation based on magnitude: \n", b)

```

This demonstrates a situation where NumExpr might need supplementary NumPy operations.  Direct comparisons of complex numbers for conditional logic (e.g., `a > 0`) can be problematic due to floating-point representation imprecision.  Therefore, a magnitude-based comparison is utilized. The condition (`magnitudes > 1`) is evaluated efficiently by NumExpr; however, the selection of values (where clause) is achieved through NumPy's `where` function to maintain the complex number nature of the output.  This showcases scenarios where a purely NumExpr solution might not be optimal.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official NumExpr documentation.  Thoroughly review the section on supported operations and data types.
* The NumPy documentation, specifically focusing on complex number handling and ufuncs.  Understanding NumPy's behavior is crucial for effective use of NumExpr with complex numbers.
* A book on numerical methods in Python.  This will provide a broader understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts and the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.


In conclusion, NumExpr effectively handles `complex64` data through its seamless integration with NumPy.  While basic arithmetic and many ufuncs are directly supported, complex conditional logic or specialized operations might demand a more nuanced approach, combining NumExpr's speed with NumPy's functionality for robust and accurate results.  Always benchmark to assess the performance gains of using NumExpr for any specific complex number operation in your code. Remember to consider memory usage when working with the relatively large footprint of `complex64` data.
