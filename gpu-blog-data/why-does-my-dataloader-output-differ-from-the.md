The discrepancy between your DataLoader output and the PyTorch example likely stems from subtle differences in dataset instantiation, particularly concerning how you're handling data transformations and collating functions.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, ranging from image classification to time-series forecasting, points to this as the most frequent source of such inconsistencies.  Let's systematically analyze the possible causes and solutions.

**1.  Dataset Instantiation and Transformation Pipelines:**

PyTorch's `DataLoader` operates on a `Dataset` object.  The `Dataset` defines how your data is accessed and preprocessed.  Any discrepancies between your `Dataset` implementation and the example's will directly impact the `DataLoader` output. A common oversight is neglecting to apply the same transformations within your custom `Dataset` as are applied within the PyTorch example.  These transformations—such as normalization, resizing (for images), or time-series windowing—are crucial. Inconsistent application will inevitably lead to differences in the data fed to the model.

Furthermore, ensure your `Dataset`'s `__getitem__` method accurately retrieves data items corresponding to the indices provided by the `DataLoader`.  A minor indexing error can propagate through the entire process. Verify that your indexing aligns precisely with the example's, particularly if you're dealing with non-sequential data access.

**2. Collate Functions:**

The `collate_fn` argument of the `DataLoader` is frequently overlooked, but it plays a pivotal role in shaping the output.  The `collate_fn` takes a list of data samples from the `Dataset` and combines them into a batch.  If this function isn't defined explicitly, PyTorch uses a default `collate_fn`.  However, this default may not be suitable for all data types.  For example, if you're working with variable-length sequences, the default collate function will fail.  You might need a custom function to pad sequences to a uniform length before batching.  The difference between your custom (or absent) `collate_fn` and the example’s will drastically alter the batch structure.

**3.  Data Loading Order and Randomization:**

While seemingly trivial, the order of data loading significantly impacts experimental reproducibility.  The `DataLoader`'s `shuffle` parameter determines whether the data is shuffled before each epoch. Ensure that your `shuffle` parameter matches the example's. Differences in shuffling could affect the order in which batches are presented to your model, influencing training dynamics and, consequently, the output. Furthermore, ensure your dataset's underlying data storage order is the same as the example dataset, or explicitly specify a deterministic sorting mechanism if order is important for your experiments.


**Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these points with examples.  Assume we are working with a simple image classification task.


**Example 1: Incorrect Transformation in Dataset**

```python
import torch
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Incorrect Dataset: Missing transformation
class MyImageDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_dir):
        self.data = datasets.MNIST(root=data_dir, train=True, download=True)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image, label = self.data[idx]
        return image, label # Missing transformation

# Correct Dataset: Includes transformation
class CorrectImageDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_dir, transform):
        self.data = datasets.MNIST(root=data_dir, train=True, download=True)
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image, label = self.data[idx]
        image = self.transform(image)
        return image, label

transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))])
dataset_incorrect = MyImageDataset('./data')
dataset_correct = CorrectImageDataset('./data', transform)

#DataLoader instantiation (identical for both)
dataloader_incorrect = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset_incorrect, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
dataloader_correct = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset_correct, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)


#Observe the difference in outputs: dataloader_incorrect will have untransformed images
```

This illustrates the crucial role of transformations within the `Dataset`.  `MyImageDataset` omits the necessary transformations, leading to different data being fed to the `DataLoader`.


**Example 2: Custom Collate Function for Variable-Length Sequences**

```python
import torch

def pad_sequences(batch):
    # Assuming batch is a list of tensors of variable length
    max_len = max(len(x) for x in batch)
    padded_batch = [torch.nn.functional.pad(x, (0, max_len - len(x)), 'constant', 0) for x in batch]
    return torch.stack(padded_batch)

# Example usage with a DataLoader
data = [torch.randn(i) for i in range(10, 20)]  # Variable-length sequences
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, batch_size=3, collate_fn=pad_sequences)

for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch.shape) # Observe that all sequences are now padded to the same length.
```

Here, a custom `collate_fn`, `pad_sequences`, is essential for handling variable-length sequences.  Without it, the default `collate_fn` would fail.


**Example 3:  Impact of Shuffle Parameter**

```python
import torch
data = list(range(10)) # Simple dataset
dataloader_shuffled = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)
dataloader_unshuffled = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, batch_size=2, shuffle=False)

print("Shuffled DataLoader:")
for batch in dataloader_shuffled:
    print(batch)

print("\nUnshuffled DataLoader:")
for batch in dataloader_unshuffled:
    print(batch)
```

This demonstrates that altering the `shuffle` parameter from `True` to `False` (or vice-versa) will significantly change the order of batches processed.  If the example utilizes shuffling and your code doesn't, the results will inevitably differ.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections on `Dataset` and `DataLoader`, provide comprehensive explanations.  Thoroughly reviewing these sections and experimenting with various configurations will be invaluable in resolving this issue.  Familiarizing yourself with PyTorch's tutorial examples, particularly those involving custom datasets and complex data structures, is highly advisable. The book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" offers further insights into advanced usage of these components.  Pay close attention to the details within the example code you are comparing against – even seemingly inconsequential details can lead to significant differences in output.  Systematic debugging and careful comparison of your code with the example are key.
