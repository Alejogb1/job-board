Implementing `ReduceLROnPlateau` within a PyTorch Lightning training loop distributed with Horovod necessitates a careful consideration of the reduction strategy employed for the monitored metric.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects using this exact combination highlighted the potential pitfalls of naively averaging metrics across multiple processes. Direct averaging can lead to inaccurate learning rate adjustments, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets or highly variable batch sizes across nodes.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`ReduceLROnPlateau` in PyTorch relies on a single scalar value representing the performance metric to determine if a learning rate reduction is warranted.  In a Horovod-distributed setting, this metric is typically calculated independently on each process.  Simply averaging these values across all processes before feeding them to `ReduceLROnPlateau` is problematic.  The averaged metric may not reflect the true performance across the entire dataset, especially if there's significant data heterogeneity across workers or if communication latency affects data synchronization.  A more robust approach involves using a reduction operation that accounts for the distributed nature of the training.

Horovod provides tools for performing all-reduce operations, which aggregate data across all processes in a consistent manner.  This consistent aggregation is crucial for `ReduceLROnPlateau`'s functionality.  Instead of averaging, we utilize the `horovod.torch.allreduce` function to aggregate the metric, choosing an appropriate reduction operation depending on the nature of the metric (e.g., `horovod.torch.sum` for loss, `horovod.torch.mean` for accuracy).  This guarantees that the scheduler sees a globally consistent value, irrespective of data distribution among the nodes.

Furthermore, the choice of the metric to monitor must be made carefully.  The chosen metric should directly reflect the training objective and be robust to stochasticity inherent in mini-batch training.  Over-fitting on a noisy metric can trigger unnecessary learning rate reductions, harming the training process.  For instance, while validation accuracy is a widely used metric, it can be noisy, especially in early training stages.  Alternatively, a smoothed version of the metric, or a metric aggregated over a larger number of epochs, might provide a more stable signal for the learning rate scheduler.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Implementation with Validation Loss:**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch
import horovod.torch as hvd

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... model definition ...

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # ... training logic ...
        loss = self.calculate_loss(batch)
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        return loss

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # ... validation logic ...
        loss = self.calculate_loss(batch)
        self.log('val_loss', loss)
        return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min', patience=3)
        return {
            'optimizer': optimizer,
            'lr_scheduler': {
                'scheduler': scheduler,
                'monitor': 'val_loss'
            }
        }

    def on_validation_end(self):
        # Horovod all-reduce for validation loss
        val_loss = self.trainer.callback_metrics['val_loss']
        reduced_val_loss = hvd.allreduce(val_loss, op=hvd.Sum) / hvd.size()
        self.trainer.callback_metrics['val_loss'] = reduced_val_loss

# Initialize Horovod
hvd.init()

# ... trainer setup ...
```

This example demonstrates a basic integration. The `on_validation_end` hook performs the all-reduce on the validation loss before the `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler evaluates it.  Note the crucial division by `hvd.size()` to obtain the average across all processes post-summation. This averaging is pertinent to a summed metric like loss.

**Example 2: Using a Custom Metric with Horovod:**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch
import horovod.torch as hvd

class MyMetric(pl.metrics.Metric):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.add_state("sum", default=torch.tensor(0.0), dist_reduce_fx="sum")
        self.add_state("count", default=torch.tensor(0), dist_reduce_fx="sum")

    def update(self, preds, target):
        self.sum += preds.sum()
        self.count += preds.numel()

    def compute(self):
        return self.sum / self.count

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    # ... model definition and training steps as before ...

    def configure_optimizers(self):
        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        my_metric = MyMetric()
        scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'max', patience=3)
        return {
            'optimizer': optimizer,
            'lr_scheduler': {
                'scheduler': scheduler,
                'monitor': 'my_metric' # Custom metric name
            }
        }

    def validation_epoch_end(self, outputs):
        #compute the metric, avoiding unnecessary all-reduce for each batch
        my_metric = MyMetric()
        for output in outputs:
            my_metric.update(output['preds'], output['target'])
        self.log('my_metric', my_metric, prog_bar=True)

# ... Horovod initialization and trainer setup ...
```

Here, a custom metric `MyMetric` leverages PyTorch Lightning's built-in distributed capabilities, automatically handling the reduction operation.  This eliminates the need for manual `hvd.allreduce` in `validation_epoch_end`. This approach is cleaner and more efficient than manual handling.

**Example 3: Handling potential NaN values:**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch
import horovod.torch as hvd
import numpy as np

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    # ... model definition ...
    def on_validation_end(self):
        val_loss = self.trainer.callback_metrics['val_loss']
        #handle potential NaN values
        val_loss = np.nan_to_num(val_loss) #replace NaN with 0
        reduced_val_loss = hvd.allreduce(val_loss, op=hvd.Sum) / hvd.size()
        self.trainer.callback_metrics['val_loss'] = reduced_val_loss
    # ...rest of the class...
# ... Horovod initialization and trainer setup ...

```
This example explicitly handles potential `NaN` values that might arise during training, ensuring the scheduler operates correctly even in the presence of numerical instability.  Replacing NaN values with 0 is just one approach; a more sophisticated strategy might involve using a previous valid metric value or triggering an early stopping mechanism.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch Lightning documentation, the Horovod documentation, and a comprehensive textbook on distributed deep learning would prove invaluable resources.  Further, examining existing code repositories implementing distributed training with PyTorch Lightning and Horovod will provide practical examples and best practices.  Focusing on examples involving custom metrics and robust error handling is advised.  Finally, understanding the implications of different all-reduce operations (Sum, Mean, Min, Max) in relation to the chosen metric is critical for optimal performance.
