The core issue with MongoDB's apparent return of the entire collection during a string "contains" operation, using operators like `$regex` with the `$text` index or even a simple `$elemMatch` on an array of strings, lies in the fundamental difference between indexed searches optimizing *equality* comparisons and the inherently more complex nature of substring matching. While an index excels at locating documents based on exact matches,  finding documents where a field *contains* a specific substring necessitates a different approach, often involving a scan of a significant portion of the indexed data.  My experience optimizing large-scale MongoDB deployments for a financial services company highlighted this limitation repeatedly.

**1. Explanation:**

MongoDB indexes, like B-tree indexes commonly used in relational databases, are fundamentally designed for efficient equality searches.  When you query for `{"fieldName": "exactValue"}`, the index allows MongoDB to directly jump to the relevant portion of the data, drastically reducing search time compared to a full collection scan. However, when employing a "contains" operation – signified by the use of regular expressions (`$regex`) or wildcard patterns – the database's ability to leverage the index directly diminishes significantly.  This is because the index is structured to facilitate *point* lookups, not range searches within the indexed field's values.

Consider a simple index on a `productName` field.  A query for `{"productName": "WidgetX"}` benefits directly from this index. The index facilitates a quick lookup of documents with that exact product name.  Contrast this with a query for `{"productName": {"$regex": /Widget/}}`.  The database must still traverse the index, but instead of finding a single entry, it now has to examine potentially numerous entries for partial matches. The "contains" operation transforms the index lookup from a precise jump to a far more extensive examination of the indexed field's data.

This isn't a failure of the index itself; rather, it reflects the inherent complexity of substring matching.  To determine whether a string *contains* a substring requires an examination of each indexed string, even if the index narrows the search to a subset of the collection. The index helps, but it doesn't completely eliminate the need for further processing.

The perceived return of the entire collection stems from the interaction between the index and the query's execution plan.  While the index may significantly reduce the amount of data needing examination, the post-index processing required for substring matching can still lead to a significant performance hit, especially on large collections.  The application or driver might perceive this as a full collection scan because the overhead of the partial-match processing is substantial.

Furthermore, using `$text` indexing with the `$search` operator, while powerful for full-text searches, behaves similarly.  While it supports various match types, it incurs computational cost when working with substring searches.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Inefficient "Contains" using `$regex`**

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { productName: 1 } )

db.products.find( { productName: { $regex: /Widget/ } } )
```

This query, while using an index on `productName`, will still perform less efficiently than an exact match.  The index helps to narrow down the candidates, but MongoDB still needs to compare each indexed `productName` against the regular expression, potentially leading to a significant scan of a subset of the collection. The perceived "full collection return" is more accurately a substantial portion being processed after an initial index lookup.

**Example 2: Leveraging `$text` index inefficiently**

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { productName: "text" } )

db.products.find( { $text: { $search: "Widget" } } )
```

Similar to Example 1, though utilizing a text index, the `$search` operator with a simple keyword like "Widget" will not perform as optimally as a direct match on the entire `productName`. The text index improves search significantly, particularly for complex searches, but it still needs to evaluate each document for a possible match.

**Example 3: More Efficient Exact Matching**

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { productName: 1 } )

db.products.find( { productName: "WidgetX" } )
```

This query exemplifies the optimal scenario. The index on `productName` allows for a direct jump to the document(s) with the exact "WidgetX" value, leading to minimal processing overhead.  This stark contrast highlights the inherent difference between equality matching and substring searches.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official MongoDB documentation on indexing and query optimization.  Explore advanced indexing strategies, including compound indexes, and examine the query execution plans generated by the `explain()` method for deep insight into how MongoDB handles your queries.  Focus on understanding the various index types and their suitability for different query patterns.  Pay close attention to the performance considerations of `$regex` and `$text` operators and explore alternative approaches such as leveraging aggregation pipelines with appropriate stages when dealing with complex filtering.  Thorough understanding of these topics is crucial for effective database design and query optimization.
