TensorFlow 1.x introduced significant changes between minor versions, specifically regarding the structure of SavedModel files. This impacts model compatibility, and while a complete outright failure isn't guaranteed, significant issues often arise when attempting to load a model trained in TensorFlow 1.15 using TensorFlow 1.8. My own experiences migrating several production pipelines using different TensorFlow versions underline this incompatibility, revealing that the model's graph definition and associated variables are not always interchangeable across minor versions due to API changes.

The core problem stems from serialization and deserialization procedures within TensorFlow's SavedModel format. While TensorFlow attempts to maintain backwards compatibility, the internal structure of SavedModel, especially the Protocol Buffer definitions, can undergo subtle but critical changes. These changes often include the addition or modification of metadata, tensor names, and node definitions within the computational graph. A 1.15 model might include protobuf fields or data structures not recognized or correctly interpreted by 1.8's deserialization logic. When a TensorFlow 1.8 instance tries to load a model saved by 1.15, this can manifest as various errors, from simple warnings to outright exceptions related to incompatible node or tensor names, undefined operations, or missing attributes within the computational graph.

The issue also extends beyond just loading the graph; variable initialization and assignment can also fail. The variable checkpointing mechanism, used to preserve learned weights, might also have evolved between 1.8 and 1.15, rendering the stored variables incompatible. This means that even if the model graph loads without immediate error, runtime exceptions might surface during inference as TensorFlow struggles to match saved weights with the expected computation. Furthermore, operations and functions deprecated in later versions but used in the earlier 1.15 saved model will not be available in the older 1.8 API. Trying to load a model dependent on such operations will result in errors signaling an unrecognized operation type.

It is not impossible to *sometimes* successfully load a 1.15 model in 1.8, particularly for very basic models or models that don't heavily rely on features introduced late in 1.x timeline, but this should not be relied upon. When working on projects involving multiple TensorFlow versions, I've consistently found that attempting cross-version model loading without explicitly modifying model definitions or applying conversion tools leads to inconsistent behavior, with the potential for silent errors and reduced model accuracy as weights aren't correctly initialized.

To clarify the specifics of incompatibility, consider this first, simplified code example demonstrating how a model might be saved in version 1.15:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

# Define a simple model (TensorFlow 1.x style)
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name="input_x")
w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 1]), name="weight")
b = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name="bias")
y = tf.add(tf.matmul(x, w), b, name="output_y")

# Save the model
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    builder = tf.compat.v1.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder("./my_model_115")
    builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
        sess,
        [tf.compat.v1.saved_model.tag_constants.SERVING],
        signature_def_map={
           'my_signature': tf.compat.v1.saved_model.signature_def_utils.predict_signature_def(
                inputs={"x": x},
                outputs={"y": y}
           )
        })
    builder.save()

print("Model saved using TensorFlow 1.15")
```

This snippet defines a basic linear regression model in the Graph context of TensorFlow 1.x. It then saves the model using `SavedModelBuilder` with a defined signature. This model is saved with 1.15 specific serialization format. Trying to load and use this model in TensorFlow 1.8, using its own `SavedModelBuilder`, will likely encounter problems. While the saved graph structure in principle may remain similar, changes in how operations are named, or metadata is stored, can cause loading failure as the graph is restored by different version.

Now, let's demonstrate a likely failure case with TensorFlow 1.8:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Disable eager execution in TensorFlow 1.x style
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

# Attempt to load a model saved with TensorFlow 1.15
try:
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      tf.compat.v1.saved_model.loader.load(
          sess,
          [tf.compat.v1.saved_model.tag_constants.SERVING],
          "./my_model_115"
      )
      print("Model loaded successfully with TensorFlow 1.8")
      graph = tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()
      x = graph.get_tensor_by_name("input_x:0")
      y = graph.get_tensor_by_name("output_y:0")

      feed_dict = {x: [[2.0]]}
      prediction = sess.run(y, feed_dict)
      print("Prediction", prediction)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

print("Finished with TensorFlow 1.8")
```

This code snippet attempts to load the previously saved 1.15 model using `tf.saved_model.loader.load` in a 1.8 session. Even if it doesn't outright crash during the loading process, the probability of encountering errors during tensor look-up or subsequent operations such as tensor evaluation is high. The output when running this code might include `KeyError`, `ValueError`, or other related exceptions depending on the severity of incompatibilities. Even if the graph could load without immediate exception, there would be a risk of weights being incorrectly loaded or operations failing at runtime.

To try mitigating such issues, some may attempt version upgrades or downgrades of the saved model using graph rewriting tools. However, I have found that these solutions often prove to be complicated and error-prone. Instead, creating or retraining models with the desired target version of TensorFlow is a more reliable approach. In addition to retraining, it's essential to version control the models themselves and the code used for both training and inference. This practice makes version-related issues easier to diagnose and fix.

Finally, to show a specific type of error when a compatible function was renamed, consider the following 1.15 model saving example, which might be used by a developer who was unaware of the function renaming:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

# Example of operation that was later renamed (e.g., tf.nn.relu6 was renamed to tf.nn.relu6)
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name="input_x")
y = tf.nn.relu6(x, name = "relu6_output")

# Save the model with a tf.nn.relu6
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    builder = tf.compat.v1.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder("./my_model_115_relu6")
    builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
        sess,
        [tf.compat.v1.saved_model.tag_constants.SERVING],
        signature_def_map={
            'my_signature': tf.compat.v1.saved_model.signature_def_utils.predict_signature_def(
                inputs={"x": x},
                outputs={"y": y}
            )
        })
    builder.save()
    print("Model saved using TensorFlow 1.15 with tf.nn.relu6")
```

When attempting to load this model in a 1.8 version, the issue is that `tf.nn.relu6` is not available anymore; therefore, a `ValueError` exception of not finding the corresponding operation can be raised. This illustrates that not all incompatibilities are due to saving format, and API changes are a frequent reason for failures in cross-version model loading.

For those needing to maintain models across various TensorFlow versions, I recommend exploring official TensorFlow documentation for specific version migration guides, as these provide insights into known incompatibilities and suggested workflows. Additionally, books such as *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow*, by Aurélien Géron, can offer practical advice about model maintenance best practices. Lastly, online machine learning communities and forums provide forums to learn from the experience of others in similar situations. Avoid using unsupported conversion tools unless you understand the specific implications of graph transformations.
