The core issue with `exec.Command` not outputting to `stdout` when using `cmd.Process.Wait()` stems from a misunderstanding of how process I/O buffering and asynchronous operations interact.  In my experience debugging complex system administration scripts, I've encountered this numerous times. The `Wait()` function, while seemingly straightforward, doesn't inherently guarantee the immediate flushing of buffered output from the child process.  The child process writes to its standard output, but this output remains in the operating system's buffers until it's explicitly flushed, or until the buffer is full enough to trigger a flush.  The parent process, waiting with `Wait()`, only blocks until the child process terminates; it doesn't actively manage the child's output stream.


This behavior is not a bug but a consequence of how operating systems optimize I/O.  Writing to a stream doesn't automatically translate to immediate visibility on the parent's console.  The operating system employs buffering to enhance efficiency.  Consequently, to ensure that a child process's `stdout` is visible to the parent, we must explicitly handle the output stream, typically by reading it concurrently with the execution of the child process.  Failing to do so leads to the observed behavior: the command executes successfully, `Wait()` returns, indicating completion, but no output is visible.


**Explanation:**

The `exec.Command` function initiates a new process.  By default, the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) of this child process are buffered.  The `cmd.Process.Wait()` method simply waits for the child process to complete.  It does *not* actively read or manage the child process's I/O streams. The child process writes data to its buffer, but this data remains in the OS buffer until it's full and automatically flushed or until a read operation occurs on the parent process's side consuming that buffer.  This separation is crucial to understand. The parent and child are independent processes, each with its own I/O streams and buffers.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Handling (No Output)**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

func main() {
	cmd := exec.Command("sleep", "2", "& echo 'Hello from child process'")
	err := cmd.Run()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Parent process finished")
}
```

In this example, `echo`'s output is buffered by the shell and, critically, likely not flushed before the sleep command completes.  While `cmd.Run()` implicitly waits, it doesn't actively manage the `stdout` stream. Therefore, "Hello from child process" likely will not appear. The shell's buffer management is a confounding factor here, adding to the complexity.  If the `echo` command produces a large output, it might flush its buffer, but this is unreliable.


**Example 2: Correct Handling with `Output`**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

func main() {
	cmd := exec.Command("bash", "-c", "sleep 2; echo 'Hello from child process'") //using bash for consistent shell behaviour
	out, err := cmd.Output()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Output:", string(out))
	fmt.Println("Parent process finished")
}
```

Here, `cmd.Output()` captures the `stdout` of the child process.  This actively reads the output stream, forcing the buffer to flush and ensuring the output is available to the parent.  This is a direct and robust solution, preferable when the output size is manageable.  However, `Output` will block until the command completes, limiting its use for long running processes.


**Example 3: Correct Handling with Concurrent Reading (for large or streaming output)**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os/exec"
)

func main() {
	cmd := exec.Command("bash", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Streaming output'; sleep 1; done")
	stdout, err := cmd.StdoutPipe()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating stdout pipe:", err)
		return
	}
	err = cmd.Start()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error starting command:", err)
		return
	}

	go func() {
		io.Copy(os.Stdout, stdout)
	}()

	//Allow some output to appear before the process is killed (demonstration only)
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	err = cmd.Process.Kill() //Kill after 5 seconds to avoid infinite loop
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error killing command:", err)
		return
	}
	cmd.Wait() //Wait for the process to actually exit after kill.

	fmt.Println("\nParent process finished")
}
```

This example demonstrates a more sophisticated approach. `cmd.StdoutPipe()` creates a pipe connected to the child process's `stdout`. A goroutine concurrently reads from this pipe and writes to the parent's `stdout`.  This method handles streaming output effectively, even for long-running or large-output commands.  Note the necessity of error handling, `cmd.Start()` and explicit termination.  This pattern is crucial for applications requiring real-time interaction with the child process.

In conclusion, the apparent lack of output from `exec.Command` when using `cmd.Process.Wait()` is not a fundamental limitation but a consequence of buffered I/O and the asynchronous nature of process execution.  Proper handling of the child process's `stdout` through techniques such as `cmd.Output()`, `cmd.StdoutPipe()` with concurrent reading, is essential to guarantee that output is visible to the parent process.  Choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific needs of your application concerning output volume and timing requirements.  Always remember that error handling is paramount when working with external processes.
