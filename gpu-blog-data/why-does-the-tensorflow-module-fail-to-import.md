TensorFlow’s import behavior, where it succeeds in a terminal and JupyterLab but fails within a Jupyter Notebook, typically stems from nuanced differences in environment management and process execution. I’ve encountered this exact issue on several project deployments, especially when dealing with complex virtual environments and specific kernel configurations. The core problem usually isn't with TensorFlow itself, but rather how Jupyter Notebook manages its Python interpreter process and interacts with virtual environments, compared to JupyterLab and a standard terminal.

Jupyter Notebook’s isolated kernel execution model is the primary contributor. When you start a Jupyter Notebook, it launches a separate Python kernel process that’s responsible for running the code in each cell. This kernel isn’t necessarily inheriting the same environment configurations as the terminal from which the notebook server was started, nor is it directly linked to the environment configuration of a JupyterLab instance.  JupyterLab, while also using kernels, generally shares more state and environment awareness with the server process due to its architecture, making it less prone to these issues. The terminal, when executing a Python script, usually directly utilizes the currently activated environment.

The critical factor is often the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable and how it’s resolved during import operations. This variable dictates the directories the Python interpreter searches for modules. In many cases, your virtual environment, which contains the TensorFlow installation, is activated correctly in the terminal and potentially in JupyterLab due to server-level environment inheritance. However, the kernel started for a Jupyter Notebook may not be inheriting or correctly configuring this environment variable, causing it to look for TensorFlow in the system’s default Python installation or in locations where the package is not available. Furthermore, there could be conflicts with other package versions or specific environment settings within the notebook kernel process that aren’t present elsewhere.

To further explain this behavior, let's consider a few scenarios with code examples. First, suppose we have a virtual environment `venv_tf` where TensorFlow is installed:

**Example 1: Direct import attempt in Jupyter Notebook (Failure Scenario)**

```python
# Jupyter Notebook cell execution
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__) # This will raise an ImportError
```

In this very simple scenario, if the kernel is not configured to use the `venv_tf` environment, the import will fail. This is because the kernel’s interpreter cannot find the TensorFlow module in its search path. The resulting traceback typically indicates that `tensorflow` could not be found. The Jupyter Notebook kernel is not automatically activating virtual environments; it is using its own context.

**Example 2: Demonstrating the correct path with sys and os (Diagnostic)**

```python
# Jupyter Notebook cell execution
import sys
import os

print("Current Python Executable:", sys.executable)
print("PYTHONPATH:", os.environ.get("PYTHONPATH"))
print("Python sys.path:", sys.path)
```

This code will output the Python executable being used by the Jupyter Notebook kernel, the `PYTHONPATH` as the notebook kernel perceives it, and the interpreter’s search paths from `sys.path`. Examining these outputs is crucial. If the printed Python executable is not the one within the activated virtual environment, then that is the main cause. Similarly, if the printed `PYTHONPATH` does not contain the path to the `site-packages` directory in your virtual environment, this further points toward a kernel environment configuration problem.

**Example 3: Explicitly Modifying sys.path (Workaround)**

```python
# Jupyter Notebook cell execution
import sys
import os
#This needs to be modified to have the location of your virtual environment’s ‘site-packages’
env_path = "/path/to/your/venv_tf/lib/python3.x/site-packages" 

if env_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(env_path)

import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__) #Import succeeds after path modification
```

This code example manually appends the location of your virtual environment’s site-packages directory to the Python path for the current session. While it is an effective workaround, it isn't the ideal solution for a stable project environment. Directly manipulating the `sys.path` should be treated as a temporary debugging tactic, rather than a recommended long-term solution due to its potential interference with other modules.

The best approach is to properly configure your Jupyter Notebook kernel so that it is associated with the correct environment. This involves either creating a new kernel specifically for your virtual environment or modifying the existing kernel configuration.  The process usually starts by activating your desired virtual environment and then installing `ipykernel` package within it. Then, using the `ipython kernel install` command, the environment's path becomes registered as a potential kernel for Jupyter Notebook, and when launching the notebook interface, you choose to load the notebook using your custom created kernel. This allows for each notebook’s kernel to be configured at launch.

From my experience,  a thorough understanding of virtual environment management and kernel configurations are required to resolve such issues. The failure of TensorFlow imports exclusively in Jupyter Notebook is not a flaw of TensorFlow itself; it reflects the unique environment interaction model that Jupyter Notebook employs. Always verify the Python executable and the search paths within your Jupyter Notebook kernel to locate the underlying source of the import errors. 

For further exploration of these areas, I would suggest researching topics such as 'Python virtual environments',  'Jupyter Kernel specifications,' and 'configuring kernel environments for Jupyter Notebook.' Understanding process inheritance and environment variables within a Python context will also be of value when debugging these situations. Specifically look for guides explaining `ipykernel` and `venv` or `virtualenv`. Also consider looking at detailed explanations of the `sys` module within Python, which allows inspection of the current runtime context.
