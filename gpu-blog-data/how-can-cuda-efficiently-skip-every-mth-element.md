Efficiently skipping every Mth element in an array iteration within a CUDA kernel necessitates a nuanced understanding of memory access patterns and thread organization.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations involving spatiotemporal data revealed that naive approaches, such as conditional branching within the kernel, frequently lead to significant performance bottlenecks due to divergence and reduced memory coalescing.  The key lies in structuring the kernel launch and thread indexing to directly access only the desired elements, thereby eliminating the overhead of conditional checks within the inner loop.

The most efficient strategy involves carefully crafting the thread index and the array access within the kernel to inherently skip the unwanted elements. This avoids conditional branching at the cost of potentially processing some unnecessary indices (outside the array bounds). However, this overhead is typically far less than the performance penalty of branching divergence.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental principle relies on exploiting the modulo operator.  Instead of iterating through every element and then conditionally skipping, we directly calculate the indices of the elements we *want* to process.  Let's assume we have an array of size `N` and we want to skip every `M`th element.  The indices of the elements we will process are given by the following formula:

`index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * M + threadIdx.x * M + offset`

Where:

* `blockIdx.x` is the index of the block in the grid.
* `blockDim.x` is the number of threads per block.
* `threadIdx.x` is the index of the thread within the block.
* `M` is the skip factor (every Mth element).
* `offset` is an integer in the range [0, M-1], used to process non-consecutive elements.  By varying `offset` across kernel launches, one can process all elements efficiently in multiple launches.


This formula directly computes the index of the element to be processed, bypassing the need for an `if` condition within the kernel's main loop.  The choice of `blockDim.x` and the number of blocks should be carefully selected to maximize occupancy and memory coalescing.  Furthermore, the use of shared memory can significantly enhance performance for larger arrays by reducing global memory accesses.  However, the shared memory size should be chosen carefully to avoid exceeding the limit and thus affecting performance negatively.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Implementation (No Shared Memory)**

```cuda
__global__ void skipMthElement(const float* input, float* output, int N, int M) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * M + threadIdx.x * M;
  if (i < N) {
    output[i / M] = input[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization, etc.) ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock * M - 1) / (threadsPerBlock * M);

  skipMthElement<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(input, output, N, M);

  // ... (Error checking, data retrieval, etc.) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental concept.  Note the use of integer division (`i / M`) to index the `output` array. This maps the selected input elements to the appropriate positions in the output array which only contains the elements which weren't skipped.  The `if` statement is required to handle cases where `i` exceeds `N`, ensuring that we don't access memory outside the array bounds.  The calculation of `blocksPerGrid` ensures all elements within array bounds are processed.


**Example 2: Utilizing Shared Memory**

```cuda
__global__ void skipMthElementShared(const float* input, float* output, int N, int M) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[256]; // Adjust size as needed

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * M + threadIdx.x * M;
  int sharedIndex = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[sharedIndex] = input[i];
  } else {
    sharedData[sharedIndex] = 0; //Fill with a default value
  }

  __syncthreads(); //Synchronize threads within the block

  if (i < N) {
    output[i / M] = sharedData[sharedIndex];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization, etc.) ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock * M - 1) / (threadsPerBlock * M);

  skipMthElementShared<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(input, output, N, M);

  // ... (Error checking, data retrieval, etc.) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This refined version leverages shared memory to reduce global memory accesses. Each thread loads a section of the input array into shared memory, performs the necessary operations, and then writes the result to global memory.  `__syncthreads()` ensures all threads within a block have completed their shared memory operations before proceeding.  The size of `sharedData` is crucial and should be carefully adjusted based on available shared memory and the problem size.



**Example 3: Handling Multiple Kernel Launches for Complete Coverage (Offset)**

```cuda
__global__ void skipMthElementOffset(const float* input, float* output, int N, int M, int offset) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * M + threadIdx.x * M + offset;
  if (i < N) {
      output[ (i - offset) / M] = input[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization, etc.) ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock * M - 1) / (threadsPerBlock * M);

  for(int k=0; k<M; ++k){
      skipMthElementOffset<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(input, output + (k * N/M), N, M, k);
  }

  // ... (Error checking, data retrieval, etc.) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example addresses the challenge of handling cases where `M` doesn't divide `N` evenly. By using a loop and changing the `offset` in each iteration, we cover all elements across multiple kernel launches. The output array must be properly sized to accommodate the result of skipping every `M`th element. The `output` array is correctly addressed by incrementing the pointer in each iteration based on `k`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* CUDA Programming Guide
* NVIDIA CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide
*  A comprehensive textbook on parallel computing and GPU programming.
*  Documentation for your specific CUDA-capable GPU architecture.


These resources provide detailed information on CUDA programming, memory management, and performance optimization techniques that are crucial for efficient kernel development.  Careful consideration of these factors, along with appropriate profiling and benchmarking, will be critical in achieving optimal performance for your specific application.  Remember that the optimal approach will heavily depend on the specific values of `N` and `M`, along with the available hardware resources.
