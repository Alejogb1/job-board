TensorFlow Keras' `fit_generator`, deprecated in favor of `fit` with `tf.data.Dataset`, does *not* utilize the GPU by default.  This is a crucial point often overlooked, leading to significant performance bottlenecks when working with large datasets.  My experience working on a large-scale image classification project for a medical imaging company highlighted this issue precisely.  We initially used `fit_generator` without explicitly specifying GPU usage, resulting in training times that were orders of magnitude slower than anticipated.  The underlying reason stems from the way TensorFlow manages device placement.

**1.  Explanation of GPU Utilization in TensorFlow/Keras**

TensorFlow's execution engine operates on a graph representation of the computation.  The placement of operations within this graph, specifically determining which operations run on the CPU or GPU, is a critical aspect of performance.  While TensorFlow strives for optimal performance by attempting to place computationally intensive operations on available GPUs, it doesn't inherently assume GPU availability or automatically allocate resources to it. This is particularly true for legacy functions like `fit_generator`.  If a GPU is present but not explicitly specified, TensorFlow defaults to the CPU, which significantly impacts training speed, especially for deep learning models.

The absence of automatic GPU utilization is not a design flaw; it's a deliberate choice to maintain flexibility and control.  Many scenarios may necessitate CPU execution, such as debugging, using specialized libraries with CPU-only implementations, or working on systems with limited resources.  Therefore, the burden of specifying device placement rests with the user.

Several mechanisms exist to direct TensorFlow to utilize the GPU.  The most straightforward approach involves configuring the session or using the `tf.device` context manager.  The advent of `tf.data.Dataset` and its integration with the `fit` method streamlines this process, offering more efficient data pipeline management that implicitly manages device placement more effectively compared to `fit_generator`. However, understanding the underlying mechanism remains crucial, even with modern workflows.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  CPU Execution (Incorrect)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... Model definition ...

model.fit_generator(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10)
```

This code snippet, while functional, executes entirely on the CPU.  The `fit_generator` function does not automatically detect or utilize available GPUs.  This results in significantly slower training times.  The observed performance would be identical if `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` were set to an empty string in the environment.


**Example 2: GPU Execution using `tf.config.set_visible_devices` (Correct)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... Model definition ...

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

model.fit_generator(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10)
```

This example utilizes the `tf.config.list_physical_devices` function to check for available GPUs.  The `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` function is crucial for efficient memory management, allowing TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed instead of reserving a fixed amount upfront. This approach addresses memory constraints that could arise, especially in environments with multiple GPUs. The `fit_generator` call now runs on the GPU if available, resulting in faster training.


**Example 3:  GPU Execution with `tf.device` context manager (Illustrative, less preferred with `fit_generator`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... Model definition ...

with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Assumes a GPU with index 0 is available.  Adjust index as needed.
    model.fit_generator(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10)
```

This demonstrates using the `tf.device` context manager.  This explicitly places the `fit_generator` call on the specified GPU. While functional, this is less robust than using `tf.config.set_visible_devices`. This method only works if a GPU is available and the correct index is provided.  It also lacks the memory management benefits of `set_memory_growth`. This approach is less preferred for modern practices, particularly when considering the deprecation of `fit_generator`.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, especially sections covering device placement and `tf.data.Dataset`, is indispensable.  Further, exploring tutorials and examples focusing on GPU acceleration in TensorFlow, particularly those demonstrating efficient data loading pipelines, are vital for practical understanding.  Finally, a deep understanding of the TensorFlow execution graph and its optimization strategies will provide a firm foundation for troubleshooting performance issues.  Familiarizing oneself with various profiling tools for TensorFlow will allow for in-depth performance analysis and optimization.
