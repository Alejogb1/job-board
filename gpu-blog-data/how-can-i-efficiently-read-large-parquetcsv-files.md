Large datasets, especially those in columnar formats like Parquet and CSV, present a significant bottleneck when training deep learning models with PyTorch. Directly loading the entire dataset into memory before creating a `DataLoader` is impractical and can lead to `OutOfMemoryError`. I've faced this issue numerous times while working on large-scale image classification tasks and found that an iterative, chunk-based approach is essential for efficiency. This involves reading data in manageable segments, processing it, and feeding it to the `DataLoader` without holding the complete dataset in RAM.

The crux of the problem lies in the fact that PyTorch's `DataLoader` expects an iterable dataset object, and naive attempts at directly converting large files into these iterables often fail due to memory constraints. The solution involves creating a custom dataset class that handles the data loading, transformation, and iteration process efficiently. This custom class needs to implement `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. The `__len__` should return the number of samples in the dataset (not necessarily the file's total row count if chunking is involved), and `__getitem__` should load and process the sample at the requested index.

For Parquet files, the `pyarrow.parquet` module provides excellent tools for chunked reading. We can use the `ParquetFile` class to access the file and iterate over row groups which are smaller, logical divisions of the data within the file. Similarly, for CSV files, libraries like `pandas` offer methods to read files in chunks, though they are not always optimal for direct `DataLoader` usage.  Iâ€™ve found that processing CSVs in smaller, fixed-sized chunks using generators tends to be more efficient and versatile for subsequent PyTorch tensor conversion. Crucially, we must avoid loading more data than necessary at any single step, and the `__getitem__` method should only load a small portion of the data required for the particular batch.

Here are some examples based on my practical experience:

**Example 1: Reading Parquet files with `pyarrow`**

```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np

class ParquetDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, file_path, batch_size, transforms=None):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.transforms = transforms
        self.parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(self.file_path)
        self.row_group_indices = range(self.parquet_file.num_row_groups)
        self.num_samples = self.parquet_file.metadata.num_rows
        self.samples_per_group = [row_group.num_rows for row_group in self.parquet_file.metadata.row_groups]
        self.cumsum_samples = np.cumsum([0] + self.samples_per_group)

    def __len__(self):
         return self.num_samples

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
      
        row_group_idx = np.searchsorted(self.cumsum_samples, idx + 1, side='right') - 1
        offset = idx - self.cumsum_samples[row_group_idx]
        table = self.parquet_file.read_row_group(row_group_idx, columns=['feature1', 'feature2', 'label'])  # Adjust columns
        
        sample = table.to_pylist()[offset]
        features = torch.tensor([sample['feature1'], sample['feature2']], dtype=torch.float32) # Adjust feature extraction
        label = torch.tensor(sample['label'], dtype=torch.long)


        if self.transforms:
            features = self.transforms(features)
        return features, label

# Example Usage
file_path = 'my_large_data.parquet' # Ensure file exists
batch_size = 32
dataset = ParquetDataset(file_path, batch_size)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) # adjust parameters as needed
```

**Commentary:** This `ParquetDataset` class reads the Parquet file in row group segments. The `__init__` method determines the row group indices and total sample count. The `__getitem__` method maps the input `idx` to a specific row group and offset, reading only the necessary subset of data.  `numpy.searchsorted` provides a performant way of identifying the correct row group based on a sample index. Feature extraction and transformations are applied after data retrieval. Note: the column names ('feature1','feature2','label') and feature conversion (within the `__getitem__` method) are placeholders and should be modified according to your specific data schema.

**Example 2: Reading CSV files with generators**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import pandas as pd

class CSVDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, file_path, chunksize, transforms=None):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.chunksize = chunksize
        self.transforms = transforms
        self.file_iterator = pd.read_csv(self.file_path, chunksize=self.chunksize, iterator=True)
        self.current_chunk = None
        self.current_chunk_idx = 0
        self.total_samples = 0
        for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunksize):
            self.total_samples+=len(chunk)

    def __len__(self):
        return self.total_samples

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        if self.current_chunk is None or idx >= self.current_chunk_idx + len(self.current_chunk):
            try:
                self.current_chunk = next(self.file_iterator)
                self.current_chunk_idx = 0 if self.current_chunk is None else self.total_samples - len(self.current_chunk) - self.total_samples
            except StopIteration:
                raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
                
        relative_idx = idx - self.current_chunk_idx
        sample = self.current_chunk.iloc[relative_idx]

        features = torch.tensor([sample['feature1'], sample['feature2']], dtype=torch.float32) # Adjust columns
        label = torch.tensor(sample['label'], dtype=torch.long)

        if self.transforms:
            features = self.transforms(features)
        return features, label

# Example Usage
file_path = 'my_large_data.csv' # Ensure file exists
batch_size = 32
chunksize = 1024 # Adjust as required
dataset = CSVDataset(file_path, chunksize)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) # adjust parameters as needed
```

**Commentary:** In this `CSVDataset` class, the `pandas.read_csv` function is used with the `iterator=True` argument, which returns a `TextFileReader` object that can iterate over the file in chunks, instead of reading the entire file at once. The `__getitem__` function handles loading new chunks when necessary. The total number of samples is determined in the initialization.  Again, replace `'feature1', 'feature2', 'label'` with the appropriate column names from your CSV data. Adjust the chunksize based on available RAM. The logic to compute `total_samples` is designed to work correctly whether or not the data fully fills every chunk.  The current chunk index `current_chunk_idx` is designed to track the correct location within the large CSV file to ensure the overall behavior is as desired.

**Example 3: Applying Transformations**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import pandas as pd

class TransformationDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, file_path, chunksize, transforms=None):
      self.file_path = file_path
      self.chunksize = chunksize
      self.transforms = transforms
      self.file_iterator = pd.read_csv(self.file_path, chunksize=self.chunksize, iterator=True)
      self.current_chunk = None
      self.current_chunk_idx = 0
      self.total_samples = 0
      for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunksize):
        self.total_samples+=len(chunk)

    def __len__(self):
        return self.total_samples
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        if self.current_chunk is None or idx >= self.current_chunk_idx + len(self.current_chunk):
           try:
                self.current_chunk = next(self.file_iterator)
                self.current_chunk_idx = 0 if self.current_chunk is None else self.total_samples - len(self.current_chunk) - self.total_samples
           except StopIteration:
                raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
        relative_idx = idx - self.current_chunk_idx
        sample = self.current_chunk.iloc[relative_idx]

        features = torch.tensor([sample['feature1'], sample['feature2']], dtype=torch.float32)
        label = torch.tensor(sample['label'], dtype=torch.long)

        if self.transforms:
            features = self.transforms(features)

        return features, label

# Example transformation using torch
def normalize(tensor):
  mean = torch.mean(tensor)
  std = torch.std(tensor)
  return (tensor - mean) / (std + 1e-8) # add a small epsilon value to prevent division by zero

# Example Usage
file_path = 'my_large_data.csv' # Ensure file exists
batch_size = 32
chunksize = 1024 # Adjust as required
dataset = TransformationDataset(file_path, chunksize, transforms=normalize)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) # adjust parameters as needed
```

**Commentary:** This example builds on the CSV reader, showing how to incorporate transformations. A function `normalize` is defined to demonstrate a simple operation (standardization) that applies to each sample. This is passed as the `transforms` parameter when creating the `TransformationDataset` instance. The transformation is then applied in the `__getitem__` method after loading the features. More complex transformations can be implemented either using a function call or a custom class that implements the transformation logic.

These examples demonstrate a basic structure for handling large Parquet and CSV files with PyTorch `DataLoader`. When optimizing data loading, consider experimenting with different chunk sizes and batch sizes to identify the best performance for your hardware and data.

For further understanding of techniques for handling large datasets, I recommend exploring books and documentation on the `pyarrow` and `pandas` libraries, specifically focusing on iterative data processing. Detailed explanations of PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes within the official PyTorch documentation are also invaluable. Articles focusing on best practices for data loading in machine learning pipelines also tend to be very useful. Lastly, understanding the memory hierarchy within modern computer architecture provides a basis for understanding why reading data in smaller pieces is generally much more efficient than reading the entire file in a single step.
