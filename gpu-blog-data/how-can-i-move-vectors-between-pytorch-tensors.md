Moving vectors, represented as elements within PyTorch tensors, between tensors requires a nuanced understanding of tensor operations, especially when shapes and memory layouts differ. I’ve frequently encountered this challenge while building custom neural network layers involving embedding lookups and dynamic attention mechanisms, where data must flow between different tensor representations.  Fundamentally, the task involves manipulating the tensor structure, not simply copying data in a naive way.  Efficiently transferring vectors depends on properly utilizing indexing, reshaping, and broadcasting functionalities to avoid unnecessary memory copies and computational overhead.

The core of the problem lies in recognizing that PyTorch tensors are multi-dimensional arrays, and what we conceptually consider a “vector” is often a sub-array within a larger tensor. To move a vector, we’re actually extracting a specific slice and placing it into a designated location in another tensor. The approach varies greatly based on the relative dimensions of the source and target tensors. If both have the same number of dimensions and identical shapes apart from the dimension along which the vectors are oriented, direct indexing works. However, challenges arise with differing ranks or when the vector needs to be scattered or gathered among many tensors. In these cases, `torch.index_select`, `torch.gather`, or `torch.scatter_add` (along with reshapes) become invaluable. The important thing to remember is that PyTorch does not perform copies when moving a slice but modifies the memory directly if no reshape operation is performed.

Let’s explore three practical examples.

**Example 1: Moving Vectors Between Tensors of Compatible Shapes**

Assume we have two tensors, `source` and `target`, both three-dimensional.  We aim to move a vector, represented by a slice along the second dimension (index 1), from the `source` tensor to the same location in the `target` tensor. Both tensors have equivalent shapes apart from the dimension containing the vector we wish to copy. Here's how I approach it:

```python
import torch

# Create source and target tensors
source = torch.randn(3, 5, 4)
target = torch.zeros(3, 5, 4) # Create a target tensor with all zeros

# Index to the vector (along dim=1, index 1) in source tensor
vector_source = source[:, 1, :]

# Index to the same location in the target tensor
target[:, 1, :] = vector_source

print("Source Tensor (first 2 slices):\n", source[0:2])
print("\nTarget Tensor (first 2 slices):\n", target[0:2])

# Verify if vector has been moved by comparing to the corresponding slice in the source tensor
comparison = (target[:, 1, :] == source[:, 1, :]).all()
print("\nVerification: Vector Moved Successfully:", comparison.item())
```

In this example, the code selects a specific slice from the `source` tensor using standard indexing syntax. Importantly, this slice is a *view*, not a copy.  Then, that view is assigned to the corresponding location in the `target` tensor. Both the view and the target tensor points to the same underlying memory region so the assignment in-place updates the memory.  Verification ensures that the data movement was successful. This method is efficient, avoiding unnecessary data copies. The key here is that the indexing was performed along the dimension that contained vectors (dim=1 in this instance), so that vector shape is preserved when indexing.

**Example 2: Moving a Single Vector to Multiple Locations Using Scattering**

Consider a scenario where we have one source vector and wish to transfer this vector to different locations in a target tensor based on an index mapping. This is akin to embedding lookups, or copying the attention vector to all attention heads for multiheaded attention for example. For instance, we might have a single `source_vector` and a `target_tensor`.  We'll distribute `source_vector` along the second dimension of `target_tensor` to different locations as specified in an `index` tensor. This requires scattering.

```python
import torch

# Source vector
source_vector = torch.randn(4)

# Target tensor (to be populated with copies of source_vector)
target_tensor = torch.zeros(3, 5, 4)

# Index tensor indicating where the source vector should be placed
index = torch.tensor([[0, 2, 3],
                      [1, 4, 2],
                      [3, 1, 4]])

# Prepare the source vector for broadcasting
expanded_source_vector = source_vector.expand(3, 3, -1) # The number of rows and cols in index can vary
                                                         # which is why we expand it

# Create a tensor of indices that match the shape of the expanded vector
batch_indices = torch.arange(3).unsqueeze(1).expand(-1, 3).unsqueeze(2).expand(-1, -1, 4)
vector_indices = torch.arange(3).unsqueeze(0).expand(3, -1).unsqueeze(2).expand(-1,-1,4)
feature_indices = torch.arange(4).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).expand(3,3,-1)

# Use scatter_add to place the source vector to the given indices
target_tensor.scatter_add_(1, index.unsqueeze(2).expand(-1,-1,4), expanded_source_vector)

print("Source Vector:\n", source_vector)
print("\nIndex Tensor:\n", index)
print("\nTarget Tensor (first slice):\n", target_tensor[0])
print("\nTarget Tensor (second slice):\n", target_tensor[1])

#Verification using direct indexing for first sample
verification_1 = (target_tensor[0, index[0], :] == source_vector).all()
verification_2 = (target_tensor[1, index[1], :] == source_vector).all()
verification_3 = (target_tensor[2, index[2], :] == source_vector).all()

print("\nVerification Sample 1:", verification_1.item())
print("\nVerification Sample 2:", verification_2.item())
print("\nVerification Sample 3:", verification_3.item())
```

Here, `torch.scatter_add_` plays the key role. First, the source vector is broadcast to a matching shape of the locations to scatter to.  The `index` tensor contains indices indicating where to insert a particular copy of the `source_vector`. The `scatter_add` operation adds this broadcast vector at the specified locations in the `target_tensor`.  The underbar in the function name implies that the operation modifies the `target_tensor` in-place. We verify that copies of the source vector are correctly placed using indexing with the provided indices.

**Example 3: Gathering Vectors from Different Tensors**

Now, imagine a situation where we want to extract vectors from different slices of a tensor based on an index mapping and consolidate them into a new tensor.  This is common in sequence-to-sequence models where we gather embeddings of input tokens. Assume we have a `source_tensor`, from which we want to gather vectors using an `index` tensor. These vectors will be used to populate a new tensor `target_tensor`.

```python
import torch

# Source tensor
source_tensor = torch.randn(5, 4)

# Index tensor (pointing into the source tensor along dimension 0)
index = torch.tensor([1, 3, 0, 4])

# Target tensor to hold gathered vectors
target_tensor = torch.zeros(4, 4)

# Use index_select to gather the vectors
target_tensor = source_tensor.index_select(0, index)


print("Source Tensor:\n", source_tensor)
print("\nIndex Tensor:\n", index)
print("\nTarget Tensor:\n", target_tensor)

#Verification
verification_1 = (target_tensor[0] == source_tensor[1]).all()
verification_2 = (target_tensor[1] == source_tensor[3]).all()
verification_3 = (target_tensor[2] == source_tensor[0]).all()
verification_4 = (target_tensor[3] == source_tensor[4]).all()

print("\nVerification Sample 1:", verification_1.item())
print("\nVerification Sample 2:", verification_2.item())
print("\nVerification Sample 3:", verification_3.item())
print("\nVerification Sample 4:", verification_4.item())

```

Here, the `torch.index_select` function is used to gather vectors. The `index` tensor provides the indices of the vectors to be extracted from the `source_tensor`. The dimension over which to gather vectors is specified as the first argument and the index tensor as the second argument. The result of the gather operation is placed into `target_tensor`. The output shows the target tensor which now contains the selected vectors. Indexing to verify the result confirms the data movement was successful. The main difference from `torch.gather` is that in `torch.index_select` we specify a location from which we want to extract the vector for each index in the `index` vector, whereas `torch.gather` takes a tensor of indices that are used as coordinate for a single destination vector.

In summary, moving vectors between PyTorch tensors involves carefully using indexing, reshaping, scattering, and gathering to efficiently manipulate tensor data. I've found that a thorough understanding of these techniques is essential for crafting efficient and correct PyTorch models.

For further learning, I strongly suggest investigating the official PyTorch documentation related to tensor indexing, `torch.index_select`, `torch.scatter_add_`, `torch.gather`, and `torch.reshape`, as well as practicing these operations with different tensor shapes and sizes. Reviewing community tutorials on PyTorch tensor manipulation can also provide additional insights. Books focused on deep learning with PyTorch often provide detailed examples of real-world use cases.
