The core challenge in using CUDA compute capability as a `constexpr` with `__launch_bounds__` lies in the dynamic nature of hardware detection at runtime versus the static requirement of `constexpr` evaluation at compile time. While it would be ideal to tailor thread block size based on specific GPU architecture during compilation, directly querying compute capability using CUDA runtime APIs is an operation that occurs only when a CUDA context is initialized, which is definitively a runtime event.

A `constexpr` expression must be resolvable during compilation. This implies that its value must be known without any runtime execution. CUDA runtime function calls, such as those querying device properties (including compute capability), violate this constraint. Therefore, directly using the output of a function like `cudaGetDeviceProperties` within a `constexpr` is not permissible. The CUDA compiler, `nvcc`, will flag such attempts as errors, since the result of the runtime call is not fixed and will depend on the GPU where the program eventually runs.

Furthermore, the `__launch_bounds__` attribute relies on constant integral expressions, which are resolved during the kernel compilation phase. These values set an upper limit on the number of threads within a thread block that can be launched. The primary objective of `__launch_bounds__` is to aid the compiler in optimizing register usage, thus preventing resource exhaustion at runtime when the defined thread block size is too large. Given this context, the ideal way to approach the challenge would be to encode different thread block sizes corresponding to various compute capabilities as distinct constants, and then employ conditional compilation to select the correct constant based on the known compute capabilities of the target GPUs during compilation. This effectively shifts the compute capability check from runtime to compilation, using preprocessor directives to select between different kernel instances or to compute the `__launch_bounds__` value based on target hardware.

To illustrate this, consider the hypothetical scenario where Iâ€™ve been developing a compute-intensive CUDA application targeted at both older and newer GPUs. I needed a mechanism to dynamically optimize thread block sizes at compile time based on the target compute capability to improve kernel efficiency and resource utilization.

Here's a first example demonstrating the incorrect attempt and the problem I encountered:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__device__ int get_compute_capability() {
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0);
    return prop.major * 10 + prop.minor;
}

__global__ void kernel_test(int *out) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}

int main() {
    int out[256];
    int *dev_out;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_out, 256 * sizeof(int));
    
    int compute_cap;
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0);
    compute_cap = prop.major * 10 + prop.minor;
    std::cout << "Compute capability: " << compute_cap << std::endl;


    // This will NOT work, the function cannot be constexpr.
    // constexpr int cc = get_compute_capability();
    //kernel_test<<<1, cc>>>(dev_out);


    kernel_test<<<1, 256>>>(dev_out);
    cudaMemcpy(out, dev_out, 256 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++){
        std::cout << out[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    cudaFree(dev_out);

    return 0;
}
```

This code attempts to retrieve the compute capability inside the device function `get_compute_capability()` and expects to use the result directly as a launch parameter for the kernel and as a `constexpr`. As expected, `nvcc` will issue errors because `cudaGetDeviceProperties` and other CUDA runtime API calls are not valid within `__device__` function. Furthermore, it is also not valid to attempt to call device functions within a `constexpr` context. The key error is in attempting to use the device property in the `constexpr` declaration which is then passed to a kernel launch.

The second example uses a preprocessor-based solution to enable conditional compilation according to target architecture:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

#define CC_30 30
#define CC_35 35
#define CC_50 50
#define CC_60 60
#define CC_70 70

// Example thread block sizes
#if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 700
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 1024;
    #define MY_CC CC_70
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 512;
    #define MY_CC CC_60
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 500
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 256;
    #define MY_CC CC_50
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 350
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 128;
    #define MY_CC CC_35
#else
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 64;
    #define MY_CC CC_30
#endif

__global__ void kernel_test(int *out) __launch_bounds__(THREADS_PER_BLOCK, 1) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}

int main() {
    int out[THREADS_PER_BLOCK];
    int *dev_out;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_out, THREADS_PER_BLOCK * sizeof(int));

    std::cout << "Compiled for compute capability: " << MY_CC << std::endl;

    kernel_test<<<1, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(dev_out);
    cudaMemcpy(out, dev_out, THREADS_PER_BLOCK * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for(int i = 0; i < THREADS_PER_BLOCK; i++){
        std::cout << out[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    cudaFree(dev_out);

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a compile-time approach. The preprocessor macros `__CUDA_ARCH__` and compile-time conditionals are used to determine a constant thread block size `THREADS_PER_BLOCK`, as well as a macro representing the compute capability (`MY_CC`). The `__launch_bounds__` attribute is now used properly with the `THREADS_PER_BLOCK` constant to guide the compiler. Note that the appropriate compute capability is resolved at *compile time* based on the architecture for which the kernel is compiled, using the architecture flag passed to `nvcc`.

Finally, a more complex example showing the use of multiple kernels and device selection is shown below.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

#define CC_30 30
#define CC_35 35
#define CC_50 50
#define CC_60 60
#define CC_70 70
//Kernel declaration
#if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 700
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 1024;
    #define MY_CC CC_70
    __global__ void kernel_optimized_cc70(int *out) __launch_bounds__(THREADS_PER_BLOCK, 1);
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 512;
    #define MY_CC CC_60
    __global__ void kernel_optimized_cc60(int *out) __launch_bounds__(THREADS_PER_BLOCK, 1);
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 500
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 256;
    #define MY_CC CC_50
    __global__ void kernel_optimized_cc50(int *out) __launch_bounds__(THREADS_PER_BLOCK, 1);
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 350
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 128;
    #define MY_CC CC_35
    __global__ void kernel_optimized_cc35(int *out) __launch_bounds__(THREADS_PER_BLOCK, 1);
#else
    constexpr int THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 64;
    #define MY_CC CC_30
    __global__ void kernel_optimized_cc30(int *out) __launch_bounds__(THREADS_PER_BLOCK, 1);
#endif

//Kernel Implementation
#if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 700
__global__ void kernel_optimized_cc70(int *out) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600
__global__ void kernel_optimized_cc60(int *out) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 500
__global__ void kernel_optimized_cc50(int *out) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}
#elif defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) && __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 350
__global__ void kernel_optimized_cc35(int *out) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}
#else
__global__ void kernel_optimized_cc30(int *out) {
    __shared__ int shared_data;
    shared_data = threadIdx.x;
    __syncthreads();
    out[threadIdx.x] = shared_data;
}
#endif



int main() {
    int out[THREADS_PER_BLOCK];
    int *dev_out;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_out, THREADS_PER_BLOCK * sizeof(int));

    std::cout << "Compiled for compute capability: " << MY_CC << std::endl;
    
    #if MY_CC == CC_70
        kernel_optimized_cc70<<<1, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(dev_out);
    #elif MY_CC == CC_60
        kernel_optimized_cc60<<<1, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(dev_out);
    #elif MY_CC == CC_50
        kernel_optimized_cc50<<<1, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(dev_out);
    #elif MY_CC == CC_35
        kernel_optimized_cc35<<<1, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(dev_out);
    #else
        kernel_optimized_cc30<<<1, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>(dev_out);
    #endif

    cudaMemcpy(out, dev_out, THREADS_PER_BLOCK * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for(int i = 0; i < THREADS_PER_BLOCK; i++){
        std::cout << out[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    cudaFree(dev_out);

    return 0;
}
```
This final example is the most complete, where multiple kernel implementations are used for varying compute capabilities and the correct one is selected at compile-time. The selection is done using compiler directives, as before, and the correct kernel is launched depending on the defined `MY_CC`. This allows us to have maximum flexibility for different hardware. The kernel launches are also conditional and based on the `MY_CC` preprocessor directive.

For further learning, I recommend consulting NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA Programming Guide, particularly the sections on compute capabilities and compiler directives. The programming guide will have more detail on device-specific architectural information, including register usage and thread limits. Additionally, exploring examples of CUDA projects that use conditional compilation for platform optimization would offer valuable practical insight. Finally, the C++ documentation concerning preprocessor directives and `constexpr` is fundamental for fully understanding the reasoning behind this technique.
