The core challenge in computing per-sample gradients in PyTorch lies in understanding how automatic differentiation operates within the context of batched computations.  My experience debugging high-dimensional optimization problems has highlighted the crucial distinction between aggregate gradients (across the entire batch) and individual sample gradients.  Simply calling `.backward()` provides the former; obtaining the latter requires a more nuanced approach.  This involves selectively accumulating gradients or employing techniques tailored to handle per-sample computations efficiently.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `autograd` system, by default, accumulates gradients across the entire computational graph. When `.backward()` is invoked on a loss tensor calculated from a batch of samples, the resulting `.grad` attributes of your model's parameters reflect the aggregated gradients, not the individual contributions of each sample. To isolate per-sample gradients, we need to interrupt this accumulation process, effectively creating separate computational graphs for each sample or manipulating the gradient accumulation behavior.  This is important not just for analyzing individual sample contributions to the overall loss but also for algorithms like importance weighting or personalized learning where per-sample gradients are essential.

There are primarily three strategies to achieve this:  (a) iterating through the batch and computing gradients individually; (b) utilizing `torch.no_grad()` context for selective gradient computation; (c) employing techniques involving gradient cloning and accumulation.  Each has its strengths and weaknesses concerning computational efficiency and memory usage, especially for very large batch sizes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Iterative Approach**

This method is straightforward but can be less efficient for large batches.  I've used this extensively in research projects involving analyzing individual data point influence on model predictions.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample model and data
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 10) # Batch size 32
target_tensor = torch.randn(32, 1)

# Loss function and optimizer (not strictly necessary for gradient computation, but included for completeness)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

per_sample_gradients = []

for i in range(input_tensor.shape[0]):
    model.zero_grad() # Crucial to reset gradients for each sample
    single_input = input_tensor[i:i+1] # Selecting single sample
    single_target = target_tensor[i:i+1]
    prediction = model(single_input)
    loss = loss_fn(prediction, single_target)
    loss.backward()

    # Store gradients.  Need to clone to avoid modification by subsequent iterations
    per_sample_gradients.append([p.grad.clone() for p in model.parameters()])

# per_sample_gradients now contains a list of gradient lists for each sample.
# Accessing e.g., gradients for the first sample: per_sample_gradients[0]

```

**Example 2:  `torch.no_grad()` Context**

In situations where you're performing operations on a batch but only need gradients for a subset,  `torch.no_grad()` allows for controlled gradient accumulation. This method proved efficient in my work with large datasets where computing full batch gradients was unnecessary for certain intermediate steps.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Model, data, loss, optimizer defined as in Example 1) ...

model.zero_grad()

with torch.no_grad():
    # Operations that should not contribute to gradients
    intermediate_result = some_function(input_tensor)

# Now compute gradients for selected samples
for i in range(5): # Gradients for samples 0-4
    prediction = model(input_tensor[i:i+1])
    loss = loss_fn(prediction, target_tensor[i:i+1])
    loss.backward()

# Gradients will only reflect the contribution of samples 0-4
```

**Example 3: Gradient Cloning and Accumulation**

This approach requires careful memory management but offers potential efficiency gains for complex models.  I've found this useful when dealing with custom loss functions requiring per-sample gradient manipulation before aggregation.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Model, data, loss, optimizer defined as in Example 1) ...

model.zero_grad()
prediction = model(input_tensor)
loss = loss_fn(prediction, target_tensor)

# Compute aggregate gradients
loss.backward()

per_sample_gradients = []
for i in range(input_tensor.shape[0]):
    cloned_grads = [p.grad.clone() for p in model.parameters()]
    per_sample_gradients.append(cloned_grads)
    model.zero_grad()  # Reset gradients after cloning

# per_sample_gradients now contains per-sample gradients.
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly sections covering `autograd` and the `torch.no_grad()` context manager, are essential resources.  Advanced optimization texts covering automatic differentiation and backpropagation algorithms provide deeper theoretical understanding.  Furthermore, exploring papers focused on efficient gradient computation methods in deep learning can provide valuable insights into handling large-scale datasets and intricate model architectures.  Finally, review tutorials on custom loss functions and gradient manipulation within PyTorch for more specialized applications.
