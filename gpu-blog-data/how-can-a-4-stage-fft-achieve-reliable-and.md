The core challenge in implementing a fast and low-latency 4-stage Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) lies in optimizing the butterfly operations, which are the fundamental computation units. A partitioned combination approach, coupled with careful use of sequential logic, can significantly improve performance. I've seen this firsthand in designing digital signal processing pipelines for real-time radar systems where throughput and minimal delay were paramount.

A 4-stage FFT processes an input signal consisting of *N* samples, where *N* is a power of 2, by recursively dividing the input into smaller sub-problems. Each stage performs a set of butterfly operations, taking pairs of complex numbers and combining them to produce two new complex numbers. This process introduces dependencies: the output of one stage serves as the input to the next. Direct implementation using purely combinatorial logic becomes resource intensive and often yields unacceptable latency for high data rates.

Partitioned combination seeks to distribute the butterfly operations across different physical units or processing elements. Instead of computing all butterflies in a single clock cycle within each stage, we divide the computation into smaller chunks, allowing pipelined processing. This approach trades off area (increased hardware) for speed and decreased latency. For a 4-stage FFT, we essentially partition the calculations within each stage, processing subsets of butterfly operations in sequence, rather than computing all of them simultaneously. Sequential logic is crucial here because registers are used to store intermediate values between these partial calculations, allowing for the pipelined processing and enabling greater throughput at higher clock speeds. The data dependencies between stages mean that the data must be carefully managed as it passes between these pipelined units.

Consider the first stage of a 16-point FFT (N=16), where each of the first-stage butterflies combines two inputs using complex multiplications and additions/subtractions, yielding two outputs. Instead of performing all eight first-stage butterflies in parallel and all at once, we can process them in sets of two using a single butterfly unit, and then store the result in a register file. In the following clock cycles, we perform the remaining butterfly operations for this stage. We subsequently use other register files at the output of the stage to buffer the results before they are fed to the next stage of the transform.

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate how a partitioned approach with sequential logic can be applied. These examples assume the use of a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL, but Iâ€™ll focus on conveying the core concepts.

**Example 1: Single Butterfly Unit**

```verilog
module butterfly_unit (
  input  wire  [15:0] a_re,  //Real part of input 'a'
  input  wire  [15:0] a_im,  //Imaginary part of input 'a'
  input  wire  [15:0] b_re,  //Real part of input 'b'
  input  wire  [15:0] b_im,  //Imaginary part of input 'b'
  input  wire  [15:0] tw_re, //Real part of twiddle factor
  input  wire  [15:0] tw_im, //Imaginary part of twiddle factor
  output reg  [15:0] out_re_plus, //Real part of (a + b*tw)
  output reg  [15:0] out_im_plus, //Imaginary part of (a + b*tw)
  output reg  [15:0] out_re_minus, //Real part of (a - b*tw)
  output reg  [15:0] out_im_minus //Imaginary part of (a - b*tw)
);

  reg [31:0] mult_re;
  reg [31:0] mult_im;

  always @(*) begin
     mult_re = (b_re * tw_re) - (b_im * tw_im);
     mult_im = (b_re * tw_im) + (b_im * tw_re);

     out_re_plus  =  a_re + mult_re[31:16];  // Keep upper half
     out_im_plus  =  a_im + mult_im[31:16];
     out_re_minus =  a_re - mult_re[31:16];
     out_im_minus =  a_im - mult_im[31:16];
   end
endmodule
```

This module implements a single butterfly operation. It performs the complex multiplication of input `b` and the twiddle factor `tw`, then adds and subtracts the result from `a` producing the two outputs, `out_plus` and `out_minus`. The multiplication results in 32-bit values. To maintain a 16-bit output width, I've taken only the upper 16 bits of the multiplication results before performing the additions. Importantly, this is implemented with combinational logic. We will utilize this butterfly unit repeatedly.

**Example 2: Pipelined Stage 1**

```verilog
module stage1_pipelined (
  input  wire        clk,
  input  wire        reset,
  input  wire [15:0] input_data [15:0], // 16 data points
  input  wire [15:0] twiddles [7:0],    // 8 twiddle factors
  output reg [15:0] output_data [15:0]
  );

  reg [15:0] butterfly_a_re [7:0];
  reg [15:0] butterfly_a_im [7:0];
  reg [15:0] butterfly_b_re [7:0];
  reg [15:0] butterfly_b_im [7:0];
  reg [15:0] butterfly_tw_re [7:0];
  reg [15:0] butterfly_tw_im [7:0];

  reg  [15:0] butterfly_out_re_plus  [7:0];
  reg  [15:0] butterfly_out_im_plus  [7:0];
  reg  [15:0] butterfly_out_re_minus [7:0];
  reg  [15:0] butterfly_out_im_minus [7:0];

  integer i;

  butterfly_unit butterfly_units [7:0] (
     .a_re(butterfly_a_re),
     .a_im(butterfly_a_im),
     .b_re(butterfly_b_re),
     .b_im(butterfly_b_im),
     .tw_re(butterfly_tw_re),
     .tw_im(butterfly_tw_im),
     .out_re_plus (butterfly_out_re_plus),
     .out_im_plus (butterfly_out_im_plus),
     .out_re_minus(butterfly_out_re_minus),
     .out_im_minus(butterfly_out_im_minus)
    );

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if(reset) begin
            // Reset the output
            for(i=0; i<16; i=i+1) begin
               output_data[i] <= 16'b0;
            end
        end
        else begin
            // Feed data to butterfly units. Data is interleaved for this FFT stage.
             for (i=0; i<8; i=i+1) begin
               butterfly_a_re[i] <= input_data[i*2][15:0];
               butterfly_a_im[i] <= input_data[i*2][15:0]; // Assuming Re and Im are equal
               butterfly_b_re[i] <= input_data[i*2 + 1][15:0];
               butterfly_b_im[i] <= input_data[i*2 + 1][15:0];
               butterfly_tw_re[i] <= twiddles[i][15:0];
               butterfly_tw_im[i] <= twiddles[i][15:0];

            end
           // Write to output buffer using sequential logic after computations are complete
            for (i=0; i<8; i=i+1) begin
               output_data[i*2]   <=  butterfly_out_re_plus[i];
               output_data[i*2+1] <=  butterfly_out_re_minus[i];
            end
         end
    end
endmodule
```

This module illustrates a simplified first stage of a 16-point FFT. Here we assume that the real and imaginary components of each input sample are identical; in a practical implementation they would be provided separately.  The core of this module lies in the instantiation of 8 instances of the `butterfly_unit`, which execute in parallel for higher throughput. Intermediate data registers are not shown here for brevity but in a real implementation they would be used for a truly pipelined implementation. Note the use of `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` blocks, which demonstrates that data is latched and passed to the output registers using sequential logic. The use of a for loop indicates the data processing in the multiple units simultaneously. However, one clock cycle is still taken to compute and latch the outputs.

**Example 3: Pipelined Full FFT**

```verilog
module fft_pipelined (
  input  wire       clk,
  input  wire       reset,
  input  wire [15:0] input_data [15:0], // 16 data points
  input  wire [15:0] twiddle_stage1 [7:0], // Stage 1 twiddle factors
  input  wire [15:0] twiddle_stage2 [3:0], // Stage 2 twiddle factors
  input  wire [15:0] twiddle_stage3 [1:0], // Stage 3 twiddle factors
  input  wire [15:0] twiddle_stage4 [0:0], // Stage 4 twiddle factors
  output reg [15:0] output_data [15:0]
);

  reg [15:0] stage1_output [15:0];
  reg [15:0] stage2_output [15:0];
  reg [15:0] stage3_output [15:0];

  stage1_pipelined stage1_inst (
     .clk(clk),
     .reset(reset),
     .input_data(input_data),
     .twiddles(twiddle_stage1),
     .output_data(stage1_output)
   );

   // Data reordering logic could be here (omitted for brevity)

  stage1_pipelined stage2_inst (
     .clk(clk),
     .reset(reset),
     .input_data(stage1_output),
     .twiddles(twiddle_stage2),
     .output_data(stage2_output)
   );

   //Data reordering logic could be here (omitted for brevity)

  stage1_pipelined stage3_inst (
     .clk(clk),
     .reset(reset),
     .input_data(stage2_output),
     .twiddles(twiddle_stage3),
     .output_data(stage3_output)
  );

  //Data reordering logic could be here (omitted for brevity)

  stage1_pipelined stage4_inst (
     .clk(clk),
     .reset(reset),
     .input_data(stage3_output),
     .twiddles(twiddle_stage4),
     .output_data(output_data)
  );

endmodule
```

This final module depicts the entire 4-stage FFT pipeline. We reuse our previous `stage1_pipelined` module. The data is piped between the stages in sequence, each stage processing data according to the butterfly pattern. The data reordering, usually needed between stages of an FFT, has been omitted for clarity, but would be critical in a real-world design. Each `stage1_pipelined` module operates with sequential logic, using registers within and between stages, allowing for high throughput. Although I've used the same `stage1_pipelined` implementation for all the stages, the twiddle factors change, which results in different operations.

In practice, the implementation should account for more intricate details such as bit-reversal of inputs or outputs, memory management, and data validity flags. The sequential nature, however, remains central to achieving high throughput and low latency. Throughput is optimized because the stages work concurrently. The latency, though present, is manageable because each stage can operate independently.

To delve deeper into this topic, I recommend examining texts and reference materials on digital signal processing, particularly focusing on hardware implementations of FFT algorithms. Look for resources that detail techniques for pipelined processing in FPGAs or ASICs. Study the implementation details and optimization techniques associated with these technologies, as well as material on how to design hardware for digital signal processing applications. Also, exploring literature on high-performance computing architectures and dataflow design can provide further valuable insights.
