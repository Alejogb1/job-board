The absence of `RegisterShape` within TensorFlow's `ops` module, particularly when attempting to define custom operations, stems from its fundamental design change since TensorFlow 2.0. Prior to this major revision, `RegisterShape` was integral for statically defining the output shapes of custom operations during graph construction. However, the shift towards eager execution and automatic shape inference has rendered its direct use obsolete in the standard Python API. Effectively, the TensorFlow framework now relies primarily on runtime, rather than static, shape determination.

The core issue you are likely encountering is using older tutorials or code snippets that assume a pre-TensorFlow 2.0 paradigm. This legacy approach attempted to manually instruct the TensorFlow graph how the shapes of tensors would transform through a custom operation. `RegisterShape` allowed one to specify, via C++ registration within a custom op kernel, the output shape based on input shapes. Now, TensorFlow leverages the provided *implementation* of the custom op to dynamically infer output shapes, thus eliminating the static registration requirement. Attempting to find or utilize `RegisterShape` through the `tf.ops` module or any direct call in modern TensorFlow will fail. It is simply not there anymore.

Instead of `RegisterShape`, the focus should now be on the custom operation's implementation itself. The kernel you write, be it in C++, CUDA, or a Python-based custom operation utilizing `@tf.function`, is responsible for returning the correctly shaped tensor. TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation and dynamic graph building rely on the implementation to produce outputs of the correct type and dimensionality. This means that errors related to shape mismatches will occur if your kernel’s logic produces incorrect output shapes, not because a static shape declaration is missing.

Consider this illustration through code:

**Example 1: Custom Operation Without Explicit Shape Handling**

Assume you have defined a simple custom operation that adds a scalar value to each element of a tensor. Initially, you might be inclined to look for a `RegisterShape` equivalent; however, the correct approach is to ensure the operation's Python implementation maintains input shape consistency:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def add_scalar_op(input_tensor, scalar_value):
  return input_tensor + scalar_value

# Example usage:
input_data = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
scalar = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)

output_tensor = add_scalar_op(input_data, scalar)
print(output_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output_tensor.shape}") # Output shape: (2, 2)
```

Here, the `@tf.function` decorator compiles this Python function into a TensorFlow graph, which then leverages `input_data + scalar_value`'s inherent shape propagation. We don’t explicitly tell TensorFlow what the output shape will be; the addition automatically produces a tensor with the same shape as `input_data` because of broadcasting rules. No `RegisterShape` equivalent is needed or even applicable in this context. If our code were instead `tf.reshape(input_data + scalar_value, (1,1))`, the result would be reshaped according to the specification *during execution*, and the resulting tensor would have shape `(1,1)`. This is in contrast to the pre-2.0 approach where `RegisterShape` would statically inform the graph builder that a given operation would *always* have an output of the specified shape.

**Example 2: Utilizing `tf.shape` for Dynamic Shapes**

Sometimes, the exact output shape depends on runtime information. If, for instance, we were padding or cropping the input based on values from other tensors:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def pad_with_value(input_tensor, padding_amount, value):
    input_shape = tf.shape(input_tensor)
    padded_shape = input_shape + padding_amount
    paddings = tf.stack([tf.zeros_like(padding_amount, dtype=tf.int32), padding_amount], axis=1)
    return tf.pad(input_tensor, paddings=paddings, constant_values=value)


input_data = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)
pad_amts = tf.constant([1, 2], dtype=tf.int32)
pad_val = tf.constant(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)

output_tensor = pad_with_value(input_data, pad_amts, pad_val)
print(output_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output_tensor.shape}") # Output shape: (3, 5)
```

In this scenario, the output shape is determined during runtime based on the `padding_amount` tensor. We don’t register any shape statically; instead, the `tf.pad` operation dynamically calculates the shape based on the `paddings` and the input. The key here is to leverage TensorFlow’s available operations to construct the tensor in a way that ensures it has the correct shape *at runtime*, and to use `tf.shape` if runtime shape information is required during the operation itself.

**Example 3:  Custom C++ Kernel (Conceptual)**

Should you be implementing a C++ custom op kernel, the principle remains the same. You are responsible for ensuring your kernel's computation results in an output with the expected shape; there is no separate shape registration process with modern TensorFlow. For instance, if your C++ code takes a tensor as input and returns the element-wise square root:

```c++
// Conceptual example, not runnable code
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.h"

using namespace tensorflow;

class CustomSqrtOp : public OpKernel {
public:
    explicit CustomSqrtOp(OpKernelConstruction* ctx) : OpKernel(ctx) {}

    void Compute(OpKernelContext* ctx) override {
        const Tensor& input_tensor = ctx->input(0);
        // No static shape registration here, just allocate space and implement the compute logic.
        Tensor* output_tensor = nullptr;
        OP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->allocate_output(0, input_tensor.shape(), &output_tensor)); // Allocate output space
        // ... Actual kernel math implementation using the input_tensor and writing to output_tensor ...
        auto input_data = input_tensor.flat<float>();
        auto output_data = output_tensor->flat<float>();
        for(int i=0; i<input_data.size(); i++){
          output_data(i) = std::sqrt(input_data(i));
        }
    }
};

REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("CustomSqrtOp").Device(DEVICE_CPU), CustomSqrtOp); // Register the CPU kernel
```

The critical aspect here is how the output tensor is allocated: `ctx->allocate_output(0, input_tensor.shape(), &output_tensor)`. We are using the *input shape* to allocate output space. If you returned an output of a different shape, TensorFlow would flag a runtime shape incompatibility issue. You must ensure the actual processing of data in the C++ `Compute` method results in the correct shape and content.

In summary, the absence of `RegisterShape` is by design, representing a significant shift in TensorFlow's approach to shape handling. Instead of static declarations, focus on implementing custom operations that produce outputs with the correct shapes at runtime. If you encounter shape errors, meticulously debug the logic of your custom operation itself, ensuring that the dimensions of the output tensor are calculated and produced correctly.

For additional information, consult the official TensorFlow documentation regarding custom operations, specifically the sections dealing with `@tf.function` usage and custom C++ kernels. The TensorFlow official guides and tutorials focused on creating custom ops and kernels are invaluable resources. The TensorFlow API documentation provides detailed information about each available function including the expected data input shapes and output shapes. Furthermore, discussions and examples in the official GitHub repository for TensorFlow often provide best practice recommendations. These resources will enable you to fully grasp the current approach to shape handling and custom operation creation within TensorFlow.
