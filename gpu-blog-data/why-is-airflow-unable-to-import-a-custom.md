The root cause of Airflow's inability to import custom Python packages almost invariably stems from misconfiguration of the Airflow environment's PYTHONPATH, or, less frequently, issues with package installation and virtual environment management.  In my experience troubleshooting this across numerous projects—from small data pipelines to large-scale ETL processes—the problem rarely lies within Airflow itself, but rather in how the Airflow worker processes and the custom package interact.

**1. Explanation:**

Airflow executes its DAGs within distinct worker processes.  These processes operate in isolated environments, inheriting only a subset of the system's Python environment.  Crucially, they generally don't automatically include the site-packages directory from your system's global Python installation or even a virtual environment you might have activated in your terminal before starting the Airflow scheduler.  Therefore, if your custom package is installed in a location not accessible to the Airflow worker processes, the import will fail.

This necessitates explicit configuration to make your custom package available. This can be achieved through several methods, primarily focusing on setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable within the Airflow worker's execution context, or by leveraging Airflow's plugin mechanism for a more integrated approach.  A less common yet relevant consideration involves ensuring correct virtual environment setup and package installation within the environment used by Airflow, not just your development environment.  Failure to align these environments often leads to this import error.  I’ve personally debugged numerous situations where developers correctly installed the package in their local virtual environment but failed to deploy it within the Airflow environment, causing the failure.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Modifying the Airflow Worker Environment (Environment Variable Approach):**

This approach directly modifies the environment in which the Airflow worker processes run.  The drawback is that this requires modifying Airflow's configuration files, which is generally less desirable than using the plugin mechanism outlined later.  However, it's a quick fix for temporary testing or smaller projects.

```bash
# Assuming your custom package resides at /path/to/my/package
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/my/package:$PYTHONPATH
airflow webserver
airflow scheduler
```

This code snippet, executed before starting the Airflow webserver and scheduler, prepends the directory containing your custom package to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.  The `$PYTHONPATH` ensures existing paths remain intact.  Remember to replace `/path/to/my/package` with the correct path.  This method's limitation lies in its reliance on shell configuration; it's not ideal for production deployments and requires restarting the Airflow services after modification.


**Example 2: Using Airflow Plugins (Recommended Approach):**

Airflow's plugin architecture provides a more robust and maintainable solution.  Plugins are self-contained modules that extend Airflow's functionality.  By creating a plugin containing your custom package, you ensure its automatic inclusion in the Airflow worker's environment.

```python
# my_plugin/my_package/__init__.py  (Simplified structure)
from my_module import MyCustomClass

# my_plugin/my_package/my_module.py
class MyCustomClass:
    def my_method(self):
        return "This is my custom method"

# my_plugin/hooks/my_custom_hook.py
from airflow.hooks.base import BaseHook
from my_package.my_module import MyCustomClass

class MyCustomHook(BaseHook):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.custom_class = MyCustomClass()

    def run(self):
        return self.custom_class.my_method()

# my_plugin/__init__.py
from airflow.plugins_manager import AirflowPlugin
from my_package.my_module import MyCustomClass

class MyPlugin(AirflowPlugin):
    name = "my_custom_plugin"
    hooks = [MyCustomHook]
```

This illustrates a simple plugin structure.  The `my_package` directory houses the custom code, and the `MyCustomHook` integrates it with Airflow's hook mechanism.  Place this `my_plugin` directory in Airflow's plugins folder (typically `$AIRFLOW_HOME/plugins`).  This method cleanly integrates your package without modifying system environment variables; this is considered best practice for maintainability and scalability.


**Example 3:  Leveraging a Virtual Environment within Airflow (Advanced Approach):**

This involves setting up a dedicated virtual environment for Airflow and installing all necessary packages, including your custom one, within it.  This is particularly beneficial in complex environments or when managing multiple projects with differing dependency requirements.  I have implemented this successfully in large-scale ETL deployments to ensure strict package version control and minimize conflicts.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv /path/to/airflow_venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/airflow_venv/bin/activate

# Install Airflow and your custom package
pip install apache-airflow
pip install -e /path/to/my/package

# Set AIRFLOW_HOME to point to this virtual environment
export AIRFLOW_HOME=/path/to/airflow_home
#Configure Airflow to use this venv in your airflow.cfg

#Start airflow processes
airflow webserver -D
airflow scheduler -D
```

This technique requires configuring Airflow to use this virtual environment.  This usually involves setting the `AIRFLOW_HOME` environment variable and potentially adjusting paths in the Airflow configuration file (`airflow.cfg`).  This is more complex to set up initially but provides better isolation and dependency management.  Careful consideration of the `AIRFLOW_HOME` variable's correct assignment within this virtual environment's context is crucial for the proper operation of this method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Airflow documentation is your primary resource.  Familiarize yourself with the sections on plugins and environment variables. Consult relevant Python packaging tutorials and documentation regarding virtual environments and package installation. A thorough understanding of the Python `sys.path` mechanism will also greatly benefit troubleshooting import issues.  Finally, a good understanding of how to use a debugger within your Airflow DAGs can provide insightful information regarding the runtime environment and your package's availability.
