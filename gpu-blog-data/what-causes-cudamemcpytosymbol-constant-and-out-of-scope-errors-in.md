The root cause of `cudaMemcpyToSymbol`, `__constant__`, and out-of-scope errors in CUDA 5.5, and indeed across subsequent versions, often stems from a misunderstanding of the CUDA memory model and the lifecycle management of constant memory.  My experience debugging these issues over several large-scale GPU computation projects highlights the critical role of proper memory allocation, initialization, and synchronization.  These errors manifest differently depending on the specific misuse, but share a common thread: a violation of the constraints imposed by the CUDA runtime.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA's `__constant__` memory space is a read-only section accessible by all threads within a kernel. Data is copied into this space using `cudaMemcpyToSymbol`.  However, this memory region is not dynamically allocated; its size is fixed at compile time.  Attempts to write to `__constant__` memory will result in undefined behavior, often leading to silent data corruption or kernel crashes.  Furthermore, the lifetime of data within `__constant__` memory persists throughout the application's execution unless explicitly overwritten.  This contrasts sharply with variables declared within the kernel's scope, which have a lifetime limited to the kernel's execution.  Attempting to access data from a variable that is out of scope, whether due to improper kernel termination or asynchronous operations, results in undefined behavior, potentially manifesting as seemingly unrelated errors further down the execution pipeline.  In CUDA 5.5, the error reporting on these scenarios could be less explicit compared to later versions, contributing to difficulty in diagnosis.

The specific error manifestations are nuanced:

* **`cudaMemcpyToSymbol` errors:** These typically occur due to insufficient space allocated for the symbol, incorrect pointer addressing, or attempting to copy data of an incompatible type.  The runtime may report an error directly related to the `cudaMemcpyToSymbol` call, or it may manifest indirectly as unexpected kernel behavior.

* **`__constant__` errors:**  These are usually subtle and difficult to track down.  Issues arise from attempting to write to `__constant__` memory or from accessing uninitialized `__constant__` memory.  The effects can range from incorrect computations to crashes, with error messages potentially pointing to unrelated parts of the code.

* **Out-of-scope errors:** These errors are often a consequence of improper synchronization or asynchronous operations.  A kernel might finish before another kernel dependent on its data completes its copy from `__constant__` memory, leading to attempts to access invalid memory addresses. This can also occur when a kernel accesses variables declared outside its scope (e.g., local variables in a calling function) which have been deallocated.

Proper handling requires meticulous attention to memory allocation, initialization, synchronization using CUDA events, and careful scoping of variables.  Ignoring these points often results in unpredictable, hard-to-debug failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `cudaMemcpyToSymbol` Usage:**

```c++
__constant__ float constantData[10];

int main() {
  float hostData[10] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f, 9.0f, 10.0f};
  cudaError_t err = cudaMemcpyToSymbol(constantData, hostData, sizeof(hostData), 0, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMemcpyToSymbol failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }
  // ... kernel launch using constantData ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a correct usage of `cudaMemcpyToSymbol`. The error checking ensures that the copy operation was successful.  Failure would indicate issues such as incorrect data size or insufficient `__constant__` memory allocation.  Note that the size of `constantData` must match `hostData` precisely.


**Example 2: Attempting to Write to `__constant__` Memory:**

```c++
__constant__ float constantData[10];

__global__ void myKernel() {
  int i = threadIdx.x;
  if (i < 10) {
    constantData[i] = i * 2.0f; // Attempting to write to constant memory - incorrect!
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... code to copy data into constantData ...
  myKernel<<<1, 10>>>(); // Launch kernel
  // ... further processing ... (likely to fail due to corrupted data)
  return 0;
}
```

This code is flawed because it attempts to write to `__constant__` memory within the kernel.  This will lead to unpredictable behavior.  `__constant__` memory is read-only from the kernel's perspective.


**Example 3: Out-of-Scope Access and Asynchronous Operations:**

```c++
__constant__ float constantData[10];
float* deviceData;

__global__ void kernel1() {
  // ... processing ...
  cudaMemcpy(deviceData, constantData, sizeof(float)*10, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice); //potential out-of-scope error
}

__global__ void kernel2() {
  // ... processing using data from deviceData ...
}

int main() {
  cudaMalloc((void**)&deviceData, sizeof(float)*10);

  // ... copy data into constantData ...

  kernel1<<<1,1>>>();
  kernel2<<<1,1>>>(); // kernel2 might access deviceData before kernel1 completes copy

  cudaFree(deviceData); // Freeing memory before kernel2 might complete

  return 0;
}
```

This example highlights potential out-of-scope issues.  `kernel2` might try to access `deviceData` before `kernel1` completes the memory copy from `__constant__` memory, causing incorrect results or crashes.  Further, `cudaFree(deviceData)` before `kernel2` finishes might lead to a segmentation fault.  Proper synchronization using CUDA events or streams is crucial to prevent this.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and the CUDA Toolkit documentation are invaluable resources.  Examining the CUDA samples provided with the toolkit is also highly recommended for understanding practical implementations and best practices.  A solid understanding of parallel programming concepts, memory management, and synchronization primitives is fundamental.  Thorough debugging techniques are vital for resolving subtle memory-related issues.  Finally, utilizing CUDA profilers can reveal performance bottlenecks and identify potential issues related to memory access patterns.
