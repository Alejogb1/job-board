The `None` return from an optimizer frequently stems from a mismatch between the optimizer's expected input and the actual data it receives. This is often masked by seemingly correct code, making debugging challenging.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale machine learning projects at my previous firm involved meticulously examining data types, gradient calculations, and the optimizer's internal mechanisms.  This frequently revealed subtle errors invisible to cursory inspection.

**1. Explanation:**

Optimizers in machine learning, such as Adam, SGD, or RMSprop, require specific input formats.  Their core function is to update model parameters based on calculated gradients.  A `None` return usually signals a failure within this process.  This failure can originate from several sources:

* **Incorrect Gradient Calculation:** The most common culprit.  If the backpropagation algorithm fails to compute gradients correctly—due to errors in the loss function, network architecture, or automatic differentiation—the optimizer receives `None` gradients. This often happens with custom loss functions or complex network topologies where subtle mathematical inconsistencies can arise.

* **Data Type Mismatches:** Optimizers often expect specific data types for parameters and gradients (typically floating-point tensors).  Inconsistent types, such as mixing NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors, can lead to errors within the optimizer's internal operations, resulting in a `None` return.  This is particularly insidious because type errors sometimes propagate silently until the optimizer attempts to perform an operation that is undefined for the given type.

* **Invalid Parameter Initialization:** Incorrectly initialized model parameters can also cause issues.  For instance, parameters initialized to `None` or with unsupported data types will lead to failures during optimization. This is usually related to the initialization strategy employed during model definition.

* **Optimizer-Specific Issues:** Each optimizer has its specific requirements and limitations.  For example, Adam requires specific hyperparameters; if these are improperly set, it can fail to operate correctly. Similarly, using a momentum-based optimizer with a model that doesn't support momentum calculations can result in unexpected behavior.

* **Numerical Instability:** In cases involving very large or very small numbers, numerical instability can lead to `NaN` or `inf` values during gradient calculations.  These values can propagate through the optimizer, leading to a `None` return as a mechanism to handle such problematic states.  This often manifests subtly and is difficult to trace without careful monitoring of intermediate values during the optimization process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Calculation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Incorrect loss function - missing reduction argument
class IncorrectLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(IncorrectLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, output, target):
        return torch.mean((output - target)**2) # Missing reduction='mean'

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
criterion = IncorrectLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

input = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 1)

output = model(input)
loss = criterion(output, target)

optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward() # This might result in None gradients depending on the backend

optimizer_step = optimizer.step() # This will likely return None or throw an error
print(optimizer_step) # Output: None or an error
```

Commentary: The `IncorrectLoss` function omits the crucial `reduction` argument, leading to inconsistent gradient computation.  The default behavior in such situations might result in `None` gradients, causing the optimizer to return `None`.  Explicitly specifying `reduction='mean'` or `reduction='sum'` usually solves this.

**Example 2: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Using NumPy array instead of PyTorch tensor
input_np = np.random.randn(1, 10).astype(np.float32)
target_np = np.random.randn(1, 1).astype(np.float32)

# Conversion needed
input_tensor = torch.from_numpy(input_np)
target_tensor = torch.from_numpy(target_np)

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = torch.nn.MSELoss()(output, target_tensor)

optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer_step = optimizer.step()
print(optimizer_step)  # Output: None (if the mismatch is severe enough)

```

Commentary: While the example includes type conversion, a less explicit or incomplete conversion could lead to a `None` return.  This highlights the importance of carefully managing data types when interfacing with PyTorch optimizers.


**Example 3: Invalid Parameter Initialization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Incorrect parameter initialization
class ModelWithNoneParams(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelWithNoneParams, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.linear.weight = None  # Deliberately setting weight to None

model = ModelWithNoneParams()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

input = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 1)

try:
    output = model(input)
    loss = torch.nn.MSELoss()(output, target)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"RuntimeError: {e}") # This will likely print an error about None parameters

```

Commentary:  This illustrates the impact of improper parameter initialization. Attempting to optimize a model with `None` parameters inevitably leads to an error, which in some cases might manifest as a `None` return from the optimizer.  Careful initialization, using techniques like Xavier or Kaiming initialization, is crucial to avoid these problems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow). Thoroughly examine the optimizer's specifications regarding expected input formats and hyperparameters.  Study relevant academic papers on the theoretical underpinnings of the optimization algorithms.  Furthermore, advanced debugging techniques involving logging intermediate values during training, using visualization tools to inspect gradients, and employing gradient checking can significantly aid in identifying the root cause of `None` returns from optimizers.  Finally, exploring the error messages meticulously—not just the top-level message, but also any nested exceptions—often provides critical clues for resolving the underlying problem.
