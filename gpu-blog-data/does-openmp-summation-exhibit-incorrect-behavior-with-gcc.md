I have encountered, in practical use, situations where OpenMP summation, specifically when employing highly optimized builds with GCC, can exhibit unexpected behavior that appears numerically incorrect. This is not a consistent bug in GCC's OpenMP implementation, but rather a confluence of factors related to floating-point math, compiler optimization, and the underlying hardware architecture. The problem typically surfaces when a large number of additions are performed in parallel, particularly with relatively small floating-point values and high levels of optimization such as `-O3`, `-march=native`, or `-march=skylake-avx512`.

The primary issue is not a direct error in OpenMP’s threading mechanics itself, but instead stems from the way floating-point operations are handled under these conditions. With high optimization levels, GCC aggressively transforms the code, potentially reordering operations, using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions provided by AVX512 when `-march=skylake-avx512` is used, and taking advantage of features like fused multiply-add (FMA). This transformation, while generally improving performance, can introduce variations in the order of additions, leading to different accumulated rounding errors.

In a serial summation, where additions are performed sequentially, rounding errors typically accrue in a predictable fashion. However, with OpenMP’s parallel reduction, each thread calculates a partial sum and then these partial sums are combined. The order of these partial sum combinations is not deterministic, unless specifically controlled. The higher optimization levels increase the chances of this non-deterministic ordering. Consequently, the resulting sum, despite being mathematically equivalent, can differ slightly from the serial result due to these varying accumulated rounding errors. This difference, while often small, can be significant in numerical applications that demand high accuracy or where small variations trigger divergence or instabilities.

Let’s consider some code examples to illustrate this:

**Example 1: Basic Summation with OpenMP**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int N = 1000000;
    double arr[N];
    double serial_sum = 0.0;
    double parallel_sum = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        arr[i] = 0.00001;
    }


    // Serial Summation
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        serial_sum += arr[i];
    }


    // Parallel Summation
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:parallel_sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        parallel_sum += arr[i];
    }


    printf("Serial Sum: %.10f\n", serial_sum);
    printf("Parallel Sum: %.10f\n", parallel_sum);

    return 0;
}
```

Here, I initialize a large array with a small floating-point number, and then calculate the sum both serially and in parallel using OpenMP's reduction clause. When compiled with moderate optimization (e.g., `-O2`), both `serial_sum` and `parallel_sum` will generally be numerically very close, if not identical. However, compiling with  `-O3 -march=native` or `-O3 -march=skylake-avx512`, often reveals a small discrepancy, especially on systems that use AVX-512 instructions. This difference is due to the reordering and vectorization of floating-point operations within the parallel loop. The degree of discrepancy can depend on the number of threads used and the specific instruction selection by the compiler.

**Example 2: Explicit Reduction with Partial Sums**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
  const int N = 1000000;
  double arr[N];
  double serial_sum = 0.0;
  double parallel_sum = 0.0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    arr[i] = 0.00001;
  }

  // Serial Summation
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    serial_sum += arr[i];
  }


  // Parallel Summation with explicit partial sums
  #pragma omp parallel
    {
    int num_threads = omp_get_num_threads();
    int thread_id = omp_get_thread_num();
    double local_sum = 0.0;

    #pragma omp for
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
      local_sum += arr[i];
    }
    
    #pragma omp critical
    parallel_sum += local_sum;
    
  }

  printf("Serial Sum: %.10f\n", serial_sum);
  printf("Parallel Sum: %.10f\n", parallel_sum);

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, I've explicitly created local sums within each thread and used a critical section to combine the partial sums. This is a manual way of approximating the reduction provided by OpenMP. While still not numerically guaranteed to produce the same result as a serial summation, using the critical section generally mitigates some of the potential variations compared to the previous example. However, the performance is impacted by the overhead of the critical section. The non-deterministic nature of scheduling threads will influence the order in which these critical sections are entered, which affects the overall result. High optimization levels like `-O3 -march=native` or `-O3 -march=skylake-avx512` can still expose differences, due to microarchitectural influences.

**Example 3: Utilizing `volatile` Keyword to Restrict Optimization**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
  const int N = 1000000;
  double arr[N];
  double serial_sum = 0.0;
  volatile double parallel_sum = 0.0; // Declare parallel_sum as volatile

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    arr[i] = 0.00001;
  }

  // Serial Summation
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    serial_sum += arr[i];
  }

    // Parallel Summation with volatile
  #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:parallel_sum)
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
      parallel_sum += arr[i];
    }

  printf("Serial Sum: %.10f\n", serial_sum);
  printf("Parallel Sum: %.10f\n", parallel_sum);

  return 0;
}
```

Here, I've declared the `parallel_sum` variable as `volatile`. The `volatile` keyword instructs the compiler to avoid aggressive optimizations on accesses to this variable, including caching or reordering. This constraint reduces the probability of differences between serial and parallel sums. While it provides more consistent results across different optimization settings and architectures, it typically comes with a performance penalty, as optimization opportunities are lost. This provides a trade off to consider.

These examples demonstrate that, while OpenMP reduction is generally reliable, the combination of aggressive compiler optimization, SIMD instructions, and the non-associative nature of floating-point math can lead to discrepancies. This isn't a bug in OpenMP or the compiler, but rather a consequence of how numerical calculations are handled under these constraints.

It's important to note that, for many applications, these discrepancies are negligible and do not impact the overall results. However, in cases requiring high precision or numerical stability, it’s essential to be aware of this phenomenon and consider potential mitigation strategies. Some of these strategies include using double-precision floating point (which reduces the impact of rounding errors), careful ordering of sums, using Kahan summation techniques, explicitly controlling floating-point environments, or using `volatile` with the understanding of its performance implications.

For further study into this issue, I would recommend exploring resources on topics such as floating-point representation, compiler optimization techniques, the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, and parallel numerical algorithms. Consulting materials on numerical methods and high-performance computing can provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interplay between software and hardware, particularly the impact of SIMD instructions and optimization levels on numerical computations. It is also helpful to look at documentation and research papers on the various OpenMP implementations and their specific behaviours, with attention to the implementation of the reduction clause.
