TensorFlow's `tf.image.extract_glimpse` function utilizes a combination of offset calculations and image padding to extract rectangular regions (glimpses) from an input image tensor. The offsets, specified as arguments, are not directly applied as pixel-based coordinates but rather influence the positioning of the glimpse within the original image's coordinate space *before* any cropping or padding takes place. This detail is critical for understanding how the function operates correctly, especially around image boundaries.

My experience developing object detection pipelines has led me to a practical understanding of `extract_glimpse`. The challenges involved dealing with objects situated close to the edge of input images. If not careful, a poorly constructed pipeline could easily cut off or misrepresent a portion of a target object, which made proper offset handling crucial.

Here’s a breakdown of the mechanism: The function accepts an image tensor of shape `[batch, height, width, channels]` as input, along with a size tensor of shape `[batch, 2]` and an offsets tensor of shape `[batch, 2]`. The size tensor defines the height and width of the desired glimpse. The offset tensor, however, does not represent the top-left corner of the glimpse *relative* to the image. Instead, it’s used to determine the *center* of the glimpse's extraction region with a fractional unit system. Specifically, each offset value (within the range [-1, 1]) is scaled and converted into an absolute center coordinate within the original image dimensions.

For each sample in the batch, let's denote:
- `h` and `w` as the original image's height and width, respectively.
- `gh` and `gw` as the glimpse's height and width, respectively.
- `ox` and `oy` as the offset values in x and y directions, respectively.

The computation proceeds as follows:
1. **Center Coordinate Calculation:** The x-coordinate `cx` of the glimpse center is computed using the formula:  `cx = (ox + 1.0) * (w - 1) * 0.5`. Similarly, the y-coordinate `cy` is: `cy = (oy + 1.0) * (h - 1) * 0.5`. This transformation scales the offset range [-1, 1] to the effective range [0, w-1] for x and [0, h-1] for y, aligning it with the image's valid coordinates. Note, the multiplication by 0.5 is important as it centers the calculation.
2. **Top-Left Corner Derivation:** The coordinates of the top-left corner of the *extraction region* are then computed from the center, rather than directly from the offset. The x-coordinate becomes: `x_tl = cx - (gw - 1) * 0.5` and the y-coordinate is `y_tl = cy - (gh - 1) * 0.5`.  Notice that these use glimpse dimensions.
3. **Glimpse Extraction with Padding:** Finally,  a rectangular region is cropped from the original image *based on the calculated top-left coordinates*, `x_tl` and `y_tl` and the specified glimpse size, `gh` and `gw`. Importantly, the function automatically performs padding (usually with zeros) if the computed region extends beyond the boundaries of the original image to match the requested glimpse size. No truncation is performed.

This two-step calculation using the center avoids potential issues with naive coordinate offset applications, especially when objects are partially present at the image boundaries.

Here are three code examples to illustrate these offset mechanics:

**Example 1: Center Offset**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

image = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
                    [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]],
                    [[13, 14], [15, 16], [17, 18]]], dtype=tf.float32) # 3x3 image

image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0) # batch size 1

size = tf.constant([[2, 2]], dtype=tf.int32)
offsets = tf.constant([[0.0, 0.0]], dtype=tf.float32) # Center offset

glimpse = tf.image.extract_glimpse(image, size, offsets)

print(glimpse)

# Output will be:
# tf.Tensor(
# [[[[ 3.  4.]
#   [ 9. 10.]]]], shape=(1, 2, 2, 2), dtype=float32)
```

In this example, the offset `[0.0, 0.0]` indicates the glimpse center should be at the center of the input image. The resulting 2x2 glimpse indeed captures the central region.

**Example 2: Off-Center Offset with Padding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

image = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
                    [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]],
                    [[13, 14], [15, 16], [17, 18]]], dtype=tf.float32) # 3x3 image

image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0) # batch size 1

size = tf.constant([[2, 2]], dtype=tf.int32)
offsets = tf.constant([[0.5, 0.5]], dtype=tf.float32) # Offset towards bottom-right

glimpse = tf.image.extract_glimpse(image, size, offsets)

print(glimpse)

# Output will be:
# tf.Tensor(
# [[[[ 9. 10.]
#   [15. 16.]]]], shape=(1, 2, 2, 2), dtype=float32)
```

Here, the offset `[0.5, 0.5]` moves the glimpse center towards the bottom-right. The glimpse extracts data accordingly. Since the original image doesn't extend further, it contains only values and is not zero-padded.

**Example 3: Boundary Offset with Padding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

image = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
                    [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]],
                    [[13, 14], [15, 16], [17, 18]]], dtype=tf.float32) # 3x3 image

image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0) # batch size 1

size = tf.constant([[3, 3]], dtype=tf.int32)
offsets = tf.constant([[-0.9, -0.9]], dtype=tf.float32) # Offset towards top-left

glimpse = tf.image.extract_glimpse(image, size, offsets)

print(glimpse)

# Output will be:
# tf.Tensor(
# [[[[0. 0.]
#    [0. 0.]
#    [1. 2.]]
#
#   [[0. 0.]
#    [1. 2.]
#    [3. 4.]]
#
#   [[1. 2.]
#    [3. 4.]
#    [7. 8.]]]], shape=(1, 3, 3, 2), dtype=float32)
```

This last example illustrates the use of padding. With an offset `[-0.9, -0.9]`, the desired glimpse region's center is far towards the top-left. Because the 3x3 glimpse extends beyond the image bounds, the function pads the area with zeros.

To further investigate this topic, I would recommend consulting the following TensorFlow resources:
1.  The official TensorFlow documentation, which includes a description of the `tf.image.extract_glimpse` function and its parameters, paying particular attention to the offset argument.
2.  The source code of the TensorFlow library, specifically the implementation of `extract_glimpse` within the `tensorflow/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py` file. Examining the actual code provides detailed insight on how offsets are internally computed.
3.  Examples and tutorials on using object detection frameworks like TensorFlow Object Detection API, which often employ glimpse extraction techniques. Investigating how these frameworks handle boundary conditions can further improve understanding.
These resources should give a deeper perspective on the mathematical underpinnings and the implementation of `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and how offsets contribute to the final extracted region.
