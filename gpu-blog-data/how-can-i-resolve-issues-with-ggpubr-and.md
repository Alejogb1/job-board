The primary conflict between `ggpubr` and `latex2exp` arises from differing expectations regarding expression parsing and rendering contexts, particularly when combining statistical annotations with mathematical formulas in plot titles or labels. `ggpubr` relies heavily on its internal interpretation of expressions, while `latex2exp` is designed to process LaTeX syntax directly and integrate it into plotting environments. This mismatch can lead to partially rendered formulas, errors, or simply incorrect displays. Having wrestled with similar problems extensively while building reporting pipelines for pharmacokinetic analysis, Iâ€™ve developed strategies that reliably bridge this gap.

The fundamental issue is that `ggpubr` expects expressions to be in R's expression format (similar to but distinct from LaTeX), which it then may or may not render with LaTeX capabilities based on whether a LaTeX engine is active, whereas `latex2exp` explicitly requires LaTeX syntax. When annotations or labels are provided to `ggpubr` functions like `stat_compare_means` or `ggbarplot`, it expects R expressions. If these contain LaTeX commands meant for `latex2exp`, the parsing mechanism fails to properly translate this into the desired visual result or, in some cases, can trigger errors. Conversely, passing pre-processed LaTeX strings from `latex2exp` to `ggpubr` often results in improper font rendering or fails to fully utilize `ggpubr`'s layout control for positioning the annotations. Effectively, they are interpreting two distinct languages and the translation isn't automatic.

My approach revolves around ensuring the proper context of each process. I typically pre-process LaTeX expressions with `latex2exp::TeX` or `latex2exp::tex2math` *before* integrating them within `ggpubr` calls, and if I am using `stat_compare_means` or similar annotation functions, I explicitly build my annotation labels as proper R expressions using `bquote` in conjunction with the processed latex strings. This distinction is crucial; I am not passing raw LaTeX to `ggpubr`, but properly formatted output derived from it.

Let me illustrate this with code. Assume we are generating a bar plot and want to include p-values annotated with LaTeX formatting.

**Example 1: Pre-processing with latex2exp and building expressions with bquote for stat_compare_means**

```r
library(ggpubr)
library(latex2exp)
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
df <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  value = c(rnorm(10, 5, 2), rnorm(10, 7, 2))
)

p_value_test <- t.test(value ~ group, data = df)$p.value
p_value_tex <- latex2exp::TeX(sprintf("$p = %.3f$", p_value_test))

p_value_expr <- bquote(italic(p) == .(p_value_tex))
plot1 <- ggbarplot(df, x = "group", y = "value") +
  stat_compare_means(label = p_value_expr)
print(plot1)
```

In this example, we first calculate the p-value and use `sprintf` to format it into LaTeX syntax as a string. Then `latex2exp::TeX` processes it, enabling correct LaTeX rendering. Importantly, we use `bquote()` to construct an R expression which incorporates the processed LaTeX string using `.()`. This constructs a valid R expression to be provided to `stat_compare_means` ensuring its proper processing. Had I directly passed the `latex2exp::TeX()` output to the label argument of `stat_compare_means`, I would have observed misaligned text with a failure to interpret the math syntax.

**Example 2: Using latex2exp for plot titles and axis labels:**

```r
library(ggpubr)
library(latex2exp)
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
df <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  value = c(rnorm(10, 5, 2), rnorm(10, 7, 2))
)


plot2 <- ggbarplot(df, x = "group", y = "value") +
  labs(
    title = latex2exp::TeX("Comparison of Group $\\mu$ Values"),
    x = latex2exp::TeX("Group Identifier"),
    y = latex2exp::TeX("Observed Value")
  )
print(plot2)
```

Here,  `latex2exp::TeX` is used directly within the `labs()` function for title and axis labels. This avoids any conflict as `labs` primarily uses `ggplot2`'s text rendering system, which is readily compatible with `latex2exp` after the parsing has occurred. This method is effective for static text in titles and labels, since  `latex2exp` handles font rendering after parsing.

**Example 3: Handling More Complex LaTeX Expressions and `stat_compare_means` with `tex2math`**

```r
library(ggpubr)
library(latex2exp)
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
df <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  value = c(rnorm(10, 5, 2), rnorm(10, 7, 2))
)
#Calculate p-value 
p_value_test <- t.test(value ~ group, data = df)$p.value

# More complex latex expression:
p_value_tex <- latex2exp::tex2math(sprintf(
  "$\\textit{p}$ < %.3f",
  p_value_test
)) # Using tex2math

p_value_expr <- bquote(.(p_value_tex))

plot3 <- ggbarplot(df, x = "group", y = "value") +
  stat_compare_means(label = p_value_expr)
print(plot3)
```

In this advanced scenario, the p-value is incorporated into a more complex LaTeX expression. I have replaced `TeX()` with `tex2math()`, which produces an R expression directly instead of an object suitable for rendering. I can then embed that pre-processed output directly within the bquote command without additional handling, since it's an R expression ready for injection into a label. This simplifies the process slightly for more intricate mathematical formatting.

These examples highlight my process: I carefully pre-process LaTeX code with `latex2exp`, and then ensure the output is properly embedded within the context of `ggpubr` either by constructing expressions with `bquote()` when using `stat_compare_means` or by using `labs()` for titles and axes labels. I avoid directly feeding raw LaTeX strings to `ggpubr` functions directly as it would introduce ambiguity and rendering failures.

For those encountering these issues, I suggest exploring the documentation of both `ggpubr` and `latex2exp` to understand the expected input formats for expressions. In particular, reviewing the help pages for `stat_compare_means`, `bquote`, `TeX`, `tex2math`, and the text rendering options in `ggplot2` are beneficial. Furthermore, experimenting with different combinations of these tools is essential for mastering the subtle differences in how they handle mathematical notation. There are excellent vignettes for both packages available, and understanding these materials and testing out various implementations is the best approach. By diligently following these practices and resources, the user can successfully incorporate complex mathematical expressions into their plots while maintaining the desired formatting and statistical annotations.
