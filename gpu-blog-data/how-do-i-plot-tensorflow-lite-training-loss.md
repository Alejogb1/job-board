TensorFlow Lite, by design, doesn't directly support logging training metrics during model *training*.  Its focus is on optimized inference on resource-constrained devices, not the training process itself.  Training typically occurs using TensorFlow/Keras on a more powerful machine, then the resulting model is converted to the Lite format for deployment. Therefore, plotting training loss and accuracy requires careful consideration of where the training occurs and how metrics are captured during that process.

My experience working on embedded vision projects has underscored the importance of a clear separation between training and inference pipelines.  I've encountered situations where developers mistakenly attempted to integrate logging directly into the Lite runtime, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and unexpected crashes.  The key is to capture the metrics during the TensorFlow/Keras training phase, export them to a suitable format, and then use a separate plotting library (such as Matplotlib) to visualize the results.

**1.  Capturing Training Metrics with TensorFlow/Keras:**

The most straightforward approach leverages Keras' built-in callbacks.  These callbacks allow you to execute custom code at various points during the training process, including at the end of each epoch.  We can use the `CSVLogger` callback to write the training metrics to a CSV file, which is then easily parsed and plotted.  Alternatively, a custom callback can offer more flexibility, permitting more sophisticated logging strategies if needed.

**Code Example 1: Using `CSVLogger`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import CSVLogger

# ... define your model, optimizer, and data ...

csv_logger = CSVLogger('training_log.csv', separator=',', append=False)

model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    callbacks=[csv_logger]
)

```

This code snippet demonstrates the use of the `CSVLogger` callback. The `training_log.csv` file will contain epoch number, training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy.  The `separator` and `append` arguments control the file format and whether to append to an existing file.  Crucially, the callback is included in the `callbacks` list passed to the `model.fit` function.


**Code Example 2: Custom Callback for Enhanced Logging**

For more intricate logging requirements, a custom callback provides granular control.  This might be beneficial if you need to log additional metrics or handle specific events during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback
import numpy as np

class TrainingLogger(Callback):
    def __init__(self, filepath='training_log.txt'):
        super(TrainingLogger, self).__init__()
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.log_data = []

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        logs = logs or {}
        epoch_log = {
            'epoch': epoch,
            'loss': logs.get('loss'),
            'accuracy': logs.get('accuracy'),
            'val_loss': logs.get('val_loss'),
            'val_accuracy': logs.get('val_accuracy')
        }
        self.log_data.append(epoch_log)
        with open(self.filepath, 'w') as f:  # Overwrites at each epoch for brevity in example
            np.savetxt(f, np.array([list(entry.values()) for entry in self.log_data]), delimiter=',')
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} logged to {self.filepath}")

# ... define your model, optimizer, and data ...

custom_logger = TrainingLogger()
model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    callbacks=[custom_logger]
)
```

This example shows a custom callback that overrides the `on_epoch_end` method. This method is called at the end of each epoch, allowing you to access and record the training metrics.  The log data is saved to a text file. This demonstrates a flexible and more explicit approach for logging.  Note: For large datasets, a more efficient storage solution than overwriting a file each epoch would be necessary.


**Code Example 3: Plotting with Matplotlib**

Once the training metrics are saved, you can use Matplotlib to create visualizations.  The following example assumes the data is in a CSV file.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('training_log.csv')  # Or 'training_log.txt' if using the custom callback example

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(data['epoch'], data['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(data['epoch'], data['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(data['epoch'], data['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(data['epoch'], data['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code uses Pandas to read the CSV file and Matplotlib to create a plot with subplots for loss and accuracy.  Error handling (e.g., checking for file existence) should be added in a production setting.


**2.  Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow/Keras callbacks, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation.  The Matplotlib documentation provides comprehensive information on plot customization and creation.  Exploring resources on data visualization techniques will prove beneficial for optimizing your plots for clarity and insightful interpretation.  Finally, a solid understanding of Pandas for data manipulation will enhance your ability to efficiently process and analyze the training logs.  These resources will offer the required depth and breadth of information necessary for effectively handling this task.
