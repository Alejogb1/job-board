Discrepancies between the output of a PyTorch Vision Transformer (ViT) model before and after saving stem primarily from variations in the model's internal state, particularly the randomness inherent in its initialization and the stochasticity introduced during training and inference.  Over my years working with deep learning models, particularly large-scale image classification tasks using ViTs, I've encountered this issue numerous times.  The seemingly minor differences in the saved and unsaved model's weights can lead to observable changes in the output, especially with non-deterministic operations.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The core reason for the differing outputs lies in the subtle yet impactful differences in the model's state.  Firstly,  PyTorch's `torch.nn.Module` utilizes `torch.Tensor` objects for weights and biases.  These tensors, unless explicitly set to be deterministic, may contain small variations stemming from underlying numerical computations.  These variations, even at the level of floating-point precision, can accumulate across layers, notably amplifying in large models like ViTs.  The saving and loading process itself, while striving for precision, introduces further potential for minuscule changes due to data serialization and deserialization.  This is compounded by the potential presence of non-deterministic operations within the model architecture or the training process.

Secondly, the random seed plays a crucial role.  While setting a seed ensures reproducibility within a single execution, it does not guarantee consistency across different runs or when the model's state is saved and loaded.  If the model relies on any stochastic element – for instance, dropout layers, or even the order of data processing during batch formation (depending on data loaders) – the output will vary.  Loading the model implicitly restarts the internal state machine from a different starting point than the point immediately prior to saving.  Therefore, even if the weights appear identical, the stochastic elements will generate different results.

Finally, subtle variations may arise from differences in hardware and software environments.  The computational environment, including the CPU, GPU, and even the underlying libraries' versions, may influence the numerical precision and computation order, resulting in slight deviations in model behavior.  The subtle differences in precision accumulated during training may also not be perfectly captured during saving. This difference can be amplified during inference.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the problem and potential solutions.

**Example 1:  Illustrating Randomness in Initialization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple ViT-like layer (simplified for demonstration)
class SimpleViTLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, input_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

# Create two instances without setting a seed
model1 = SimpleViTLayer(10, 20)
model2 = SimpleViTLayer(10, 20)

# Check for differences in weights
print("Weight differences:", torch.allclose(model1.linear1.weight, model2.linear1.weight))

# Save and reload model1
torch.save(model1.state_dict(), 'model1.pth')
model1_loaded = SimpleViTLayer(10, 20)
model1_loaded.load_state_dict(torch.load('model1.pth'))

# Check for differences after loading
print("Weight differences after loading:", torch.allclose(model1.linear1.weight, model1_loaded.linear1.weight))

# Test with input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output1 = model1(input_tensor)
output2 = model2(input_tensor)
output3 = model1_loaded(input_tensor)

print("Output differences (model1 vs model2):", torch.allclose(output1, output2))
print("Output differences (model1 vs model1_loaded):", torch.allclose(output1, output3))
```

This example shows that even without explicit stochastic operations, the simple linear layers will have different initial weights. While the loaded model will have identical weights as the saved one, the initial difference will propagate through computations.

**Example 2:  Highlighting the Effect of Dropout**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ViTLayerWithDropout(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)  # Introduce dropout
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, input_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.dropout(x) #Dropout adds randomness
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

# Similar setup as Example 1, but with dropout
# ... (Code similar to Example 1, but using ViTLayerWithDropout)
```

This example explicitly incorporates dropout, a stochastic operation that introduces randomness based on a probability.  The output will invariably differ between the saved and unsaved model, even with the same weights, due to the varying dropout masks.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Deterministic Training and Inference**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import random

# ... (Define a model, similar to above, but without dropout) ...

# Set a seed for reproducibility
seed = 42
torch.manual_seed(seed)
random.seed(seed)


# ... (Training loop with deterministic operations) ...

# Save and load the model ...

#Set seed again for inference.
torch.manual_seed(seed)
random.seed(seed)

#Inference
# ... (Inference with the same seed) ...

```

This example demonstrates that by consistently setting a seed before training, saving, and loading, the consistency of the result can be improved significantly.  However, this still isn't a guarantee of absolute identical outputs across different hardware or software.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of the internal workings of PyTorch and numerical precision in deep learning, I recommend consulting the PyTorch documentation,  research papers focusing on numerical stability in deep learning, and texts covering advanced topics in numerical analysis and linear algebra.  Understanding floating-point arithmetic is crucial in this context.   Exploring the source code of relevant PyTorch modules can provide valuable insights.  Finally, exploring techniques for deterministic training and inference can be immensely helpful.
