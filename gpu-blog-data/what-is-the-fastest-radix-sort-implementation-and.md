The fastest radix sort implementation hinges critically on minimizing cache misses and exploiting data locality.  My experience optimizing sorting algorithms for high-frequency trading applications revealed that a significant performance bottleneck in radix sort, even with careful bit manipulation, stems from memory access patterns.  Therefore, focusing on cache-friendly data structures and algorithms is paramount.  While theoretical complexities suggest O(nk) time, where n is the number of elements and k is the number of digits, real-world performance heavily depends on hardware specifics and data characteristics.

**1.  Explanation:**

Radix sort operates by sorting numbers digit by digit, typically starting from the least significant digit (LSD). This iterative process leverages counting sort, a stable sorting algorithm, for each digit.  Stability ensures that the relative order of elements with the same digit value is preserved across iterations, crucial for the correctness of radix sort.  Optimizing for speed requires attention to several areas:

* **Data Structure Choice:**  Instead of using linked lists or dynamic arrays within counting sort (which introduce overhead), I've consistently found that statically allocated arrays provide the most significant performance gains. This eliminates dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, a costly operation.  Furthermore, careful alignment of these arrays to cache lines is crucial.

* **Counting Sort Optimization:** The counting sort step inherently involves counting the occurrences of each digit.  Optimizing this step involves avoiding unnecessary branching and leveraging bitwise operations where appropriate to accelerate the counting process.  For instance, using bitmasks to quickly determine the digit value can significantly reduce instruction cycles.

* **Digit Extraction:** Extracting individual digits efficiently is critical.  Instead of using division and modulo operations (which are relatively slow), I found that bitwise operations (right shifts and bitwise AND) offer substantial speed improvements, particularly when dealing with fixed-size integers.

* **Parallelism:**  Modern CPUs offer multiple cores.  Leveraging these cores through techniques like SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions or multi-threading can significantly speed up the process, especially for large datasets.  However, careful synchronization is necessary to avoid race conditions.  My experience shows that data partitioning followed by independent radix sorting on each partition, then merging the results (using a merging algorithm optimized for already partially-sorted data), provides an excellent balance between parallelization and overhead.

* **Cache Optimization:**  This is arguably the most crucial factor. Techniques such as loop unrolling, data prefetching, and padding arrays to cache line sizes can drastically reduce cache misses.  Understanding the cache hierarchy of the target architecture is essential for fine-tuning these optimizations.


**2. Code Examples:**

These examples demonstrate a base radix sort (in C++),  an optimized version utilizing bitwise operations, and a partially parallelized version. They are simplified for clarity and may lack some of the more fine-grained optimizations mentioned previously.


**Example 1: Base Radix Sort (C++)**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void radixSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int maxVal = *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int exp = 1;
    while (maxVal / exp > 0) {
        countingSort(arr, exp);
        exp *= 10;
    }
}

void countingSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int exp) {
    int n = arr.size();
    std::vector<int> output(n);
    std::vector<int> count(10, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]++;

    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
        count[i] += count[i - 1];

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        output[count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
        count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        arr[i] = output[i];
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation, suitable for demonstrating the core algorithm but lacking crucial optimizations for speed.


**Example 2: Optimized Radix Sort with Bitwise Operations (C++)**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void radixSortOptimized(std::vector<unsigned int>& arr) { //Assumes unsigned ints for simplicity
    unsigned int maxVal = *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int numBits = 0;
    while ((1 << numBits) <= maxVal) numBits++;

    for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
        countingSortOptimized(arr, i);
    }
}

void countingSortOptimized(std::vector<unsigned int>& arr, int shift) {
    int n = arr.size();
    std::vector<unsigned int> output(n);
    std::vector<int> count(256, 0); // 8 bits per pass

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        count[(arr[i] >> shift) & 0xFF]++;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < 256; i++) {
        count[i] += count[i - 1];
    }

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        output[--count[(arr[i] >> shift) & 0xFF]] = arr[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = output[i];
    }
}
```

This version utilizes bitwise operations for digit extraction and handles 8 bits at a time, significantly improving efficiency.


**Example 3: Partially Parallelized Radix Sort (Conceptual C++)**

```cpp
// This example demonstrates the conceptual approach; actual parallelization requires
// thread management and synchronization mechanisms (e.g., OpenMP or pthreads).

void radixSortParallel(std::vector<int>& arr, int numThreads) {
    // Partition the data into numThreads subarrays
    // ... (Partitioning logic using std::vector splitting) ...

    // Sort each subarray using radixSortOptimized concurrently
    // ... (Parallelization using OpenMP or pthreads) ...

    // Merge the sorted subarrays efficiently (using a merge algorithm optimized for already sorted data)
    // ... (Merge logic) ...
}
```

This example outlines a parallel approach.  The specific implementation would involve leveraging threading libraries and careful synchronization to avoid data races.  The merging step is crucial for maintaining efficiency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.  This provides a strong theoretical foundation for sorting algorithms.
*  A textbook focusing on compiler optimization and low-level programming. This helps understand how to manipulate memory access patterns.
*  Documentation for your target CPU architecture, focusing on SIMD instructions and cache management. This is crucial for achieving peak performance.

The selection of the "fastest" radix sort implementation depends heavily on the hardware and dataset characteristics.  The presented examples and strategies provide a starting point for developing a highly optimized version, but further profiling and tuning are typically needed to achieve optimal performance in a specific context.  The focus on minimizing cache misses remains paramount across all implementations.
