TensorFlow's "index 11292 out of bounds" error typically arises from attempting to access an element within a tensor that does not exist.  This is fundamentally a mismatch between the expected size of the tensor and the index used to access it. My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image processing pipelines and natural language processing models has shown that this error frequently stems from subtle indexing errors, incorrect tensor reshaping, or unexpected tensor dimensions after operations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core problem lies in the discrepancy between the requested index (11292) and the actual size of the tensor's relevant dimension. TensorFlow tensors are multi-dimensional arrays, and each dimension has a specific size.  If you attempt to access an element using an index that exceeds the upper bound of any dimension (remember, indexing typically starts at 0), the "out of bounds" error is raised. This can occur during direct indexing using `[]` or `tf.gather`, within loops iterating over tensors, or as a result of broadcasting operations where dimensions are implicitly expanded or contracted.  Furthermore, the error might be masked; it could appear downstream from the actual cause. For example, a wrong shape might propagate through several layers before manifesting as an out-of-bounds error in a later part of the computation graph. The error message itself doesn't pinpoint the source, just the point of failure.

Determining the root cause necessitates careful examination of the tensor's shape at the point of the error.  Inspecting intermediate tensor shapes through `tf.shape(tensor)` or by printing the tensor's shape within debugging statements is crucial.  Tracing back the operations leading to the problematic tensor is essential to understand where the dimension mismatch originated. This often involves reviewing slicing, concatenation, reshaping, or other operations that modify tensor dimensions. Incorrect handling of batch sizes, sequence lengths, or feature dimensions are common culprits.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Slicing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])  # Shape: (3, 3)

# Attempting to access an index out of bounds
try:
  element = tensor[0, 3]  # Accessing the 4th element of the first row (index 3) - Out of bounds!
  print(element)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")
  print(f"Tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")

# Correct slicing
element = tensor[0, 2]  # Accessing the 3rd element of the first row (index 2)
print(element)

```

This example highlights a straightforward indexing error. The tensor has 3 columns (size 3 in the second dimension), but the code attempts to access index 3, which is out of bounds.  The `try-except` block demonstrates a robust way to handle such errors, enabling the program to continue execution after informing the user of the issue and providing context such as the tensor shape.

**Example 2:  Incorrect Reshaping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])  # Shape: (6,)

# Attempting to reshape to an incompatible shape.
try:
    reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [2, 4])  # Trying to reshape a 6-element tensor into a 2x4 tensor
    element = reshaped_tensor[1, 3]
    print(element)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")

# Correct reshaping
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [2, 3])  # Correct reshaping into a 2x3 tensor
element = reshaped_tensor[1, 2]
print(element)
```

This example showcases errors arising from reshaping operations.  Incorrectly specifying the new shape will lead to an incompatible tensor, and subsequent attempts to access elements might fail.  The `tf.reshape` function requires the new shape to be compatible with the total number of elements in the original tensor.

**Example 3:  Dynamically Shaped Tensors and Loops**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def process_tensor(tensor):
    for i in range(12000): #potential issue: assuming a tensor length
        try:
            element = tensor[i]
            # ... processing element ...
            pass
        except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
            print(f"Error at iteration {i}: {e}")
            print(f"Tensor shape: {tf.shape(tensor)}")
            break #Stop after error
            
tensor = tf.random.uniform([11000], maxval=100, dtype=tf.int32)  # dynamically shaped tensor
process_tensor(tensor)

```

This illustrates a scenario where the tensor's shape is determined dynamically, and a loop iterates over it, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access.  This example demonstrates the importance of checking tensor shapes within loops, particularly when dealing with dynamically sized tensors.  The use of a `try-except` block is essential in such cases, and adding checks before each indexing operation to ensure the index is within the bounds using `tf.shape` would be best practice.  The error message in this scenario helps pinpoint exactly which index caused the issue.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive information on tensor manipulation and error handling.  Familiarizing oneself with the `tf.shape` function and using it liberally during debugging is invaluable.  Understanding broadcasting rules and how they affect tensor shapes is crucial. Consulting the TensorFlow API documentation for specific functions used in your code is essential to grasp their behavior and potential side effects on tensor shapes. A strong understanding of linear algebra and multi-dimensional arrays also proves to be highly beneficial in tackling shape related issues.  Finally, mastering debugging techniques, such as utilizing print statements strategically and using a debugger, is critical for effectively resolving these errors.  Carefully reviewing the error messages, including the specific index causing the error, can provide highly valuable clues.
