The successful loading of `libcudnn.so.7` does not guarantee successful CUDA execution.  My experience debugging similar issues across diverse HPC applications points to a mismatch between the loaded library version and the CUDA toolkit version, or more subtly, inconsistencies in the CUDA runtime environment.  The symptom, a failure *after* successful library loading, indicates the problem lies not in the library's presence, but in its interaction with other components.  This necessitates a systematic approach focusing on environment verification, library compatibility, and code-level scrutiny.

1. **Environment Verification:**  The CUDA environment relies on a tightly coupled ecosystem.  A seemingly trivial detail, like a mismatched driver version, can lead to unpredictable behavior, even with a correctly loaded `libcudnn.so.7`. I encountered this precisely during a project involving real-time image processing, where an older driver version, despite its compatibility claim, subtly interfered with cuDNN's memory management routines, manifesting as crashes after successful library loading.  Verify your CUDA driver version using `nvidia-smi` and ensure its compatibility with your CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions.  Consult the NVIDIA documentation for compatible version pairings; discrepancies here are the most frequent source of such problems.  Additionally, examine the output of `ldconfig -p | grep cudnn` to confirm the library's path and symbolic link integrity.  Inconsistencies here can disrupt the dynamic linking process, causing seemingly inexplicable failures.  Finally, ensure your environment variables, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in particular, are correctly set to include the directories containing the necessary CUDA libraries.  Overwriting or omitting these can lead to the system loading an incorrect version of a library or missing dependencies altogether.

2. **Library Compatibility:**  While `libcudnn.so.7` loaded successfully, its internal version might not be compatible with your CUDA toolkit.  This manifests as seemingly successful initialization, followed by a later crash during actual computation. The toolkit's header files and the library itself need precise alignment.  I once spent days tracking down a failure in a deep learning training script only to discover I'd inadvertently used cuDNN 7.6.5 with a CUDA toolkit designed for cuDNN 8.x.  The subtle differences in internal data structures resulted in memory corruption and a crash further along in the execution pipeline.  Check the versions of your CUDA toolkit and cuDNN using the appropriate commands within their installation directories (often involving `.so` files' property inspection).  Ensure they adhere to NVIDIA's compatibility matrix, particularly concerning minor version updates, as even these can introduce breaking changes.

3. **Code-Level Issues:** The problem might reside in your application code itself.  Even with a perfectly configured environment, improper use of CUDA functions, particularly memory management, can lead to crashes.  This frequently manifests as successful initialization, followed by errors during kernel launches or data transfers. During my work on a high-throughput data analysis project, a seemingly trivial off-by-one error in memory allocation within a custom CUDA kernel led to significant problems only during large datasets, initially masked by successful library loading.  This highlights the crucial role of thorough code review and debugging. Pay close attention to memory allocation and deallocation (`cudaMalloc`, `cudaFree`), kernel launches (`cudaLaunch`), and data transfers (`cudaMemcpy`).  Employ rigorous error checking after every CUDA API call, immediately identifying potentially problematic conditions.  Using CUDA debuggers, and carefully examining memory access patterns are vital.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Robust Error Handling**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int dev;
    cudaGetDevice(&dev);
    printf("Using device %d\n", dev);

    float *h_data, *d_data;
    int size = 1024;

    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_data, size * sizeof(float));
    if (cudaSuccess != cudaGetLastError()) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaMallocHost failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));
        return 1;
    }

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(float));
    if (cudaSuccess != cudaGetLastError()){
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));
        cudaFreeHost(h_data);
        return 1;
    }

    // ... your CUDA operations here ...

    cudaFree(d_data);
    cudaFreeHost(h_data);
    if (cudaSuccess != cudaGetLastError()){
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaFree failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This demonstrates robust error handling for each CUDA API call.  Checking `cudaGetLastError()` after every call is essential for pinpointing the exact source of the failure.

**Example 2:  Explicit Device Selection**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    printf("Number of devices: %d\n", deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "No CUDA-capable devices found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    int device = 0; // Select the desired device
    cudaSetDevice(device);
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
    printf("Using device %s\n", prop.name);

    // ... your CUDA code here ...

    return 0;
}
```
This explicitly selects a CUDA device.  Checking for available devices and handling the case of no devices found prevents unexpected behavior. Specifying the device avoids conflicts and ensures that the code runs on the intended hardware.

**Example 3:  Using `cuda-gdb` for Debugging**

```bash
cuda-gdb ./my_cuda_program
(gdb) run
(gdb) break my_cuda_function  // Set breakpoint at a specific function
(gdb) continue
(gdb) info cuda // Inspect CUDA device status
(gdb) p *d_data // Inspect memory contents
```
`cuda-gdb` provides powerful debugging capabilities for CUDA applications.  Setting breakpoints within the CUDA kernels allows you to inspect the program's state at crucial points, examining variables and memory to identify the source of the problem.  Inspecting the CUDA device state through commands like `info cuda` can provide valuable insights into potential hardware or driver issues.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.  The cuDNN library documentation.  A comprehensive C++ programming textbook focusing on memory management and error handling. A debugging guide focusing on low-level memory access and program flow within parallel computing environments.  Advanced CUDA programming resources focused on parallel algorithm design and optimization.  These resources provide detailed information on CUDA programming, debugging techniques, and best practices, crucial for effectively troubleshooting problems like this.
