The presence of two tensors visualized for a single `MaxPool2d` layer within TensorBoard, when inspecting a ResNet50 model, stems from how TensorFlow (and Keras, which often serves as its high-level API) handles gradient computation during backpropagation and the associated computational graph representation. It's not a direct reflection of the output of the MaxPool operation itself but rather, the forward pass output and the gradients propagated back through that layer.

In my experience debugging and visualizing complex convolutional neural networks, this is a relatively common point of confusion, particularly for individuals new to the nuances of automatic differentiation and computational graphs. The core issue isn't that the `MaxPool2d` layer is producing two outputs during the forward pass – it produces a single downsampled tensor. Instead, it's that TensorFlow tracks both the activations (output of the forward pass) and, more critically, the gradients of those activations during backpropagation.

When you visualize tensors within TensorBoard using callbacks (such as `keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` in TensorFlow), you're typically capturing not only the forward pass outputs of a layer but also, depending on the parameters of your callback and the configuration of your graph, the gradients calculated for backpropagation. These are distinct tensors. For a `MaxPool2d` layer, the forward pass calculates the maximum values within specified pooling windows, yielding a reduced spatial dimension tensor. However, during backpropagation, the gradient calculation must understand where to propagate the error. This is where the second tensor arises: it represents the gradients with respect to the *input* of the `MaxPool2d` operation.

During a backpropagation step, the gradient received from the subsequent layer needs to be distributed to the pre-max-pooled input. Max pooling is not a directly reversible operation due to the information loss inherent in selecting only the maximal value. Therefore, during backpropagation, the gradients are ‘routed’ back to the locations in the input feature maps that contributed to the maximal values in the output. This 'routing' process implicitly generates a tensor of the same size as the input feature maps which are connected to the max pool layer and which are necessary to calculate the gradients for the layers preceding the maxpool operation. The values in this ‘routed’ gradient tensor are used to update the weights of the previous layer. Crucially, it is not simply an inverted pooling operation but a gradient map that indicates how changes to the input *would have impacted* the output after max pooling operation in the forward pass.

The presence of these two tensors, therefore, provides a complete picture of both the forward pass activation and the backpropagation gradient flow through the `MaxPool2d` layer and aids in the debugging of neural network architecture.

Here are three code examples demonstrating how this might appear in a typical workflow, along with explanations:

**Example 1: Basic ResNet50 and TensorBoard Visualization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard
import datetime

# Load pre-trained ResNet50
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Define a dummy input tensor
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 224, 224, 3))


# Generate logs for Tensorboard with histograms of both activations and gradients.
log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

# Call the model with the dummy input
model(dummy_input)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy training and saving to trigger logging.
dummy_output = tf.random.normal(shape = (1, 1000))
model.fit(dummy_input, dummy_output, epochs=1, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])

```
*Commentary:* This code loads a pre-trained ResNet50 model and sets up a TensorBoard callback. After passing a dummy input, and performing a dummy training step with dummy output to trigger logging we expect a series of logs to be generated including one for each layer within the Resnet50 architecture. Within TensorBoard, if you navigate to the histograms tab and select a max pooling layer you will see two separate histograms. One corresponds to the tensors generated during the forward pass, while the other represents the tensors generated during back propagation. If histogram tracking is turned off for gradients you will see only one activation tensor.
It highlights the typical setup where such visualizations will be captured.

**Example 2:  Specific Layer Inspection**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPool2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard
import datetime

# Define a simple model with one max pooling layer
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))
max_pool_layer = MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(input_tensor)
model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=max_pool_layer)

# Define a dummy input tensor
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 32, 32, 3))

# Generate logs for Tensorboard with histograms of both activations and gradients.
log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

# Call the model with the dummy input
model(dummy_input)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy training and saving to trigger logging.
dummy_output = tf.random.normal(shape = (1, 16, 16, 3))
model.fit(dummy_input, dummy_output, epochs=1, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

*Commentary:* In this example, a simple custom model is constructed with a single `MaxPool2D` layer. The aim is to isolate the layer of interest and reduce complexity. We see the same principle applies even to very simple models, the tensor board is displaying both the output of the forward pass as well as the gradients generated during back propagation. This highlights the generality of this observation across diverse model structures.

**Example 3:  Disabling Gradient Histograms**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard
import datetime


# Load pre-trained ResNet50
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Define a dummy input tensor
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 224, 224, 3))

# Generate logs for Tensorboard with histograms of only activations and no gradients.
log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1, write_grads = False)

# Call the model with the dummy input
model(dummy_input)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy training and saving to trigger logging.
dummy_output = tf.random.normal(shape = (1, 1000))
model.fit(dummy_input, dummy_output, epochs=1, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])

```

*Commentary:*  Here, we demonstrate how to modify the TensorBoard callback to *only* log activation histograms. This results in TensorBoard only showing one histogram for the output of a pooling operation. This makes explicit the fact that the second tensor observed in earlier examples corresponds to the gradients during backpropagation as opposed to a second tensor generated during forward computation.

Regarding resources, I would highly recommend consulting documentation for TensorFlow and Keras. The guides on callbacks, model subclassing, automatic differentiation, and specifically the documentation for TensorBoard itself are extremely useful. Papers or articles explaining backpropagation through pooling layers are also beneficial, providing deeper insights into the mathematical processes involved. Furthermore, understanding the structure of computational graphs is fundamental to working with the back propagation through any deep learning model. This knowledge enables more meaningful debugging and optimization. A careful study of these topics will provide greater clarity about how gradients flow in networks with pooling layers.
