The "no kernel image available" error when transitioning between CUDA versions, specifically from 9.0 to 11.2, frequently points to a runtime incompatibility rooted in the compilation and execution model differences between these versions. It's not a question of simple compatibility in the sense that a driver for 11.2 would inherently allow execution of binaries compiled against 9.0. The underlying issue is more nuanced, requiring a re-evaluation of how code is compiled and linked to the appropriate CUDA runtime. My experience across several hardware migration projects, where similar "no kernel image" issues plagued initial deployment attempts, informs this response.

CUDA's binary compatibility model, or rather the lack thereof between major versions, demands that code compiled for one specific CUDA toolkit version, like 9.0, isn’t inherently executable on a system with a different runtime library, such as 11.2. The generated binary, specifically the PTX or cubin file that encapsulates the GPU instructions, relies on an implicit understanding of the CUDA API and the driver interface. The API evolves between major versions, and the driver interface also undergoes changes. Hence, a kernel compiled with 9.0 relies on the 9.0 API, and will look for the 9.0 driver interface, which simply won't be compatible with 11.2.

The “no kernel image available” error manifests when the driver cannot find a binary, or image, that it understands and can execute based on the driver version it is running under. This can be caused by the fact that, during compilation for older versions of CUDA, only compute capabilities for specific targeted GPUs were compiled, without generating an "intermediate" PTX code. Later CUDA versions support forward compatibility using a strategy where PTX code is embedded in the binary and, if needed, recompiled on the fly to create the specific cubin for the target GPU. This allows binaries targeting earlier CUDA versions to run with a later driver and runtime. However, in the case of going from 9.0 to 11.2, the opposite compatibility isn't guaranteed, and there is no guarantee that a 9.0 binary will contain embeded PTX that can be compiled on-the-fly for an 11.2-compliant driver.

Therefore, it’s incorrect to assume that the presence of the 11.2 driver is enough for 9.0 compiled code to function. Compatibility between versions requires compiling and linking using the newer CUDA toolchain.

Let me illustrate this with a few examples, focusing on compile-time and runtime configuration. Assume that I have a hypothetical CUDA kernel, `vector_add.cu`, a simplistic example that performs a vector addition:

**Example 1: Compiling and running for CUDA 9.0.**

```cpp
// vector_add.cu
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vector_add(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *a, *b, *c;
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  a = new float[n];
  b = new float[n];
  c = new float[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = (float)i;
      b[i] = (float)(i*2);
  }

  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

  cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  vector_add<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);
  cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
  {
      printf("c[%d] = %f\n", i, c[i]);
  }

  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  delete[] a;
  delete[] b;
  delete[] c;

  return 0;
}
```

**Compilation with CUDA 9.0:**

I'd use the following command to compile for a 9.0 compatible environment:

```bash
nvcc -arch=sm_35 -o vector_add_9.0 vector_add.cu -lcudart
```

Here, `sm_35` is an example architecture; other architectures might be used to target specific older NVIDIA GPUs. Running `vector_add_9.0` compiled in this manner on a system without a CUDA 9.0 runtime environment will most likely cause the "no kernel image available" error.

**Example 2: Attempting to run compiled 9.0 on CUDA 11.2:**

If I take the compiled executable `vector_add_9.0` and try to run this on a system with CUDA 11.2 installed, I would very likely get the "no kernel image available" error, confirming the incompatibility. This is because the driver for 11.2 cannot understand the compiled cubin. The driver loads but fails to find a matching binary that it can understand and execute. Even if there is no explicit error message returned by the CUDA driver, it can simply fail to execute, appearing as if nothing was triggered.

**Example 3: Compiling for CUDA 11.2:**

To run the `vector_add.cu` code successfully under the CUDA 11.2 environment, recompilation with the 11.2 toolchain is required:

```bash
nvcc -arch=sm_70 -o vector_add_11.2 vector_add.cu -lcudart
```

Here, `sm_70` represents an example compute capability that is supported by CUDA 11.2 (or newer versions). In this case, a binary that contains both cubin files and the PTX code will be generated. It is important that in CUDA 11.2 (and later) the PTX intermediate representation is embedded in the final binary, which makes it forward compatible. Executing `vector_add_11.2` on a system with an 11.2 CUDA runtime and driver will work successfully, executing the CUDA kernel on the GPU. The driver will then select the appropriate cubin to execute (or will recompile from PTX on the fly).

In summary, the "no kernel image available" error observed in this context underscores a fundamental incompatibility arising from changes in the CUDA runtime and driver interface between versions 9.0 and 11.2. Code needs to be compiled with a toolkit version that is compatible with the deployed CUDA driver and runtime environment. While forward compatibility does exist with PTX code embedding, reverse compatibility is not guaranteed. Attempting to execute binaries compiled with older toolchains on a system with newer toolchains will almost always require recompilation.
