Transaction queries in Hyperledger Fabric do not, by default, return a signed result. This behavior stems from the fundamental architectural design that prioritizes transaction consensus and immutability on the ledger. Querying, while essential for accessing data, is viewed as a read-only operation not directly requiring the same level of cryptographic assurance as transaction submission and validation. My experience developing several Fabric applications, including a multi-organizational supply chain platform, has repeatedly reinforced this understanding.

The core concept to grasp is the difference between a transaction being submitted to the ledger and a query being executed against the ledger's state. Transactions, which result in changes to the world state (the current state of the ledger's data), are processed through a rigorous workflow that includes endorsement by peers, ordering into blocks, and subsequent commitment to the ledger. Every step involves cryptographic signing and verification to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering. Querying, on the other hand, only reads the current world state. The data returned is not digitally signed by any peer or ordering service. The query execution primarily involves chaincode logic running against the ledger’s current state, returning the result of the execution to the client.

The lack of a signed query result might seem like a security vulnerability at first glance, but it's a conscious decision balancing performance and security. Requiring every query result to be signed would introduce considerable overhead, requiring the peers to involve signing and the client to involve verification. This overhead would greatly reduce query performance, impacting the responsiveness of the application. Since a query’s impact is limited to read-only operations, this level of security is considered unnecessary.

It is, however, crucial to acknowledge the implications of this design. A client application must rely on secure communication channels to access query results, primarily through TLS encrypted connections established with the peer. Additionally, the trustworthiness of the peer itself becomes an implicit trust requirement. A malicious or compromised peer could potentially return incorrect query results. Therefore, rigorous network security and peer management practices are imperative in a Hyperledger Fabric deployment.

To illustrate, consider a simple scenario with a chaincode managing assets:

**Example 1: Basic Query Execution**

This example demonstrates a typical chaincode function that reads asset information and the Javascript client code used to execute the query.

*Chaincode (Go)*
```go
func (s *SmartContract) QueryAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, assetID string) (*Asset, error) {
    assetJSON, err := ctx.GetStub().GetState(assetID)
    if err != nil {
       return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read from world state: %v", err)
    }
    if assetJSON == nil {
       return nil, fmt.Errorf("the asset %s does not exist", assetID)
    }
    asset := new(Asset)
    _ = json.Unmarshal(assetJSON, asset)
    return asset, nil
}
```
*Client (Javascript)*
```javascript
  async function queryAsset(assetID) {
    const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
    const contract = network.getContract('asset-contract');
    const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('QueryAsset', assetID);
    console.log(`Query result: ${result.toString()}`);
 }
```
This example showcases a standard query function in the chaincode which retrieves data from the ledger. The client then calls the 'QueryAsset' function using the evaluateTransaction method. Notice that the returned result is simply the raw data. No digital signature is present to verify its integrity at the transport or client level.

**Example 2: Verifying peer identity with TLS certificates**

This example focuses on the security of the communication channel using TLS. While the query result isn't signed, it's essential that the client confirms the identity of the peer it communicates with.

*Client (Javascript - showing TLS connection)*

```javascript
 const tlsOptions = {
    trustedRoots: [tlsCert], // TLS cert of the peer org
    verify: true,          //Enable verification
    clientCert: tlsClientCert, // Client cert to connect to the peer
    clientKey: tlsClientKey
  };

  const gateway = new Gateway();

  await gateway.connect(ccp, {
      identity: wallet.get("user"),
      discovery: {enabled: true, asLocalhost: false},
      tls: tlsOptions
  });

  async function queryAsset(assetID) {
     const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
     const contract = network.getContract('asset-contract');
     const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('QueryAsset', assetID);
     console.log(`Query result: ${result.toString()}`);
 }
```

Here, the client explicitly sets up the TLS connection using `tlsOptions`. The `trustedRoots` property specifies the peer’s certificate, and verification is enabled using `verify`. This confirms that the communication is with the expected peer, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. While it does not sign the query result, TLS ensures confidentiality and integrity of the query response during transit, and client verification establishes the trustworthiness of the origin.

**Example 3: Client-side result validation (Application level)**

While Hyperledger Fabric doesn’t sign query results, application-level validation can be used to add additional security. In some implementations, hash values, or other verifiable data, is stored in the ledger alongside actual data. This value can be queried and compared to the value extracted from data received.

*Chaincode (Go - updated to return a hash along with asset data)*

```go
func (s *SmartContract) QueryAssetWithHash(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, assetID string) (*AssetWithHash, error) {
    assetJSON, err := ctx.GetStub().GetState(assetID)
    if err != nil {
       return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read from world state: %v", err)
    }
    if assetJSON == nil {
       return nil, fmt.Errorf("the asset %s does not exist", assetID)
    }
    asset := new(Asset)
    _ = json.Unmarshal(assetJSON, asset)

    // Calculate Hash
    assetHash := sha256.Sum256(assetJSON)
    hashString := hex.EncodeToString(assetHash[:])
    assetWithHash := AssetWithHash {AssetData: *asset, Hash: hashString}
    return &assetWithHash, nil
}
```
*Client (Javascript - showing hash verification)*
```javascript
  async function queryAssetWithHash(assetID) {
     const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
     const contract = network.getContract('asset-contract');
     const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('QueryAssetWithHash', assetID);
     const resultObj = JSON.parse(result.toString());
     const assetData = JSON.stringify(resultObj.AssetData)
     const hashFromChaincode = resultObj.Hash

    const generatedHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(assetData).digest('hex');
     if(generatedHash === hashFromChaincode){
          console.log(`Asset verified. Data: ${assetData}`);
     }
     else {
          console.log("Error: Hash verification failed.");
     }
  }
```
This example shows an addition to the chaincode which returns a calculated hash alongside the asset. On the client side, the hash is recalculated, and the returned hash is compared to verify the integrity of the data. If the hashes do not match, it raises an error. This approach is useful when data integrity on the client-side is absolutely essential.

It is important to note that while this example adds integrity validation, it is not a replacement for a formal signature. The client is still dependent on the integrity of the chaincode execution and data as stored in the ledger. However, it mitigates against data modification occurring after it leaves the chaincode.

To reinforce secure application development within a Hyperledger Fabric ecosystem, there are resources that can provide additional guidance. Several Hyperledger Fabric documentation resources offer comprehensive information on network security and client application configuration. Specific books dedicated to Hyperledger Fabric development also contain useful chapters on secure development practices. Finally, various online communities can help with questions and specific implementation challenges.

In summary, Hyperledger Fabric does not inherently sign query results, prioritising performance for read-only operations. Security is maintained by focusing on a secure communication channel between the client and the peer. While this design choice requires careful consideration of application security, it is essential for performance. Adding additional validation on the client-side, as demonstrated with hash verification, can add additional integrity checks for critical data.
