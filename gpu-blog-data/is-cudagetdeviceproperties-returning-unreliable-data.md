In my experience profiling CUDA applications over the past decade, inconsistencies observed in `cudaGetDeviceProperties` aren't indicative of inherent unreliability within the function itself, but rather stem from misunderstandings of its operational context and potential environmental interference.  The function provides a snapshot of device properties at the time of the call;  these properties can dynamically change during runtime, leading to seemingly incongruent results across subsequent calls or comparisons with other sources of information.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`cudaGetDeviceProperties` retrieves information about a specific CUDA device.  This information includes, but isn't limited to, memory capacity, clock speeds, multiprocessor count, compute capability, and driver version.  The key understanding is that this is a *query* at a specific point in time.  Factors affecting these properties are numerous, and can be categorized as:

* **Driver Version and Updates:**  Driver updates frequently introduce optimizations and potentially alter reported device characteristics.  The reported clock speed, for instance, might reflect a boost clock achievable under specific conditions rather than a base clock.  These conditions might not always be met during runtime or even consistently during the same runtime session.

* **Power Management and Thermal Throttling:** Modern GPUs employ dynamic power and thermal management.  Under heavy load or high temperatures, the GPU might downclock to maintain stability, resulting in reported clock speeds that differ from the theoretical maximum. This is especially true in laptop environments where power budgets are strictly enforced.  Therefore, a reported clock speed from `cudaGetDeviceProperties` might not reflect the clock speed during an actual kernel launch.

* **Concurrency and Resource Contention:** Multiple processes or threads might access the GPU concurrently.  The operating system's scheduler and resource allocation policies influence the amount of resources available to a specific process at any given moment. This can affect the perceived memory bandwidth or other performance metrics indirectly reflected in reported properties or inferred from subsequent performance measurements.

* **Error Handling and Context:**  Insufficient error checking after calling `cudaGetDeviceProperties` can mask underlying problems. A failure to correctly select a CUDA device prior to calling the function will lead to undefined behavior, often resulting in seemingly random or inconsistent data.  Always check the return value of CUDA functions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Property Retrieval and Error Handling**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: No CUDA devices found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    int device = 0; // Select device 0
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: cudaGetDeviceProperties failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Device Name: %s\n", prop.name);
    printf("Major: %d, Minor: %d\n", prop.major, prop.minor);
    printf("Total Global Mem: %lld bytes\n", (long long)prop.totalGlobalMem);
    // ... other properties ...

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the proper way to obtain device properties. Note the crucial error checking after `cudaGetDeviceCount` and `cudaGetDeviceProperties`.  Failure to perform such checks can lead to misleading or catastrophic results.


**Example 2:  Observing Dynamic Changes (Illustrative)**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h> // for sleep

int main() {
    // ... (Error handling from Example 1) ...

    cudaDeviceProp prop1, prop2;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop1, 0);

    // Simulate some activity that might affect the GPU state
    // e.g., running a computationally intensive kernel or changing power settings externally.
    // This is highly system dependent and might require specific actions.
    printf("Simulating a heavy load...\n");
    sleep(5);

    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop2, 0);

    printf("Clock Speed 1: %d MHz\n", prop1.clockRate);
    printf("Clock Speed 2: %d MHz\n", prop2.clockRate);
    // ... Compare other properties ...

    return 0;
}

```

This example highlights the dynamic nature of GPU properties. The `sleep` function simulates a period of potential clock speed changes due to thermal throttling or power management. Actual methods to induce changes will be system-specific. The comparison demonstrates how results might differ.


**Example 3: Selecting and Verifying the Correct Device**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: No CUDA devices found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Explicitly select a device based on a criteria, for instance,  compute capability
    int bestDevice = -1;
    int bestComputeCapability = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; ++i) {
        cudaDeviceProp prop;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, i);
        if (prop.major * 10 + prop.minor > bestComputeCapability) {
            bestComputeCapability = prop.major * 10 + prop.minor;
            bestDevice = i;
        }
    }
    if (bestDevice == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: No suitable device found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, bestDevice);

    printf("Selected Device: %s\n", prop.name);
    // ... further operations ...
    return 0;
}
```

This example underscores the importance of device selection.  It actively searches for the device with the highest compute capability, ensuring that the subsequent calls to `cudaGetDeviceProperties` operate on the intended device, reducing the chance of obtaining unexpected or inconsistent results.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The CUDA Toolkit documentation.  Thoroughly review the descriptions and specifications of all CUDA runtime functions.
* The CUDA Programming Guide.  Understand the underlying architecture and limitations of the CUDA platform.
* A comprehensive text on parallel programming and GPU computing.  This will provide essential context for performance analysis and optimization.


By meticulously understanding the runtime environment and the dynamic nature of GPU properties, alongside robust error handling, one can effectively utilize `cudaGetDeviceProperties` and interpret its output correctly.  Attributing inconsistencies solely to the function itself is usually a premature conclusion.  My years of experience highlight that a thorough investigation into the application's context and the system's behavior is critical for accurate analysis and efficient code development.
