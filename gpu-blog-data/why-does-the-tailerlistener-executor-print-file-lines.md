The observed behavior, where a `TailerListener` executor prints file lines twice, often stems from a misunderstanding of how file tailing interacts with thread pools and the underlying mechanism for delivering change notifications. I've encountered this precise issue multiple times in my career while developing log aggregation tools, and it typically boils down to either a flawed implementation of the `Tailer` itself, or more commonly, an incorrect interpretation of the callbacks within the `TailerListener` implementation.

Essentially, the core principle of a `Tailer` is to monitor a file for changes – specifically, appends – and then signal those changes to registered listeners. However, this notification mechanism isn’t a simple, direct push model. Instead, libraries like Apache Commons IO's `Tailer` often leverage a polling or change detection mechanism. When a change is detected (typically a new line appended to the file), this triggers a callback on the registered `TailerListener`. The critical point here is that, depending on thread pool configurations and the `Tailer`'s inner workings, it is possible for the callback to be executed more than once for the same perceived change, even though the underlying file only registered a single append.

The duplication typically arises because of concurrent execution within the thread pool associated with the listener. Suppose the `Tailer` detects an append and places a task into the thread pool to process it. At the same time, depending on the polling interval or change detection mechanism, if a second poll occurs immediately afterwards and still detects the changed file, the `Tailer` might *again* schedule a processing task. Now two tasks from the same change might be active. If the listener's code that processes the line isn’t aware of this, it will print the same line twice.

The core issue is the combination of the "change detection" behavior of the tailer and asynchronous processing within the `ExecutorService`. A poorly configured executor, or the assumption that the tailer's change detection is infallible, leads to this duplication.

Here's an example of a `TailerListener` implementation illustrating how the duplication can occur:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListenerAdapter;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class DuplicationExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        File logFile = new File("test.log");
        logFile.createNewFile(); // Create a dummy file

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        TailerListener listener = new TailerListenerAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void handle(String line) {
                System.out.println("Line: " + line);
            }
        };

        Tailer tailer = new Tailer(logFile, listener, 100, true); // Poll every 100ms
        executor.submit(tailer); // Submit Tailer to executor

        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5); // Simulate the application running for a few seconds

        executor.shutdownNow();

        try {
            executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e)
        {
          //Handle thread interrupt exception.
        }
        
    }
}
```

In this basic example, the `Tailer` instance is submitted directly to the executor. The `Tailer` polls the file every 100 milliseconds. A `TailerListenerAdapter` is used as a simple listener and the core listener functionality prints to system.out. While not inherently flawed, this implementation suffers when coupled with an environment that writes quickly to the file. Multiple polls can identify a change, resulting in multiple lines being published to the listener, if it's fast enough. It showcases how the polling mechanism in tandem with a thread pool can yield duplicate prints.

To mitigate the duplication, one must employ a strategy that prevents redundant task submission. This is typically achieved through a combination of adjustments to the listener's behavior or adjustments to the tailer itself by using a single-threaded executor or making sure the listener execution is thread-safe. Here's a revised example using a lock:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListenerAdapter;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class LockExample {

    private static final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private static String lastLine = "";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        File logFile = new File("test.log");
        logFile.createNewFile(); // Create a dummy file

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);


        TailerListener listener = new TailerListenerAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void handle(String line) {
                lock.lock();
                try{
                  if (!line.equals(lastLine)){
                    System.out.println("Line: " + line);
                    lastLine = line;
                  }
                }
                finally{
                  lock.unlock();
                }
            }
        };

        Tailer tailer = new Tailer(logFile, listener, 100, true);
        executor.submit(tailer);

       TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);

       executor.shutdownNow();

       try{
         executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
       }
        catch(InterruptedException e)
        {
          //Handle thread interrupt exception.
        }
    }
}
```
In this revised implementation, a `ReentrantLock` is introduced to ensure only one thread processes a given line. The lock is acquired before the processing logic and released in a finally block to prevent accidental deadlocks. By maintaining a 'lastLine' variable, we can ignore subsequent calls for the same line if they happen to execute concurrently, mitigating the duplication. However, this approach still has a potential problem. If multiple lines are written to the logfile, while the single threaded execution mitigates duplicate detection of the same line, it doesn’t mitigate multiple lines being detected and delivered in quick succession by the tailer and thread pool.

A more robust and less resource intensive approach involves a custom `TailerListener` that leverages a `BlockingQueue` for processing and a single dedicated thread to consume it, effectively processing the lines sequentially.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListener;
import org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListenerAdapter;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;


public class QueueExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        File logFile = new File("test.log");
        logFile.createNewFile(); // Create a dummy file

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        LinkedBlockingQueue<String> lineQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();


        TailerListener listener = new TailerListenerAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void handle(String line) {
                lineQueue.offer(line);
            }
        };

        Tailer tailer = new Tailer(logFile, listener, 100, true);
        executor.submit(tailer);

        // Dedicated consumer thread.
        executor.submit(() ->{
           try{
               while(true){
                 String line = lineQueue.take();
                  System.out.println("Line: " + line);
               }
           }
           catch (InterruptedException e){
              //Handle thread interrupt.
           }
        });

       TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);

       executor.shutdownNow();

       try {
         executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
       }
       catch (InterruptedException e)
       {
         //Handle thread interrupt exception.
       }
    }
}
```

In this final example, the listener adds lines to a `LinkedBlockingQueue`. A dedicated thread consumes these lines from the queue and processes them sequentially. This ensures lines are printed in the order they arrived, without any duplication and the processing is completely decoupled from the tailer and the thread pool that submits the tailer to the executor. The `LinkedBlockingQueue` acts as a safe and reliable handoff mechanism. This offers the benefits of both asynchronous and single-threaded behavior.

For developers seeking to deepen their understanding of thread pool management and concurrent programming in Java, I highly recommend consulting resources such as "Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz and "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch. In addition, extensive documentation provided with libraries like Apache Commons IO can significantly improve one’s understanding of specific utilities, such as the `Tailer`. Understanding these resources is key to debugging subtle threading issues like this one. The key takeaway is to understand the interplay between the tailing mechanism and thread execution for robust file change processing.
