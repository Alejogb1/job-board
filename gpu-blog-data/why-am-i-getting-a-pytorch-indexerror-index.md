IndexError: index out of range in PyTorch, in my experience, almost always boils down to a mismatch between the dimensions of the tensor you're indexing into and the indices you're providing. It’s a fundamental issue of accessing a memory location outside the bounds of allocated storage for your tensor. When working with PyTorch, tensors representing multi-dimensional data can quickly become complex, making this particular error a common hurdle.

The core of the issue stems from how tensors are structured and indexed. A tensor of shape `(N, C, H, W)` for example, representing a batch of `N` images with `C` channels, `H` height, and `W` width, requires four indices to pinpoint a specific element. Attempting to access an element using, say, just three indices, or if one of your indices surpasses the corresponding dimension's length will trigger the `IndexError`. The debugger often highlights the line where this indexing occurs, yet pinpointing *why* the indices are incorrect requires closer examination of the code’s logic and preceding data manipulations.

Several common coding patterns frequently lead to this error. One, for instance, involves attempting to access the tensor using hardcoded indices that may not reflect the actual dimensions computed during training or processing. Another arises from improper slicing operations, especially when combined with dynamically changing shapes due to operations such as `torch.cat` or reshaping. Resizing or reshaping tensors, particularly after operations like pooling or convolution, can easily alter dimensions, and relying on previous assumptions about tensor shape will result in out-of-bounds errors. Furthermore, faulty indexing when working with batch data, especially in scenarios where the batch size may vary during training, can also be a contributor. Failing to properly account for padding in sequence processing operations is another common pitfall.

Let's delve into a few code examples that demonstrate these points and how one might avoid them.

**Example 1: Hardcoded Indices and Dynamic Shape Changes**

```python
import torch

# Assume a tensor of shape (batch_size, features) generated earlier in the code
# Let's simulate a batch size of 3
batch_size = 3
features = 10
data = torch.randn(batch_size, features)

# This naive approach is prone to errors, as batch_size might change
index = 0
# The below line will error only if a batch size smaller than 2 is used later
result = data[1, index] # Attempting to access the 2nd element of batch data.

# Correct way:
# always work with the actual size of the tensor
actual_batch_size = data.shape[0]
index_within_batch = 0
if actual_batch_size > 1:
    result_safe = data[1, index_within_batch] # Accesses second item of batch, if available
    print(f"Accessed element at {1},{index_within_batch}. Correct shape: {data.shape}")

# Incorrect way assuming batch_size is always 2. This will raise an exception when batch_size is < 2
#if batch_size >= 2:
#    result_incorrect = data[1, 0] # Dangerous - depends on hardcoded assumption that batch size is 2.
#    print("Accessed element. (Incorrect, relying on hardcoded shape)")
#else:
#    print("Batch size is too small")
```

In this example, I have simulated a scenario where the batch size can vary. Using the hardcoded `1` as a batch index could lead to issues if the batch size is less than 2. The corrected approach dynamically gets the `actual_batch_size` and only performs the index when it's within valid range. This emphasizes the importance of using `tensor.shape` to derive information on tensor dimensions. The commented out incorrect part highlights the issue of making hardcoded assumptions about size, which could cause the index to be out of bounds, especially during iterative training loops with batches.

**Example 2: Reshaping and Inconsistent Indexing**

```python
import torch

# Start with a 2D tensor
data = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)

# Reshape it to a 1D tensor
data_flattened = data.reshape(-1)

# Incorrect indexing:
# This will cause an error, because the original shape is not valid after reshaping
# This index will raise an error
#wrong_index = data[1, 2]

# Correct indexing for the reshaped tensor:
correct_index = 5
if correct_index < data_flattened.shape[0]:
  result_flattened = data_flattened[correct_index]
  print(f"Accessed element at {correct_index}. Correct shape: {data_flattened.shape}")
else:
    print(f"Index is out of range after flattening")


# Another incorrect example
#result_reshaped = data_flattened[1, 2] # Raises an error, as it has only 1 dimension

# Trying to access it using the original 2D indices without resizing/reshaping results in error.
```

Here, we initiate with a 2D tensor and then reshape it into a 1D tensor using `reshape(-1)`. When reshaped, the tensor's structure changes, and trying to index using the original 2D indexing pattern (`[1, 2]`) produces an error. I show the correct way to index into the flattened tensor `data_flattened` using its new 1D shape. Again, checking the size prior to accessing the index helps avoid errors. The example demonstrates the critical need to be mindful of tensor dimensionality transformations when indexing.

**Example 3: Batch Data Processing and Variable Lengths**

```python
import torch

# Simulate a batch of sequences with different lengths
seq1 = torch.arange(5)
seq2 = torch.arange(3)
seq3 = torch.arange(7)
sequences = [seq1, seq2, seq3]

# Attempting to naively create a tensor from these directly will likely fail
#padded_sequences = torch.stack(sequences) # This will fail due to different lengths

# Instead we must manually pad them to max sequence length, or work with sequence-masks:
max_len = max([seq.shape[0] for seq in sequences])
padded_seqs = torch.zeros(len(sequences), max_len, dtype=torch.int64)
# create sequence masks as well to use when indexing
mask = torch.zeros(len(sequences), max_len, dtype=torch.bool)


for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):
    seq_len = seq.shape[0]
    padded_seqs[i, :seq_len] = seq
    mask[i, :seq_len] = True

# Correct access by masking to avoid index out of range errors when accessing the data
for i in range(len(sequences)):
    for j in range(max_len):
      if mask[i,j]: # Mask out sequence index locations that are just padding.
        value_safe = padded_seqs[i, j]
        print(f"Safe access of {value_safe} at position {i}, {j}")
      # if no mask, the padded positions are skipped

# Incorrect attempt at accessing sequence data
#for i in range(len(sequences)):
#    result_incorrect = padded_seqs[i, 6]  # Possible error if sequence is shorter than 7

```

This example highlights challenges when working with variable-length sequences in a batch. Attempting to directly stack the sequences would cause a dimension mismatch error. I have demonstrated a manual padding strategy using `torch.zeros` and then filling in the actual sequence data. I have used a `mask` to keep track of the valid indices in the padded tensor. The safe way to access the data is to verify the mask before trying to index, and the commented incorrect section demonstrates the error that will occur if we try to blindly access the padded regions.

To effectively mitigate `IndexError: index out of range`, meticulous attention to detail is required when handling tensor manipulation. Before indexing, use `tensor.shape` to confirm the expected dimensions. Where possible, avoid using hardcoded values, especially within iterative processes. Employ logging and debugging tools to track tensor shapes at crucial stages during your program's execution. The `torch.Size` objects returned by `tensor.shape` are immensely valuable for this. Employ tensor operations like `torch.clamp` or `torch.where` to ensure indices remain within valid bounds when necessary. Incorporate explicit checks to validate the ranges before accessing specific tensor elements. Finally, for more complex or irregular structures, consider using data structures such as masks to avoid invalid accesses, as demonstrated in the sequence example.

For further understanding, I recommend delving deeper into the PyTorch documentation regarding tensor manipulation and indexing specifically. Additionally, studying research papers that discuss handling varying lengths when using sequence models is helpful for more complex situations involving this error. Books on deep learning frequently touch upon techniques that address these problems as well.
