Setting `reuse=True` within the TensorFlow variable scope significantly impacts variable creation and sharing across different parts of a computational graph.  In essence, it dictates whether TensorFlow should create new variables or reuse existing ones with the same name.  My experience troubleshooting complex, multi-model architectures heavily relied on a precise understanding of this parameter; misusing it frequently led to unexpected behavior, particularly during model restoration from checkpoints.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's variable scope mechanism provides a hierarchical namespace for managing variables.  Each variable is identified by its name, which is implicitly determined by its location within nested scopes.  When a variable is defined within a scope, TensorFlow checks if a variable with the same name already exists within that scope or any of its ancestor scopes.  If `reuse=True` is set, and a variable with a matching name is found, TensorFlow will reuse the existing variable. Otherwise, a new variable will be created, potentially leading to unexpected duplicate variables if not carefully managed.  This mechanism is fundamental for implementing weight sharing in neural networks, where multiple layers or branches may benefit from sharing parameters, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and promoting regularization.

The `reuse` parameter operates at the scope level, not at the individual variable level. Consequently, setting `reuse=True` affects all subsequent variable creations within that scope. This means if you create a variable named 'weights' in a scope with `reuse=True`, TensorFlow will find and use any existing 'weights' within that scope or its parents. It will then not create another variable.  Crucially, attempting to create a variable with a name that does not already exist when `reuse=True` is set will raise a `ValueError`, indicating that the variable is not found. This exception provides a crucial safeguard against unintended variable creations.

The behavior of `reuse=True` is intricately tied to the lifecycle of variables and the graph's construction.  Variables are created only when they are first assigned a value.  Setting `reuse=True` beforehand doesn't guarantee variable reuse if the variable isn't subsequently assigned. Only when the code attempts to assign a value to a variable with a name already present in the scope will TensorFlow initiate the reuse behavior. This subtlety is often overlooked, causing confusion during development.

Furthermore, the impact of `reuse=True` extends beyond simple variable sharing.  It also affects the behavior of operations that depend on the variables. If a variable is reused, any operations connected to it will also use the reused variable’s value, which has implications for the gradient calculations during backpropagation.  For instance, in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the `reuse=True` flag is critical for correctly sharing weights across different time steps, allowing the network to maintain a consistent state throughout the sequence.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Weight Sharing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("my_scope") as scope:
    weights = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5])
    bias = tf.get_variable("bias", shape=[5])
    #... some operations using weights and bias

    scope.reuse_variables() #Setting reuse=True for the scope
    weights_reused = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5])
    bias_reused = tf.get_variable("bias", shape=[5])
    # ... further operations using weights_reused and bias_reused (same variables)

    # Attempting to create a new variable in the same scope will fail
    # This demonstrates the impact of reuse=True
    try:
        new_var = tf.get_variable("new_variable", shape=[2,2])
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")

```

This demonstrates basic weight sharing. The second call to `tf.get_variable` reuses `weights` and `bias` from the first definition.  Attempting to define a new variable results in a ValueError, highlighting the crucial point about variable availability.


**Example 2:  Illustrating the importance of variable assignment:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("my_scope") as scope:
    weights = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())

    scope.reuse_variables()
    try:
        reused_weights = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5])  #Reuses weights
        print("Reused weights shape:", reused_weights.shape)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")

    scope.reuse_variables()
    reused_weights2 = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5], initializer=tf.ones_initializer()) #Creates a new variable with same name (No reuse)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print("Weights:", sess.run(weights))
    print("Reused weights:", sess.run(reused_weights))
    print("Reused weights2:", sess.run(reused_weights2))
```

This example showcases the requirement for assignment in order for a variable to be considered for reuse. The second attempt to reuse the variable results in an error, while re-assigning to it explicitly creates a new variable, even with `reuse=True`.

**Example 3:  Nested Scopes and Reuse:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("outer_scope") as outer_scope:
    with tf.variable_scope("inner_scope") as inner_scope:
        weights1 = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[5, 2])

    with tf.variable_scope(outer_scope, reuse=True): #Reuse the outer scope
        with tf.variable_scope("inner_scope", reuse=True): #Reuse the inner scope
            weights2 = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[5,2])

    with tf.variable_scope(outer_scope, reuse=True):
      try:
          weights3 = tf.get_variable("weights_new", shape=[5,2])
      except ValueError as e:
          print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")


with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print("weights1:", sess.run(weights1))
    print("weights2:", sess.run(weights2))
```

This illustrates reuse across nested scopes. `weights2` reuses `weights1` because both `outer_scope` and `inner_scope` are explicitly reused.  The final `try-except` block demonstrates that even with `reuse=True` in the outer scope, creating a new variable within the inner scope without explicitly setting `reuse` there will raise an error.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's variable scope and graph management, I would recommend carefully reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on variable management.  Furthermore, the source code itself provides valuable insights into the mechanisms involved.  Studying examples from established TensorFlow projects – particularly those demonstrating complex model architectures – can greatly aid in developing practical expertise.  Finally, I would recommend mastering debugging techniques specific to TensorFlow, as identifying issues related to variable sharing requires a systematic approach.  A solid grasp of these resources is essential for effective and error-free TensorFlow development.
