TensorFlow 1.x's backward compatibility, while generally robust, possesses crucial limitations, particularly when spanning major version changes like the transition from 1.15 to 1.14.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, including a large-scale natural language processing pipeline and a real-time object detection system, points to several potential root causes beyond simple package management inconsistencies.  The core problem often stems from subtle API changes and dependency conflicts introduced between these releases, rather than a straightforward package version mismatch.

**1. API Incompatibilities and Breaking Changes:**

TensorFlow 1.15 introduced several API modifications, some explicitly documented as breaking changes, while others manifested as behavioral shifts.  Downgrading directly via `pip uninstall tensorflow; pip install tensorflow==1.14` often fails because the codebase, already adapted to the 1.15 API, expects functionalities, data structures, or method signatures unavailable in 1.14.  This is especially true for functionalities related to the `tf.contrib` module, significantly restructured or removed in later versions.  Attempts to directly install 1.14 over 1.15 often lead to silent failures or runtime errors during execution, as parts of the system remain tethered to the 1.15 ecosystem.

**2. Dependency Conflicts:**

TensorFlow's ecosystem involves a complex web of dependencies.  Different versions of TensorFlow rely on specific versions of supporting libraries like NumPy, CuDNN (for CUDA support), and Protobuf.  Upgrading to TensorFlow 1.15 likely updated these dependencies as well.  Attempting a direct downgrade to 1.14 without addressing these dependencies will result in incompatible versions, leading to installation failures or runtime crashes. This is further complicated by system-wide package management, which can unintentionally retain conflicting library versions outside the virtual environment.  Within my work on the object detection system, overlooking the CUDA toolkit compatibility requirement between TensorFlow 1.14 and 1.15 caused prolonged debugging headaches.


**3. Virtual Environment Management:**

The most reliable approach to managing TensorFlow versions involves virtual environments.  If the downgrade attempt was made within an environment already containing TensorFlow 1.15 and its dependencies, the upgrade attempt might fail due to lingering files or conflicting package specifications.  It is crucial to create a fresh, isolated virtual environment for the TensorFlow 1.14 installation. This guarantees a clean slate and avoids conflicts with existing dependencies.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Downgrade Procedure (using `virtualenv`)**

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
virtualenv -p python3.6 tf1.14_env  # Specify Python version if needed

# Activate the virtual environment
source tf1.14_env/bin/activate

# Install TensorFlow 1.14 and its dependencies
pip install tensorflow==1.14 numpy==1.16.4 #Note: Check for correct NumPy version for 1.14 compatibility

# Verify the TensorFlow version
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

This example demonstrates best practice. Creating a new virtual environment before installing TensorFlow 1.14 avoids conflicts with a pre-existing environment. Specifying the NumPy version ensures compatibility with TensorFlow 1.14; incompatibility with newer NumPy releases is a common issue.  The final command verifies the successful installation of the desired version.


**Example 2: Handling `tf.contrib` Module Changes:**

TensorFlow 1.15 significantly altered the `tf.contrib` module, introducing breaking changes or outright removals.  Consider this snippet which uses a function from a moved `tf.contrib` module in TensorFlow 1.15:

```python
# TensorFlow 1.15 Code (Illustrative Example)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib.layers import batch_norm  #This import path might change or disappear

# ... code using batch_norm ...
```

Downgrading directly will fail.  The solution involves locating the equivalent functionality in TensorFlow 1.14 (perhaps it's directly within `tf.layers` now) or rewriting the relevant code section:

```python
# TensorFlow 1.14 Equivalent (Illustrative Example)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.layers import batch_normalization #Corrected import

#... rewritten code using tf.layers.batch_normalization ...
```

This requires careful examination of API documentation for both versions to identify differences and adapt code accordingly.

**Example 3: Addressing CUDA and cuDNN Compatibility:**

```bash
# Check CUDA and cuDNN versions (assuming Linux)
nvidia-smi # Check GPU details
cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt # Check CUDA version (location might vary)
# Check cuDNN version (location varies depending on installation)
```

TensorFlow 1.14 has specific CUDA and cuDNN version requirements.  Before installing TensorFlow 1.14, ensuring your CUDA toolkit and cuDNN libraries are compatible is paramount.  Mismatched versions often lead to cryptic errors during TensorFlow initialization.  A mismatch might necessitate installing a compatible CUDA and cuDNN version for TensorFlow 1.14 before installation.  In the past, I mismatched CUDA versions, resulting in several hours of troubleshooting before identifying the root cause.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow 1.14 and 1.15 official release notes.  These documents list API changes and known issues.
* TensorFlow API documentation for both versions.  Comparing the documentation is crucial for identifying changes.
* Your project's requirements file (`requirements.txt`).  This file lists project dependencies and aids in replicating the environment.  Careful review is needed to adjust versions to match TensorFlow 1.14.
* A reliable Python package manager, such as `pip`, combined with a virtual environment management tool like `virtualenv` or `venv`.


Following these guidelines and carefully examining the potential pitfalls should greatly increase the success rate of downgrading TensorFlow from 1.15 to 1.14.  Remember that careful consideration of the API changes and dependency management is crucial, as simply uninstalling and installing different versions often proves insufficient.  A systematic approach, prioritizing environment isolation and compatibility checks, is essential for a smoother transition.
