The assertion that TensorFlow and PyTorch GPUs are unavailable in Ubuntu 18.04 is inaccurate.  The lack of GPU acceleration is not inherent to the operating system itself, but rather stems from incomplete or improperly configured CUDA and cuDNN installations, or a mismatch between hardware and software capabilities.  During my time developing high-performance computing solutions for a large financial institution, I frequently encountered this issue, often tracing it back to seemingly minor configuration oversights.  The core problem resides in ensuring the necessary drivers and libraries are correctly installed and compatible with the specific GPU and TensorFlow/PyTorch versions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Ubuntu 18.04, while now considered an older LTS release, remains capable of supporting GPU acceleration for TensorFlow and PyTorch.  The process involves several interdependent steps:

* **NVIDIA Driver Installation:**  The foundation is the correct NVIDIA driver for your specific GPU. This driver provides the low-level interface between the operating system and the GPU hardware.  Incorrect or missing drivers are the most frequent cause of GPU acceleration failures.  Using the NVIDIA-provided installer is generally recommended over using the generic `apt` package manager for optimal performance and stability.  Post-installation, verification through `nvidia-smi` is crucial to confirm driver installation and GPU identification.

* **CUDA Toolkit Installation:**  CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model. It provides the necessary libraries and tools to allow TensorFlow and PyTorch to utilize the GPU's processing power. The correct CUDA version must match your NVIDIA driver version and the TensorFlow/PyTorch versions you intend to use.  Mixing incompatible versions almost certainly leads to errors.  Careful attention to version compatibility information from NVIDIA's website is critical.

* **cuDNN Installation:** cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. It significantly improves the performance of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.  Again, version compatibility with CUDA and your specific frameworks is essential.  Incorrect versions or a missing cuDNN installation are common reasons why GPU acceleration is not functioning as expected.

* **Framework Installation:** TensorFlow and PyTorch installations must be configured to utilize CUDA. This usually involves specifying CUDA-enabled wheels or building the frameworks from source with CUDA support enabled. The installation instructions for both frameworks explicitly detail the necessary build options and dependencies. Failing to follow these instructions rigorously will result in CPU-only execution.

* **Environment Variables:**  Correctly setting environment variables such as `CUDA_HOME`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `PATH` is paramount. These variables direct the system to locate the necessary CUDA and cuDNN libraries.  Incorrectly set or missing environment variables are a frequent source of subtle errors that are difficult to diagnose.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Installation**

```bash
# Check CUDA installation
nvcc --version

# Check CUDA libraries
ldconfig -p | grep libcuda
```

This code snippet checks the CUDA toolkit installation. The first command verifies the `nvcc` compiler is installed and displays its version.  The second command lists shared libraries, specifically searching for `libcuda`, indicating the presence of essential CUDA runtime libraries.  Failure to find these libraries indicates a problem with the CUDA installation.  I've personally used this snippet countless times to troubleshoot deployment issues on various servers.


**Example 2: TensorFlow GPU Check**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This short Python script checks if TensorFlow can detect any GPUs.  If the output is 0, then TensorFlow isn't accessing the GPU, implying issues with the CUDA/cuDNN configuration or driver problems.  During my work, I found this to be a rapid and reliable method to isolate whether the issue is with TensorFlow's GPU detection or earlier in the pipeline.


**Example 3: PyTorch GPU Check**

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())
print(torch.cuda.device_count())
```

This Python code checks PyTorch's ability to utilize a GPU. The first line checks for GPU availability; the second reports the number of available GPUs.  A `False` output for the first line, or 0 for the second, signals a problem with PyTorch's GPU setup.  This simple check has saved me countless hours debugging GPU-related problems in PyTorch applications within our firm.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Documentation: This official documentation offers detailed instructions on installing and configuring the CUDA toolkit, covering various operating systems and hardware configurations.

* NVIDIA cuDNN Documentation:  This comprehensive guide explains how to install and use cuDNN, including compatibility information and detailed explanations of its features.

* TensorFlow Installation Guide: TensorFlow's official documentation provides comprehensive instructions for installing and configuring TensorFlow on various platforms, including guidance on GPU support.

* PyTorch Installation Guide:  Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch's official documentation covers installation and configuration details with explicit instructions for leveraging GPU acceleration.


In conclusion, the absence of GPU functionality in TensorFlow and PyTorch on Ubuntu 18.04 is not inherent to the system.  A systematic approach, involving careful driver installation, accurate CUDA and cuDNN version selection, and meticulous framework configuration, along with verifying the environment variables, are critical steps towards achieving GPU acceleration. Using the provided code examples and consulting the recommended documentation will significantly aid in resolving such issues.  My extensive experience working with these technologies in high-demand environments has repeatedly underscored the importance of meticulous attention to these details.
