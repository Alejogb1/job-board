The `InaccessibleTensorError` in TensorFlow 2.0 typically arises from attempting to access a tensor that's been deallocated or is otherwise outside the scope of the current computation graph. This stems from a fundamental difference between eager execution (the default in TF2.0) and graph execution, and a misunderstanding of tensor lifetimes within these execution modes.  My experience troubleshooting this error across numerous large-scale model deployments has highlighted the crucial role of tensor management and the proper use of TensorFlow's control flow operations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's eager execution allows for immediate execution of operations, dispensing with the explicit construction of a computational graph beforehand.  This improves debugging and simplifies the development process, especially for beginners. However, it also necessitates a more diligent approach to memory management.  Unlike graph execution, where the graph retains tensors until explicitly deleted, eager execution releases tensors once they're no longer needed.  The `InaccessibleTensorError` manifests when your code attempts to access a tensor that's already been deallocated due to this automatic memory management.

Several scenarios commonly lead to this error:

* **Accessing tensors outside their scope:** A tensor created within a function or loop might be deallocated once that block completes, rendering subsequent attempts to access it invalid.
* **Incorrect use of control flow:**  Improperly structured `tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`, or custom control flow operations can lead to tensors being prematurely released.
* **Tensor sharing across different sessions or graphs:** This is especially relevant in distributed TensorFlow scenarios. Accessing a tensor created within one session or graph from another results in an error.
* **Using tensors after a `tf.reset_default_graph()` call:**  While less common in eager execution, this can still occur if you inadvertently reuse graph-based operations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Tensor Scope:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_function():
  tensor_a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
  return tensor_a

tensor_b = my_function()
# This line will likely raise an InaccessibleTensorError if eager execution is enabled
print(tensor_b.numpy())  
```

**Commentary:** The tensor `tensor_a` is created within `my_function()`. Once `my_function()` finishes execution, `tensor_a` is typically deallocated.  Attempting to access it outside the function, through the variable `tensor_b`, throws the `InaccessibleTensorError`.  The solution is to either return the tensor's value (e.g., using `.numpy()`) within the function or design the code to operate entirely within the function's scope.


**Example 2: Problematic Control Flow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_c = tf.constant(0)
condition = tf.constant(True)

def conditional_operation(condition, tensor_c):
    if condition:
        tensor_d = tf.add(tensor_c, 1)
        return tensor_d
    else:
        return tensor_c

tensor_e = conditional_operation(condition, tensor_c)

# This may raise the InaccessibleTensorError (depending on Tensorflow's internal optimization).
# The tensor_d is potentially deallocated after exiting the if statement, even if tensor_e references it.
print(tensor_e.numpy())
```


**Commentary:**  Improperly managed control flow, particularly in eager execution, can lead to similar errors. Although `tensor_e` should logically reference `tensor_d`, TensorFlow's optimization might deallocate `tensor_d` immediately after the `if` block. To mitigate this, you should explicitly ensure the tensor's lifetime is extended within the control flow structure, perhaps through explicit assignments or by leveraging TensorFlow's control flow functions more strategically (using `tf.cond` instead of Python `if` is usually preferable for this reason).


**Example 3:  Retaining Tensor Reference:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_f = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])
tensor_g = tensor_f  # Explicitly keep a reference to the tensor.

# Perform some computation...
tensor_h = tf.multiply(tensor_g, 2)

print(tensor_h.numpy()) # This should work correctly.
```

**Commentary:** In this example, `tensor_g` maintains a direct reference to `tensor_f`.  This ensures `tensor_f` remains accessible even after computations involving it, preventing the `InaccessibleTensorError`. While seemingly simple, this explicit referencing is a cornerstone of preventing errors stemming from implicit deallocation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on eager execution and control flow, provide invaluable guidance.  Furthermore,  thorough understanding of Python's memory management and scoping rules is crucial.  Supplement this knowledge with a debugging-focused approach; using TensorFlow's debugging tools and logging effectively will reveal the timing and location of the deallocation leading to the error.  Finally, familiarize yourself with the nuances of  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation and gradient calculations, as these processes can implicitly influence tensor lifetimes.  Analyzing memory profiles of your code during execution is also a highly effective debugging technique.
