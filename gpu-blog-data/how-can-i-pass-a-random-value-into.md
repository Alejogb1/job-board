The core challenge in passing a random value into a TensorFlow function lies in ensuring proper tensor manipulation within the TensorFlow graph execution paradigm.  Directly feeding Python's random number generators into TensorFlow operations can lead to inconsistencies, particularly during distributed training or when using TensorFlow's eager execution mode.  The solution hinges on employing TensorFlow's built-in random number generation functionalities to maintain consistency and ensure reproducibility. My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale model deployments highlights the importance of this approach.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's computational graph operates differently from typical Python code execution.  Python's `random` module generates numbers outside this graph, making them inaccessible to TensorFlow's optimization and parallelization mechanisms.  Consequently, using Python's random numbers directly might result in different random numbers being generated on different runs or across distributed nodes, undermining reproducibility and potentially corrupting training processes.

To overcome this, TensorFlow provides operations for generating random tensors within the computational graph. This allows TensorFlow to manage the random number generation process, ensuring consistency across different executions and environments. These operations are typically seeded for reproducibility; that is, specifying a seed value guarantees the same sequence of random numbers across runs.  This is paramount for debugging and ensuring reliable experiments.  The key is to integrate random number generation *inside* the TensorFlow graph rather than as an external input.

Several TensorFlow distributions are available, including `tf.random.normal`, `tf.random.uniform`, and `tf.random.truncated_normal`, catering to different needs in terms of probability distributions.  Choosing the appropriate distribution depends on the specific application and desired properties of the random variable.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Generating a single random number:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_tf_function(shape, seed):
  """Generates a random tensor of specified shape using a given seed."""
  tf.random.set_seed(seed)  # Set global seed for reproducibility
  random_tensor = tf.random.uniform(shape, minval=0, maxval=1, dtype=tf.float32)
  return random_tensor

# Generate a single random number between 0 and 1
random_number = my_tf_function(shape=[], seed=42) # shape [] indicates a scalar
print(random_number)

# Rerun with the same seed, you should get the same number
random_number_again = my_tf_function(shape=[], seed=42)
print(random_number_again)
```

This example demonstrates generating a single random number using `tf.random.uniform`. The `set_seed` function ensures reproducibility. Changing the `seed` value will result in a different random number.  The use of an empty shape (`[]`) specifies a scalar value.

**Example 2: Generating a random tensor:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_tf_function(shape, seed, mean, stddev):
  """Generates a random tensor from a normal distribution."""
  tf.random.set_seed(seed)
  random_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape, mean=mean, stddev=stddev, dtype=tf.float32)
  return random_tensor

# Generate a 2x3 tensor of random numbers from a normal distribution
shape = [2, 3]
mean = 0.0
stddev = 1.0
seed = 123
random_tensor = my_tf_function(shape, seed, mean, stddev)
print(random_tensor)
```

Here, a 2x3 tensor is generated from a normal distribution using `tf.random.normal`.  The `mean`, `stddev`, and `seed` parameters provide control over the distribution and reproducibility.  The importance of specifying a `dtype` (data type) should be noted for numerical precision.

**Example 3:  Using random values within a more complex function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def complex_tf_function(input_tensor, seed):
  """Demonstrates incorporating random values within a larger computation."""
  tf.random.set_seed(seed)
  random_weights = tf.random.normal([input_tensor.shape[1], 5], seed=seed + 1) # Additional seed for weights
  weighted_sum = tf.matmul(input_tensor, random_weights)
  return weighted_sum


# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
seed = 456
result = complex_tf_function(input_tensor, seed)
print(result)
```

This example showcases incorporating random weight generation within a matrix multiplication.  Observe the use of a different seed (`seed + 1`) for the weights to ensure their randomness is independent from the global seed, allowing for more nuanced control over different random number streams within the same function. This approach becomes crucial in more sophisticated models.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the sections dealing with random number generation and the operational mechanics of the TensorFlow computational graph.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a strong TensorFlow focus would also offer valuable context.  Finally, exploring publicly available TensorFlow codebases for complex models (e.g., those from research papers) could serve as a practical learning aid by examining how experienced practitioners address similar challenges.  Careful study of these resources will allow for a deeper understanding of the nuances involved in managing randomness effectively within the TensorFlow framework.
