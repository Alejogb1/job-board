Scaling vectors within a TensorFlow custom loss function or layer by group requires careful consideration of computational efficiency and numerical stability.  My experience developing high-throughput machine learning models for image recognition highlighted the importance of leveraging TensorFlow's optimized operations for vectorized computations when dealing with grouped scaling.  Directly manipulating individual vector elements within a loop is computationally expensive and scales poorly.  Instead, leveraging TensorFlow's broadcasting capabilities and masking operations provides significant performance gains.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in applying a different scaling factor to different subsets (groups) of vectors within a larger tensor. We assume our input tensor represents a batch of vectors, where each vector belongs to a specific group.  This group membership can be encoded using several methods: a separate tensor indicating group indices, one-hot encoding of group labels, or even implicitly through the tensor's structure (e.g., separate sub-tensors for each group).  The scaling factors themselves can be pre-computed or dynamically determined within the loss function, potentially based on group-specific statistics derived from the input data.

The efficient approach involves generating a scaling factor tensor with dimensions matching the input vectors' shape, where each element corresponds to the appropriate scaling factor for that specific vector element.  This is achieved by effectively "broadcasting" the group-specific scaling factors to match the shape of the input vectors.  TensorFlow's broadcasting rules automatically handle this expansion, ensuring efficient computation on the GPU.  Masking, if necessary, allows us to selectively apply scaling only to specific elements within each vector based on additional criteria.

Finally, element-wise multiplication between the input tensor and the scaling factor tensor achieves the desired scaling effect within TensorFlow's optimized computational graph.  The resulting scaled tensor is then used in the subsequent computations within the custom loss function or layer.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Scaling using Group Indices:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def grouped_scale_loss(y_true, y_pred, group_indices, group_scales):
    """Scales y_pred by group before calculating MSE loss.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor. Shape (batch_size, vector_dim).
        y_pred: Predicted tensor. Shape (batch_size, vector_dim).
        group_indices: Tensor of group indices. Shape (batch_size,).
        group_scales: Tensor of scaling factors for each group. Shape (num_groups,).

    Returns:
        Mean Squared Error loss for scaled predictions.
    """
    num_groups = tf.shape(group_scales)[0]
    scale_matrix = tf.gather(group_scales, group_indices) # Gather scales for each vector
    scale_matrix = tf.reshape(scale_matrix, (-1, 1)) # Reshape for broadcasting
    scaled_predictions = y_pred * scale_matrix # Element-wise multiplication
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - scaled_predictions))
    return loss

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.1, 1.9], [3.2, 3.8], [5.3, 5.7]])
group_indices = tf.constant([0, 1, 0])
group_scales = tf.constant([0.9, 1.1])

loss = grouped_scale_loss(y_true, y_pred, group_indices, group_scales)
print(loss)
```

This example uses `tf.gather` to efficiently select the correct scaling factor for each vector based on its group index.  The reshaping ensures correct broadcasting during element-wise multiplication.


**Example 2: Scaling using One-Hot Encoding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def grouped_scale_loss_onehot(y_true, y_pred, group_onehot, group_scales):
    """Scales y_pred by group using one-hot encoding before calculating MSE loss.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor. Shape (batch_size, vector_dim).
        y_pred: Predicted tensor. Shape (batch_size, vector_dim).
        group_onehot: One-hot encoded group labels. Shape (batch_size, num_groups).
        group_scales: Tensor of scaling factors for each group. Shape (num_groups,).

    Returns:
        Mean Squared Error loss for scaled predictions.
    """
    scale_matrix = tf.matmul(group_onehot, tf.expand_dims(group_scales, 1))
    scaled_predictions = y_pred * scale_matrix
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - scaled_predictions))
    return loss

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.1, 1.9], [3.2, 3.8], [5.3, 5.7]])
group_onehot = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0]])
group_scales = tf.constant([0.9, 1.1])

loss = grouped_scale_loss_onehot(y_true, y_pred, group_onehot, group_scales)
print(loss)

```
This example uses one-hot encoding and matrix multiplication to achieve the scaling.  `tf.expand_dims` is crucial for ensuring correct matrix dimensions during multiplication.

**Example 3:  Dynamic Scaling based on Group Statistics:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def grouped_scale_loss_dynamic(y_true, y_pred, group_indices):
    """Dynamically scales y_pred based on group mean of y_true before calculating MSE loss.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor. Shape (batch_size, vector_dim).
        y_pred: Predicted tensor. Shape (batch_size, vector_dim).
        group_indices: Tensor of group indices. Shape (batch_size,).

    Returns:
        Mean Squared Error loss for scaled predictions.
    """
    num_groups = tf.reduce_max(group_indices) + 1
    group_means = tf.math.segment_mean(y_true, group_indices)
    group_scales = 1.0 / group_means # Inverse of the mean as a scaling factor.  Handle potential division by zero.
    scale_matrix = tf.gather(group_scales, group_indices)
    scale_matrix = tf.reshape(scale_matrix, (-1, tf.shape(y_pred)[1]))
    scaled_predictions = y_pred * scale_matrix
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - scaled_predictions))
    return loss

# Example usage:  (requires careful handling of potential division by zero in real-world scenarios)
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [1.0, 2.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.1, 1.9], [3.2, 3.8], [1.2, 1.8]])
group_indices = tf.constant([0, 1, 0])

loss = grouped_scale_loss_dynamic(y_true, y_pred, group_indices)
print(loss)
```

This example demonstrates dynamic scaling factor computation based on group statistics (group means in this case).  `tf.math.segment_mean` efficiently calculates the mean for each group.  Note:  Robust error handling is crucial for scenarios where group means might be zero or very close to zero, potentially leading to numerical instability.  A safeguard (e.g., adding a small epsilon) should be implemented in a production environment.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on tensor manipulation, broadcasting, and custom loss functions, provides comprehensive guidance.  Furthermore, texts covering advanced topics in TensorFlow and numerical computation offer valuable insights into optimization strategies and handling numerical instability.  A strong understanding of linear algebra and matrix operations is also beneficial.
