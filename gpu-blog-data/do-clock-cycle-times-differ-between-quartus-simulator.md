Clock cycle times will demonstrably differ between Quartus Prime simulator and actual FPGA implementation, a discrepancy stemming from the fundamental differences in their operational environments.  My experience designing high-speed data acquisition systems for aerospace applications has consistently highlighted this crucial distinction.  Simulators operate within the context of a software environment, possessing significantly higher precision and deterministic timing compared to the inherently variable nature of physical hardware.  This discrepancy is not merely a minor imperfection but a critical consideration for any design targeting real-time constraints.

The primary reason for this divergence lies in the abstraction levels involved.  Quartus Prime simulator models the design at a Register-Transfer Level (RTL), employing idealized components with precisely defined delays.  These delays, while attempting to reflect real-world behavior, are simplifications and do not account for the complexities introduced by the physical FPGA fabric.  Factors such as routing delays, clock skew, and variations in gate propagation times due to temperature and voltage fluctuations are inherently absent from simulation.  Furthermore, the simulator operates under ideal conditions, free from the noise and interference that plague actual hardware.

Consequently, while a simulator can provide valuable insight into design functionality and potentially identify logical errors, it serves as an imperfect predictor of timing behavior in a deployed FPGA.  Over-reliance on simulated clock cycle times can lead to designs that fail to meet timing requirements once deployed. This is particularly critical in high-frequency applications where even minor timing discrepancies can lead to data corruption or system instability.  In my experience, designs successfully simulated at 100MHz often required adjustments to operate reliably at 80MHz on the target FPGA.


**Explanation:**

The difference in clock cycle times manifests primarily as a longer cycle time in the FPGA compared to the simulation.  The simulator assumes idealized propagation delays through logic elements, ignoring physical constraints like routing lengths and signal integrity issues. In contrast, the FPGA's physical implementation introduces considerable parasitic capacitance and inductance in the routing, directly impacting signal propagation delay.  Furthermore, the clock signal itself experiences skew, meaning different parts of the circuit receive the clock edge at slightly different times.  This skew further contributes to the increase in the effective clock cycle time.  Additionally, variations in manufacturing processes can lead to slight variations in the gate propagation delays within individual logic elements across different FPGAs.  Temperature changes also affect the propagation delays within the FPGA.  These factors are difficult, if not impossible, to precisely model in simulation.

In summary, the discrepancy arises from:

* **Idealized vs. Physical Delays:** Simulators use simplified models, ignoring parasitic elements.
* **Clock Skew:** The clock signal arrives at different parts of the FPGA at slightly different times.
* **Process Variations and Temperature Effects:** Manufacturing tolerances and temperature-dependent behavior introduces variability in gate delays.
* **Routing Delays:** The physical routing of signals introduces significant delays not present in the simulation.


**Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how variations in delay specifications might influence the simulated and implemented clock cycle times.  Note these are simplified illustrations, focusing on the core concept; real-world designs would be considerably more complex.

**Example 1: Simple Counter**

```verilog
module simple_counter (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  output reg [7:0] count
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst)
      count <= 8'b0;
    else
      count <= count + 1'b1;
  end

endmodule
```

In simulation, the `count` register updates precisely on each clock edge. However, on the FPGA, the combinatorial logic before the register's input will introduce delays, possibly extending the effective clock cycle time required for the update to complete. This might manifest as metastability concerns if the clock period is too aggressive.


**Example 2: Pipelined Adder**

```verilog
module pipelined_adder (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output reg [7:0] sum
);

  reg [7:0] sum_reg;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst)
      sum_reg <= 8'b0;
    else
      sum_reg <= a + b;
  end

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst)
      sum <= 8'b0;
    else
      sum <= sum_reg;
  end

endmodule
```

Here, pipelining mitigates the impact of propagation delays to some degree.  The simulation will still show a precise clock cycle time. However, the FPGA implementation will likely see a longer clock cycle time due to the cumulative effect of delays in both pipeline stages. This emphasizes the importance of timing closure analysis in the FPGA design flow.


**Example 3:  Asynchronous FIFO**

```verilog
//Simplified Asynchronous FIFO (Illustrative Only - Real Designs are significantly more complex)
module async_fifo #(parameter DATA_WIDTH=8, DEPTH=4) (
  input clk_a,
  input rst_a,
  input wr_en_a,
  input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_in_a,
  output reg wr_full_a,
  input clk_b,
  input rst_b,
  output reg rd_en_b,
  output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_out_b,
  output reg rd_empty_b
);

  //Implementation details omitted for brevity...
endmodule
```

Asynchronous FIFOs are particularly sensitive to clock domain crossing issues.  Simulation can predict the functional behavior, but the actual implementation faces challenges related to metastability and timing closure, potentially resulting in significantly different timing characteristics. This highlights that simulations need to include models to accurately simulate real-world problems and variations.



**Resource Recommendations:**

*  Altera's (now Intel) Quartus Prime documentation.
*  Xilinx Vivado documentation.
*  A comprehensive digital design textbook covering FPGA architecture and timing analysis.
*  Advanced topics in timing analysis and clock domain crossing.

Through extensive experience, I've found that a rigorous approach involving careful timing analysis using tools provided by the FPGA vendor and a methodical iterative design process is crucial for bridging the gap between simulated and implemented clock cycle times. Neglecting this can result in costly design revisions and project delays.  Accurate timing prediction and closure are paramount for successful FPGA implementation.
