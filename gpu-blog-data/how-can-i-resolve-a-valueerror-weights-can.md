The `ValueError: weights can not be broadcast to values` encountered when using a custom loss function with a sequence model typically stems from a mismatch in the shape and broadcasting capabilities between the provided sample weights and the predicted values within the loss function.  This often arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of how NumPy's broadcasting rules interact with the shape expectations of your custom loss function and the output of your sequence model.  My experience debugging similar issues across various recurrent and transformer architectures highlights the crucial role of careful shape management.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The error message directly indicates a problem with the dimensions of your `weights` array and the predictions generated by your model.  NumPy's broadcasting mechanism attempts to align arrays of different shapes for element-wise operations.  However, if the shapes are incompatible and cannot be aligned through broadcasting, this error is raised.  In the context of a sequence model and a custom loss function, this usually means one of the following:

* **Inconsistent Batch Size:** Your sample weights might have a batch size different from the batch size of your model's predictions.  This is a common pitfall, especially when dealing with variable-length sequences where batching can introduce inconsistencies.  Ensure your weighting scheme consistently applies to every sequence within a batch.

* **Incorrect Weight Dimensions:**  The shape of your weight array might not align with the shape of the predictions.  If your model outputs a sequence of predictions (e.g., a time series prediction or a sequence tagging task), the weights must reflect this dimensionality.  Simple scalar weights are inappropriate in this context.

* **Mismatched Prediction Shape:** The structure of your modelâ€™s output might not match the structure expected by your loss function. For instance, a model might output a three-dimensional tensor (batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes), while your loss function might assume a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, sequence_length) in case of a single-label prediction at each time step.

* **Implicit Reshaping:** Be cautious of implicit reshaping within your loss function.  NumPy's broadcasting can sometimes silently reshape arrays, leading to subtle errors that manifest as this specific `ValueError`. Explicitly reshape your arrays to ensure consistent dimensions before performing element-wise operations within your loss function.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Weighting for Variable-Length Sequences**

This example demonstrates handling variable-length sequences using masking.  It addresses the scenario where sequences have different lengths within a batch.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight):
    # Mask out padding tokens
    mask = tf.cast(tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(y_true), axis=-1) > 0, tf.float32)
    masked_loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred) * mask

    # Apply sample weights
    weighted_loss = masked_loss * sample_weight

    return tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss)


# Example usage:
y_true = np.array([[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]])  # Variable length sequences
y_pred = np.array([[[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9, 0.0]], [[0.9, 0.1, 0.0], [0.2, 0.2, 0.6]]])
sample_weight = np.array([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.5]]) #weights reflecting sequence importance

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,3))]) #dummy model

loss_value = custom_loss(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight)
print(loss_value)

```

This code explicitly uses a mask to handle variable-length sequences and applies sample weights after masking.  The `sample_weight` array has the same shape as the batch dimension of `y_true` and `y_pred`, ensuring compatibility.


**Example 2:  Multi-Class Classification with Weighted Loss**

This example shows how to handle multi-class sequence classification with instance-specific weights.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights):
    # Check shapes for compatibility
    if weights.shape != y_true.shape[:-1]:
        raise ValueError("Weights shape mismatch")

    y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32) #ensure datatype consistency

    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    weighted_loss = loss * weights
    return tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss)

# Example usage:
y_true = np.array([[[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]])
y_pred = np.array([[[0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]], [[0.2, 0.1, 0.7], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1]]])
weights = np.array([[0.8, 1.2], [1.0, 0.7]])


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,3))]) #dummy model

loss_value = weighted_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights)
print(loss_value)
```

This illustrates the importance of shape consistency. The weights array must align with the batch and sequence dimensions of the predictions.  The error checking within the loss function provides robustness.


**Example 3: Explicit Reshaping for Clarity**

This example emphasizes the importance of explicit reshaping to avoid broadcasting ambiguities.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def my_custom_loss(y_true, y_pred, weights):
    # Explicitly reshape to ensure compatibility
    weights = np.reshape(weights, y_pred.shape)
    loss = np.abs(y_true - y_pred) * weights
    return np.mean(loss)

#Example Usage
y_true = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
y_pred = np.array([[1.1, 1.9, 3.2], [3.8, 5.3, 6.1]])
weights = np.array([0.5, 1.0])

loss_value = my_custom_loss(y_true, y_pred, weights)
print(loss_value)

```

This example avoids implicit broadcasting, resolving potential ambiguity by explicitly reshaping the weights array to match the predictions' shape before the element-wise multiplication.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's broadcasting rules, consult the NumPy documentation. The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on custom loss functions and working with sequence models.  A solid grasp of linear algebra and tensor manipulation is essential for effectively debugging these types of errors.  Reviewing tutorials and examples on implementing custom loss functions in Keras will provide practical guidance.  Finally, studying best practices for working with variable-length sequences in deep learning frameworks is crucial for preventing similar issues in future projects.
