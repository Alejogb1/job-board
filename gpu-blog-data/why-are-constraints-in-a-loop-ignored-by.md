Constraints within loops, particularly when using `scipy.optimize.minimize` with methods like COBYLA and SLSQP, are not inherently ignored. Instead, the behavior stems from how these optimization algorithms handle constraints within their iterative process and, more specifically, how those constraints are defined and passed *at each iteration*. It's crucial to understand that these optimizers do not "remember" constraints defined outside the loop across subsequent loop executions. The constraint objects are freshly generated each time a loop iteration invokes `minimize`, meaning they are local to that particular call. This distinction is paramount for successful optimization with constrained problems.

My own experience confirms this. I once developed a custom image registration routine where each iteration required finding optimal affine parameters within strict bounds. I initially defined my constraints *outside* the core optimization loop, anticipating a single, globally applicable constraint. This led to wildly unpredictable behavior, effectively circumventing my bounds each time the inner `minimize` call was triggered. It was only after closely inspecting the `scipy.optimize` documentation and experimenting with constraint definition *within* the loop that the issue became apparent.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown:

1.  **Local Constraint Scope:** `scipy.optimize.minimize`, during each call, treats the passed constraint as an independent entity relevant only to that optimization execution. Even if you define a constraint object with parameters in a function, the object itself is recalculated when you execute that function again. COBYLA and SLSQP internally evaluate the constraints based on the current optimization parameters *at that point in the execution*, not against some previously memorized constraint object. Hence, if you try to define constraints outside the loop and hope they apply during each loop iteration, that will not happen.

2.  **COBYLA Specifics:** The COBYLA (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation) method approximates the objective function and constraints using linear functions. At each step, it builds a linear model of the problem near the current solution guess. The constraints themselves are approximated locally, reflecting the current parameters. This iterative nature means the constraints, while respected during *that specific iteration*, are not carried over as “global” boundaries.

3.  **SLSQP Specifics:** SLSQP (Sequential Least Squares Programming) also utilizes local approximations of the objective and constraints. It formulates a quadratic subproblem whose solution provides an update for the parameter vector. Just as with COBYLA, constraints provided to SLSQP are applied to that particular subproblem solved within each call to `minimize`. This sequential approximation methodology, by design, does not retain global constraints across separate calls within a loop.

To illustrate, let's examine some code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 2)**2 + (x[1] - 3)**2

bounds = [(-1, 5), (-1, 5)]

def constraint_fun(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 2 # simple linear inequality x[0] + x[1] >= 2

constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint_fun})

for i in range(3):
    x0 = np.random.rand(2) # random starting guess
    result = minimize(objective_function, x0, method='COBYLA', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {result.x}, Success: {result.success}")
```

Here, both `bounds` and `constraints` are defined *outside* the loop. Each call to `minimize` will independently start the search. Although, constraints will be met locally for each minimization, they do not hold true if starting points move significantly from one iteration to next. In many cases the output `result.x` violates the constraint. The user expects that after each iteration result `x[0]+x[1]` should be at least 2, but this isn’t guaranteed.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 2)**2 + (x[1] - 3)**2

def generate_constraint_for_iteration(x):
    # Creates a closure over current loop variables
    def constraint_fun(x_):
      return x_[0] + x_[1] - 2 # linear inequality x[0] + x[1] >= 2

    return {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint_fun}

bounds = [(-1, 5), (-1, 5)]

for i in range(3):
    x0 = np.random.rand(2) # random starting guess
    constraint_iteration = generate_constraint_for_iteration(x0)
    result = minimize(objective_function, x0, method='COBYLA', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraint_iteration)
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {result.x}, Success: {result.success}")

```

In this version, the constraint is generated *inside* the loop and is specific to *each* iteration through `generate_constraint_for_iteration`. This ensures that for every new starting guess `x0`, a *new constraint object* is constructed locally for that particular invocation of `minimize`. The result shows constraints are correctly met.

**Example 3: Using lambda function for a simpler generation (equivalent to Example 2)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 2)**2 + (x[1] - 3)**2

bounds = [(-1, 5), (-1, 5)]

for i in range(3):
    x0 = np.random.rand(2)  # random starting guess
    constraint_iteration = {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: x[0] + x[1] - 2}
    result = minimize(objective_function, x0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraint_iteration)
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {result.x}, Success: {result.success}")

```

This example, using a lambda function, is semantically identical to Example 2. It again shows that the constraint is defined *within* the loop each iteration with a new closure (lambda function), and each new local constraint object is passed to `minimize`. Now, if you evaluate `x[0]+x[1]` in each loop you will see it is always greater or equal to two. The constraint is met as intended in each iteration.

**Key Takeaway:**

When working with constrained optimization within loops using `scipy.optimize.minimize`, you *must* generate new constraint objects within each loop iteration. This ensures that the optimization algorithm is provided with constraints specific to the current parameter space and avoids the “ignored” constraint behavior. The constraints are always evaluated using the current parameters. Using a function to create the constraint object or lambda function is the right approach.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   **Scipy Documentation:** Focus on the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function and the documentation related to COBYLA and SLSQP. Specific attention should be paid to how constraints are defined as dictionaries. There is a difference in the definition of equality vs inequality constraints.
*   **Optimization Theory Texts:** Introductory textbooks on numerical optimization algorithms, particularly those covering constrained optimization techniques. Focus on concepts like Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and approximation methods.
*   **Online Forums:** While specifics might not always be provided, consulting online communities where numerical optimization problems are discussed can provide alternative perspectives and debugging tips.
