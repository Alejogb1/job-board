The root cause of empty outputs from `model.summary()` and `plot_model()` in TensorFlow Keras frequently stems from improper model instantiation or a lack of layer definitions within the model object.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including large-scale image recognition and time-series forecasting models, this oversight is surprisingly common.  The seemingly innocuous nature of model construction often masks subtle errors that render these visualization tools ineffective.  I've encountered this myself while working on a multi-headed attention mechanism for natural language processing, and the resulting debugging process directly informed my understanding of these methods' underlying dependencies.

**1. Explanation:**

`model.summary()` provides a textual representation of the model's architecture, detailing layer types, output shapes, and parameter counts. `plot_model()` generates a visual graph of the model's structure. Both functions rely on the model object possessing a correctly defined architecture, complete with layers interconnected in a coherent manner.  An empty output indicates the functions cannot interpret the model's structure, implying either a missing or improperly configured model architecture, or an issue with the Keras backend.  This often arises from situations such as:

* **Uninitialized Model:** The model object might be created but not populated with any layers. A simple instantiation without subsequent layer addition will result in empty outputs.
* **Incorrect Layer Addition:** Layers may be added incorrectly, leading to an inconsistent or disconnected architecture.  This can be due to typos in layer names, incorrect input/output shape specifications, or improper use of functional API constructs.
* **Backend Issues:** While less frequent, underlying backend incompatibility or configuration issues can interfere with the functionality of `model.summary()` and `plot_model()`. This is especially relevant when working with custom layers or integrating with other libraries.
* **Incorrect Import Statements:** Though less common, ensure that both `tensorflow` and `keras` (if not bundled) and relevant visualization libraries (`keras.utils.plot_model`) are properly imported.

Addressing these points involves careful review of the model creation process, paying close attention to layer definitions and their interconnections.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Uninitialized Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect: Model instantiated but no layers added
model = keras.Sequential()
model.summary() # Produces empty output
keras.utils.plot_model(model, to_file='uninitialized_model.png') # Produces empty file or error
```

This example demonstrates the simplest error: a model object is created, but no layers are added.  `model.summary()` and `plot_model()` will fail because there's no architecture to describe.


**Example 2: Incorrect Layer Addition (Functional API)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.utils.vis_utils import plot_model

# Incorrect: Incorrect input shape in the Dense layer
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)  # Correct
y = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)  #Correct


# Incorrect attempt to create a model from separate layers
# model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x) # Incorrect output definition.
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=y) # Correct output definition.

model.summary() #Now Produces output
plot_model(model, to_file='functional_model.png', show_shapes=True) #Now Produces output

```

This example uses the Keras functional API. The initial attempt uses the intermediate output layer, `x`, creating an invalid model. The second, correct implementation uses the final output `y`. Note that `show_shapes=True` in `plot_model()` can enhance debugging by displaying layer input and output shapes within the diagram.


**Example 3: Custom Layer Issue**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.utils.vis_utils import plot_model


class CustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                               initializer='random_normal',
                               trainable=True)
      super(CustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# Correct implementation of custom layer within a model.
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CustomLayer(units=64),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.summary() #Produces output
plot_model(model, to_file='custom_layer_model.png', show_shapes=True) #Produces output
```

This example showcases the use of a custom layer within a sequential model.  A common mistake with custom layers is improper implementation of the `build` and `call` methods, which are crucial for Keras to understand how the layer functions within the broader network.  Ensuring the correct input and output shapes are defined and handled prevents issues with `model.summary()` and `plot_model()`.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on Keras models and model visualization, is invaluable.  Further, I've found the Keras documentation itself to be particularly useful in understanding layer specifications and the functional API. Consulting relevant chapters in introductory deep learning textbooks covering model building can provide a strong theoretical foundation to support practical troubleshooting.  Finally, searching relevant forums and Q&A sites for specific error messages or unusual behaviors can uncover solutions that address uncommon issues.  Effective debugging often requires a multi-pronged approach, combining thorough code review with targeted external resources.
