`CONTAINSTABLE` in SQL Server, while a powerful tool for full-text searching, does not directly support an `OR` clause in the way one might expect from a standard SQL `WHERE` clause. Instead, it leverages a specific syntax to achieve similar results, focusing on combining different search terms or phrases. The misconception that a typical `OR` is applicable stems from a misunderstanding of how `CONTAINSTABLE` interprets search predicates. My experience managing large-scale databases for a news aggregation platform has repeatedly underscored this nuance.

The core difference lies in the nature of the full-text index. Unlike a standard index that maps to specific values, a full-text index is built around the concept of word tokens and their proximity. Therefore, `CONTAINSTABLE` uses operators specific to its indexing structure to express Boolean relationships between search conditions.  These operators—particularly `NEAR`, `AND`, and implicit `OR` functionality—are critical to mastering effective full-text queries. Directly writing `CONTAINS(column, 'word1' OR 'word2')` will lead to syntax errors, confirming this. The system does not parse such statements as desired. To effect an `OR` operation, you need to understand the underlying mechanics of its interpretation.

The primary method to emulate an `OR` behavior within `CONTAINSTABLE` is by specifying multiple search terms within a single predicate, separated by commas.  SQL Server implicitly treats comma-separated terms as if they are connected with an `OR` operator during the search. This is the foundational aspect of how 'OR' logic is achieved. The `CONTAINSTABLE` function itself returns rows ranked by their relevance to the search terms; this ranking is based on factors like term frequency and proximity. Therefore, results containing multiple terms from the search will generally score higher than those containing only one.

The `NEAR` operator is another critical tool. While it doesn't function like a strict `OR`, it allows searching for terms within a specific proximity of each other. If both `term1` and `term2` are nearby in the document they will both get a higher rank. Using the `NEAR` operator implicitly provides an alternate approach to searching for two terms. It considers the relative location of the words as part of the search criteria rather than pure existence.

My experience migrating our search infrastructure required mastering these nuanced operators to efficiently query large volumes of text data with diverse user searches. A common scenario was searching for articles related to both 'election' and 'voting rights'. Misinterpreting how to combine these terms using implicit `OR` and the `NEAR` operator was a common source of issues early on.

Here are three examples demonstrating how to effectively simulate `OR` behavior:

**Example 1: Implicit `OR` using comma-separated terms.**

```sql
SELECT  KEY,RANK
FROM  CONTAINSTABLE(Articles, Content, 'election, voting')
ORDER BY RANK DESC;
```

**Commentary:**

This query searches the `Content` column of the `Articles` table for rows that contain either the term 'election', the term 'voting', or both. The implicit `OR` functionality is achieved by separating these search terms with a comma. Each matching term will add to the overall score of a matching row. Rows containing both `election` and `voting` are likely to have a higher rank, based on their relevance with regards to the total number of matching terms specified. The returned columns, `KEY` and `RANK` are standard outputs of a `CONTAINSTABLE` query; `KEY` would be the primary key from the base table and `RANK` is the score or relevance of that record. This example forms the core of understanding implicit `OR` logic in CONTAINSTABLE.

**Example 2: Demonstrating the limitations of a naive `OR` syntax.**

```sql
--  Invalid Syntax -- Demonstrates the misunderstanding of OR clause
-- SELECT KEY, RANK
-- FROM CONTAINSTABLE(Articles, Content, 'election' OR 'voting')
-- ORDER BY RANK DESC;

-- Correct Approach using implicit OR
SELECT KEY, RANK
FROM CONTAINSTABLE(Articles, Content, '"election", "voting"')
ORDER BY RANK DESC;

```

**Commentary:**

This highlights the error encountered if using a literal `OR`. The first query, commented out, demonstrates this error using invalid syntax. SQL Server's full-text engine doesn't handle 'OR' in this manner. The corrected version illustrates the appropriate syntax utilizing comma separated values to simulate the 'OR'. The explicit quoting is not always required but demonstrates a more accurate syntax. This example underscores the critical difference between expected SQL syntax and the required syntax for full-text searching.

**Example 3: Combining Implicit `OR` with the `NEAR` operator.**

```sql
SELECT KEY, RANK
FROM CONTAINSTABLE(Articles, Content, 'NEAR((“election”, “voting”),5)' )
ORDER BY RANK DESC;
```

**Commentary:**

This more complex query uses both the implicit `OR` (represented by the comma between 'election' and 'voting' within the `NEAR` operator) and the `NEAR` operator to find articles where the words "election" and "voting" occur within 5 terms of each other. This approach will return documents that include both terms within the proximity range. While the `NEAR` operator adds proximity and ranking components, it indirectly acts as an `OR` modifier. The `NEAR` operator can help to further refine the results. The returned rows would have a higher rank if they have a stronger proximity score, and a stronger `OR` match. This example illustrates a more advanced method to combine proximity and the implicit `OR` behavior.

These examples demonstrate the core logic of utilizing `CONTAINSTABLE` to emulate `OR` behavior through comma-separated terms and in conjunction with the `NEAR` operator, the latter further refining the search by emphasizing the relative location of words.

For more extensive research and development, I would recommend exploring the official SQL Server documentation on full-text search; it contains detailed explanations and comprehensive examples. Books focused on SQL Server performance tuning also often have chapters specifically dedicated to full-text search and its optimization techniques. In addition, research material concerning Information Retrieval (IR) systems can provide valuable context and theoretical grounding for understanding the design considerations of tools like `CONTAINSTABLE`. The key to mastery lies in practicing the different search constructs and observing how changes in predicates affect the result sets. Experimentation with different operators such as `FORMSOF` and `FREETEXT` can also broaden your understanding of full-text indexing. Finally, delving into the internal workings of SQL Server's query optimizer, while complex, can be highly beneficial to understanding the performance characteristics of these types of queries.
