The core issue often lies in the output layer activation function and the loss function employed in your neural network architecture.  Inconsistencies between these two critical components lead to regression behavior even when the intent is classification.  In my experience troubleshooting similar problems across diverse projects—ranging from sentiment analysis to medical image diagnosis—this has been the most prevalent root cause.  Let's examine this in detail.

**1.  Understanding the Discrepancy:**

A classification task aims to assign an input to one of several predefined discrete categories.  The output, therefore, should represent a probability distribution over these classes, with the highest probability indicating the predicted class. Regression, conversely, predicts a continuous value.  The crucial distinction rests in the nature of the output: discrete (classification) versus continuous (regression).

If your network is performing regression despite your classification intentions, the output layer is likely generating continuous values rather than probability distributions. This usually stems from the selection of an inappropriate activation function, combined with a loss function designed for regression.

**2.  Output Layer Activation Functions:**

The activation function applied to the output layer significantly influences the interpretation of the network's output.  For classification problems, activation functions that ensure the output is a valid probability distribution are necessary.  Common choices include:

* **Softmax:** This function takes a vector of arbitrary real numbers and transforms it into a probability distribution.  Each output neuron represents a class, and the softmax function ensures that the sum of outputs across all neurons equals 1, representing a normalized probability distribution.  This is particularly well-suited for multi-class classification problems.

* **Sigmoid:** Used primarily for binary classification problems, the sigmoid function outputs a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the input belonging to the positive class.  The complement (1 - output) represents the probability of belonging to the negative class.

Using a linear activation function or ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) at the output layer, which outputs unbounded values, directly contradicts the probabilistic nature of classification.  The network will then inadvertently produce continuous values, leading to regression behavior.

**3.  Loss Functions:**

The loss function guides the training process by quantifying the discrepancy between the network's predictions and the true labels.  In classification, loss functions that penalize deviations from the true probability distribution are crucial.  These include:

* **Categorical Cross-Entropy:** Typically used for multi-class classification, it measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the one-hot encoded true labels.

* **Binary Cross-Entropy:**  Used for binary classification, it measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability and the binary true label (0 or 1).

Employing loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which are designed for regression problems, will inherently guide the network towards producing continuous values, even if the output layer uses a softmax or sigmoid activation.  This reinforces the regression behavior.

**4. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these concepts with three Python code examples using TensorFlow/Keras:

**Example 1: Incorrect Configuration (Regression Behavior)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear') # Incorrect: Linear activation for classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # Incorrect: MSE loss for classification

# ... training code ...
```

This example demonstrates an incorrect configuration.  The linear activation in the output layer and the MSE loss function will result in regression behavior, even if the intended task is classification.

**Example 2: Correct Configuration (Binary Classification)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Correct: Sigmoid for binary classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy') # Correct: Binary cross-entropy loss

# ... training code ...
```

Here, the sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss are correctly applied for binary classification, ensuring the network outputs probabilities.

**Example 3: Correct Configuration (Multi-class Classification)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Correct: Softmax for multi-class classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy') # Correct: Categorical cross-entropy loss

# ... training code ...
```

This example demonstrates the correct setup for multi-class classification with three classes. The softmax activation generates a probability distribution, and categorical cross-entropy guides the training towards accurate probability estimations.


**5. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing comprehensive textbooks on neural networks and deep learning.  Focus on chapters covering activation functions, loss functions, and the fundamental differences between regression and classification tasks.  Further, explore the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for detailed explanations of available activation functions and loss functions.  Pay close attention to the practical examples provided within the documentation.  A thorough understanding of these fundamental concepts is crucial for successful model building.  Finally, consider working through several end-to-end classification tutorials to solidify your grasp of the practical aspects of building and training classification networks.
