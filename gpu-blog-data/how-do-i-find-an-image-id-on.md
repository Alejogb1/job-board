Determining a Docker image's ID solely from its tag via the Docker CLI directly is not possible.  The Docker CLI's `docker images` command displays tags, but the underlying image ID is an internal representation managed by the Docker daemon.  It's crucial to understand this distinction.  The tag is a human-readable identifier, whereas the ID is a unique, immutable hash representing the image's content.  Therefore, retrieving the ID necessitates an indirect approach leveraging the Docker Hub API or relying on intermediate steps.  I've spent considerable time working with Docker registries, including extensive use of the Docker Hub API, and based on this experience, I will outline several methods.


**1. Using the Docker CLI and `docker inspect` (Indirect Approach):**

This approach involves first pulling the image and then inspecting its details to extract the ID.  This method relies on having the image locally.  If the image is substantial, this approach can be inefficient in terms of bandwidth and time.  However, it's straightforward and avoids external API calls.

```bash
# Pull the image from Docker Hub.  Replace <your_username>/<your_image>:<tag> with your specific details.  Error handling is omitted for brevity.
docker pull <your_username>/<your_image>:<tag>

# Inspect the image to retrieve its ID.
docker inspect <your_username>/<your_image>:<tag> | grep -oP '"Id": "\K[^"]*'

#This command uses grep to extract the ID value. The -oP option ensures that only the matched part is printed. "\K" is a PCRE feature to match the pattern but not include it in the output.  Alternative parsing methods exist depending on your preferred toolset.
```

The `docker inspect` command provides comprehensive image metadata.  The `grep` command is used to filter this output, focusing solely on the ID field. The output will be the image ID.  Note that replacing `<your_username>/<your_image>:<tag>` with the actual details from Docker Hub is mandatory. This is not a direct retrieval from the registry; instead, it leverages a local copy to infer the ID.


**2. Leveraging the Docker Hub API (Direct Approach):**

Accessing Docker Hub's API offers a direct route to acquiring information without needing a local image pull. This avoids the bandwidth and time overhead mentioned previously.   However, this necessitates familiarity with API interactions and potentially handling authentication tokens. I've encountered scenarios where rate limits became a significant issue, necessitating careful design and implementation of API calls. This method is preferable for automated processes or when dealing with numerous images.

```python
import requests
import json

# Replace with your actual repository and tag information.  Ensure to handle API rate limits and potential errors appropriately.
repository = "<your_username>/<your_image>"
tag = "<tag>"

# Construct the API URL. This URL assumes you have not set any specific API version.  Adjust the version if needed based on the documentation.
url = f"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/{repository}/tags/{tag}"

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = json.loads(response.text)
    image_id = data["images"][0]["id"] # Assuming a single image per tag.  Appropriate error handling is crucial for multiple images
    print(f"Image ID: {image_id}")
else:
    print(f"Error fetching image data: {response.status_code}")

```

This Python script demonstrates the process.  It constructs the API URL, retrieves the JSON response, and extracts the `id` field from the `images` array (assuming only a single image exists for the specified tag).  Crucially, appropriate error handling (missing or multiple images, API errors, rate limiting) should be incorporated into a production-ready script.  This is a far more robust solution than purely CLI-based commands because it interacts directly with the source of truth.


**3.  Combining `docker search` and `docker inspect` (Compromise Approach):**

This is a middle ground, aiming to identify a candidate image without pulling everything locally. Using the `docker search` command can potentially list images, and then further inspecting them can lead to the ID. This however doesn't guarantee finding the exact image across many results, and requires manual intervention. Therefore its reliability is limited.  I've used this approach in situations where local storage was severely constrained, but would not recommend it for any automated workflow.

```bash
# Search for the image on Docker Hub. Note the ambiguity here: there might be many matches.
docker search <your_image>:<tag>

# Manually identify the correct image from the search results based on the description. Assume the name is `<your_username>/<your_image>:<tag>`.
docker inspect <your_username>/<your_image>:<tag> | grep -oP '"Id": "\K[^"]*'
```

This approach combines searching for the image (which can be inaccurate) and inspecting the (potentially wrongly identified) image.  The ambiguity inherent in relying on search results makes this method less reliable. The `docker search` command provides no guarantee of accuracy; several images with similar names might be returned. Consequently, careful manual review is necessary.  The ID retrieval after the manual search remains the same as in the first method.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* The official Docker documentation.
* The Docker Hub API documentation.
* A comprehensive guide to using the `curl` command (for alternative API interaction).
* Relevant sections on command-line tools and regular expressions in general programming documentation.  These resources will facilitate more sophisticated parsing of the output from `docker inspect`.


In summary, directly obtaining an image ID from only the tag using solely the Docker CLI is not feasible.  The provided methods offer different approaches, each with advantages and disadvantages concerning efficiency, reliability, and complexity.  Selecting the most appropriate method depends on the specific context, resource availability, and the need for automation.  Remember to always handle errors and edge cases in production environments.
