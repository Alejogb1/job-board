The interaction between `grad.zero_()` and gradient tracking in PyTorch is not a matter of "should" but rather a fundamental aspect of how backpropagation operates. Specifically, `grad.zero_()` *must* be used when gradients are being tracked, otherwise, accumulation, not resetting, of gradients will occur during iterative optimization. I’ve repeatedly witnessed this issue leading to incorrect parameter updates and convergence problems in my past projects involving complex deep learning architectures.

To elaborate, let’s understand PyTorch's approach to gradient calculation. Gradients, the derivatives of a loss function with respect to the model's parameters, are computed during the backward pass of backpropagation, using the chain rule. In PyTorch, these gradients are not overwritten on each iteration of training. Instead, they are *accumulated* into the `.grad` attribute of each parameter tensor involved in the computation. This behavior is particularly useful in techniques like gradient accumulation for simulating larger batch sizes. If the `.grad` tensors are not explicitly reset before the backward pass of each training step, the subsequent calculation will add new gradients onto existing gradients, producing a sum of gradients from different iterations.

Consequently, when gradient tracking is enabled (i.e., tensors are created with `requires_grad=True` and computations are done within the computational graph), we must use `grad.zero_()` on the optimizer's parameter tensors or on the individual `.grad` tensor themselves, prior to initiating the backward pass. Failure to do so results in cumulative, erroneous gradients, which ultimately prevent learning.

Let me illustrate with three code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Accumulation**

This first snippet exemplifies the detrimental effect of not calling `grad.zero_()`. I encountered this exact scenario when developing a custom RNN for sentiment analysis.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Dummy input and target tensors
inputs = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 2)

# Simulate multiple iterations without zeroing gradients
for i in range(3):
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, target)
    loss.backward() # Calculate gradients for all parameters
    optimizer.step() # Apply gradients to update model parameters

    # Note: No optimizer.zero_grad() or parameter.grad.zero_() call
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: bias gradient = {model.bias.grad}")
```

In this example, the gradients of the model’s bias parameter increase with each iteration. The values are continuously appended instead of starting from zero each time. This is not how a proper training loop functions, and will lead to incorrect weight updates. This behavior can be corrected with a `grad.zero_()` call, which is demonstrated in the next example.

**Example 2: Correct Gradient Resetting**

This snippet demonstrates the proper procedure, employing `optimizer.zero_grad()` to reset gradients at the start of each loop. In previous projects, my team and I found this the most common approach, especially when using standard optimizers provided by PyTorch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Dummy input and target tensors
inputs = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 2)

# Simulate multiple iterations with zeroing gradients
for i in range(3):
    optimizer.zero_grad() # Reset all parameter gradients within this optimizer instance
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: bias gradient = {model.bias.grad}")
```

In this second example, the gradients are reset to zero at the beginning of each iteration using `optimizer.zero_grad()`. This function, specifically, iterates through the parameters of the model registered with the optimizer, calling `.grad.zero_()` on each of them. As such, each backward pass is calculating the gradient *from scratch* based on the current forward pass, which is the desired behavior.

**Example 3:  Manual `.grad.zero_()` Resetting**

This last snippet showcases how to use `.grad.zero_()` directly on individual parameter tensors. This is a less common practice but can prove useful in situations requiring more fine-grained control over gradient updates, such as custom training loops or when dealing with individual parameters during debugging.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Dummy input and target tensors
inputs = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 2)

# Simulate multiple iterations with manual zeroing
for i in range(3):
    # Manual gradient reset.
    for param in model.parameters():
        if param.grad is not None: # Only zero if grads exist.
            param.grad.zero_()

    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: bias gradient = {model.bias.grad}")
```

In this third instance, we directly iterate through the model parameters and manually reset `.grad` tensor using its own `.zero_()` method. This mirrors what the optimizer's `zero_grad` call is doing behind the scenes. This method allows finer control. The `if param.grad is not None:` check ensures that gradients are only reset if they have been previously calculated by a backward pass. This robustness can be useful, especially during early iterations of training.

In conclusion, the correct behavior requires using `grad.zero_()` (either through `optimizer.zero_grad()` or directly on `.grad` tensors) *every time* before calling `.backward()` when training models with gradient tracking enabled. Omitting this crucial step leads to incorrect gradient accumulation, ultimately hindering or preventing proper learning and model convergence.

For further understanding, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation concerning `torch.optim`, specifically the explanation of the optimizers' `zero_grad()` method. Additionally, the tutorials on implementing custom training loops can provide practical exposure to the manual use of `.grad.zero_()`. Furthermore, resources discussing the backpropagation algorithm and computational graphs will give a deeper understanding of why gradients accumulate. Reading through the source code of the optimizers can be invaluable, demonstrating precisely how parameter gradients are handled at each iteration.
