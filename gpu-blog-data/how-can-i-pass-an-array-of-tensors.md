The core challenge in passing an array of tensors to a PyTorch criterion lies in understanding that most PyTorch loss functions expect input tensors in a specific format.  They generally aren't designed to directly handle a Python list or NumPy array of tensors.  This is because the underlying computational graph optimization relies on contiguous memory allocation and efficient tensor operations; a heterogeneous Python list doesn't offer this.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training pipelines has repeatedly highlighted this limitation.  The solution requires restructuring the input data into a single, appropriately shaped tensor before passing it to the criterion.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch criteria, such as `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `nn.MSELoss`, and others, primarily accept two arguments: the predicted output and the target output.  When dealing with batches of data, these outputs are typically represented as tensors of shape `(batch_size, *)`, where `*` denotes any number of additional dimensions depending on the task (e.g., number of classes in classification, number of output features in regression).  If you have an array of tensors representing predictions or targets for multiple independent samples, you need to concatenate them along the batch dimension to form a single tensor before feeding it to the loss function.  This concatenation must respect the data type and the dimensionality of the individual tensors to avoid errors.  Failure to do so will result in shape mismatches and ultimately incorrect loss calculations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Concatenating Tensors for Multi-class Classification**

This example demonstrates how to handle an array of predicted probabilities and corresponding target labels for a multi-class classification problem.  I encountered this situation while working on a project involving sentiment analysis of multiple short text snippets.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume predicted probabilities for 3 samples, each with 5 classes
predictions = [torch.randn(5), torch.randn(5), torch.randn(5)]

# Assume corresponding target labels (one-hot encoded for simplicity)
targets = [torch.tensor([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]), 
           torch.tensor([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]),
           torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 0, 1])]


# Convert lists to tensors, ensuring consistent data type
predictions_tensor = torch.stack(predictions) #stacks along dim 0 (batch dimension)
targets_tensor = torch.stack(targets)


# Define and apply the criterion
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = criterion(predictions_tensor, torch.argmax(targets_tensor, dim=1)) #argmax converts to class labels

print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

The `torch.stack` function is crucial here. It creates a new tensor by stacking the input tensors along a new dimension (dimension 0 in this case, which becomes the batch dimension).  The `torch.argmax` function converts the one-hot encoded targets into class labels, which are required by `CrossEntropyLoss`.  This approach ensures that the criterion receives the data in the expected format.  Failure to stack correctly would result in a shape mismatch error.


**Example 2: Handling Regression with Variable-Length Output Tensors**

In regression tasks, the output tensors might have varying lengths. This often occurs when dealing with sequences of different lengths. During my research on time-series forecasting, this was a persistent challenge.  This example demonstrates how to handle this scenario using padding and masking.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Predicted values for 3 samples with different sequence lengths
predictions = [torch.randn(4), torch.randn(6), torch.randn(5)]

# Corresponding target values
targets = [torch.randn(4), torch.randn(6), torch.randn(5)]

# Find the maximum sequence length
max_len = max(len(p) for p in predictions)

# Pad the tensors to the maximum length
padded_predictions = [torch.nn.functional.pad(p, (0, max_len - len(p))) for p in predictions]
padded_targets = [torch.nn.functional.pad(t, (0, max_len - len(t))) for t in targets]

# Stack the padded tensors
padded_predictions_tensor = torch.stack(padded_predictions)
padded_targets_tensor = torch.stack(padded_targets)


# Define and apply the criterion (with masking for padded values)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
mask = (padded_targets_tensor != 0).float() #create mask based on padded zeros. Could use another value if needed.
loss = criterion(padded_predictions_tensor * mask, padded_targets_tensor * mask) #apply mask to ignore padded values.


print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

Here, padding is used to make all the tensors the same length.  This is essential for `torch.stack` to work correctly.  Crucially, a mask is applied to avoid including padded values (here represented by 0) in the loss calculation.  Without this masking, the padded values would artificially inflate the loss.


**Example 3:  Handling a List of Dictionaries containing Tensors**

Sometimes, the data might be structured as a list of dictionaries, each containing tensors for predictions and targets, often encountered in multi-task learning scenarios. During my work on a multi-modal learning project, I encountered this type of data structure regularly.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example data: list of dictionaries, each with prediction and target tensors
data = [
    {'prediction': torch.randn(2), 'target': torch.randn(2)},
    {'prediction': torch.randn(2), 'target': torch.randn(2)},
    {'prediction': torch.randn(2), 'target': torch.randn(2)}
]

# Extract predictions and targets into separate lists
predictions = [item['prediction'] for item in data]
targets = [item['target'] for item in data]

# Stack the tensors
predictions_tensor = torch.stack(predictions)
targets_tensor = torch.stack(targets)

# Define and apply the criterion
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
loss = criterion(predictions_tensor, targets_tensor)

print(f"Loss: {loss}")

```

This example showcases how to efficiently extract the relevant tensor data from a more complex data structure and then apply the standard stacking procedure. The key is to pre-process the data to extract the prediction and target tensors into separate lists before using `torch.stack`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation is invaluable for understanding the nuances of loss functions and tensor manipulation.  Exploring the documentation for specific loss functions (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `nn.MSELoss`, etc.) is highly recommended.  Furthermore, studying examples within the PyTorch tutorials related to building and training neural networks will offer practical insights into handling data structures effectively.  Finally, consulting advanced PyTorch textbooks will provide a deeper understanding of tensor operations and their optimization within the PyTorch framework.
