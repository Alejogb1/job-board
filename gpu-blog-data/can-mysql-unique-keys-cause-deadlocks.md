MySQL unique keys, particularly when combined with concurrent transactions performing inserts or updates, can indeed become a significant contributor to deadlock scenarios. I’ve observed this repeatedly over the years while working on database-driven applications. The issue arises not from the unique key constraint itself being faulty, but from the underlying mechanism used by MySQL to enforce this constraint: gap locks. These locks, while critical for data integrity, can inadvertently create conditions where multiple transactions block each other indefinitely.

The core problem stems from how MySQL, particularly when using the InnoDB storage engine, implements transaction isolation levels, specifically the Repeatable Read isolation level which is the default. This level uses next-key locking, which combines a record lock (a lock on the index record itself) and a gap lock (a lock on the gaps *between* index records). When an insertion or update requires checking for unique key violations, MySQL obtains shared locks on the index record where the insert is taking place and on the gaps that are being considered for unique key violation. This behavior is necessary to ensure serializability; it prevents phantom reads where a different transaction inserts a record that would violate the unique key constraint in the original transaction. The potential for deadlocks comes into play when two transactions try to acquire conflicting locks on the same gaps, leading to circular dependencies.

Let's consider a scenario involving a table `users` with a unique key on the `email` column. Initially, the table contains the following:

| id | email           |
|----|-----------------|
| 1  | test1@example.com |
| 2  | test3@example.com |

The `email` column has a unique index. If two transactions, Transaction A and Transaction B, are executing concurrently, each attempting to insert a new user, the following sequence of events could trigger a deadlock.

**Transaction A:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('test2@example.com');
```

**Transaction B:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('test4@example.com');
```

Transaction A attempts to insert `test2@example.com`. MySQL acquires a shared next-key lock on the index record for `test1@example.com` and a gap lock between `test1@example.com` and `test3@example.com`. Transaction B similarly acquires a shared next-key lock on the index record for `test3@example.com` and a gap lock between `test3@example.com` and any theoretical next value. Now, if Transaction B attempts to insert `test2@example.com`, it needs to acquire a lock in the same gap that Transaction A has already locked and vice versa, resulting in a deadlock.

The crucial point is that both transactions require the gaps to be free from insertions for a consistent view, thus leading to a deadlock situation. In such scenarios, MySQL's deadlock detection mechanism kicks in, killing one of the transactions, usually the one with the lower transaction ID, and allowing the other to proceed.

Now, let's examine some more concrete code examples demonstrating different deadlock scenarios.

**Example 1: Insertion Deadlock**

This example is a more detailed version of the above scenario, clarifying the steps and associated locks:

```sql
-- Setup
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('a@example.com'), ('c@example.com');

-- Transaction A (Session 1)
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('b@example.com'); -- Acquires shared lock on 'a@example.com' and gap lock between 'a' and 'c'

-- Transaction B (Session 2)
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('d@example.com'); -- Acquires shared lock on 'c@example.com' and gap lock from 'c' up to a theoretical next.
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('b@example.com'); -- Waits to acquire gap lock from session A, causing deadlock
```

In this example, the deadlock occurs when Transaction B attempts to insert `b@example.com`. Because Transaction A holds a lock on the gap where `b@example.com` *would* be inserted, Transaction B is blocked. Simultaneously, Transaction A is blocked because it will need to obtain a similar lock for any potential insert beyond `c@example.com`.

**Example 2: Update Deadlock**

Unique keys aren't just a factor during insertions; updates can also trigger deadlocks if they involve a unique key column:

```sql
-- Setup
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    sku VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO products (sku, name) VALUES ('SKU-1', 'Product 1'), ('SKU-2', 'Product 2');

-- Transaction A (Session 1)
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE products SET sku = 'SKU-3' WHERE sku = 'SKU-1';  -- Shared next-key lock on SKU-1 and gap locks

-- Transaction B (Session 2)
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE products SET sku = 'SKU-1' WHERE sku = 'SKU-2';  -- Shared next-key lock on SKU-2 and gap locks
UPDATE products SET sku = 'SKU-3' WHERE sku = 'SKU-2'; -- Waits for Transaction A gap lock. Deadlock.
```

Here, the problem is that both transactions are trying to acquire exclusive locks in the same range, with Transaction B being held up by the locks of Transaction A and therefore forming a deadlock.

**Example 3: Insert and Update Deadlock**

A combination of insertion and update operations can create a more subtle deadlock:

```sql
-- Setup is same as in Example 1
-- Transaction A (Session 1)
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('b@example.com'); -- Acquires shared lock on 'a@example.com' and gap lock between 'a' and 'c'

-- Transaction B (Session 2)
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE users SET email = 'e@example.com' WHERE email = 'c@example.com'; -- Acquires shared next-key lock on 'c@example.com' and gap lock after 'c'.
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('d@example.com'); -- Wait for gap lock in transaction A, deadlock.
```
In this case, Transaction B waits for transaction A to complete as transaction A is holding a gap lock that is needed for transaction B to successfully insert ‘d@example.com’. Conversely, transaction A waits for transaction B to finish as transaction B is holding a gap lock on the range between ‘c@example.com’ and future records.

These examples highlight the crucial relationship between unique key constraints, gap locks, and potential deadlocks. The default Repeatable Read isolation level amplifies this issue due to next-key locking.

To mitigate such problems, a few best practices are recommended. Minimizing lock contention is crucial. This can often be achieved by adopting more granular locking by rewriting queries. In some cases, utilizing explicit locking might assist. In specific cases, employing optimistic locking mechanisms can also decrease the chances of encountering deadlocks, though this introduces added complexity of application logic for retry mechanism. Lowering the isolation level to READ COMMITTED can avoid gap locks and next-key locks altogether, but risks introducing other issues with phantom reads and potentially non-repeatable reads, so such decisions must be considered carefully. Finally, designing tables with carefully chosen indices and well structured data with respect to the database application can reduce lock contention by ensuring that reads and writes will cause fewer conflicting range locks.

For further study, I suggest consulting the MySQL documentation pertaining to transaction isolation levels, InnoDB locking, and deadlock detection. Specifically, investigate the concepts of next-key locking and gap locks. The "High Performance MySQL" book provides a wealth of information on this topic as well, and is a strong resource for understanding the intricacies of MySQL performance tuning. Additionally, resources on database transaction management principles provide a broader view of how databases handle concurrency. These, in combination with personal practical experimentation, will help develop a strong understanding of how to avoid deadlocks in various database situations.
