TensorFlow and Keras, while inherently capable of leveraging GPU acceleration, often require deliberate optimization to achieve peak performance.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for production environments revealed that neglecting GPU-specific considerations consistently leads to significant performance bottlenecks, even with seemingly efficient model architectures.  The key lies not just in selecting the right hardware, but in meticulously managing data flow, memory allocation, and kernel execution within the TensorFlow/Keras framework.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Optimizing TensorFlow/Keras for GPU usage involves a multi-faceted approach targeting various aspects of the training and inference pipelines.  First, ensuring the correct installation and configuration of CUDA and cuDNN is paramount.  These libraries provide the necessary interface between TensorFlow/Keras and the NVIDIA GPU, allowing the framework to utilize the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.  Beyond this foundational step, several key strategies contribute to enhanced performance:

* **Data Preprocessing and Pipelining:**  Inefficient data loading and preprocessing significantly impact training speed.  Utilizing TensorFlow's `tf.data` API for creating efficient input pipelines is crucial.  This API allows for parallel data loading, preprocessing, and batching, maximizing GPU utilization by feeding data continuously without bottlenecks.  Techniques like data augmentation should be incorporated within this pipeline to further streamline the process.

* **Model Architecture Considerations:** While model complexity inherently influences training time, certain architectural choices can exacerbate GPU limitations.  Overly deep or wide networks might exceed GPU memory capacity, leading to excessive swapping to system RAM, severely hindering performance.  Techniques like model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation can help reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.

* **Hardware Resource Management:**  Understanding the GPU's memory capacity and processing capabilities is crucial.  Monitoring GPU memory usage during training provides valuable insights into potential bottlenecks.  Adjusting batch size dynamically, based on available memory, is a common strategy to prevent out-of-memory errors.  Furthermore, employing mixed precision training (using both FP16 and FP32) can significantly reduce memory consumption and accelerate training, as FP16 computations are faster.

* **TensorFlow/Keras Configuration:**  Utilizing TensorFlow's configuration options is essential.  Setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to specify which GPUs the program should use is a fundamental step.  Furthermore, using the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth()` function allows TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed, avoiding pre-allocation of excessive memory that might not be utilized.

* **Profiling and Optimization:**  Profiling tools, such as TensorBoard, are invaluable for identifying performance bottlenecks.  TensorBoard provides detailed visualizations of the training process, revealing areas where optimization efforts can yield the greatest improvements.  By analyzing memory usage, computational time per layer, and other metrics, specific areas for performance tuning can be pinpointed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Efficient Data Pipelining with `tf.data`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a tf.data.Dataset from NumPy arrays
data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_images, train_labels))

# Apply transformations for data augmentation and preprocessing
data = data.map(lambda image, label: (tf.image.random_flip_left_right(image), label), num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
data = data.map(lambda image, label: (tf.image.random_brightness(image, 0.2), label), num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
data = data.batch(32).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Train the model using the optimized dataset
model.fit(data, epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the use of `tf.data` to create an efficient input pipeline.  The `num_parallel_calls` argument enables parallel processing of data transformations, speeding up the preprocessing stage.  `prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` ensures a continuous data flow to the GPU, avoiding idle time.  `AUTOTUNE` lets TensorFlow dynamically determine the optimal number of parallel calls based on system resources.


**Example 2: Mixed Precision Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

mixed_precision = tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(mixed_precision)

# Define and compile the model as usual
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...)
model.compile(...)

# Train the model
model.fit(...)
```

*Commentary:* This showcases the simple implementation of mixed precision training.  By setting the global policy to `mixed_float16`, TensorFlow performs computations using FP16 where possible, significantly reducing memory footprint and accelerating training.  Note that careful monitoring is necessary to ensure numerical stability.


**Example 3: GPU Memory Growth Configuration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# Rest of the TensorFlow code...
```

*Commentary:*  This code snippet ensures that TensorFlow dynamically allocates GPU memory as needed.  `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)` prevents TensorFlow from pre-allocating all available GPU memory, enabling efficient memory utilization and reducing the likelihood of out-of-memory errors.  The `try-except` block handles potential errors that might arise from incorrect timing of device configuration.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on GPU usage and optimization.  NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN documentation offer detailed explanations of these critical libraries.  Furthermore, several excellent publications and textbooks on deep learning cover advanced optimization techniques.  Finally, exploring resources on distributed training with TensorFlow can significantly enhance scalability for exceptionally large models or datasets.
