TensorFlow 1.x utilized a significantly different architecture for saving and loading models compared to TensorFlow 2.x.  The primary difference stems from the introduction of the Keras API as the primary high-level API in TensorFlow 2.x, along with the deprecation of the `tf.Session` object and the `saver` API used extensively in TensorFlow 1.x.  Direct loading is thus not possible; a conversion process is necessary.

My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects, specifically those involving transfer learning from pre-trained Inception models originally built with TensorFlow 1.x, provided substantial insight into this conversion process.  Successfully migrating these models to TensorFlow 2.x required a nuanced understanding of both model architectures and the associated conversion tools.

The key to loading a TensorFlow 1.x saved model into TensorFlow 2.x lies in leveraging the `tf.compat.v1` module and understanding the structural differences between the two versions.  This module provides backward compatibility for many TensorFlow 1.x functions, allowing us to load the model and then perform necessary transformations for compatibility with the newer framework.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three core steps:

* **Loading the 1.x model:**  We utilize the `tf.compat.v1.saved_model.load()` function to load the 1.x saved model. This function, residing within the compatibility module, allows us to access the graph and variables of the legacy model.

* **Converting the graph:**  Once loaded, the model is represented as a computational graph. While functional in a TensorFlow 1.x environment, its structure needs mapping to the TensorFlow 2.x graph execution paradigm. This typically involves identifying the input and output tensors, and potentially converting the variable scopes into layer objects compatible with the Keras API, if you wish to further integrate with the higher-level functionality provided by Keras.

* **Integrating with 2.x:** Once the graph is loaded and potentially converted into a more compatible format, it can be integrated into a TensorFlow 2.x workflow.  This could involve using the loaded variables as weights within a new Keras model, or leveraging the loaded graph directly for inference within a `tf.function` decorated function.  The exact method depends on the intended use case and complexity of the 1.x model.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Model Loading and Inference:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the TensorFlow 1.x SavedModel
model_path = "path/to/your/tensorflow1x/model"
imported = tf.compat.v1.saved_model.load(model_path)

# Access the input and output tensors
input_tensor = imported.signature_def['serving_default'].inputs['input_tensor'].name
output_tensor = imported.signature_def['serving_default'].outputs['output_tensor'].name

# Create a TensorFlow 2.x session
with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=imported.graph) as sess:
    # Run inference
    input_data = ... # Your input data
    output = sess.run(output_tensor, {input_tensor: input_data})

print(output)
```

This example demonstrates loading a simple model and performing direct inference.  Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.Session` for execution within the loaded graph.  The `signature_def` is crucial for locating the appropriate input and output tensors within the legacy model. This method assumes a simple model where direct inference is sufficient.  Error handling (e.g., checking for the existence of the `serving_default` signature) should be incorporated in a production setting.


**Example 2: Conversion to Keras Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Load model as in Example 1) ...

# Extract weights and biases from the loaded model
weights = sess.run(imported.get_tensor_by_name("your_model/weights:0"))
biases = sess.run(imported.get_tensor_by_name("your_model/biases:0"))

# Create a Keras layer using the extracted weights and biases
keras_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=weights.shape[1], use_bias=True)
keras_layer.set_weights([weights, biases])

# Integrate the Keras layer into your TensorFlow 2.x model
model = keras.Sequential([keras_layer])
```

This example showcases a more involved approach.  It extracts specific weights and biases from the loaded 1.x model and uses them to initialize a corresponding Keras layer. This allows integration of the functionality from the 1.x model into a new, more manageable TensorFlow 2.x Keras model. The names "your_model/weights:0" and "your_model/biases:0" are placeholders; replace them with the actual names from your TensorFlow 1.x model graph.  This requires a deeper understanding of the internal structure of the 1.x model.


**Example 3:  Handling complex model architectures using tf.function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Load model as in Example 1) ...

@tf.function
def inference_function(input_data):
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=imported.graph) as sess:
      output = sess.run(output_tensor, {input_tensor: input_data})
    return output

# Use the inference function in a TensorFlow 2.x context
input_data = ... # Your input data
output = inference_function(input_data)
```


This approach is suitable for complex models where direct conversion to Keras layers is cumbersome or impractical.  The `tf.function` decorator allows for efficient execution of the 1.x graph within the TensorFlow 2.x runtime.  This minimizes the need for explicit conversion while maintaining compatibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on compatibility, specifically the sections relating to migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x, offers comprehensive guidance.  Consult the TensorFlow API reference for details on the `tf.compat.v1` module and related functions.  Finally, explore relevant articles and tutorials specifically addressing the conversion of saved models; a careful search will yield numerous examples and best practices for handling various complexities.  Reviewing example code repositories dealing with legacy model loading and conversion will further enhance your understanding.
