The performance difference between using `__threadfence()` with global memory writes and employing `atomicExch()` hinges critically on the specific access patterns and the underlying hardware architecture.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing kernels for NVIDIA GPUs, particularly those involving large-scale simulations and particle dynamics, has revealed that a blanket statement favoring one over the other is misleading.  The optimal approach depends heavily on the level of concurrency, data dependencies, and the granularity of the memory operations.

**1. Explanation:**

`__threadfence()` ensures that all preceding global memory writes issued by a thread are globally visible before subsequent memory operations.  This is crucial for maintaining data consistency when multiple threads concurrently access and modify shared data structures.  However, it imposes a significant synchronization overhead, potentially stalling the execution pipeline until all preceding writes are flushed.  The impact is particularly pronounced when dealing with a large number of threads simultaneously writing to disparate memory locations. The compiler may introduce further optimizations that can impact performance in unpredictable ways.

`atomicExch()`, on the other hand, performs an atomic exchange operation.  It atomically replaces the value at a specified memory location with a new value and returns the original value.  While atomic operations intrinsically handle synchronization, they're inherently more expensive than non-atomic writes due to the hardware-level locking mechanisms involved.  The cost increases significantly with contention â€“ when multiple threads attempt to perform atomic operations on the same memory location simultaneously.

Therefore, the relative speed depends entirely on the application's memory access patterns.  If the code involves numerous independent writes where data races are improbable, then using `__threadfence()` might introduce unnecessary overhead.  Conversely, in scenarios involving potential data races or requiring strict ordering of writes, `atomicExch()` ensures correctness but at a potentially higher computational cost.  In situations with high contention, the performance penalty of `atomicExch()` can become substantial, dwarfing the cost of `__threadfence()`.  This is where the importance of appropriate synchronization primitives, possibly beyond simply `atomicExch()` (e.g., atomic add operations), becomes critical.  My work on fluid dynamics simulations highlighted this perfectly; the granular nature of particle interactions meant that fine-grained atomic operations were a bottleneck.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Independent Writes - `__threadfence()` Overhead:**

```cuda
__global__ void independentWrites(int *data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    data[i] = i * 2; //Independent write
  }
  __threadfence(); //Unnecessary overhead here
}
```

In this scenario, each thread writes to a unique memory location.  The `__threadfence()` call is redundant and introduces unnecessary overhead.  Removing it would significantly improve performance.  The lack of data dependency makes the fence operation entirely superfluous.  I encountered a similar situation while optimizing a ray tracing kernel where independent pixel calculations benefited significantly from removing the fence.

**Example 2: Atomic Exchange - Necessary for Synchronization:**

```cuda
__global__ void atomicExchange(int *counter) {
  int oldVal = atomicExch(counter, 1); //Atomically sets counter to 1, returning old value
  //Further operations based on oldVal
}
```

This example showcases a classic use case for `atomicExch()`.  Multiple threads concurrently attempt to update a shared counter.  Using `atomicExch()` guarantees atomicity and prevents race conditions.  The overhead is justified as it ensures correctness; a simple non-atomic write would risk data corruption.  During development of a distributed lock mechanism, this approach proved essential for robust synchronization.

**Example 3:  Balancing Act - Conditional Atomic Operations:**

```cuda
__global__ void conditionalAtomic(int *data, int *flags, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    if (flags[i] == 1) { //Check a flag before atomic operation
      atomicAdd(&data[i], 1); //Atomic add operation - less contention than exchange
    }
  }
}
```

This demonstrates a more nuanced approach.  Instead of always using an atomic operation, a conditional check is performed first. If the condition (`flags[i] == 1`) is false, the expensive atomic operation is avoided.  This strategy reduces contention, hence improving performance compared to a straightforward atomic operation for every element.  In simulations requiring infrequent updates to specific data structures, this conditional approach significantly reduced the atomic operation overhead.  The choice between `atomicExch()` and `atomicAdd()` also underscores the importance of selecting the most appropriate atomic function for the task at hand.

In conclusion, there isn't a universally faster approach. The choice between using `__threadfence()` with global memory writes and `atomicExch()` depends critically on the specific memory access patterns of your CUDA kernel.  Profiling your code with different strategies, analyzing the generated assembly code, and carefully considering the nature of your data dependencies are essential steps toward optimizing performance. A thorough understanding of the hardware architecture, thread scheduling, and memory access patterns is paramount in making an informed decision.  Ignoring this crucial detail frequently resulted in suboptimal performance in my past projects.
