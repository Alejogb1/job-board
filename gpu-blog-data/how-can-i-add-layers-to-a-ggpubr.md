The `ggpubr` package, while convenient for generating publication-ready plots, lacks a direct function for adding layers in the same intuitive manner as base `ggplot2`.  This stems from its design philosophy of simplifying common plotting tasks, often abstracting away the underlying `ggplot2` functionality.  However, leveraging `ggplot2`'s capabilities directly within a `ggpubr` workflow is entirely feasible and often necessary for complex plot customization.  My experience working on visualizing multi-faceted genomic data frequently demanded this approach, particularly when combining statistically derived annotations with raw data representations.

**1.  Understanding the ggplot2 Layering Principle**

The foundation of adding layers in `ggplot2`, and thus implicitly within `ggpubr`, lies in understanding the grammar of graphics. Each plot element – points, lines, text, annotations – is a layer added sequentially to a base plot. The order of layer addition dictates visual hierarchy; layers added later appear on top.  This is achieved using functions such as `geom_point()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_text()`, `geom_abline()`, etc., all of which are compatible with `ggpubr` objects.

**2.  Integrating ggplot2 Layers with ggpubr Plots**

Since `ggpubr` functions fundamentally build upon `ggplot2` objects, you can access and extend the underlying `ggplot2` plot using the `$` operator to access the `ggplot` object. This exposes the full power of `ggplot2`'s layering capabilities.  This is crucial for adding layers beyond what `ggpubr`'s high-level functions offer.  For instance, directly adding confidence intervals computed externally, or incorporating custom legends, requires this approach. My work in proteomics frequently required overlaying theoretical models onto experimental data, and this technique proved indispensable.

**3. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Adding a Regression Line to a Scatter Plot**

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))

# Create a scatter plot using ggpubr
p <- ggscatter(data, x = "x", y = "y")

# Add a linear regression line using ggplot2's geom_smooth
p <- p$ggplot + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red")

# Print the enhanced plot
print(p)
```

This example demonstrates the core concept. We first create a scatter plot using `ggscatter`.  Then, we access the underlying `ggplot` object using `p$ggplot` and add a linear regression line using `geom_smooth()`. Note that `se = FALSE` suppresses the confidence interval ribbon.  This is a common scenario where `ggpubr` provides a streamlined plot, but `ggplot2` extensions are needed for fine-grained control.

**Example 2:  Adding Custom Annotations to a Boxplot**

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
                   value = c(rnorm(10, mean = 10), rnorm(10, mean = 15), rnorm(10, mean = 12)))

# Create a boxplot using ggpubr
p <- ggboxplot(data, x = "group", y = "value")

# Add custom annotations using ggplot2's annotate function
p <- p$ggplot + annotate("text", x = "B", y = 17, label = "Significant Difference", size = 4)

#Print the enhanced plot
print(p)

```

Here, a boxplot is created using `ggboxplot`. We then use `annotate("text", ...)` to add a textual annotation indicating a significant difference observed between groups. This exemplifies adding custom textual elements that aren't directly supported by the `ggpubr` high-level functions.  In my prior work analyzing clinical trial data, this was crucial for highlighting statistically significant treatment effects.

**Example 3:  Combining Multiple Geoms and Faceting**

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 20)),
                   time = rep(1:20, 2),
                   value = c(rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(20, mean = 12, sd = 3)))

# Create a line plot with points using ggpubr
p <- ggline(data, x = "time", y = "value", add = "point", color = "group")

# Facet the plot using ggplot2's facet_wrap to visualize each group independently.
p <- p$ggplot + facet_wrap(~group)

#Add a horizontal line at the mean value for each group separately
p <- p + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(value), color=group), data=data %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(mean_value = mean(value)), linetype = "dashed")

# Print the enhanced plot
print(p)
```

This example showcases a more complex scenario combining multiple layers.  A line plot is created with data points, then faceted by group using `facet_wrap()` from `ggplot2`. This method offers a more flexible alternative to the built-in faceting options within some `ggpubr` functions.  Finally, horizontal dashed lines indicating group means are added.  This demonstrates the power of integrating `ggplot2` for advanced plot structuring and layer addition that can not be readily achieved with a single `ggpubr` command.


**4.  Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding of the `ggplot2` grammar of graphics, I recommend consulting the official `ggplot2` documentation.  Further exploration into advanced plotting techniques can be found in several texts dedicated to data visualization with R.  Familiarity with the dplyr package for data manipulation is also beneficial, particularly when dealing with complex datasets needing preparation prior to plotting.  These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles which will empower you to effectively utilize `ggplot2` layers within a `ggpubr` context for sophisticated plot customization.
