Converting int64 WAV files to a TensorFlow Dataset necessitates a careful understanding of both the WAV format and TensorFlow's data ingestion mechanisms. The core challenge lies in efficiently decoding the binary audio data and transforming it into a format suitable for TensorFlow's computation graph, typically as tensors of float32. Over my years of experience working on audio processing pipelines, I've developed a workflow that emphasizes both speed and memory efficiency, which I'll outline below.

The standard WAV file uses a RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) container. Within this container, the audio samples themselves are usually stored within a "data" sub-chunk. These samples, in the case of int64 WAV files, are 8-byte signed integers. Consequently, direct reading of the raw bytes doesn't directly translate into useful audio information; they must be interpreted as int64 data, and then scaled and converted to a floating-point representation before feeding them into a TensorFlow model. I’ll detail the specifics of that process here.

First, I need to handle the WAV file header. The WAV header provides critical metadata including sampling rate, number of channels, and bit depth. Typically, I’ll use Python's 'wave' library to parse these, which simplifies extracting that crucial information. While I *could* perform manual binary parsing, utilizing the 'wave' module dramatically reduces the error surface, and speeds up the initial data extraction. Importantly, I *do not* intend to use 'wave' to decode audio itself; I'm going to read the raw sample data bytes. The ‘wave’ module merely parses header data, which is crucial for interpreting the subsequent raw bytes as integer audio data. With this header metadata secured, I proceed to the actual audio sample extraction. I typically use standard Python `open()` function to read the raw bytes.

Next, the raw binary data representing int64 audio samples needs interpretation. Crucially, WAV files usually store samples in little-endian byte order, which is standard on most modern hardware. Therefore, conversion of bytes to int64 values requires that the bytes are interpreted as little-endian int64 integers. Numpy arrays provide convenient vectorization for this process – this avoids explicitly looping and drastically improves performance. Once the int64 samples are extracted, I need to normalize these values to a floating-point range, which is vital for numerical stability in training neural networks and also is expected by TensorFlow. The magnitude of int64 data is very large, and directly using it could introduce numerical instabilities in models. Scaling these down to a float range of approximately [-1, 1] is almost always needed for this reason. The range used here typically matches the full-scale range of the source analog-to-digital converter that was used to generate the digital signal.

Finally, the normalized audio samples are fed into a TensorFlow Dataset. This can be done by leveraging `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`. Note that `from_tensor_slices` creates a dataset where each slice corresponds to an example which, in my case, is an entire audio file's time-series. For longer files, splitting into smaller chunks to allow for more iterations during training is crucial. I typically use a function to generate windowed segments of audio for better training and performance if the model is designed to handle smaller audio time-windows.

Here are some code examples illustrating these steps:

```python
import wave
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def decode_wav_int64(wav_file):
    """Decodes an int64 WAV file and returns audio data and sampling rate."""
    with wave.open(wav_file, 'rb') as wf:
        num_channels = wf.getnchannels()
        sampling_rate = wf.getframerate()
        sample_width = wf.getsampwidth()
        num_frames = wf.getnframes()

        if sample_width != 8:
           raise ValueError("Expected 8-byte samples (int64).")

        raw_data = wf.readframes(num_frames)

    audio_data = np.frombuffer(raw_data, dtype=np.int64)
    
    max_val = float(np.iinfo(np.int64).max)
    normalized_audio = audio_data.astype(np.float32) / max_val
   

    return normalized_audio, sampling_rate, num_channels

def create_audio_dataset(wav_files):
    """Creates a TensorFlow Dataset from a list of WAV files."""
    audio_list = []
    for wav_file in wav_files:
         audio_data, _, _ = decode_wav_int64(wav_file)
         audio_list.append(audio_data)
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(audio_list)

# Example usage
wav_files = ['audio1.wav', 'audio2.wav']  # Assume these files exist
audio_dataset = create_audio_dataset(wav_files)

for example in audio_dataset.take(2):
     print(example.shape)
     print(example.dtype)
```

This code reads the WAV header to get information on sampling rate, channel count, and importantly confirms that the WAV file is truly an int64. Then reads the raw bytes from the WAV's 'data' subchunk using the `readframes` function. The subsequent decoding process uses numpy's ability to interpret the byte array, and then normalizes the array by dividing by the maximum int64 value. `create_audio_dataset` simply iterates over the WAV files and packages the audio as a TF Dataset. I use `take(2)` to demonstrate accessing the first two samples in the dataset, which shows that the dataset contains tensors and also the datatype has changed to `float32`, and also shows that shapes will match the length of audio time series from those samples.

A slightly more sophisticated code block follows:

```python
import wave
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def decode_wav_int64_with_padding(wav_file, target_length):
    """Decodes an int64 WAV, pads to target length, and returns data and sampling rate."""
    with wave.open(wav_file, 'rb') as wf:
        num_channels = wf.getnchannels()
        sampling_rate = wf.getframerate()
        sample_width = wf.getsampwidth()
        num_frames = wf.getnframes()

        if sample_width != 8:
            raise ValueError("Expected 8-byte samples (int64).")
        raw_data = wf.readframes(num_frames)

    audio_data = np.frombuffer(raw_data, dtype=np.int64)
    
    max_val = float(np.iinfo(np.int64).max)
    normalized_audio = audio_data.astype(np.float32) / max_val

    if len(normalized_audio) < target_length:
        padding_len = target_length - len(normalized_audio)
        padded_audio = np.pad(normalized_audio, (0, padding_len), mode='constant')
    else:
        padded_audio = normalized_audio[:target_length]

    return padded_audio, sampling_rate, num_channels


def create_padded_audio_dataset(wav_files, target_length):
    """Creates a TensorFlow Dataset with padded audio data."""
    audio_list = []
    for wav_file in wav_files:
        padded_audio, _, _ = decode_wav_int64_with_padding(wav_file, target_length)
        audio_list.append(padded_audio)

    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(audio_list)

# Example usage
wav_files = ['audio1.wav', 'audio2.wav']  # Assume these files exist
target_length = 10000 # example length

padded_audio_dataset = create_padded_audio_dataset(wav_files, target_length)

for example in padded_audio_dataset.take(2):
     print(example.shape)
     print(example.dtype)
```

In this version, I’ve added padding or truncation to the audio clips to ensure a uniform length. This is very important when batching tensors together for training, especially with variable length audio. `decode_wav_int64_with_padding` now adds padding with zeros to audio that is shorter than the `target_length`, or it truncates an audio clip if the clip is longer than the `target_length`. The rest of the function mirrors the previous, but now the Dataset generated from the output will have each audio tensor with the same length.

As a last example, I am going to show how to generate windowed samples, which is very important for training models that use shorter time segments:

```python
import wave
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def decode_and_window_wav_int64(wav_file, window_size, stride):
    """Decodes an int64 WAV, creates windowed samples, and returns them and sampling rate."""
    with wave.open(wav_file, 'rb') as wf:
        num_channels = wf.getnchannels()
        sampling_rate = wf.getframerate()
        sample_width = wf.getsampwidth()
        num_frames = wf.getnframes()

        if sample_width != 8:
           raise ValueError("Expected 8-byte samples (int64).")
        raw_data = wf.readframes(num_frames)
    
    audio_data = np.frombuffer(raw_data, dtype=np.int64)

    max_val = float(np.iinfo(np.int64).max)
    normalized_audio = audio_data.astype(np.float32) / max_val
    
    windows = []
    for i in range(0, len(normalized_audio) - window_size + 1, stride):
         windows.append(normalized_audio[i:i+window_size])
    
    return windows, sampling_rate, num_channels

def create_windowed_audio_dataset(wav_files, window_size, stride):
    """Creates a TensorFlow Dataset with windowed audio data."""
    all_windows = []
    for wav_file in wav_files:
         windows, _, _ = decode_and_window_wav_int64(wav_file, window_size, stride)
         all_windows.extend(windows)

    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(all_windows)

# Example usage
wav_files = ['audio1.wav', 'audio2.wav']  # Assume these files exist
window_size = 2048 # example window size
stride = 1024 # example stride

windowed_audio_dataset = create_windowed_audio_dataset(wav_files, window_size, stride)
for example in windowed_audio_dataset.take(5):
    print(example.shape)
    print(example.dtype)
```

In this final example, we generate windowed samples by defining a window size and stride. The `decode_and_window_wav_int64` will now read an audio file and split it into multiple segments. These windowed segments are then passed to the dataset generator. The dataset will now have tensors of size of `window_size`, which is ideal for many audio model architectures. This type of processing is especially important for acoustic scene recognition, audio tagging, or other tasks where time-localized acoustic information is needed.

For further exploration of this area, I recommend reviewing the official Python 'wave' library documentation for a deeper understanding of WAV file structure. Also, I highly recommend a deep review of TensorFlow documentation specifically on the `tf.data` API, with specific attention to `tf.data.Dataset` creation methods. There are also great resources available which detail numeric representation on computers, and what byte order, little-endian vs big-endian, mean, which is critical to correctly decoding the audio data. Further studying signal processing methods, in particular Fourier transforms, would provide additional context as to what happens after the time-series is fed into a neural network.
