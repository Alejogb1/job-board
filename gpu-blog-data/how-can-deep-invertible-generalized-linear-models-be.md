Deep invertible generalized linear models (DIGLMs) present a unique challenge in probabilistic programming frameworks like TensorFlow Probability (TFP), stemming from the inherent difficulty in balancing the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the constraint of invertibility required for efficient inference.  My experience working on Bayesian neural networks for medical imaging analysis highlighted this tension.  Specifically, the need for accurate posterior inference on high-dimensional image data necessitates efficient sampling techniques, which are often hampered by the computational cost associated with non-invertible transformations within the model.  Therefore, constructing DIGLMs in TFP requires careful consideration of the model architecture, the chosen inversion method, and the implementation details for optimal performance.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge in implementing DIGLMs within TFP lies in defining the invertible transformation. Standard neural networks are not inherently invertible.  To achieve invertibility, we must employ specific architectural constraints and/or introduce auxiliary variables.  Several approaches exist, each with trade-offs in complexity and computational efficiency.  One common strategy is to use a sequence of invertible transformations, where each layer's output is a deterministic function of the input, and the inverse function is readily available.  This allows for efficient computation of the likelihood and its gradient during inference.  Popular choices include coupling layers, autoregressive flows, and orthogonal transformations.

Coupling layers partition the input vector and apply a transformation to one partition conditioned on the other, ensuring invertibility through carefully designed conditioning mechanisms. Autoregressive flows model each element of the output vector as a function of the preceding elements, maintaining invertibility through the sequential nature of the transformation. Orthogonal transformations, such as those based on Householder reflections or Givens rotations, guarantee invertibility by ensuring the transformation matrix maintains orthogonality.

Within the TFP framework, the implementation involves leveraging the `tfp.distributions` module to define the likelihood function and the `tfp.bijectors` module to construct the invertible transformations. The choice of bijector will heavily influence the model's performance and complexity.  The model can then be trained using variational inference (VI) techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or stochastic variational inference (SVI), depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the dataset. The use of VI is preferred over exact inference due to the intractability of computing the posterior distribution in deep models.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Coupling Layer Based DIGLM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a coupling layer using a MADE bijector
def coupling_layer(x_dim, hidden_units):
  def create_coupling(forward_net):
    return tfp.bijectors.MaskedAutoregressiveFlow(
        shift_and_log_scale_fn=forward_net,
        num_masked_units=x_dim
    )
  return create_coupling

# Define the model
def diglm_coupling(x_dim, hidden_units):
  bijector = tfp.bijectors.Chain([coupling_layer(x_dim, hidden_units) for _ in range(3)]) #Stack layers
  base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=tf.zeros(x_dim))
  model_dist = tfd.TransformedDistribution(distribution=base_dist, bijector=bijector)
  return model_dist

# Example Usage
x_dim = 10
hidden_units = [64, 64]
model = diglm_coupling(x_dim, hidden_units)
```
This example demonstrates a simple DIGLM using chained coupling layers implemented via Masked Autoregressive Flows (MADE). Each layer partitions the input, applies a transformation using a neural network, and combines the transformed and untransformed portions.  The `Chain` bijector allows for sequential application of these coupling layers. The base distribution is a simple multivariate normal, transformed to a more complex distribution.

**Example 2: Autoregressive Flow Based DIGLM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define an autoregressive flow
def autoregressive_flow(x_dim, hidden_units):
    return tfp.bijectors.AutoregressiveNetwork(
        params=lambda x: tf.layers.dense(x, units=2 * x_dim),  #Neural net to output parameters for the flow.
        event_ndims=1
    )


# Define the model
def diglm_autoregressive(x_dim, hidden_units):
    bijector = autoregressive_flow(x_dim, hidden_units)
    base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=tf.zeros(x_dim))
    model_dist = tfd.TransformedDistribution(distribution=base_dist, bijector=bijector)
    return model_dist

# Example Usage
x_dim = 10
hidden_units = [64, 64]
model = diglm_autoregressive(x_dim, hidden_units)
```
Here, an autoregressive flow is used.  The `AutoregressiveNetwork` bijector models the dependency between variables sequentially.  This approach is less efficient for high-dimensional data due to the computational complexity of the autoregressive structure but is simpler to implement for lower-dimensional datasets.


**Example 3:  Incorporating a Generalized Linear Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a simple invertible transformation
def simple_invertible_transform(x):
  return tf.tanh(x)

#Define the GLM part
def glm_layer(x, weights):
  return tf.matmul(x,weights)


# Define the model
def diglm_glm(x_dim, hidden_units, y_dim):
  bijector = tfp.bijectors.Chain([tfp.bijectors.Invert(tfp.bijectors.AffineScalar(scale=tf.Variable(tf.ones([1]),name="scale",dtype=tf.float32))),simple_invertible_transform]) # Example invertible transformation
  base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=tf.zeros(y_dim))
  model_dist = tfd.TransformedDistribution(distribution=base_dist, bijector=bijector)
  weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((x_dim,y_dim)),name="weights")
  #In this example, we are assuming the GLM is applied as a deterministic transformation before sampling from the distribution.
  def log_prob(x):
    transformed_x = glm_layer(x,weights)
    return model_dist.log_prob(transformed_x)

  return log_prob,weights


# Example Usage
x_dim = 5
hidden_units = [64, 64]
y_dim = 2 #Output dimension for the GLM.
log_prob_fn,weights = diglm_glm(x_dim, hidden_units, y_dim)

```

This example sketches how to incorporate a generalized linear model into the architecture.  A simple, invertible transformation (`tf.tanh`) is used for demonstration. A more complex, invertible transformation could be used, such as those demonstrated in examples 1 & 2. The GLM is defined by a weight matrix that applies a linear transformation before feeding into the transformed distribution. This approach can be modified to integrate the GLM more intrinsically within the invertible layers for more intricate modeling.
