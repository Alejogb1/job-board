The presence of seemingly unnecessary quotation marks around CUDA compiler binaries within CMake stems from how CMake handles list expansions and its interpretation of paths containing spaces or special characters. Specifically, CMake’s list processing mechanism, when interacting with generated variables, requires that elements representing file paths be properly quoted to ensure they are treated as single, complete entities. Without this quoting, paths containing spaces might be misinterpreted as separate arguments, leading to compilation errors.

I encountered this directly during the development of a high-performance image processing library. Our team heavily leveraged CUDA for parallel processing, and we were transitioning from manual build scripts to CMake for better portability. Initially, we were not quoting the CUDA compiler binaries generated by CMake’s CUDA module, which was particularly problematic on Windows where paths to the CUDA toolkit often contain spaces. The builds consistently failed with obscure errors complaining about missing files, which after some painstaking debugging, revealed that the spaces in the toolchain paths were being treated as argument separators rather than as part of the path.

CMake's behavior, at its core, stems from its interpretation of strings as lists. When you define a variable that is later used as a list, CMake treats the spaces within the string as delimiters by default. For instance, if you have a variable like `CUDA_COMPILER = /path/to/cuda/bin/nvcc.exe` and you pass this directly to a command without quotes, the command interpreter might receive `/path/to/cuda/bin/nvcc.exe` as several separate arguments instead of a single executable path. CMake, to avoid this, suggests enclosing these paths in quotation marks to force the entire string to be treated as a single list element that represents a full file path.

Now, let us examine three code examples to illustrate this point. The first example will highlight the problem that occurs when quotations are not present, while the second will demonstrate the proper usage of quotations to resolve the issue. The third example shows the actual use within the context of the `cuda_add_executable` function.

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage (Without Quotations)**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(CudaUnquoted)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

set(CUDA_NVCC_PATH "${CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR}/bin/nvcc.exe")

add_executable(my_cuda_app main.cu)
target_compile_options(my_cuda_app PRIVATE -std=c++17)

set_target_properties(my_cuda_app PROPERTIES CUDA_COMPILER ${CUDA_NVCC_PATH})
```
In this scenario, assuming the CUDA toolkit is installed in a location with spaces, such as `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.2`, CMake's interpretation of `"${CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR}/bin/nvcc.exe"` will result in a `CUDA_NVCC_PATH` value that expands to a path containing spaces which are not explicitly enclosed within quotes. Consequently, when the `CUDA_COMPILER` property of the target `my_cuda_app` is set, the command interpreter would receive the path as multiple arguments, for example, `C:\Program`, `Files\NVIDIA`, etc. instead of `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.2/bin/nvcc.exe`. This causes the compilation to fail since the compiler is not called using the correct path.

**Example 2: Correct Usage (With Quotations)**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(CudaQuoted)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

set(CUDA_NVCC_PATH "\"${CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR}/bin/nvcc.exe\"")

add_executable(my_cuda_app main.cu)
target_compile_options(my_cuda_app PRIVATE -std=c++17)

set_target_properties(my_cuda_app PROPERTIES CUDA_COMPILER ${CUDA_NVCC_PATH})
```
In this corrected version, we have explicitly enclosed the path in quotation marks by creating a variable with a string starting and ending with `\"`. This tells CMake to treat the entire path as a single argument. When CMake expands `${CUDA_NVCC_PATH}` the quotes remain, ensuring that the compiler's path, including any spaces, is correctly interpreted. Now the build will execute the compiler with the full path, resolving the previously encountered compilation errors. The double quotes, once interpreted by CMake and passed to the command interpreter, ensure that the entire path is treated as one argument.

**Example 3: Real World `cuda_add_executable` Use Case**
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(CudaAppExample)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

cuda_add_executable(my_cuda_app main.cu)
target_compile_options(my_cuda_app PRIVATE -std=c++17)
```
The `cuda_add_executable` macro internally handles these details and ensures all arguments, including compiler paths, are correctly quoted. In this specific case we are not explicitly setting the `CUDA_COMPILER` property, but the `cuda_add_executable` macro, provided by the CUDA CMake module, will automatically manage the quoting and compiler settings for us. This is the recommended method for managing CUDA builds with CMake because it abstracts away the potentially complicated interactions with compiler paths. Internally, when this macro uses the `CUDA_COMPILER` variable, the generated calls are equivalent to the quoted version discussed in Example 2.

The key to understanding the need for these quotations is understanding how CMake's list processing and string expansion works. While developers can define and set the `CUDA_COMPILER` explicitly, this is typically not advised as it may increase the risk of creating erroneous path constructs and leads to repetitive code. Instead, the use of functions like `cuda_add_executable` and CMake's handling of its own internal variables mitigates the need for manual quoting of variables and guarantees that the correct compiler binary path is being used regardless of its location and the operating system.

For further information on this specific area of CMake, I recommend consulting the CMake documentation on properties, particularly those related to compilers, as well as the CMake CUDA module documentation. Exploring the section on list manipulation will also be particularly helpful. Additionally, reviewing any general resources regarding the use of command line arguments and path handling in different operating systems will deepen the understanding of why this is required and how different operating systems might introduce different challenges. Finally, a good understanding of the internals of the CUDA toolchain and its compiler, specifically `nvcc`, can provide helpful insights into why this specific compiler requires such attention to detail regarding path resolution.
