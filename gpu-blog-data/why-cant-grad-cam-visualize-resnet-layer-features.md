The inability of Grad-CAM to directly visualize ResNet layer features, specifically features deep within the residual blocks, arises primarily from the nature of its gradient calculation and the architecture of ResNet's skip connections. Grad-CAM relies on backpropagating gradients of a specific class score through the convolutional layers of a network to identify the regions in the input image that were most salient to that classification. When applied to ResNet, these gradients become diluted or fragmented, making direct visualization of individual layer feature maps unreliable.

Here's a more detailed breakdown. The core mechanism of Grad-CAM involves calculating the gradient of a target class score with respect to the feature maps of a chosen convolutional layer. This gradient represents how much each activation in the feature map contributed to the final classification. In a standard convolutional network, these gradients flow relatively unimpeded, allowing for a clear attribution of importance to the spatial locations within the feature maps. However, ResNet architectures introduce skip connections or shortcut paths which bypass one or more layers, significantly altering gradient flow dynamics. The gradients of the class score are not solely dependent on the intermediate layer's output but can also directly propagate through the shortcut connection. This parallel path means that the gradients calculated at any layer within a residual block no longer exclusively represent the influence of just that layer. The impact of the other parallel paths, particularly in deeper residual blocks, become dominant and diminishes the interpretability of the chosen layerâ€™s feature maps. The information carried by the gradient essentially splits, leading to an inaccurate attribution when using Grad-CAM.

Moreover, the feature maps inside the residual blocks themselves represent the *residual* signal. The layers learn the difference or correction to the identity connection. These feature maps do not directly encode the overall information; instead, they learn increasingly complex deviations from the prior state which often lacks a clear correspondence with the input image's spatial structure. Therefore, even if the gradients flowed exclusively through the layer, the feature maps themselves are not directly representative of the input signal in the way an earlier convolution layer feature map might be. They represent adjustments and transformations, which are often not easily interpretable visually using Grad-CAM which focuses on spatial localization of class-specific importance.

Consequently, attempting to visualize features deep within a ResNet using Grad-CAM often results in noisy, diffuse, or generally uninformative activation maps that do not clearly highlight the relevant regions of an input image. The gradients that are used to create the heatmap are, in essence, scattered across multiple paths and applied to a feature map that does not represent the overall signal but a residual. In effect, the method is attempting to interpret a complex, intermediate signal using a framework designed for simpler, more linear convolutional pathways.

To illustrate this, consider the following code examples using PyTorch.

**Example 1: Basic Convolutional Layer Grad-CAM Visualization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models, transforms
from torch.autograd import Variable
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm

def grad_cam(model, input_tensor, target_class, layer):
    model.eval()
    input_tensor.requires_grad_(True)
    output = model(input_tensor)

    score = output[:, target_class].squeeze()
    score.backward()

    gradients = layer.grad.detach().cpu().numpy()
    activations = layer.detach().cpu().numpy()

    pooled_gradients = np.mean(gradients, axis=(2, 3))

    for i in range(activations.shape[1]):
        activations[:, i, :, :] *= pooled_gradients[i]

    heatmap = np.mean(activations, axis=1)
    heatmap = np.maximum(heatmap, 0)
    heatmap /= np.max(heatmap)

    return heatmap

#Load a pretrained Resnet 18 and modify for single image classification
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.fc = nn.Linear(512, 1000) # Adjust output if needed
layer = model.layer4[1].conv2 # Choose a specific convolutional layer in ResNet 

preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

img = Image.open("image.jpg") #Replace with actual image file
input_tensor = preprocess(img).unsqueeze(0)
input_var = Variable(input_tensor)
target_class = 282 # Class ID

heatmap = grad_cam(model, input_var, target_class, layer)

h, w = input_tensor.shape[2], input_tensor.shape[3]
heatmap = np.uint8(cm.jet(heatmap) * 255)
heatmap = Image.fromarray(heatmap).resize((w, h), resample=Image.Resampling.BILINEAR)

plt.imshow(heatmap, alpha = 0.7)
plt.show()
```

This first example calculates a Grad-CAM heatmap using `model.layer4[1].conv2`. This is the second convolutional layer within the second residual block of `layer4`. The image 'image.jpg', is expected to exist in the same folder with the python script. The code performs forward and backward passes, extracts the required gradients, and produces a heatmap overlay.

**Example 2: Attempting Grad-CAM on an early convolutional layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models, transforms
from torch.autograd import Variable
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm

def grad_cam(model, input_tensor, target_class, layer):
    model.eval()
    input_tensor.requires_grad_(True)
    output = model(input_tensor)

    score = output[:, target_class].squeeze()
    score.backward()

    gradients = layer.grad.detach().cpu().numpy()
    activations = layer.detach().cpu().numpy()

    pooled_gradients = np.mean(gradients, axis=(2, 3))

    for i in range(activations.shape[1]):
        activations[:, i, :, :] *= pooled_gradients[i]

    heatmap = np.mean(activations, axis=1)
    heatmap = np.maximum(heatmap, 0)
    heatmap /= np.max(heatmap)

    return heatmap

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.fc = nn.Linear(512, 1000)
layer = model.conv1 # Choose an early convolutional layer

preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

img = Image.open("image.jpg")
input_tensor = preprocess(img).unsqueeze(0)
input_var = Variable(input_tensor)
target_class = 282

heatmap = grad_cam(model, input_var, target_class, layer)

h, w = input_tensor.shape[2], input_tensor.shape[3]
heatmap = np.uint8(cm.jet(heatmap) * 255)
heatmap = Image.fromarray(heatmap).resize((w, h), resample=Image.Resampling.BILINEAR)

plt.imshow(heatmap, alpha = 0.7)
plt.show()

```

This second example targets `model.conv1`, the first convolutional layer. This visualization typically shows much clearer, interpretable activation patterns than that of deep layer in example 1. The output will demonstrate a more localized area of the image contributing to the class score. It reflects the features of the very first transformations performed on the input image, and the gradient attribution will be clearer.

**Example 3: Modifying the network to isolate a single ResNet block and applying Grad-CAM**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models, transforms
from torch.autograd import Variable
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import copy

def grad_cam(model, input_tensor, target_class, layer):
    model.eval()
    input_tensor.requires_grad_(True)
    output = model(input_tensor)

    score = output[:, target_class].squeeze()
    score.backward()

    gradients = layer.grad.detach().cpu().numpy()
    activations = layer.detach().cpu().numpy()

    pooled_gradients = np.mean(gradients, axis=(2, 3))

    for i in range(activations.shape[1]):
        activations[:, i, :, :] *= pooled_gradients[i]

    heatmap = np.mean(activations, axis=1)
    heatmap = np.maximum(heatmap, 0)
    heatmap /= np.max(heatmap)

    return heatmap


class ModifiedResNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, original_model):
        super(ModifiedResNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = original_model.conv1
        self.bn1 = original_model.bn1
        self.relu = original_model.relu
        self.maxpool = original_model.maxpool
        self.layer1 = original_model.layer1
        self.layer2 = original_model.layer2
        self.layer3 = original_model.layer3
        self.layer4_0 = original_model.layer4[0] #Isolate the first layer
        self.avgpool = original_model.avgpool
        self.fc = original_model.fc

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.maxpool(x)
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        x = self.layer3(x)
        x = self.layer4_0(x)
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

original_model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model = ModifiedResNet(original_model)
layer = model.layer4_0.conv1

preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

img = Image.open("image.jpg")
input_tensor = preprocess(img).unsqueeze(0)
input_var = Variable(input_tensor)
target_class = 282

heatmap = grad_cam(model, input_var, target_class, layer)

h, w = input_tensor.shape[2], input_tensor.shape[3]
heatmap = np.uint8(cm.jet(heatmap) * 255)
heatmap = Image.fromarray(heatmap).resize((w, h), resample=Image.Resampling.BILINEAR)

plt.imshow(heatmap, alpha = 0.7)
plt.show()
```

In example 3, a modified ResNet architecture is created. Only the first residual block of `layer4` is included. The others are removed. We now apply Grad-CAM on its first convolutional layer. The visualization can show clearer localized responses compared to the full architecture in example 1. This is because the gradient can be traced more directly to this specific layer within the modified network since other residual connections are excluded. This example provides a limited, albeit clearer, interpretation compared to deep layers when using standard full networks.

For a more thorough understanding of gradient-based visualization techniques and their limitations, I would recommend delving into research papers focusing on saliency mapping and attention mechanisms. Publications on "Integrated Gradients" and "SmoothGrad" offer insights into more robust methods for interpreting model behavior. Also, exploring research in the field of attention mechanisms provides other ways to analyze and interpret how a model arrives at a particular classification decision. Books on deep learning architecture and implementation will give a deeper conceptual understanding.
