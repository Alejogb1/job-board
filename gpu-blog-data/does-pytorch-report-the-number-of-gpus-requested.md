PyTorch's reporting of GPU requests isn't directly explicit through a single, readily accessible attribute or function.  Instead, determining the number of GPUs utilized depends on how the model and data are managed during initialization and training. My experience working on large-scale NLP models at several research institutions has shown this to be a common source of confusion.  The information isn't "hidden," per se, but rather distributed across different aspects of the execution environment.  We need to infer the GPU usage from contextual clues.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorchâ€™s flexibility allows for diverse GPU usage patterns.  You could be using a single GPU, multiple GPUs with data parallelism (DataParallel), multiple GPUs with model parallelism (a more complex scenario requiring custom code), or even a mix of CPUs and GPUs.  Consequently, there's no universal counter stating "X GPUs requested."  Instead, we need to examine the device allocation at runtime.  This primarily involves inspecting the device assignment of tensors and the modules involved in your model.  If your model is using multiple GPUs, it'll be implicitly reflected in the device assignments of its constituent layers and the tensors it processes.  If you used `torch.nn.DataParallel`, the underlying mechanism will automatically distribute the workload across available GPUs, based on the available resources.  Failure to detect sufficient GPUs during initialization will generally raise an exception, indirectly indicating a request-resource mismatch.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Single GPU Usage**

```python
import torch

# Check for GPU availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda:0") # Requesting a single GPU (cuda:0)
    print(f"Using GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(device)}")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device) # Tensor allocation on the GPU
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("Using CPU")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000)

#Further operations using x...
```

*Commentary:* This example explicitly requests a single GPU (cuda:0).  The `torch.cuda.is_available()` check is crucial.  If no GPU is available, the code gracefully falls back to the CPU.  The absence of an error implicitly suggests that one GPU was requested and (presumably) allocated successfully.  We get the name of the GPU, which confirms our selection.


**Example 2: Data Parallelism with Multiple GPUs**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Assume you have a model, training data, and other relevant components...
model = nn.Linear(1000, 10) # A simple linear model
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.randn(10000, 1000), torch.randn(10000, 10))
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    print(f"Using {torch.cuda.device_count()} GPUs for data parallelism.")
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    model.to("cuda") # Automatically distributes across available GPUs
else:
    print("Only one or no GPU detected. Using single GPU or CPU.")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        model.to("cuda")
    else:
        print("Using CPU")
# Training loop...
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates the use of `nn.DataParallel`. The `torch.cuda.device_count()` function determines the number of GPUs visible to PyTorch.  `nn.DataParallel` handles the distribution across the detected GPUs. The code explicitly states how many GPUs are used for data parallelism. An error during `model.to("cuda")` in the absence of adequate GPUs would indicate that multiple GPUs were requested but not available.


**Example 3: Manual GPU Specification (Advanced)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, gpu_ids):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(1000, 500).to(f"cuda:{gpu_ids[0]}")
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(500, 10).to(f"cuda:{gpu_ids[1]}") #Different GPU

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

if torch.cuda.device_count() >= 2:
    gpu_ids = [0, 1]  # Explicitly specifying GPU IDs
    model = MyModel(gpu_ids)
    print(f"Model using GPUs: {gpu_ids}")
    # Training logic...  (requires careful synchronization)
else:
    print("Insufficient GPUs for this model configuration.")

```

*Commentary:* This is a more advanced example showcasing manual device placement. We explicitly assign different layers to different GPUs. This requires careful consideration of data transfer between GPUs and is generally more complex than `nn.DataParallel`.  The number of requested GPUs is explicitly defined in `gpu_ids`, and an error or warning message will be issued if enough GPUs are not available.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is indispensable.  Consult the documentation on `torch.cuda`, `nn.DataParallel`, and distributed data parallel training for comprehensive details on GPU usage and management within PyTorch.  Furthermore, studying examples and tutorials covering distributed training and model parallelism will further enhance your understanding of how PyTorch handles multi-GPU scenarios.  Understanding the nuances of CUDA and its programming model will be valuable for advanced cases.  Finally,  thorough examination of the PyTorch error messages during initialization or training is crucial for diagnosing GPU allocation problems.  This includes paying close attention to the stack trace to identify the precise point of failure.
