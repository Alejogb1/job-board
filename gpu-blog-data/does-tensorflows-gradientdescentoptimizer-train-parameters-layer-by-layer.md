No, TensorFlow's `GradientDescentOptimizer`, and indeed most standard optimizers within TensorFlow, do not train parameters layer-by-layer. Instead, they operate on the entire set of trainable variables simultaneously, based on the calculated gradient of the loss function with respect to *all* those variables. This is a fundamental aspect of how backpropagation works in deep learning, and understanding this distinction is crucial for effective model training.

My early experiences building neural networks often involved misconceptions about training, particularly this idea of layer-wise learning. Before I fully grasped backpropagation, I, too, assumed that optimizers might sequentially adjust weights, starting from the output layer and progressing backwards. However, after debugging numerous training runs where different layers seemed to be learning at vastly different rates, I realized the problem was not layer-by-layer updating but rather a matter of gradient magnitudes and the architecture itself.

The core mechanism of training is based on gradient descent. Given a loss function `L` and trainable parameters (weights and biases) represented collectively as `θ`, gradient descent seeks to minimize `L` by iteratively updating `θ` in the direction opposite to the gradient of `L` with respect to `θ`, often scaled by a learning rate `α`. The update rule for a single iteration is typically expressed as `θ := θ - α * ∇L(θ)`.

Crucially, `∇L(θ)` is the gradient *across all trainable parameters*. When we call `optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, trainable_vars))` in TensorFlow, the `grads` variable will contain a gradient corresponding to each of the trainable variables, not a subset related to a particular layer. The optimizer, irrespective of whether it is `GradientDescentOptimizer` or Adam, SGD, etc., then uses these gradients to update all trainable parameters in a single step. Therefore, the entire process operates on all parameters jointly, guided by the overall error and its derivative with respect to each variable.

Let me illustrate this with some examples. The first example demonstrates a simple model and how gradients are calculated and applied.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Sample data
X = tf.random.normal((32, 5))
y = tf.random.uniform((32, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.cast(y, tf.float32)

# Training loop
for _ in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}")
```
This code initializes a basic sequential model with two layers. The critical part is the training loop. Using a `tf.GradientTape`, gradients are computed with respect to *all* `model.trainable_variables`. Then, the `optimizer.apply_gradients` function updates *all* these parameters, not just parameters of a specific layer. The output shows a decreasing loss, indicating that both layers' parameters are being trained concurrently.

The next example focuses on inspecting gradient values specifically. It highlights that gradients for all layers are indeed generated in a single backward pass.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the same model as before
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Optimizer and loss function remain the same
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Sample data - reuse previous
X = tf.random.normal((32, 5))
y = tf.random.uniform((32, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.cast(y, tf.float32)

# Training step with gradient inspection
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):
    print(f"Layer {i//2 + 1}, Parameter {i%2 + 1}: Gradient Shape {grads[i].shape}")

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example computes the gradients and then iterates through `model.trainable_variables`, printing the shape of the corresponding gradient. The shapes will correspond to the shapes of the parameter matrices of both layers, demonstrating that gradients exist for *all* parameters within each layer. If the optimizer was working layer-by-layer, the gradient would only exist for the parameters of the layer being "trained" at that step. The output will clearly show gradient shapes corresponding to all parameter matrices and bias vectors of the layers in the network.

Finally, the third example demonstrates the effect of a large learning rate, which further clarifies that all parameters are modified simultaneously, potentially in a poorly controlled manner if the learning rate is inappropriate.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the same model as before
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Optimizer with an intentionally large learning rate
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1.0) # Large Learning Rate
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Sample data - reuse previous
X = tf.random.normal((32, 5))
y = tf.random.uniform((32, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.cast(y, tf.float32)

initial_vars = [var.numpy().copy() for var in model.trainable_variables]

# Training step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

# Compare parameters after update
for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):
    diff = tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(var.numpy() - initial_vars[i]))
    print(f"Layer {i//2 + 1}, Parameter {i%2 + 1}: Change Magnitude {diff:.4f}")

```
This snippet utilizes a substantially large learning rate. After a single training step, the changes in the parameter values are computed and their magnitudes are printed. The output demonstrates that all parameters across both layers have been modified, sometimes significantly, due to the excessive learning rate. If a layer-by-layer update mechanism were in place, we would only observe changes in parameter values for one layer per training step. The large learning rate amplifies the effect, making the simultaneous change across all parameters more evident.

It is important to note that there are more advanced training strategies like pretraining or layer-wise adaptive rate scaling algorithms, but these are fundamentally different from what the core `GradientDescentOptimizer` or similar optimizers are doing. Those strategies manipulate the training process and involve mechanisms orthogonal to the core simultaneous parameter updates.

For further reading, I recommend exploring the theoretical foundations of backpropagation detailed in introductory deep learning texts and lectures. Also, examine the source code or high-level architectural diagrams of TensorFlow's optimizers. Consulting online courses and textbooks specializing in deep learning and specifically the math behind backpropagation can offer a very useful foundation. Additionally, exploring research articles on advanced optimization methods would greatly enhance understanding. These resources provide a solid base for comprehending the underlying mechanics and nuances of neural network training.

In conclusion, TensorFlow's `GradientDescentOptimizer`, along with the other commonly used optimizers, does not perform layer-by-layer training. It operates by calculating gradients across *all* trainable variables in the network simultaneously, updating all parameters together. This is a fundamental mechanism that underpins how deep learning algorithms are trained. Understanding this point is essential for effectively training and debugging neural network architectures.
