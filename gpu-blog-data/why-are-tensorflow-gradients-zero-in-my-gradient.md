The pervasive issue of zero gradients within a TensorFlow GradientTape context often stems from operations occurring outside the tape's recorded scope or involving non-differentiable tensors. Specifically, I've encountered this frequently when prematurely detaching tensors from the computation graph.

When training neural networks, TensorFlow's GradientTape diligently tracks operations performed on `tf.Variable` objects within its context. These operations build a computational graph, enabling the automatic calculation of gradients during the backward pass. If a tensor used in a computation is not a variable or if it’s detached from the graph, TensorFlow cannot trace the operation’s dependency and consequently cannot compute its derivative with respect to other variables. The result is zero gradients, hindering the learning process. Detachment, typically induced by methods such as `.numpy()` or explicit conversions to non-TensorFlow data types, creates this disconnect.

Another common culprit is applying non-differentiable operations to variables. Integer division (`//`) or logical operations (`tf.logical_and`, `tf.logical_or`, etc.) are not differentiable. If these operations are part of the forward pass, they break the chain of differentiability required for gradient calculation, effectively zeroing out the derivative. Similarly, operations that truncate or round values (e.g., `tf.floor`, `tf.ceil`, or explicit type casting like `tf.cast`) can cause a similar issue, especially when performed before the dependent variable of interest. Operations that explicitly avoid differentiability, such as `tf.stop_gradient`, will also lead to zero gradients in the region within which they are used.

The order of operations within the `GradientTape` is also critical. Variables, especially `tf.Variable` objects, need to be used within the tape's context for the gradients to be properly tracked. Consider a scenario where a variable is initialized before the tape's context and is modified outside the tape. The changes occurring outside the tape will not be tracked, and thus will have zero gradients associated with them.

Finally, any operation that results in a constant value or an operation that does not depend on the variable within the `GradientTape` context will inherently have zero gradient. This could occur due to a logical error in the mathematical formulation of the forward pass.

Let's examine three code snippets to illustrate these concepts:

**Example 1: Tensor Detachment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a variable and a constant
x = tf.Variable(2.0)
y_constant = tf.constant(3.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Detach y_constant by converting it to a NumPy array before use.
    y_detached = y_constant.numpy() 
    z = x * y_detached
    
# Attempt to calculate gradient with respect to x.
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x) 
print(gradients) # Output: tf.Tensor(3.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Use y_constant directly as a TensorFlow tensor.
    z = x * y_constant 
    
# Attempt to calculate gradient with respect to x.
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x) 
print(gradients) # Output: tf.Tensor(3.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Use y_constant directly as a TensorFlow tensor.
    y_tensor_copy = tf.identity(y_constant)
    z = x * y_tensor_copy 
    
# Attempt to calculate gradient with respect to x.
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x) 
print(gradients) # Output: tf.Tensor(3.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Use y_constant directly as a TensorFlow tensor.
    z = x * y_constant
    
    
# Attempt to calculate gradient with respect to y_constant.
gradients = tape.gradient(z, y_constant) 
print(gradients)  # Output: None

y_var = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Use y_constant directly as a TensorFlow tensor.
    z = x * y_var
    
    
# Attempt to calculate gradient with respect to y_var.
gradients = tape.gradient(z, y_var) 
print(gradients)  # Output: tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

```

*Commentary:* In this example, initially converting `y_constant` to a NumPy array using `y_constant.numpy()` detaches the tensor from the TensorFlow computation graph. As a result, `tape.gradient(z, x)` calculates the correct gradient. The gradient with respect to `y_constant`, if the tape did not track it, results in `None`. Further, the gradient with respect to a variable, like `y_var`, will result in a correctly computed gradient. It is vital to ensure all computations are done using TensorFlow tensors. The `tf.identity` does not have an effect and produces a copy of the tensor that preserves its place on the computational graph.

**Example 2: Non-Differentiable Operation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(5.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Integer division is not differentiable.
    z = x // y
    
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(gradients) # Output: None

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Integer division is not differentiable.
    z = tf.cast(x / y, dtype=tf.int32)
    
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(gradients) # Output: None

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Use normal division for differentiable results.
    z = x / y
    
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(gradients)  # Output: tf.Tensor(0.5, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

*Commentary:* Here, the usage of integer division (`//`) results in a zero gradient. The division results in a constant value that doesn't depend on the variable when doing the back propagation. Similarly, converting an operation that would normally be differentiable into an integer type results in an issue during back propagation and therefore results in zero or no gradients (`None`). If we use standard division, then we receive a non-zero gradient. It is crucial to use operations which are differentiable or can be approximated in a differentiable manner when dealing with variables.

**Example 3: Variable Modification Outside the Tape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Initial value tracked.
    y = x * 3.0

# Modifying x outside the tape.
x.assign(5.0) 
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Modified value.
    z = x * 2.0
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(gradients)  # Output: tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x_local = tf.identity(x)
    x_local.assign(5.0) # Error, x_local is not a variable
    z = x_local * 2.0
gradients = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(gradients)  # Output: None
```

*Commentary:* In the first part of this example, the first variable, `x`, is used and updated with a `.assign` method *outside* the `GradientTape`. When we create a second `GradientTape` instance and compute the gradient, we observe that the tape only uses the most recent state of the variable and does not track how the variable itself was changed, and this could be an issue if one expects to use the gradients related to the updates to that variable. In the second part of this example, we are attempting to use `tf.identity` to make a copy of `x` to make changes locally within the tape context, and we find that we are not allowed to change a tensor, only a `tf.Variable` can be modified.

To mitigate these issues, ensure that all computations involving `tf.Variable` objects occur within the scope of a `tf.GradientTape`, avoiding detaching tensors by methods such as `.numpy()` before computations needing gradients, and using differentiable operations throughout the forward pass. Additionally, avoid modifying variables outside the scope of a `GradientTape` context, and ensure that the variables are being modified with their defined methods, for example, `variable.assign(...)`.

For further exploration of automatic differentiation in TensorFlow, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation. The "GradientTape" section in the TensorFlow guide provides detailed explanations, tutorials, and use-case examples. Investigating sections regarding automatic differentiation, training loops, and custom models can provide additional insights. Furthermore, exploring example notebooks demonstrating how to implement gradient updates can provide useful context and practical understanding of how `GradientTape` functions within the training process. Finally, the TensorFlow API documentation for classes such as `tf.Variable` and `tf.GradientTape` provides granular details regarding their behavior and intended use.
