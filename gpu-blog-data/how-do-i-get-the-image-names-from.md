Accessing image filenames within a PyTorch dataset requires careful consideration of the dataset's structure and the chosen data loading mechanism.  My experience building large-scale image classification models has consistently highlighted the need for a robust and adaptable approach to this task, particularly when dealing with custom datasets.  The core challenge lies in understanding how the dataset's `__getitem__` method interacts with the underlying data storage, whether that's a directory structure or a pre-defined data file.

Directly accessing filenames isn't inherently built into the core PyTorch `Dataset` class.  Instead, you need to manage this information during dataset creation and integrate it into your data loading pipeline. This involves either storing filenames alongside image data during dataset instantiation or leveraging a mechanism to reconstruct the filenames based on the index within the dataset. The optimal method depends heavily on your dataset's organization.

**1.  Method 1: Storing Filenames Directly**

This is the most straightforward and generally preferred method.  During dataset initialization, I iterate through the image directory, storing both the image path (filename) and the corresponding image data.  This maintains a direct link between the index and the filename, simplifying retrieval later.

**Code Example 1:**

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

class ImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, root_dir, transform=None):
        self.root_dir = root_dir
        self.transform = transform
        self.image_paths = []
        self.image_labels = [] #Assuming you have labels

        for subdir, _, files in os.walk(root_dir):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png')):
                    img_path = os.path.join(subdir, file)
                    self.image_paths.append(img_path)
                    # Extract label from subdirectory name or filename, adapt as needed
                    self.image_labels.append(os.path.basename(subdir))


    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img_path = self.image_paths[idx]
        image = Image.open(img_path)
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, self.image_labels[idx], img_path #return image, label and filename

# Example usage
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
dataset = ImageDataset('./data/images', transform=transform)
image, label, filename = dataset[0]
print(f"Filename: {filename}")

```

This example demonstrates a custom dataset class. The `__init__` method iterates through the specified directory, storing all image paths in `self.image_paths`.  The `__getitem__` method returns the image, label, and filename, making filename access trivial. Note the inclusion of error handling and the adaptability for different image extensions.  In real-world scenarios, you might also need to handle corrupted files or images of unexpected formats.

**2. Method 2:  Reconstruction from Index (Less Efficient)**

If storing filenames directly isn't feasible due to memory constraints or dataset structure, you can attempt to reconstruct them from the index.  This is generally less efficient and relies on a strictly ordered and predictable directory structure.  I've used this approach only in limited cases where dataset size is exceedingly large.

**Code Example 2:**

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

class ImageDatasetIndex(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, root_dir, transform=None):
        self.root_dir = root_dir
        self.transform = transform
        self.image_list = sorted([f for f in os.listdir(root_dir) if f.endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))])

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_list)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img_name = self.image_list[idx]
        img_path = os.path.join(self.root_dir, img_name)
        image = Image.open(img_path)
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, img_name # return image and filename


#Example Usage
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
dataset = ImageDatasetIndex('./data/images', transform=transform)
image, filename = dataset[0]
print(f"Filename: {filename}")

```

This method relies on `os.listdir` to get the image names.  Crucially, `self.image_list` is sorted to ensure correct index mapping.  This method is fragile; any change in the directory structure will break the index-filename correspondence.


**3. Method 3: Leveraging Existing Datasets (If Applicable)**

Some pre-built PyTorch datasets (like ImageFolder) implicitly provide filename information, though often indirectly.  You might need to adapt your approach based on the specific dataset's implementation.

**Code Example 3:**

```python
import torchvision.datasets as datasets
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

data_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

image_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('./data/images', transform=data_transforms)

#Accessing Filenames - Requires understanding ImageFolder's structure
for i in range(len(image_dataset)):
    sample = image_dataset[i]
    image, label = sample
    filename = image_dataset.imgs[i][0]
    print(f"Image {i+1}: {filename}")
```

Here, `datasets.ImageFolder` implicitly stores the image paths.  Accessing them requires understanding the internal structure of the `imgs` attribute, which is a list of tuples, where the first element is the image path.  This approach is dataset-specific and less flexible than the custom dataset approach.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  Thorough understanding of Python's `os` module for file system interaction.  Books on advanced Python programming for working with data structures and file handling.  Literature on building custom datasets for deep learning projects.  Familiarization with various image loading libraries in Python.


In conclusion, efficiently accessing image filenames from a PyTorch dataset necessitates thoughtful planning during dataset construction.  Directly storing filenames within the dataset object, as demonstrated in Method 1, provides the most reliable and efficient solution.  Methods 2 and 3 offer alternatives, but they are less robust and adaptable, especially in large-scale or dynamically changing projects.  Remember to always prioritize error handling and design for flexibility to manage unforeseen issues that invariably arise in real-world data.
