The core challenge in allocating a tensor with a shape exceeding available GPU memory lies in the fundamental limitation of finite resources.  My experience working on large-scale deep learning models at a previous research institution frequently encountered this bottleneck.  Efficient solutions necessitate a departure from the naive approach of directly allocating the entire tensor; instead, they leverage techniques that manage data access and computation strategically.  The optimal method hinges on the specific application and the nature of the operations performed on the tensor.

**1. Out-of-Core Computation:**

This approach addresses the memory constraint by processing the tensor in smaller, manageable chunks.  Instead of loading the entire tensor into GPU memory, we load only a portion, process it, write the results to disk (or a faster, persistent storage like NVMe SSD), and then load the next portion.  This iterative process continues until the entire tensor has been processed.

The efficiency of this method heavily depends on the I/O speed of the storage device and the computational cost of processing each chunk.  For scenarios where the operations on the tensor are highly independent across chunks (e.g., element-wise operations), out-of-core computation can be highly effective.  However, if the computation requires accessing multiple, widely separated chunks repeatedly, the overhead of disk access will significantly impact performance.

**Code Example 1: Out-of-Core Matrix Multiplication**

This example demonstrates out-of-core matrix multiplication, where large matrices are processed in blocks.  Note that error handling and optimized I/O routines (like memory-mapped files) should be incorporated for production-level code.

```python
import numpy as np
import os

def out_of_core_matmul(A_path, B_path, C_path, block_size):
    """
    Performs out-of-core matrix multiplication.

    Args:
        A_path: Path to matrix A (saved as a NumPy array).
        B_path: Path to matrix B.
        C_path: Path to save the resulting matrix C.
        block_size: Size of blocks to process.
    """
    A_shape = np.load(A_path + '.npy').shape
    B_shape = np.load(B_path + '.npy').shape

    if A_shape[1] != B_shape[0]:
        raise ValueError("Matrices are incompatible for multiplication.")

    C = np.zeros((A_shape[0], B_shape[1]))
    for i in range(0, A_shape[0], block_size):
        for j in range(0, B_shape[1], block_size):
            A_block = np.load(A_path + f"_{i}_{i+block_size}.npy")
            B_block = np.load(B_path + f"_{j}_{j+block_size}.npy")
            C[i:i+block_size, j:j+block_size] = np.matmul(A_block, B_block)

    np.save(C_path, C)


# Example usage (assuming matrices are pre-divided into blocks and saved to disk):
A_path = "matrix_A"
B_path = "matrix_B"
C_path = "matrix_C"
block_size = 1024
out_of_core_matmul(A_path, B_path, C_path, block_size)

```


**2. Tensor Decomposition:**

Tensor decomposition methods, such as CP decomposition or Tucker decomposition, represent a high-dimensional tensor as a product of smaller tensors.  This significantly reduces the memory footprint required to store the tensor.  The trade-off is that the decomposed representation is an approximation of the original tensor; the accuracy of the approximation depends on the choice of decomposition method and the rank of the decomposition.

This approach is particularly useful when dealing with tensors that exhibit low-rank structure, which is common in many applications such as natural language processing and recommendation systems.  However, if the tensor does not possess low-rank structure, the approximation error might be significant, rendering this method unsuitable.

**Code Example 2: CP Decomposition using TensorLy**

This example demonstrates a basic CP decomposition using the TensorLy library.  Note that choosing the appropriate rank is crucial and typically involves experimentation.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorly.decomposition import cp_als

# Generate a sample tensor (replace with your actual tensor loading)
tensor = np.random.rand(100, 100, 100)

# Perform CP decomposition
rank = 10  # Choose an appropriate rank
factors = cp_als(tensor, rank=rank)

# Reconstruct the tensor (approximation)
reconstructed_tensor = factors.to_tensor()

# Access factors individually for computation
# ... further processing using factors ...

```


**3. Memory Mapping:**

Memory mapping allows the operating system to map a file directly into the virtual address space of the process. This enables accessing portions of a large file as if it were in RAM.  While the data is still physically stored on disk, accessing it through memory mapping can be significantly faster than explicit read/write operations, especially for sequential access patterns.

However, memory mapping is less effective when random access is dominant, and the performance gain depends on factors such as the operating system's memory management capabilities and the hardware's I/O performance.

**Code Example 3: Memory-Mapped Tensor Access**

This example shows how to access a large tensor using memory mapping in Python.  This avoids loading the entire tensor into RAM at once.

```python
import numpy as np
import mmap

def memory_mapped_tensor(filepath, shape, dtype):
    """Accesses a large tensor using memory mapping."""

    file = open(filepath, 'rb+')
    mm = mmap.mmap(file.fileno(), 0)
    tensor = np.ndarray(shape, dtype=dtype, buffer=mm)

    # Access elements of the tensor like a regular NumPy array
    # ... perform computations ...

    mm.close()
    file.close()

# Example usage: Assuming a tensor is pre-saved to file
filepath = "large_tensor.dat"
shape = (10000, 10000)
dtype = np.float32
memory_mapped_tensor(filepath, shape, dtype)
```



**Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of out-of-core computation, I suggest consulting specialized texts on high-performance computing and numerical linear algebra.  Similarly, rigorous treatments of tensor decompositions and their applications can be found in advanced machine learning and data mining literature.  Finally, resources focusing on operating system internals and memory management are invaluable for grasping the nuances of memory mapping.  Understanding these topics will allow for informed decision making when dealing with the challenges of large-scale tensor computations.
