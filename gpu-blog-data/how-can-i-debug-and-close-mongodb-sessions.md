Debugging and cleanly closing MongoDB sessions in Python often hinges on understanding the asynchronous nature of many MongoDB drivers and the potential for resource leaks if not handled appropriately.  My experience working on high-throughput data ingestion pipelines has underscored the critical importance of robust session management.  Failure to do so can lead to connection timeouts, performance degradation, and, in extreme cases, database server overload.  This response will detail best practices for debugging and closing MongoDB sessions, focusing on the PyMongo driver.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the distinction between client instances and individual sessions.  A PyMongo client represents a connection pool to the MongoDB server.  Within this pool, individual sessions manage operations, and these sessions must be explicitly closed to release resources.  Ignoring session management can result in lingering connections, consuming server resources and potentially leading to errors like "too many open files."

The `MongoClient` object itself isn't directly associated with a single session; it manages a pool of connections.  It's the `client.start_session()` method that creates a new session for use within a specific operation or transaction.  While PyMongo offers implicit session handling in some cases (using `with pymongo.MongoClient(...)` context managers), explicit session management offers superior control and debugging capabilities.

Efficient debugging requires a layered approach. First, examine the application’s interaction with the database – the specific points where connections are initiated, sessions created, and operations performed. This often involves reviewing logs for connection-related errors, analyzing network activity, and inspecting the MongoDB server logs for stalled or open connections. Second, utilize the debugging tools built into PyMongo, such as the session's `client` attribute to trace the session's origin and access related server information. Finally, instrumentation of your code to track session lifetimes and enforce proper closure is crucial for identifying and preventing resource leaks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Session Management with Explicit Closure:**

```python
import pymongo

try:
    client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
    db = client["mydatabase"]
    with client.start_session() as session:
        with session.start_transaction():
            result = db.mycollection.insert_one({"name": "Example"}, session=session)
            # ... other database operations ...
            session.commit_transaction() #critical step for transaction integrity
except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
    print(f"PyMongo Error: {e}")
finally:
    client.close() #Close the client to release the connection pool
```

This example demonstrates the preferred method.  The `with` statement guarantees the session is closed even if exceptions occur. The `client.close()` call releases the underlying connection pool. Note that the transaction must be explicitly committed.

**Example 2: Debugging using the session's `client` attribute:**

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
session = client.start_session()
try:
    # ... database operations ...
    print(f"Session ID: {session.session_id}")
    print(f"Session Client: {session.client}") #inspect the connection pool
except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
    print(f"PyMongo Error: {e}")
    print(f"Session ID (for debugging): {session.session_id}")
finally:
    session.end_session()
    client.close()
```

This showcases the use of `session.client` and `session.session_id`.  These attributes are vital during debugging, allowing you to identify the client associated with a problematic session and its unique identifier, which is useful in reviewing MongoDB server logs.  The session ID helps correlate application-level errors with server-side logs.


**Example 3: Handling multiple sessions and asynchronous operations (Illustrative):**

```python
import pymongo
import asyncio

async def perform_operation(session, data):
    try:
      db = session.client["mydatabase"] # access the database via session client
      result = await db.mycollection.insert_one(data, session=session)
      return result.inserted_id
    except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
        print(f"Error in asynchronous operation: {e}")
        return None
    finally:
      await session.end_session()


async def main():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
    data_list = [{"name": "Async1"}, {"name": "Async2"}]
    tasks = []
    for data_point in data_list:
      session = client.start_session()
      task = asyncio.create_task(perform_operation(session, data_point))
      tasks.append(task)

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results) #process the results
    client.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This example, though simplified, highlights the importance of handling sessions within asynchronous contexts. Each operation utilizes its own session, ensuring proper resource management even with concurrent execution. The `finally` block within the asynchronous function guarantees that `end_session()` is called even if exceptions arise.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyMongo documentation, especially sections dealing with sessions and advanced error handling, is essential.  The MongoDB server documentation, particularly regarding connection management and monitoring tools, offers crucial insights into server-side behavior and potential bottlenecks.  Familiarize yourself with your operating system's tools for monitoring open files and network connections.  Understanding these tools will aid in identifying lingering MongoDB connections beyond what your application directly reveals.  Finally, a robust logging strategy for both application and database operations is paramount for effective debugging.  The detail level should depend on the complexity of your application and the nature of your data.  Detailed logs make identifying the source of session issues much simpler.
