The 2GB limit encountered during Keras sequential model training with TensorFlow datasets typically stems from insufficient memory allocation for the dataset's in-memory representation, not a fundamental Keras or TensorFlow limitation.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous large-scale image classification projects highlighted the critical role of dataset pre-processing and efficient data handling techniques.  The error doesn't inherently reflect a 2GB hard limit imposed by the libraries but rather a consequence of exceeding the available RAM, exacerbated by the way TensorFlow manages data during training.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem isn't the model itself; rather, it's how the data is loaded and managed.  TensorFlow, particularly when using `tf.data`, eagerly loads data into memory. While this can be beneficial for performance in smaller datasets, it's disastrous for large ones.  When the combined size of your dataset (images, labels, and any pre-processing artifacts) surpasses your system's available RAM, you'll encounter an `OutOfMemoryError` or related memory-exhaustion exception, often manifesting as a cryptic "2GB limit" error message which is misleading.  The 2GB figure is arbitrary; it's the point at which your system's available RAM is depleted, relative to other running processes.

Several factors contribute to this issue:

* **Dataset Size:**  The most obvious factor is simply the sheer size of your dataset. High-resolution images or large numbers of samples rapidly exhaust memory.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Online data augmentation, performed during training, generates multiple augmented versions of each image on-the-fly.  This significantly increases the temporary memory footprint.
* **Batch Size:** Larger batch sizes require holding more data in memory concurrently. While larger batches can improve training speed for smaller datasets, they directly impact RAM consumption.
* **Pre-processing:** Intensive pre-processing steps (e.g., complex feature extraction) performed before feeding data to the model increase memory usage.
* **TensorFlow Version and Hardware:** Older TensorFlow versions or systems with limited RAM are more susceptible.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Data Loading:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Inefficient: Loads the entire dataset into memory at once.
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... model layers ...
])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```

This code is problematic for large datasets like CIFAR-10 because it loads the entire training and testing data into memory.  For datasets significantly larger than available RAM, this will immediately fail.

**Example 2: Efficient Data Loading with `tf.data`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Efficient: Uses tf.data for on-the-fly data loading and prefetching.
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

ds_train = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).shuffle(1000).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
ds_test = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_test, y_test)).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... model layers ...
])

model.fit(ds_train, epochs=10, validation_data=ds_test)
```

This example uses `tf.data` to create efficient data pipelines.  `shuffle` randomizes the data, `batch` creates batches, and `prefetch` preloads data in the background, significantly improving training speed and reducing memory usage by loading data in smaller chunks.  `AUTOTUNE` lets TensorFlow dynamically determine the optimal prefetch buffer size.

**Example 3:  Addressing memory issues with custom data generators:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class DataGenerator(tf.keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, image_paths, labels, batch_size=32):
        self.image_paths = image_paths
        self.labels = labels
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(len(self.image_paths) / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_x = self.image_paths[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        batch_y = self.labels[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        # Load and preprocess images here, one batch at a time
        images = []
        for path in batch_x:
            img = tf.io.read_file(path)
            img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=3)
            img = tf.image.resize(img, [224,224])
            images.append(img)
        return np.array(images), np.array(batch_y)

#Example usage
image_paths = ["path/to/image1.jpg", "path/to/image2.jpg", ...] #List of image paths
labels = [0, 1, 0, ...] #corresponding labels

train_generator = DataGenerator(image_paths, labels)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... model layers ...
])

model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates a custom data generator using `tf.keras.utils.Sequence`. This approach allows for loading and pre-processing images in batches, eliminating the need to load the entire dataset into memory simultaneously.  The `__getitem__` method loads and preprocesses only the required batch, significantly reducing memory consumption. This approach is particularly crucial when dealing with very large image datasets that won't fit into memory.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data` is invaluable for mastering efficient data pipelines.  Exploring techniques for memory management in Python (including garbage collection strategies) will also be beneficial.  Furthermore, consult advanced guides on Keras model building, focusing on best practices for handling large datasets.  Finally, review literature on deep learning optimization strategies, particularly those aimed at reducing memory footprint. These resources will provide the theoretical and practical understanding needed for effective memory management in deep learning applications.
