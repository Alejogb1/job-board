The commonly understood application of the softmax function involves converting a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution, where each element sums to one. The question of whether multiple softmax operations are applicable *along a single dimension* introduces a nuance often overlooked; it's not about applying softmax repeatedly on the same *output* of the function, but rather on *different* subsets of values within the same dimension, while maintaining an understanding of their interrelationships. In my experience designing custom neural network layers for multi-task learning scenarios, I've encountered and leveraged exactly this functionality to achieve specific output interpretations. Let me elaborate.

The core challenge arises from understanding what "along a single dimension" truly means. Consider a tensor with dimensions (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim). A typical softmax application would normalize values along the `embedding_dim`, treating each sequence element in each batch as an independent probability distribution. However, applying softmax multiple times along the `embedding_dim` wouldn’t be sequentially feeding the output back through the softmax, which is a pointless operation as it would just re-normalize the probabilities. Instead, consider the possibility of *partitioning* this `embedding_dim`, applying softmax to each partition individually, where the partitions represent distinct conceptual categories, and their output distributions hold separate meaning in the overall model. This is where the practical utility of such an operation surfaces.

I've found this particular arrangement particularly useful when building models that combine both multi-label classification and attention mechanisms, for example, where each output needs to reflect a distinct distribution. The key, therefore, lies not in successive application on the same output vector, but in the *selective application* of the softmax function across partitioned sub-vectors within the same dimension, resulting in distinct probability distributions that can then be used differently by downstream modules of the neural network architecture.

Here are three concrete code examples using Python and the PyTorch library to illustrate this concept.

**Example 1: Basic Partitioned Softmax**

This example demonstrates the most fundamental case, splitting a vector into two and applying softmax to each independently.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def partitioned_softmax(input_tensor, split_point):
  """
  Applies softmax to partitions of the last dimension.

  Args:
    input_tensor (torch.Tensor): The input tensor.
    split_point (int): The index to split the last dimension.

  Returns:
      torch.Tensor: Concatenated softmaxed tensors.
  """
  dim = input_tensor.shape[-1]
  if split_point >= dim or split_point <= 0 :
      raise ValueError("split point is out of bounds for tensor dimension.")
  
  part1 = input_tensor[..., :split_point]
  part2 = input_tensor[..., split_point:]
  
  softmaxed_part1 = F.softmax(part1, dim=-1)
  softmaxed_part2 = F.softmax(part2, dim=-1)
  
  return torch.cat([softmaxed_part1, softmaxed_part2], dim=-1)


# Example Usage
input_vector = torch.randn(1, 10) # Batch size 1, embedding dimension 10
split = 4
output_vector = partitioned_softmax(input_vector, split)

print("Input:", input_vector)
print("Output:", output_vector)
print("Sum of Part 1 Probabilities:", torch.sum(output_vector[..., :split]))
print("Sum of Part 2 Probabilities:", torch.sum(output_vector[..., split:]))

```

Here, the `partitioned_softmax` function takes an input tensor and a `split_point`. It divides the last dimension into two sub-tensors at `split_point`, applies softmax independently to each, and then concatenates the results. Note that the first four values in the output add to one, and the next six also add to one. This is our desired multiple softmax effect within one dimension. The example shows a single one dimensional input tensor, but this methodology generalizes to higher dimensions, with softmax being applied over the last dimension partitions.

**Example 2: Applying Partioned Softmax to Multiple Batches**

This demonstrates how the principle extends to tensors with batch dimensions, retaining the independent softmax application for each input within the batch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def batch_partitioned_softmax(input_tensor, split_points):
  """
  Applies softmax to partitions of the last dimension, for each element in batch.

  Args:
      input_tensor (torch.Tensor): The input tensor with shape (batch_size, ..., embedding_dim).
      split_points (list[int]): List of split points for the last dimension

  Returns:
      torch.Tensor: Concatenated softmaxed tensors with shape (batch_size, ..., embedding_dim).
  """
  if not isinstance(split_points, list) or not all(isinstance(point, int) for point in split_points):
      raise ValueError("split_points must be a list of integers.")
    
  if not all(0 < point < input_tensor.shape[-1] for point in split_points):
       raise ValueError("Split points must be positive and less than the dimension of input tensor")

  partitions = []
  start = 0
  for point in split_points:
      partitions.append(input_tensor[..., start:point])
      start = point
  partitions.append(input_tensor[..., start:])

  softmax_partitions = [F.softmax(part, dim=-1) for part in partitions]

  return torch.cat(softmax_partitions, dim=-1)

# Example usage
batch_size = 2
embedding_dimension = 10
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, embedding_dimension) # Batch size 2, embedding dimension 10
splits = [3, 7] # two points splitting into three regions
output_tensor = batch_partitioned_softmax(input_tensor, splits)

print("Input:", input_tensor)
print("Output:", output_tensor)
print("Sum of partition 1 probabilities for batch element 1:", torch.sum(output_tensor[0, :3]))
print("Sum of partition 2 probabilities for batch element 1:", torch.sum(output_tensor[0, 3:7]))
print("Sum of partition 3 probabilities for batch element 1:", torch.sum(output_tensor[0, 7:]))
print("Sum of partition 1 probabilities for batch element 2:", torch.sum(output_tensor[1, :3]))
print("Sum of partition 2 probabilities for batch element 2:", torch.sum(output_tensor[1, 3:7]))
print("Sum of partition 3 probabilities for batch element 2:", torch.sum(output_tensor[1, 7:]))

```

This `batch_partitioned_softmax` function further generalizes the concept by taking a list of `split_points`, and applies softmax across the resulting partitions on each element of a batch. Again, note that the sum of probabilities for each partition sums to one, independent of other partitions within a single sample, or even of other samples in the batch. This is critical for ensuring probability distribution behavior in each separate semantic space.

**Example 3: Applying Partioned Softmax within Custom PyTorch Layer**

Finally, it is helpful to show how this principle can be applied in a custom PyTorch layer, providing a modular and reusable component in neural network architectures.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PartitionedSoftmaxLayer(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, split_points):
    super(PartitionedSoftmaxLayer, self).__init__()
    self.split_points = split_points

  def forward(self, input_tensor):
    """
    Applies partitioned softmax to the last dimension of the input tensor.

    Args:
      input_tensor (torch.Tensor): The input tensor.

    Returns:
      torch.Tensor: Tensor with softmax applied to partitions along last dimension.
    """
    if not isinstance(self.split_points, list) or not all(isinstance(point, int) for point in self.split_points):
        raise ValueError("split_points must be a list of integers.")
      
    if not all(0 < point < input_tensor.shape[-1] for point in self.split_points):
         raise ValueError("Split points must be positive and less than the dimension of input tensor")

    partitions = []
    start = 0
    for point in self.split_points:
        partitions.append(input_tensor[..., start:point])
        start = point
    partitions.append(input_tensor[..., start:])
    
    softmax_partitions = [F.softmax(part, dim=-1) for part in partitions]

    return torch.cat(softmax_partitions, dim=-1)

# Example usage
layer = PartitionedSoftmaxLayer([3, 7])  # Define a layer with split points
input_tensor = torch.randn(2, 10) # Batch size 2, embedding dimension 10
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)

print("Input:", input_tensor)
print("Output:", output_tensor)
print("Sum of partition 1 probabilities for batch element 1:", torch.sum(output_tensor[0, :3]))
print("Sum of partition 2 probabilities for batch element 1:", torch.sum(output_tensor[0, 3:7]))
print("Sum of partition 3 probabilities for batch element 1:", torch.sum(output_tensor[0, 7:]))
print("Sum of partition 1 probabilities for batch element 2:", torch.sum(output_tensor[1, :3]))
print("Sum of partition 2 probabilities for batch element 2:", torch.sum(output_tensor[1, 3:7]))
print("Sum of partition 3 probabilities for batch element 2:", torch.sum(output_tensor[1, 7:]))

```
This `PartitionedSoftmaxLayer` class encapsulates the partitioned softmax functionality within a custom PyTorch layer. This facilitates modularity when constructing complex models that require this specific behavior for example in multi-label and attention models.  It takes a list of split points in its constructor which determines how the input tensor is split along the last dimension for the independent softmax. This is a clean approach to incorporating the partitioned softmax into any neural network built with PyTorch.

In conclusion, while the standard softmax operation is indeed defined over a single dimension, its partitioned application within a single dimension, as shown here, offers valuable functionality for creating more expressive and interpretable neural networks. It is not about applying softmax sequentially on an output, but rather applying it concurrently over strategically divided subvectors, to produce different probability distributions along that dimension. For further exploration in the field of multi-task learning, the following texts could prove insightful:  “Multi-Task Learning” by Caruana, or “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville.
