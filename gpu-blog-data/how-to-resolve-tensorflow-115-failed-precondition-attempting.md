TensorFlow 1.15's "Failed precondition: Attempting to use uninitialized value" error, encountered frequently during development, typically arises from attempting to access a TensorFlow variable before it has been properly initialized within a session. This error manifests because, unlike many other frameworks, TensorFlow does not automatically initialize variables. Initialization is an explicit step, and failing to execute this step before accessing a variable leads to the precondition violation. My experience has consistently shown this issue stemming from overlooked initialization scopes, incorrect session management, or a misunderstanding of TensorFlow's variable lifecycle.

Specifically, the error signifies that a TensorFlow `tf.Variable` object, defined within a computation graph, has been referenced before the initialization operation of that variable has been executed within a TensorFlow session. The computational graph describes the operations and data dependencies but does not, on its own, execute operations. A `tf.Session` is required for this. Without the session running the appropriate initialization operation, the variables retain their default, uninitialized states, and accessing them results in the “Failed precondition” message. This error is not an indicator of a bug in the definition of the variable or its operation; rather, it signals a failure in how the graph execution is orchestrated, specifically regarding variable initialization.

To understand this more concretely, consider a simple TensorFlow graph involving a variable `w` and an operation to use it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable 'w' with an initial value of 1.0
w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="my_variable")

# Define an operation that adds 1.0 to 'w'
increment_op = tf.add(w, 1.0)

# Attempt to run the operation (incorrectly)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    try:
        result = sess.run(increment_op)
        print(result)
    except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
        print(f"Caught error: {e}")
```

In the above example, the code defines a variable `w` and an operation that increments it. The key error here stems from the fact that `sess.run(increment_op)` is being called without initially running an operation that specifically initializes `w`. Thus, when accessing `w` as part of `increment_op`, TensorFlow throws the `FailedPreconditionError` because `w` has not been initialized yet within the context of this session. The output here would display the error message, not the expected value of 2.0.

To rectify the problem, the `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` operation must be run explicitly within the session. This operation creates an initialization operation that, when executed, assigns the initial values to all the variables in the graph. Consider this corrected example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable 'w' with an initial value of 1.0
w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="my_variable")

# Define an operation that adds 1.0 to 'w'
increment_op = tf.add(w, 1.0)

# Correctly run the operation after initializing variables.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # Initialize all variables in the graph
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    result = sess.run(increment_op)
    print(result)
```

This revised code first calls `sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())` which finds all variables in the default graph that have not yet been initialized and executes their initialization ops.  After this initialization, the code can safely use `sess.run(increment_op)` and obtain the correct result.  The output would now print “2.0”. Critically, initialization must occur *within* the session and prior to any attempts to use the variables.

Another situation where this error is commonly observed is when dealing with distinct scopes for variables. This is important when creating complex models where variables need to be grouped.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model_with_scope(name):
  with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope(name):
      w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="weight")
      b = tf.Variable(0.0, name="bias")
      return w, b

w1, b1 = create_model_with_scope("model_1")
w2, b2 = create_model_with_scope("model_2")

sum_weights = tf.add(w1, w2)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    try:
        result = sess.run(sum_weights)
        print(result)
    except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
        print(f"Caught error: {e}")

```

In the above example, two sets of variables are created within their own `variable_scope`. While these variables are distinct, the overall mechanism for initialization remains the same. It’s critical to initialize all the variables across the entire graph. If one were to only initialize a single scope of variables, any operation that uses variables from different scopes will trigger the `FailedPreconditionError`. Thus we must still initialize all variables, regardless of scope:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model_with_scope(name):
    with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope(name):
        w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="weight")
        b = tf.Variable(0.0, name="bias")
        return w, b

w1, b1 = create_model_with_scope("model_1")
w2, b2 = create_model_with_scope("model_2")

sum_weights = tf.add(w1, w2)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    result = sess.run(sum_weights)
    print(result)
```
This corrected version illustrates the crucial point: regardless of variable scopes, a single `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` is sufficient to initialize *all* variables defined in the default graph prior to running any operations.

In summary, the “Failed precondition” error in TensorFlow 1.15 highlights the importance of explicit variable initialization before usage within a session.  Correctly identifying the need for and the appropriate timing of `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` resolves the issue.

For additional information and best practices, consult the TensorFlow documentation, which provides detailed explanations of variable scoping and session management. Also review any introductory guides to TensorFlow 1.x for further clarification on the initialization process.  Further exploration of TensorFlow’s graph construction and execution models will lead to a deeper understanding of underlying mechanics, helping to avoid this kind of error during future development. Examining community resources such as Stack Overflow discussions can also offer more context and a wide variety of potential issues that might be encountered.
