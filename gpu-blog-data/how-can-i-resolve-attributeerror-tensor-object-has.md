The `AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute '_keras_shape'` in TensorFlow 1.15 stems from attempting to access the `_keras_shape` attribute on a TensorFlow `Tensor` object that wasn't created within a Keras model context.  This attribute, an internal mechanism within Keras for tracking tensor shapes during model building, is not present on general TensorFlow tensors.  My experience debugging this in large-scale image processing pipelines for a previous employer frequently highlighted this subtle mismatch between Keras's higher-level API and the underlying TensorFlow operations.  The solution invariably involves understanding where the tensor originates and adapting the code to use appropriate TensorFlow shape-related methods instead of relying on Keras-specific attributes.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow 1.15, while integrating with Keras, maintains a distinction between Keras tensors (managed within the Keras framework) and standard TensorFlow tensors (created using lower-level TensorFlow operations). Keras tensors, internally, possess the `_keras_shape` attribute to streamline shape management within models.  However, a tensor generated using `tf.constant()`, `tf.placeholder()`, or through low-level TensorFlow operations will not have this attribute.  The error arises when code, expecting a Keras tensor, encounters a standard TensorFlow tensor, leading to the attribute error.  The solution lies in replacing reliance on `_keras_shape` with methods directly available in TensorFlow for accessing tensor shapes, such as `tf.shape()`, which provides a tensor representing the shape, or `tensor.get_shape()` (though deprecated in newer TensorFlow versions, it remains functional in 1.15), which provides a `TensorShape` object.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Use of _keras_shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect approach: Trying to access _keras_shape on a TensorFlow tensor.
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
try:
    shape = tensor._keras_shape
    print(shape)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

# Correct approach using tf.shape()
correct_shape = tf.shape(tensor)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(f"Correct shape using tf.shape(): {sess.run(correct_shape)}")
```

This example directly demonstrates the problem.  The `try-except` block catches the expected `AttributeError`. The correct approach utilizes `tf.shape()`, which returns a tensor containing the shape information.  The `tf.Session().run()` is necessary to evaluate the tensor and obtain the numerical shape.

**Example 2:  Handling Shape Information in a Custom Layer**

During my work on a convolutional neural network for medical image analysis, I encountered this error when defining a custom Keras layer.  Incorrectly accessing `_keras_shape` within the layer's `call()` method resulted in the error.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect: Assuming inputs._keras_shape exists.
        # shape = inputs._keras_shape
        # ... further processing based on shape ...

        # Correct: Using tf.shape to obtain shape information.
        shape = tf.shape(inputs)
        height = shape[1]
        width = shape[2]
        # ... processing based on height and width ...
        return inputs # Placeholder return

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),  # Example Input Shape
    MyCustomLayer()
])
```

The corrected code uses `tf.shape()` to dynamically obtain the tensor dimensions within the custom layer's `call()` method, resolving the dependency on `_keras_shape`.  Note that indexing `shape` (a tensor) to obtain height and width requires knowing the input tensor structure (e.g., assuming a batch size of `shape[0]`, height at `shape[1]`, etc.).

**Example 3:  Data Preprocessing outside of Keras Model**

In another project involving time series forecasting, I encountered this error while pre-processing data before feeding it into a Keras model.  The preprocessing involved reshaping tensors using TensorFlow operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example data
data = np.random.rand(100, 20)

# Incorrect: Attempting to access _keras_shape before Keras model.
# reshaped_data = tf.reshape(data, shape=(-1, 10, 2))
# shape = reshaped_data._keras_shape

# Correct: Using tf.shape to get shape after reshaping.
reshaped_data = tf.reshape(tf.convert_to_tensor(data, dtype=tf.float32), shape=(-1, 10, 2))
shape = tf.shape(reshaped_data)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(f"Shape of reshaped tensor: {sess.run(shape)}")
```

This example shows that even if you are using TensorFlow outside of a Keras model's context, `_keras_shape` will not exist. The correct solution here uses `tf.shape()` in conjunction with `tf.convert_to_tensor()` to handle data coming from NumPy arrays (a common scenario).


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation for your specific TensorFlow version (1.15 in this case) remains the primary resource.  Pay close attention to the sections describing tensor manipulation and shape operations.  Consult the Keras documentation for TensorFlow 1.15 as well, focusing on the relationship between Keras layers and TensorFlow tensors.  Finally, explore resources related to TensorFlow's low-level APIs, particularly those related to tensor manipulation and shape inference. These resources will provide comprehensive details on various methods and their usage.  Understanding the distinction between Keras's higher-level API and TensorFlow's lower-level capabilities is crucial for avoiding this type of error.  Thorough examination of these resources will furnish the requisite knowledge to effectively manage tensor shapes within your TensorFlow 1.15 projects.
