The absence of a specified hidden size dimension in neural network architectures often stems from a misunderstanding of the fundamental role this hyperparameter plays in determining model capacity and computational cost.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale language models has highlighted this repeatedly.  The hidden size directly controls the dimensionality of the internal representation learned by the network, profoundly impacting its ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the input data.  Failing to explicitly define it leads to undefined behavior, typically manifesting as errors during model instantiation or unexpected performance.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The hidden size dimension, frequently denoted as `hidden_size` or `d_model` in code, represents the number of neurons or units in each hidden layer of a neural network.  In a feedforward neural network (like a Multilayer Perceptron), this dimension remains consistent across all hidden layers (though this isn't strictly required).  In recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs, the hidden size dictates the dimensionality of the hidden state vector maintained throughout the sequential processing.  In Transformer architectures, it defines the embedding dimension, and thus the size of the vectors representing input tokens and interacting within the attention mechanism.

The choice of hidden size is critical.  A smaller hidden size limits the network's capacity to learn intricate relationships, potentially leading to underfitting.  The model may struggle to capture the nuances in the data, resulting in poor generalization performance. Conversely, an excessively large hidden size increases the model's capacity exponentially, raising the risk of overfitting. The network might memorize the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns, thereby performing poorly on unseen data.  Furthermore, larger hidden sizes significantly increase computational demands, extending training times and potentially requiring more memory.  The optimal hidden size is highly dependent on the dataset's complexity, the network architecture, and available computational resources.  Finding it often involves experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Defining the model with explicit hidden size
model = MLP(input_size=10, hidden_size=64, output_size=2)  # 64 is the hidden size
```

In this example, the `hidden_size` parameter (set to 64) explicitly defines the number of neurons in the single hidden layer.  Altering this value directly affects the model's capacity and computational load.  During model instantiation, an undefined `hidden_size` would raise an error because the `nn.Linear` layers need this information to determine their weight matrix dimensions.

**Example 2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=64, input_length=100), #64 is the hidden size here (embedding dimension)
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=False), #128 is the hidden size of the LSTM layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

Here, the hidden size is specified in two places:  the embedding layer (`output_dim=64`) defines the dimension of the word embeddings, which acts as the initial hidden state for the LSTM, while  `units=128` in the LSTM layer sets the dimensionality of the hidden state vector maintained by the LSTM.  The lack of either would result in a poorly defined network architecture, preventing compilation and execution. This underscores the importance of defining this parameter in all layers where it is relevant.

**Example 3:  Transformer Encoder Layer (Conceptual PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerEncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, nhead): # d_model is the hidden size
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, nhead)
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)

    def forward(self, src):
        src2 = self.self_attn(src, src, src)[0]
        src = src + self.dropout(src2)
        src = self.norm1(src)
        src2 = self.linear2(self.dropout(self.linear1(src)))
        src = src + self.dropout(src2)
        src = self.norm2(src)
        return src

# Instantiate with hidden size
encoder_layer = TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=512, nhead=8) # 512 is the hidden size
```

This illustrates a simplified Transformer encoder layer.  `d_model` directly specifies the hidden size, influencing the dimensionality of the input embeddings, attention matrices, and the output of linear transformations.  Without this explicit declaration, the attention mechanism and linear layers cannot be properly initialized, rendering the model unusable.  My prior experience with building large-scale transformers reinforced the absolute need for correctly defining this parameter.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Deep Learning textbooks by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; and by Nielsen.
*   Research papers on Transformer architectures (Attention is All You Need, etc.).
*   Comprehensive documentation for deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow).  Careful study of the API documentation for each layer is crucial.  Pay close attention to the expected input and output shapes.  The documentation will clearly outline any necessary hyperparameters, including the hidden size.


In conclusion, the missing hidden size dimension isn't merely a minor oversight; it represents a fundamental architectural deficiency.  Explicitly defining this crucial hyperparameter ensures the proper initialization and functionality of neural networks, preventing errors and enabling effective model training and evaluation.  Understanding its impact on model capacity and computational cost is vital for building robust and efficient deep learning models.  My extensive work across various network architectures emphasizes the consistent importance of correctly setting this crucial hyperparameter.
