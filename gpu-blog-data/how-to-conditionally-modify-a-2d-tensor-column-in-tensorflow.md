In TensorFlow, modifying a specific column of a 2D tensor based on a condition requires careful consideration of indexing and tensor operations. Standard Python indexing, while intuitive for lists and NumPy arrays, doesnâ€™t translate directly to TensorFlow's symbolic tensors. I've encountered this issue numerous times while implementing custom loss functions and manipulating image batches where specific pixel channels needed conditional adjustments, and the solution involves a combination of `tf.where`, boolean masks, and element-wise operations.

**Explanation:**

The challenge arises from the fact that TensorFlow tensors are immutable. We cannot directly modify the elements in-place. Instead, we construct a new tensor by selectively copying elements from the original tensor or applying modifications based on a conditional mask. The core approach involves three steps:

1. **Creating a Boolean Mask:** First, we need a boolean tensor with the same shape as the column we intend to modify. This mask indicates which rows should have their column values modified. The condition itself can be based on values in other columns or external criteria, resulting in a tensor of `True` and `False` values.

2. **Generating Modified Column:** We then create a new tensor column containing the modified values. This column will have the same shape as the original column. The modification is often performed using element-wise mathematical operations on the original column and or other tensors, while we may also directly specify values. This new column only includes values that we want to replace into the targeted column position.

3. **Conditional Replacement:** Finally, we use `tf.where` to select values from the modified column where the mask is `True`, and keep the original values from the original column where the mask is `False`. `tf.where` takes the mask as its first argument, followed by a value tensor to choose from when the mask is true, and a second value tensor to choose from when the mask is false. We then use tensor slicing and `tf.stack` or `tf.concat` to replace the original column with the modified one inside the original matrix.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incrementing values based on another column**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditionally_modify_column_example_1(tensor, column_index, condition_column_index, threshold, increment):
    """
    Conditionally increments values in a column based on a threshold in another column.
    """
    # 1. Create Boolean Mask
    condition_mask = tf.greater(tensor[:, condition_column_index], threshold)

    # 2. Generate Modified Column
    original_column = tensor[:, column_index]
    modified_column = tf.where(condition_mask, original_column + increment, original_column)
    # Note that we only have values that should go into the modified column

    # 3. Conditional Replacement
    num_cols = tensor.shape[1]
    all_cols = []
    for col_i in range(num_cols):
      if col_i == column_index:
        all_cols.append(modified_column)
      else:
        all_cols.append(tensor[:, col_i])
    modified_tensor = tf.stack(all_cols, axis=1)

    return modified_tensor

# Test
tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                     [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                     [7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
                     [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

modified_tensor = conditionally_modify_column_example_1(tensor, 1, 0, 5.0, 5.0)
print("Example 1:")
print(modified_tensor)

```

In this example, we increment values in column 1 if the corresponding value in column 0 is greater than 5. The `condition_mask` uses `tf.greater` to create a mask where values in the 0th column exceed a threshold. The `modified_column` is where we apply the increase. We then reconstruct the entire tensor with the modified column.

**Example 2: Replacing values based on a fixed condition**

```python
def conditionally_modify_column_example_2(tensor, column_index, target_index, target_value, replacement_value):
    """
    Replaces values in a column if the values in the target column is equal to the target_value.
    """
    # 1. Create Boolean Mask
    condition_mask = tf.equal(tensor[:, target_index], target_value)

    # 2. Generate Modified Column
    original_column = tensor[:, column_index]
    modified_column = tf.where(condition_mask, tf.fill(tf.shape(original_column), replacement_value), original_column)
    # Note that we are filling the values we want to replace into with replacement_value.

    # 3. Conditional Replacement
    num_cols = tensor.shape[1]
    all_cols = []
    for col_i in range(num_cols):
      if col_i == column_index:
        all_cols.append(modified_column)
      else:
        all_cols.append(tensor[:, col_i])
    modified_tensor = tf.stack(all_cols, axis=1)

    return modified_tensor

# Test
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],
                     [4, 5, 6],
                     [3, 8, 9],
                     [1, 11, 12]], dtype=tf.int32)

modified_tensor = conditionally_modify_column_example_2(tensor, 2, 0, 1, -1)
print("\nExample 2:")
print(modified_tensor)

```
Here, if any value in column 0 is equal to 1, we replace the corresponding value in column 2 with -1.  `tf.equal` creates the mask comparing the target values, and `tf.fill` generates a tensor with the replacement values, so that we replace the original values with the replacement values based on the mask.

**Example 3: Modifying values based on an external mask**

```python
def conditionally_modify_column_example_3(tensor, column_index, external_mask, replacement_values):
  """
    Modifies values based on an external boolean mask.
  """
  # 1. Use External Mask directly
  condition_mask = external_mask
  
  # 2. Generate Modified Column
  original_column = tensor[:, column_index]
  modified_column = tf.where(condition_mask, replacement_values, original_column)
  # Note that we need to have the same shape for the replacement values as the original column

  # 3. Conditional Replacement
  num_cols = tensor.shape[1]
  all_cols = []
  for col_i in range(num_cols):
    if col_i == column_index:
      all_cols.append(modified_column)
    else:
      all_cols.append(tensor[:, col_i])
  modified_tensor = tf.stack(all_cols, axis=1)

  return modified_tensor
  
# Test
tensor = tf.constant([[10, 20, 30],
                     [40, 50, 60],
                     [70, 80, 90],
                     [100, 110, 120]], dtype=tf.int32)

external_mask = tf.constant([True, False, True, False], dtype=tf.bool)
replacement_values = tf.constant([1000, 2000], dtype=tf.int32)
modified_tensor = conditionally_modify_column_example_3(tensor, 2, external_mask, replacement_values)
print("\nExample 3:")
print(modified_tensor)
```
This example demonstrates the case where the mask is determined externally, such as the outcome of a complex calculation. We also demonstrate how to incorporate a `replacement_values` tensor with specific values to be replaced based on the mask. Note the need for the correct shape.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of tensor manipulation and conditional operations in TensorFlow, I recommend the official TensorFlow documentation.  Specifically, the sections on `tf.where`, `tf.boolean_mask`, basic tensor slicing, `tf.stack`, `tf.concat`, `tf.shape` are foundational.  Additionally, working through examples of image processing or data manipulation in the TensorFlow tutorials will further reinforce these concepts. A study of how broadcasting rules apply in element-wise operation is also helpful in determining how different shape tensors interact. While there is no official comprehensive book, there are many community guides and tutorials, such as the ones on the TensorFlow website, which can be valuable for building proficiency. Finally, regular experimentation with different tensor shapes, conditions, and operations is crucial for developing an intuitive grasp of these techniques.
