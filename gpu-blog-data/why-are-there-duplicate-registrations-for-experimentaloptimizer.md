The presence of duplicate registrations for an entity like `experimentalOptimizer` typically indicates a flawed initialization process or an underlying issue within a complex system's dependency management. Specifically, I've encountered this scenario multiple times, most notably while working on a distributed machine learning platform where different modules, running independently but sharing a common configuration schema, each attempted to register the same optimizer under the same name. This resulted in an unpredictable override of the original implementation or, more commonly, thrown exceptions upon subsequent retrieval.

The core problem stems from how registration mechanisms, such as those used in service locators or dependency injection frameworks, manage uniquely identified entities. When a system calls a registration function, it usually stores a reference to an object or a class within an internal mapping, using a predefined name or key. This mapping is essentially a dictionary or hash table. If registration is not handled with proper context-awareness or thread safety, the following sequence of events can easily occur: two different parts of the application, or even the same part under different invocation cycles, attempts to register an implementation against the same key (`experimentalOptimizer`). If no check for pre-existing registrations occurs, or if these checks are not performed atomically, this leads to the latter registration either overwriting the former or causing an error due to a constraint on uniqueness. This issue is particularly exacerbated in systems using dynamic loading of modules or plugins where the order of initialization becomes critical. Moreover, lazy evaluation combined with lack of proper scoping can cause similar effects, where duplicate registration attempts are performed before any instantiation process and before any explicit check of prior registration.

The problem can manifest itself in several variations. First, each module may independently attempt to create and register an instance of the optimizer, believing it's operating within a silo and unaware of existing registrations. Second, a global configuration may inadvertently trigger multiple registrations if it is loaded more than once or by different threads in parallel, without a proper lock. Lastly, a module may be inadvertently reloaded or re-instantiated multiple times, causing the same registration code to be executed repeatedly. These issues, at their core, are often a symptom of improperly isolated contexts or missing thread synchronization, exacerbated by complex loading dependencies. Let me illustrate the problem and potential solutions with code examples:

**Example 1: Illustrating Duplicate Registration Without Checks**

This first code example shows a simplified version of the problem using a global dictionary as the registration mechanism.

```python
_registry = {}

def register_optimizer(name, optimizer_class):
    _registry[name] = optimizer_class

class AdamOptimizer:
    pass

class SGD:
    pass

def main():
    register_optimizer("experimentalOptimizer", AdamOptimizer)
    register_optimizer("experimentalOptimizer", SGD)
    print(_registry)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This python script will overwrite the original AdamOptimizer with SGD. If you were to access experimentalOptimizer later it would return the last value registered, which may not be desired. This is a basic manifestation of the problem. No validation is being performed on the registration process; It simply overwrites the value stored under the experimentalOptimizer key.

**Example 2: Adding a Check Before Registration**

To mitigate duplicate registrations, one should add a validation step before registration. The modified script is shown below.

```python
_registry = {}

def register_optimizer(name, optimizer_class):
    if name not in _registry:
        _registry[name] = optimizer_class
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Optimizer {name} already registered.")


class AdamOptimizer:
    pass

class SGD:
    pass

def main():
    try:
        register_optimizer("experimentalOptimizer", AdamOptimizer)
        register_optimizer("experimentalOptimizer", SGD)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Registration Error: {e}")

    print(_registry)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this modified code, the `register_optimizer` function checks if the optimizer has already been registered. If it has, it raises a `ValueError`, preventing unintended overwrites. This simple check can prevent many issues where registrations are performed multiple times, in different locations in code. This however does not deal with the complexities of multithreading, where two threads may simultaneously check that a value does not exist, then proceed with registration, overwriting each other despite using a prior check.

**Example 3: Using a Lock for Thread-Safe Registration**

The following example illustrates how to create a thread-safe registration mechanism that uses a lock to ensure no race conditions occur in a multithreaded environment.

```python
import threading

_registry = {}
_registry_lock = threading.Lock()

def register_optimizer(name, optimizer_class):
    with _registry_lock:
      if name not in _registry:
            _registry[name] = optimizer_class
      else:
          raise ValueError(f"Optimizer {name} already registered.")

class AdamOptimizer:
    pass

class SGD:
    pass

def main():
    threads = []
    def register_task():
      try:
        register_optimizer("experimentalOptimizer", AdamOptimizer)
        register_optimizer("experimentalOptimizer", SGD)
      except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Thread Registration Error: {e}")


    for _ in range(2): #launch 2 threads
       thread = threading.Thread(target=register_task)
       threads.append(thread)
       thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
      thread.join()

    print(_registry)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here, the `_registry_lock` object ensures that only one thread at a time can access and modify the registry. This prevents race conditions during registration, making the process thread-safe. The lock prevents two threads from simultaneously executing code that attempts to check for registration, and then register, which was a potential flaw in the previous check. This method ensures that the registry remains consistent in concurrent environments.

Debugging duplicated registrations often requires a system-wide view of how different components are loaded and initialized. Strategies like careful module dependency management, rigorous unit and integration testing that specifically targets registration logic, and verbose logging of registration events are invaluable. Also, utilizing robust configuration management tools that have built-in conflict resolution is an excellent approach. The most effective solution though lies in designing an architecture where registration conflicts are either prevented through explicit module loading and control mechanisms or are gracefully handled, using techniques such as the checks described above.

In addition to the code examples, further techniques such as using a dependency injection container with proper scope management can address this. Understanding the principles behind service location, singleton patterns, and how multithreading affects shared state is imperative when working with systems that have a complex dependency tree. When dealing with plugin or component based systems, you may need to ensure that the initialization order of each component is specified, to avoid conflicts when registering the same names for different classes. Documentation for the dependency injection framework being used is an excellent resource. Also, research into the specifics of how modules are loaded for that particular project can often provide more specific information on where duplication originates from.
