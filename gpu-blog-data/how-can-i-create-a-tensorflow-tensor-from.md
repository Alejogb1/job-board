TensorFlow's core strength lies in its manipulation of tensors, multi-dimensional arrays that represent data within a computational graph. A common operation when building machine learning models is creating new tensors based on existing ones. This process, while seemingly straightforward, requires careful consideration of data types, shapes, and computational implications, especially when dealing with large datasets.

I have personally encountered this situation repeatedly, both during my early deep learning research using TensorFlow 1.x and in more recent deployments utilizing TensorFlow 2.x with eager execution. The methods used to create a new tensor from an existing one vary, and it is essential to select the approach appropriate to the specific transformation you need. Let's explore the primary techniques.

The simplest method involves creating a new tensor with the same content as the source but potentially changing the data type. This is achieved using the `tf.cast` function. It creates a tensor of the target dtype by copying the values of the input tensor. This avoids unnecessary computation if you are only interested in changing how the data is interpreted. I have found this incredibly useful when converting integer feature vectors to floating-point values before feeding them into a neural network layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example: Casting an integer tensor to float
original_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.int32)
casted_tensor = tf.cast(original_tensor, dtype=tf.float32)

print(f"Original Tensor: {original_tensor}, Dtype: {original_tensor.dtype}")
print(f"Casted Tensor: {casted_tensor}, Dtype: {casted_tensor.dtype}")

# Output:
# Original Tensor: tf.Tensor([1 2 3], shape=(3,), dtype=int32), Dtype: <dtype: 'int32'>
# Casted Tensor: tf.Tensor([1. 2. 3.], shape=(3,), dtype=float32), Dtype: <dtype: 'float32'>
```

In the above snippet, the `original_tensor`, an integer tensor, is converted to `casted_tensor` with floating-point values. The numerical content remains identical, but the data type is altered. Crucially, the original tensor remains unchanged; `tf.cast` creates a new tensor. This immutability, characteristic of tensors, prevents unintended side effects in larger codebases.

Another approach involves reshaping the tensor. The `tf.reshape` function can re-arrange the dimensions of the data but crucially maintains the underlying data values. When working with convolutional layers or recurrent networks, adjusting the shape of the input is a common step. I have frequently used reshaping to flatten activation outputs or to introduce a batch dimension before feeding data through a specific layer.

```python
# Example: Reshaping a tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.int32)
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(original_tensor, [1, 2, 2])

print(f"Original Tensor:\n {original_tensor}, Shape: {original_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped Tensor:\n {reshaped_tensor}, Shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")

# Output:
# Original Tensor:
#  tf.Tensor(
#  [[1 2]
#   [3 4]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32), Shape: (2, 2)
# Reshaped Tensor:
#  tf.Tensor(
#  [[[1 2]
#    [3 4]]], shape=(1, 2, 2), dtype=int32), Shape: (1, 2, 2)
```

Notice how the `original_tensor` with a shape of (2, 2) is transformed into a `reshaped_tensor` with shape (1, 2, 2). All the original values are kept and their arrangement in memory is altered according to the new shape definition. It is crucial that the total number of elements in the original tensor remains consistent with the newly specified shape. An incorrect shape provided to `tf.reshape` will cause an error.

The most versatile method I've employed extensively is creating a tensor from existing data using mathematical or logical transformations. TensorFlow offers a wide array of operations including `tf.add`, `tf.subtract`, `tf.multiply`, `tf.divide`, as well as various logical operations that allow you to create new tensors based on the contents of the original ones. This allows for complex manipulation of data within the graph, which is important for constructing custom model layers or manipulating model outputs.

```python
# Example: Transforming a tensor using addition and boolean masking
original_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=tf.int32)
mask = original_tensor > 2
transformed_tensor = tf.add(original_tensor, 1)
masked_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(transformed_tensor, mask)

print(f"Original Tensor: {original_tensor}")
print(f"Mask: {mask}")
print(f"Transformed Tensor: {transformed_tensor}")
print(f"Masked Tensor: {masked_tensor}")

# Output:
# Original Tensor: tf.Tensor([1 2 3 4 5], shape=(5,), dtype=int32)
# Mask: tf.Tensor([False False  True  True  True], shape=(5,), dtype=bool)
# Transformed Tensor: tf.Tensor([2 3 4 5 6], shape=(5,), dtype=int32)
# Masked Tensor: tf.Tensor([4 5 6], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
```

Here, we start with `original_tensor`, add 1 to each element, creating a `transformed_tensor`, and then use a boolean mask (derived from the original tensor’s values) to extract selected values from the `transformed_tensor` into the `masked_tensor`. This demonstrates the powerful capacity for creating complex computational expressions by combining multiple tensor operations.

These three examples demonstrate the common techniques I use for creating new tensors from existing ones: `tf.cast`, `tf.reshape`, and utilizing mathematical/logical operations. These tools, while seemingly simple, are fundamental when working with TensorFlow and offer flexibility when working with various models.

For further exploration and a more complete understanding of tensor operations, I recommend referring to the official TensorFlow documentation. Specifically, the guides on "Tensors" and "Tensor Transformations" can provide a comprehensive overview. In addition, exploring practical examples found in the official TensorFlow tutorials focused on image classification or natural language processing can solidify comprehension by showing these operations in context. Similarly, “Effective TensorFlow 2” is beneficial for a hands on approach to building pipelines. Learning by doing is key to solidifying your grasp of these concepts.
