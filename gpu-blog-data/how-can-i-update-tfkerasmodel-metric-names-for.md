The challenge of dynamically updating metric names within a custom multi-layered metric function in `tf.keras.Model` stems from the inherent design of TensorFlow's metric system, where metric names are typically defined statically during model compilation or via the `add_metric` API call, not during the metric computation itself. The underlying issue is that custom metric functions often involve intermediary computations which could benefit from being exposed as their own named metrics, but `tf.keras` doesn't natively provide a mechanism for naming these sub-results within a function. I've encountered this while developing a complex neural network involving multi-stage loss calculations where each stage's performance needed to be individually monitored and tracked.

The core problem is that `tf.keras.metrics.Mean` and similar metrics classes that accumulate values don't inherently support hierarchical or dynamic name creation. When a custom function performs several calculations, resulting in multiple values you'd want to monitor, directly creating separate `tf.keras.metrics.Mean` instances within the function, and attempting to assign them dynamically generated names, proves problematic. These metric instances need to be associated with the model and its variables before they are used in the `call` method, which is too late to generate names based on computation flow. The metric names are fixed at the point they are registered during the construction of the layer, or the model.

To address this, I've developed a technique that leverages the power of `tf.keras.Model.add_metric` in conjunction with naming conventions established prior to calling the metric function. This involves defining placeholder names during layer or model instantiation and passing a naming dictionary along with the predictions and target during the model's `call` function, then employing those placeholders to dynamically associate accumulated means with names defined in that dictionary.

Let's delve into three code examples that demonstrate how this can be achieved.

**Example 1: Basic Metric Naming with Add Metric**

This example illustrates a simple custom metric function that calculates both the mean of two intermediary values as well as the mean of a final result, using `tf.keras.metrics.Mean`, and registering those mean with names provided from an external dictionary passed into the function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')


    def custom_metric_function(self, y_true, y_pred, metric_names):
        interm_1 = tf.reduce_mean(y_pred * 0.5)
        interm_2 = tf.reduce_mean(y_pred * 0.25)
        final_result = interm_1 + interm_2

        # Register placeholder metrics with initial values of zero.
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["interm_1"])
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["interm_2"])
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["final_result"])
        
        # Update the accumulated values of these metrics
        self.get_metric(metric_names["interm_1"]).update_state(interm_1)
        self.get_metric(metric_names["interm_2"]).update_state(interm_2)
        self.get_metric(metric_names["final_result"]).update_state(final_result)

        return final_result  # Return final loss/output

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        y_pred = self.dense2(x)

        metric_names = {"interm_1": "interm_1_metric", "interm_2": "interm_2_metric", "final_result": "combined_metric"}
        _ = self.custom_metric_function(y_true=0.0, y_pred=y_pred, metric_names=metric_names)

        return y_pred

# Sample Data
x_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 10))

# Instantiate the Model
model = MyModel()

# Execute the Model
y_pred = model(x_input)
metrics = model.metrics
# Print the collected Metric Names
for metric in metrics:
    print(metric.name)
```

In this code, during the `call` function, a `metric_names` dictionary is created. Within the `custom_metric_function`, this dictionary is passed and, in the initial run, placeholder metrics with the designated names are registered with `add_metric`. For each subsequent call, existing metrics are located via their name by means of `get_metric` and their values are updated with the calculated results. This allows to use the function in a way that the metrics are computed after the tensor calculations. Note that the `y_true` argument is not required for calculating the metrics in this function, so a dummy value is passed in, which can be important in some metric calculation use-cases.

**Example 2: Hierarchical Metric Naming**

This example demonstrates hierarchical naming, using dot notation to create nested metric names, which can be useful for organizing complex metric data in experiment tracking.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class HierarchicalModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')


    def custom_metric_function(self, y_true, y_pred, metric_names):
        interm_1 = tf.reduce_mean(y_pred * 0.5)
        interm_2 = tf.reduce_mean(y_pred * 0.25)
        final_result = interm_1 + interm_2

        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["interm_1"])
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["interm_2"])
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["final_result"])


        self.get_metric(metric_names["interm_1"]).update_state(interm_1)
        self.get_metric(metric_names["interm_2"]).update_state(interm_2)
        self.get_metric(metric_names["final_result"]).update_state(final_result)

        return final_result


    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        y_pred = self.dense2(x)
        
        metric_names = {"interm_1": "stage_1.interm_1", "interm_2": "stage_1.interm_2", "final_result": "stage_1.combined"}
        _ = self.custom_metric_function(y_true=0.0, y_pred=y_pred, metric_names=metric_names)


        return y_pred


# Sample Data
x_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 10))

# Instantiate the Model
model = HierarchicalModel()

# Execute the Model
y_pred = model(x_input)
metrics = model.metrics
# Print the collected Metric Names
for metric in metrics:
    print(metric.name)
```
By using hierarchical naming such as `'stage_1.interm_1'` within the dictionary, the metrics can now be referenced with a dot operator, which enables intuitive logging and display when the model is evaluated. The names given when creating `tf.keras.metrics.Mean` are important for correctly updating the values of the collected metric.

**Example 3: Integration with Model Training Loop**

The final example illustrates how these dynamically named metrics integrate into a custom training loop. This underscores the fact that metrics are updated during both training and validation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class TrainingModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')

    def custom_metric_function(self, y_true, y_pred, metric_names):
        interm_1 = tf.reduce_mean(y_pred * 0.5)
        interm_2 = tf.reduce_mean(y_pred * 0.25)
        final_result = interm_1 + interm_2

        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["interm_1"])
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["interm_2"])
        self.add_metric(0.0, name=metric_names["final_result"])


        self.get_metric(metric_names["interm_1"]).update_state(interm_1)
        self.get_metric(metric_names["interm_2"]).update_state(interm_2)
        self.get_metric(metric_names["final_result"]).update_state(final_result)

        return final_result

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        y_pred = self.dense2(x)
        metric_names = {"interm_1": "train_stage.interm_1", "interm_2": "train_stage.interm_2", "final_result": "train_stage.combined"}
        _ = self.custom_metric_function(y_true=0.0, y_pred=y_pred, metric_names=metric_names)
        return y_pred

# Sample Data
x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 1), minval=0, maxval=1, dtype=tf.float32)

x_val = tf.random.normal(shape=(20, 10))
y_val = tf.random.uniform(shape=(20, 1), minval=0, maxval=1, dtype=tf.float32)

# Instantiate the Model and optimizer
model = TrainingModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Custom Training Loop
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x_train, training=True)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_train, y_pred))

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

    # Validation phase
    val_pred = model(x_val, training=False)
    val_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_val, val_pred))

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
    print(f"Train Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}")
    for metric in model.metrics:
      print(f"  {metric.name}: {metric.result().numpy():.4f}")
    
    print(f"Val Loss: {val_loss.numpy():.4f}")

    # Reset state for next epoch
    model.reset_metrics()
```
During the training loop, model metrics are updated during training using gradient tape and also during validation. Note that after each epoch the metrics need to be reset so as to avoid averaging across epochs. It is also important that the same `metric_names` are used when calculating the metrics for each time `custom_metric_function` is called within the training loop or validation.

By using this methodology you can create dynamically named metrics that allows you to monitor complex computations within custom metric functions in a manner that integrates seemlessly with `tf.keras` models and training loops.

For further exploration and deeper understanding of the concepts demonstrated above, I suggest examining the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.Model`, particularly the methods related to metrics, and `tf.keras.metrics`, focusing on custom metric implementation. Resources like the TensorFlow tutorials can also provide practical hands-on guidance. Researching blog posts and articles that describe model customization using `tf.keras` will complement practical examples provided here. While some sources may not directly address this specific naming challenge, understanding the core components of the `tf.keras` API will help adapt these techniques to individual projects.
