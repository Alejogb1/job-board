A core distinction in PyTorch tensor manipulation lies in memory layout, not solely in shape transformations, directly impacting the continuity of the underlying data storage. This distinction clarifies why transposing a tensor often results in a non-contiguous tensor, while an equivalent shape change achieved with `view` typically preserves continuity. I've encountered this issue countless times when optimizing model training and deployment, and the behavior, though initially confusing, stems from fundamental differences in how these operations are implemented at a low level.

The crucial factor is that `transpose` swaps axes, which usually disrupts the natural linear ordering of elements in memory. A tensor in PyTorch is stored as a contiguous block in memory, conceptually a one-dimensional sequence. For example, a 2x3 tensor with values `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` is stored as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The stride, which tells you how many memory locations to skip when moving along an axis, reflects this storage arrangement. In the example above, the stride would be (3, 1), meaning you move 3 positions in memory to go to the next row and 1 position to move to the next column.

When you `transpose` this tensor to a 3x2 shape, the data remains in the same memory location as before. However, the stride changes. It becomes (1, 3) and accessing the transposed elements would require jumping around in that same linear memory block. The resulting logical structure is 3 rows of 2, but because the data was originally row-major in memory, the transposed view is accessing elements that were not next to each other in the linear storage sequence. This creates a non-contiguous tensor.

Conversely, `view` attempts to reconstruct the stride and shape, trying to fit the data to a new structure, without data reordering, whenever possible. If the requested view maintains the logical contiguous nature of the original tensor's data in memory, then the resulting tensor will also be contiguous. If it does not, `view` might cause the tensor to be non-contiguous or throw an exception, depending on how the tensor was created. When the new shape is logically equivalent (meaning it does not jump around in the linear storage sequence), the `view` will usually succeed with a contiguous result. This difference is a consequence of the different intentions behind these operators. `Transpose` operates fundamentally at the axis level, whereas `view` at the data storage level.

Let's illustrate with three code examples:

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Basic Transpose and Contiguity
tensor1 = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Original tensor1:", tensor1)
print("Contiguous:", tensor1.is_contiguous())

transposed_tensor1 = tensor1.transpose(0, 1)
print("Transposed tensor1:", transposed_tensor1)
print("Contiguous:", transposed_tensor1.is_contiguous())


# Example 2: View and Contiguity on the same original tensor
viewed_tensor1 = tensor1.view(3, 2)
print("Viewed tensor1:", viewed_tensor1)
print("Contiguous:", viewed_tensor1.is_contiguous())


# Example 3: Creating a Non-Contiguous Initial Tensor and Attempting View
tensor2 = torch.arange(12).reshape(2, 2, 3)
transposed_tensor2 = tensor2.transpose(1, 2) # Making it non-contiguous
print("Transposed tensor2:", transposed_tensor2)
print("Contiguous:", transposed_tensor2.is_contiguous())
try:
    viewed_tensor2 = transposed_tensor2.view(3, 4) #Attempt to use view on the non-contiguous tensor.
    print("Viewed tensor2", viewed_tensor2)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Runtime Error", e)

contiguous_tensor2 = transposed_tensor2.contiguous() # Creating a copy with contiguous memory layout
print("contiguous_tensor2", contiguous_tensor2)
viewed_tensor2 = contiguous_tensor2.view(3, 4)
print("Viewed_tensor2", viewed_tensor2)
print("Contiguous:", viewed_tensor2.is_contiguous())

```

**Commentary on Example 1**: Here we create a basic 2x3 tensor and transpose it to 3x2. The original tensor is contiguous. However, the transposed tensor is reported as non-contiguous because elements are no longer stored sequentially according to how they are accessed after axis swapping, despite having the exact same linear storage.

**Commentary on Example 2**:  Using the same original tensor, we create a `view` that changes its shape to 3x2. This results in a contiguous tensor because PyTorch's underlying logic recognizes that it can use the existing linear storage sequence to construct the new view without requiring element re-arrangement. The elements remain in the same memory positions, so this view is possible while preserving contiguity.

**Commentary on Example 3**: The scenario becomes more complex here. We initially create a 3D tensor and apply a transpose, rendering it non-contiguous. Attempting to apply `view` to this non-contiguous tensor will trigger a RuntimeError, because it is not possible to reshape the current underlying data storage layout using only `view`. The RuntimeError indicates that PyTorch detects it cannot fulfill a `view` without a memory copy. We then use `.contiguous()` to create a new contiguous copy of the non-contiguous tensor, which is now re-ordered in memory, and then attempt the view, which succeeds because the data has been reordered to allow the new view without changing the linear storage.

In practice, the non-contiguous status of a tensor can affect performance and compatibility with certain PyTorch functions, particularly low-level or optimized implementations. Operations like matrix multiplications might require the input tensors to be contiguous. In such cases, one must explicitly create a contiguous copy of the tensor using `.contiguous()` to avoid errors or unexpected performance bottlenecks. However, creating a copy involves a memory allocation and data transfer, which is an overhead compared to operations using contiguous tensors.

To further understand the interplay between memory layout and tensor operations, reviewing the documentation for `torch.Tensor.stride()`, and exploring related discussions on memory optimization in deep learning frameworks can prove beneficial. Works on tensor optimization for high performance numerical libraries often offer deeper technical understanding. The source code of PyTorch itself can be a valuable but complex resource for the most detailed understanding of this behavior. Specifically, the sections related to the memory management for tensors should be of interest. Exploring more advanced topics, like understanding how certain operation calls are converted into optimized implementations by PyTorch, can deepen your expertise. This often involves inspecting some C++ code, which is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is essential for gaining a comprehensive grasp of the subject. The official PyTorch documentation offers explanations of strides, layouts and how they impact the view function, these documents can be found on the PyTorch official website under the documentation section. Additionally, several discussions on PyTorch's forums and other online resources delve into the intricacies of contiguous vs. non-contiguous tensors and their performance implications, all available via simple online search.
