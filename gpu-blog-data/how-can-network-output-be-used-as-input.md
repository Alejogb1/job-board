Network output used as input for subsequent time steps is a core concept in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, particularly LSTMs and GRUs.  My experience developing time-series forecasting models for financial applications heavily relies on this principle.  The crucial insight here is that unlike feedforward networks which process data in a single pass, these recurrent architectures maintain an internal state that's updated at each time step, allowing information from previous outputs to influence future predictions.  This ability to learn temporal dependencies is fundamental to their success in sequential data processing.

This process, often termed "feedback" or "recurrent connection," is implemented through the network's architecture.  The output at time *t* (denoted *y<sub>t</sub>*) is not only passed to the loss function for training but is also fed back into the network as part of the input at time *t+1*.  This feedback loop allows the network to maintain context and avoid losing information from earlier time steps.  The exact mechanism of this feedback varies depending on the specific RNN architecture.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental mechanics involve modifying the input vector at each time step.  A standard feedforward network receives an input vector *x<sub>t</sub>* at time *t*. In contrast, an RNN incorporates both *x<sub>t</sub>* and the previous output *y<sub>t-1</sub>* (or a transformation thereof). This combined input is then used to calculate the hidden state *h<sub>t</sub>* and the output *y<sub>t</sub>*.  The equation representing this can be simplified as:

*h<sub>t</sub> = f(W<sub>xh</sub> * x<sub>t</sub> + W<sub>hh</sub> * h<sub>t-1</sub> + b<sub>h</sub>)*

*y<sub>t</sub> = g(W<sub>hy</sub> * h<sub>t</sub> + b<sub>y</sub>)*

where:

* *x<sub>t</sub>* is the input vector at time *t*
* *h<sub>t</sub>* is the hidden state at time *t*
* *y<sub>t</sub>* is the output vector at time *t*
* *W<sub>xh</sub>*, *W<sub>hh</sub>*, and *W<sub>hy</sub>* are weight matrices
* *b<sub>h</sub>* and *b<sub>y</sub>* are bias vectors
* *f* and *g* are activation functions (e.g., tanh, sigmoid, ReLU)

Note that *h<sub>t-1</sub>*, the hidden state from the previous time step, acts as a memory of past inputs and outputs.  This is how the network effectively "remembers" past information.  The specific design of the activation functions and weight matrices allows the network to learn complex temporal relationships.   LSTMs and GRUs refine this basic mechanism through gate mechanisms that control the flow of information, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem often encountered in standard RNNs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the concept using TensorFlow/Keras.  These are simplified demonstrations and might require adjustments based on specific data and network architecture.

**Example 1: Simple RNN**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data - needs to be reshaped for time series
data = ... #your time series data.  Shape (samples, timesteps, features)
model.fit(data, data) #Using data as target for simplicity of demonstration.

# Predict on new sequence:  Output from previous step is used as input to the next
prediction = model.predict(initial_input) #initial_input is the starting input sequence.
for i in range(future_steps):
    prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(prediction[-1], axis=0))  #Take last timestep output as new input
    #Append prediction to final result

```

This example demonstrates a simple RNN with `return_sequences=True`.  This ensures the model returns the output for every time step, allowing the feedback mechanism. The prediction loop showcases how the previous prediction is fed back in to generate future predictions.  In real world scenarios, a more sophisticated data handling approach would be necessary for efficient processing and realistic prediction.

**Example 2: LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Data preprocessing similar to above.
model.fit(data, data)

#Prediction loop similar to Example 1
```

This uses an LSTM, a more sophisticated RNN architecture better suited for handling long-term dependencies. The structure remains essentially the same, leveraging the return_sequences parameter.  The internal gating mechanisms within the LSTM handle the context information more effectively than a simple RNN.

**Example 3:  Autoregressive Model with GRU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Assuming data is preprocessed:  Data should be shifted to have previous values predict the next
model.fit(X_train, y_train) # X_train will include lagged values of the target variable.

#Prediction loop requiring handling of state.
initial_state = model.layers[0].get_initial_state(np.expand_dims(X_train[0],axis=0))
prediction, state = model.predict(X_train[0], initial_state=initial_state)
for i in range(future_steps):
    prediction, state = model.predict(np.expand_dims(prediction[-1], axis=0), initial_state=state)

```

This example demonstrates an autoregressive model, where the network predicts the next value in a sequence based on preceding values. It uses a GRU, another powerful RNN variant.  The loop here includes state management which is crucial for accurate predictions with recurrent layers. Note that the input data needs to be preprocessed to create lagged input features.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting textbooks on deep learning and time series analysis.  In-depth explanations of RNN architectures, including LSTMs and GRUs, are crucial.  Exploring research papers on sequence-to-sequence models and autoregressive forecasting will provide a deeper understanding of practical applications and advanced techniques.  Finally, reviewing tutorials and documentation on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch is essential for practical implementation and experimentation.
