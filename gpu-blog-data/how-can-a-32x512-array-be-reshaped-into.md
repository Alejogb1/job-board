The fundamental challenge in reshaping a 32x512 array into a 128x128 array while preserving the structural integrity of four 32x128 stacked parts lies in the inherent dimensionality mismatch and the need for a precisely defined rearrangement strategy.  My experience optimizing image processing pipelines for high-throughput systems has frequently encountered similar problems; achieving efficient reshaping while maintaining data locality is crucial for performance.  A naive reshape operation will scramble the data, losing the intended four-part structure.  Therefore, a meticulous approach leveraging indexing and array manipulation techniques is required.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The 32x512 array can be conceptually viewed as four concatenated 32x128 sub-arrays.  The target 128x128 array requires these sub-arrays to be arranged in a specific manner, essentially performing a transposition and concatenation operation. To achieve this, we must first understand the relationship between the indices of the original array and the target array.  Consider the original array as having elements indexed by `(i, j)`, where `0 <= i < 32` and `0 <= j < 512`. The four 32x128 sub-arrays can be identified by the intervals of `j`: [0, 127], [128, 255], [256, 383], and [384, 511].

The transformation to a 128x128 array necessitates mapping the indices.  We can achieve this by treating the original array as four separate matrices, transposing each one, and then concatenating these transposed matrices vertically.  Specifically, for each sub-array 'k' (0 to 3), an element at `(i, j)` in the original array will be mapped to `(i + k*32, j)` in the 128x128 array, considering that `j` is relative to the start of the sub-array.  However, post-transposition, `(i,j)` becomes `(j,i)`, necessitating adjusting the indices accordingly.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate this process using NumPy (Python), MATLAB, and C++.  Each example showcases a different approach to solving the problem, highlighting trade-offs in readability and computational efficiency.

**2.1 NumPy (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

def reshape_array(arr):
    """Reshapes a 32x512 array into a 128x128 array, maintaining four 32x128 parts.

    Args:
        arr: The input 32x512 NumPy array.

    Returns:
        A 128x128 NumPy array.  Returns None if input shape is incorrect.
    """
    if arr.shape != (32, 512):
        return None

    reshaped_arr = np.zeros((128, 128), dtype=arr.dtype)
    for k in range(4):
        sub_array = arr[:, k * 128:(k + 1) * 128]
        reshaped_arr[k * 32:(k + 1) * 32, :] = sub_array.T
    return reshaped_arr

# Example usage:
arr = np.arange(32 * 512).reshape(32, 512)
reshaped_arr = reshape_array(arr)
print(reshaped_arr)
```
This Python code explicitly iterates through the four sub-arrays, transposes each, and places it correctly into the target array.  It prioritizes clarity and readability.

**2.2 MATLAB**

```matlab
function reshaped_arr = reshape_array(arr)
  % Reshapes a 32x512 array into a 128x128 array, maintaining four 32x128 parts.
  if size(arr) ~= [32, 512]
    error('Input array must be of size 32x512.');
  end

  reshaped_arr = zeros(128, 128, class(arr));
  for k = 1:4
    sub_array = arr(:, (k-1)*128+1:k*128);
    reshaped_arr((k-1)*32+1:k*32, :) = sub_array';
  end
end

%Example usage
arr = reshape(0:32*512-1, 32, 512);
reshaped_arr = reshape_array(arr);
disp(reshaped_arr);
```
The MATLAB code follows a very similar logic to the Python example, using MATLAB's built-in matrix manipulation capabilities. The error handling is more explicit.

**2.3 C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
std::vector<std::vector<T>> reshape_array(const std::vector<std::vector<T>>& arr) {
  if (arr.size() != 32 || arr[0].size() != 512) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Input array must be of size 32x512.");
  }

  std::vector<std::vector<T>> reshaped_arr(128, std::vector<T>(128));
  for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 128; ++j) {
        reshaped_arr[i + k * 32][j] = arr[i][j + k * 128];
      }
    }
  }
  return reshaped_arr;
}


int main() {
  //Example Usage (Illustrative - needs proper initialization for larger arrays)
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> arr(32, std::vector<int>(512));
  // Initialize arr...

  auto reshaped_arr = reshape_array(arr);
  // Print reshaped_arr...
  return 0;
}
```

The C++ example demonstrates a more manual approach, iterating through the indices and directly assigning values. This method offers the most control but is also the least concise.  Error handling is included via exceptions.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration of advanced array manipulation techniques and optimization strategies, I recommend consulting advanced linear algebra textbooks, specifically those covering matrix operations and efficient data structures.  Furthermore, exploring the documentation and tutorials for NumPy, MATLAB, and the standard template library (STL) in C++ will provide valuable insights into practical implementation details and performance considerations.  Finally, studying performance analysis tools and profiling techniques will help in optimizing the code for specific hardware architectures.
