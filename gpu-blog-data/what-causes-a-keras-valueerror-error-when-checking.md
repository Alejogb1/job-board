The Keras `ValueError: Error when checking input` arises fundamentally from a mismatch between the expected input shape of a layer and the actual shape of the data passed to it. This mismatch isn't always immediately obvious, stemming from subtle discrepancies in data preprocessing, model architecture design, or even inconsistencies within the Keras framework itself depending on the backend used.  My experience troubleshooting this error over the years, primarily working with TensorFlow and Theano backends, points to three common culprits: inconsistent batch sizes, mismatched input dimensions, and incorrect data types.


**1. Inconsistent Batch Sizes:**  This is arguably the most frequent cause.  Keras models, by default, expect data to be fed in batches.  The `batch_size` parameter during model training dictates the number of samples processed before a weight update occurs. If the training data is not structured with this batch size in mind, or if the data fed during prediction differs from the training batch size, this error will manifest.  The issue often lies in how data is loaded and pre-processed.  For example, directly feeding a NumPy array without considering the batch dimension will result in this error if your model expects batched input.

**2. Mismatched Input Dimensions:**  The input layer of your Keras model defines the expected shape of the input data. This shape usually includes the batch size (if applicable), the number of features (or channels for image data), and any temporal or spatial dimensions (for sequences or images, respectively).  Even a single dimension discrepancy – for example, expecting a (100, 3) input representing 100 samples with 3 features but providing data shaped as (100, 2) – will trigger the error.  This requires a careful examination of both your model definition and your data's structure.

**3. Incorrect Data Types:** Keras is sensitive to the data type of the input tensors. While not always explicit in the error message, incompatibility between the expected data type (e.g., `float32`) and the actual data type (e.g., `int32` or `object`) can subtly lead to the `ValueError`.  This is especially important when dealing with images, where incorrect scaling or type conversions can cause problems.  Furthermore, ensure your input data doesn't contain missing values (`NaN` or `Inf`), which can also trigger inconsistencies.



**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Batch Size Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Model expecting a batch size of 32
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Correctly batched data
X_train_correct = np.random.rand(320, 10)  # 320 samples, 10 features, implicitly batch size of 32 (320/10)
y_train_correct = np.random.rand(320, 1)
model.fit(X_train_correct, y_train_correct, batch_size=32, epochs=1)

# Incorrectly batched data -  Error!
X_train_incorrect = np.random.rand(320, 10)
y_train_incorrect = np.random.rand(320, 1)
#Trying to fit with default batch size of 32, while data is not properly batched
model.fit(X_train_incorrect, y_train_incorrect, epochs=1) #This will likely throw the error.
```

**Commentary:** The above demonstrates how providing data that doesn't align with the implicit or explicit batch size during training can trigger the error. The `X_train_incorrect` array, while having the correct number of samples and features, isn't structured to be processed in batches of 32.  Explicitly setting the `batch_size` parameter in `.fit()` is crucial.  Even if the total number of samples is divisible by the batch size, the absence of proper batch structuring might cause problems with certain Keras backends.

**Example 2: Mismatched Input Dimensions**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dense

# Model expecting (32, 28, 28, 1) input - a batch of 32, 28x28 grayscale images
model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Correct input shape
X_train_correct = np.random.rand(32, 28, 28, 1)
y_train_correct = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(32, 10)) #one-hot encoded labels
model.fit(X_train_correct, y_train_correct, epochs=1)

# Incorrect input shape - Error!
X_train_incorrect = np.random.rand(32, 28, 28) # Missing channel dimension
y_train_incorrect = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(32, 10))
model.fit(X_train_incorrect, y_train_incorrect, epochs=1) #this will fail
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the importance of matching the input shape declared in the model (`input_shape=(28, 28, 1)`) with the actual shape of the input data.  The omission of the channel dimension (`1` for grayscale) in `X_train_incorrect` leads to the error.  Always double-check the dimensionality of your input data against your model's expectation.


**Example 3: Incorrect Data Type**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(5,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Correct data type
X_train_correct = np.random.rand(100, 5).astype('float32')
y_train_correct = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 10)).astype('float32') #binary classification, one-hot encoded
model.fit(X_train_correct, y_train_correct, epochs=1)

# Incorrect data type - Potential Error
X_train_incorrect = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 5)) #Integer type
y_train_incorrect = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 10))
model.fit(X_train_incorrect, y_train_incorrect, epochs=1) # Might fail or produce unexpected results.

```

**Commentary:**  This illustrates the importance of consistent data types.  Using `int` instead of `float32` might not always throw an error immediately, but can lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues.  Explicitly converting your data to `float32` is a standard practice to ensure compatibility with Keras's numerical operations.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation, particularly the sections on model building and data preprocessing, are invaluable.  Furthermore, exploring detailed examples and tutorials on image processing and sequential data handling within Keras can provide deeper insight into resolving these shape-related issues.  Reviewing the documentation for your specific Keras backend (TensorFlow or Theano) can be extremely helpful in understanding potential backend-specific subtleties that might influence input validation.  A thorough understanding of NumPy array manipulation is essential for proper data preparation.
