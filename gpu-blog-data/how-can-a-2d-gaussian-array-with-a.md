Generating a 2D Gaussian array with a specified mean and location requires careful consideration of the underlying mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation.  My experience optimizing image processing algorithms frequently involves generating such arrays for tasks like kernel creation in convolutional neural networks and spatial filtering. The key insight lies in understanding the separable nature of the Gaussian function, allowing for significant computational savings.  Directly computing the Gaussian for each element is computationally expensive for larger arrays; exploiting separability allows for a significantly faster generation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A 2D Gaussian function is defined as:

G(x, y) = (1/(2πσ²)) * exp(-((x-µx)² + (y-µy)²)/(2σ²))

Where:

* `µx` and `µy` are the x and y coordinates of the mean (center) of the Gaussian.
* `σ` is the standard deviation, controlling the spread of the Gaussian.
* `x` and `y` are the coordinates of each element in the array.

To create a 2D Gaussian array with a mean of 1 at a specified location (µx, µy), we need to ensure that the peak value of the Gaussian function is 1.  This requires adjusting the normalization constant. The standard normalization constant (1/(2πσ²)) ensures the integral of the Gaussian over the entire plane is 1. However, the *maximum* value of the un-normalized Gaussian is at (µx, µy) and equals 1. Therefore, we can simply omit the normalization constant and apply any necessary scaling afterward. We can, therefore, simplify the equation for our purpose:

G(x, y) = exp(-((x-µx)² + (y-µy)²)/(2σ²))

This simplified equation directly produces a Gaussian array with its peak value at 1. The location of this peak is controlled by (µx, µy).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples demonstrate the generation of a 2D Gaussian array in Python using NumPy, leveraging both direct and separable calculation methods.

**Example 1: Direct Calculation (Less Efficient):**

```python
import numpy as np

def gaussian_2d_direct(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma):
    """Generates a 2D Gaussian array using direct calculation.  Less efficient for large arrays."""
    x = np.arange(cols)
    y = np.arange(rows)
    xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    gaussian = np.exp(-((xv - mux)**2 + (yv - muy)**2) / (2 * sigma**2))
    return gaussian

# Example usage:
rows, cols = 100, 100
mux, muy = 50, 50  # Center of the Gaussian
sigma = 10
gaussian_array = gaussian_2d_direct(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma)
```

This code directly implements the formula.  While straightforward, it’s computationally expensive for larger arrays due to the nested loops implied by `np.meshgrid` and the element-wise operations.


**Example 2: Separable Calculation (More Efficient):**

```python
import numpy as np

def gaussian_1d(size, mu, sigma):
    """Generates a 1D Gaussian array."""
    x = np.arange(size)
    return np.exp(-(x - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))

def gaussian_2d_separable(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma):
    """Generates a 2D Gaussian array using separable calculation.  More efficient for large arrays."""
    x_gaussian = gaussian_1d(cols, mux, sigma)
    y_gaussian = gaussian_1d(rows, muy, sigma)
    gaussian = np.outer(y_gaussian, x_gaussian)
    return gaussian


# Example usage (same parameters as before):
rows, cols = 100, 100
mux, muy = 50, 50
sigma = 10
gaussian_array = gaussian_2d_separable(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma)
```

This code exploits the separability of the Gaussian.  We generate 1D Gaussians for x and y separately and then use the outer product (`np.outer`) to create the 2D Gaussian. This method is significantly faster for larger arrays because it avoids nested loops, making it far more efficient for large-scale applications.


**Example 3:  Handling edge cases and array size:**

```python
import numpy as np

def gaussian_2d_robust(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma):
    """Generates a 2D Gaussian array, handling edge cases."""
    # Ensure mu values are within the array bounds
    mux = np.clip(mux, 0, cols -1)
    muy = np.clip(muy, 0, rows -1)
    
    x_gaussian = gaussian_1d(cols, mux, sigma)
    y_gaussian = gaussian_1d(rows, muy, sigma)
    gaussian = np.outer(y_gaussian, x_gaussian)
    return gaussian

# Example usage, demonstrating edge case handling:
rows, cols = 50, 50
mux, muy = 49, 49
sigma = 10
gaussian_array = gaussian_2d_robust(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma)

rows, cols = 50, 50
mux, muy = -1, -1 #Test with values outside array
sigma = 10
gaussian_array = gaussian_2d_robust(rows, cols, mux, muy, sigma)

```

This example adds error handling by using `np.clip` to ensure the mean coordinates (`mux`, `muy`) stay within the array bounds, preventing indexing errors.  This robust handling is crucial for production-ready code.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations, I recommend consulting standard texts on probability and statistics, particularly those covering multivariate Gaussian distributions.  Numerical analysis textbooks offer valuable insights into efficient array manipulation techniques.  Furthermore, the NumPy documentation provides detailed explanations of relevant functions and their optimization strategies.  Finally, reviewing papers on image processing and computer vision will expose you to practical applications and further optimization strategies for Gaussian kernel generation within those contexts.  These resources will allow for a more comprehensive understanding and more advanced implementations.
