Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently designed for image classification;  their architecture is specifically structured to extract hierarchical features from image data.  Therefore, the premise of "converting" a CNN into a classifier is somewhat misleading.  A CNN *is* a classifier; the final layers define the classification task.  The question, more accurately, should focus on adapting or refining a pre-trained or existing CNN for a specific classification problem.  My experience in developing image recognition systems for autonomous vehicles has provided numerous opportunities to fine-tune CNNs for varied classification tasks, ranging from pedestrian detection to traffic sign recognition.  This experience informs my response.

**1.  Explanation of Adapting CNNs for Classification**

The process of adapting a CNN for a specific classification task generally involves two key steps: pre-training and fine-tuning.  Pre-training leverages the power of transfer learning, utilizing weights learned on a large dataset (like ImageNet) to initialize the network's weights. This significantly accelerates training and improves performance, particularly when dealing with limited datasets for the target classification problem.  Fine-tuning then adjusts these pre-trained weights based on the specific characteristics of the target dataset.  This targeted adjustment allows the network to specialize in the desired classification task.

The critical component in this process lies in the output layer of the CNN.  Pre-trained models often have a final fully connected layer with a large number of output nodes, corresponding to a vast range of classes in the original training dataset.  To adapt this for a new classification problem with a different number of classes, this layer must be replaced with a new fully connected layer containing the appropriate number of output nodes.  Each node in this new layer represents a class in the target classification problem.  The activation function of this final layer is typically a softmax function, producing a probability distribution over the classes.  The class with the highest probability is assigned as the prediction.

Furthermore, the choice of pre-trained model is crucial.  Models like ResNet, VGG, and Inception have proven highly effective for various image classification tasks due to their architectural efficiency and capacity for feature extraction. The selection depends on factors such as the complexity of the classification task, dataset size, and computational resources available.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the process using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  Assume a pre-trained ResNet50 model is used as a starting point.

**Example 1:  Replacing the output layer for a binary classification problem:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 without the top classification layer
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the pre-trained layers to prevent unintended changes during fine-tuning
base_model.trainable = False

# Add a custom classification layer
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x) # Added for improved performance
predictions = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x) # Binary classification (sigmoid activation)

# Create the new model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with your dataset
model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(validation_data, validation_labels))
```

This code snippet first loads a pre-trained ResNet50, excluding the top classification layer.  The pre-trained layers are frozen to maintain the learned features.  A new fully connected layer with a single output node and sigmoid activation is added for binary classification.  The model is then compiled and trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification problems.  The addition of a dense layer with ReLU activation before the final layer often improves results.


**Example 2: Adapting for multi-class classification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D

# Load pre-trained VGG16
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
base_model.trainable = False

# Add a custom classification layer
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
predictions = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x) # num_classes is the number of classes

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(validation_data, validation_labels))
```

This example is similar, but uses VGG16 and adapts it for a multi-class classification problem. The crucial difference is the use of 'softmax' activation in the final layer and 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function.  The `num_classes` variable should be replaced with the actual number of classes in your dataset.  The `training_labels` should be one-hot encoded for categorical cross-entropy.


**Example 3: Fine-tuning pre-trained layers:**

```python
# ... (Previous code as in Example 1 or 2) ...

# Unfreeze some layers for fine-tuning
for layer in base_model.layers[-5:]: # Unfreeze the last 5 layers of the base model
    layer.trainable = True

# Recompile the model with a lower learning rate for fine-tuning
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fine-tune the model
model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=5, validation_data=(validation_data, validation_labels))
```

This example demonstrates fine-tuning.  After initial training with the pre-trained layers frozen, some of the pre-trained layers are unfrozen to allow for further adaptation to the specific dataset.  A lower learning rate is crucial here to prevent overwriting the pre-trained weights.  The number of layers unfrozen is a hyperparameter that needs adjustment based on experimentation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures and transfer learning, I strongly recommend consulting reputable machine learning textbooks and research papers on the topic.  Specifically, exploring publications on ResNet, VGG, and Inception architectures will provide valuable insights into their design and capabilities.  Thorough documentation for TensorFlow/Keras and other deep learning frameworks is also essential.  Finally, exploring the literature on hyperparameter optimization techniques will aid in refining the model's performance.
