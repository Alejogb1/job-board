Selective weight restoration in Keras models under TensorFlow 2.0 necessitates a granular approach, moving beyond simply loading entire weight files.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the critical need for this capability, especially during model fine-tuning and transfer learning scenarios where only certain layers require adjustments or a return to previous states.  This often arises from experiments with differing hyperparameters or the need to revert specific parts of the model to a known stable configuration after encountering unexpected training behavior.  A naive approach of loading a complete weight set often overlooks this level of control.

The core strategy involves leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.train.Checkpoint` and manual assignment of weights to specific layers within the Keras model.  This requires a precise understanding of the model's architecture and the naming conventions used by `Checkpoint` to manage its internal state.  Simply put,  we bypass the high-level Keras weight loading functions and directly manipulate the underlying TensorFlow variables.

**1.  Understanding the Checkpoint Mechanism**

`tf.train.Checkpoint` stores the weights as a collection of TensorFlow variables.  Crucially, these variables are named according to a hierarchical structure reflecting the model's layers and sub-layers.  During the saving process, the checkpoint manager automatically generates these names.  To restore selectively, we need to access these names and use them to target specific weights.  I've encountered instances where inconsistent naming conventions – due to custom layers or dynamically generated models – caused significant challenges.  Careful examination of the checkpoint's contents is paramount.  This is typically done by inspecting the variables contained in the checkpoint object after loading, before attempting any restoration.  The structure can be examined using tools like TensorBoard or by printing out the variable names directly.

**2. Code Examples Demonstrating Selective Weight Restoration**

The following examples utilize a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for illustrative purposes.  They represent the techniques I've found most effective across a variety of projects, emphasizing robustness and clarity.

**Example 1: Restoring Weights for a Single Convolutional Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a simple CNN model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Create a checkpoint manager
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)

# Save the model's weights
checkpoint.save('./ckpt/my_checkpoint')

# ... Training occurs here ...

# Load the previous weights and select the convolutional layer
checkpoint.restore('./ckpt/my_checkpoint')

# Access specific layer weights (adjust names as needed)
conv_layer_weights = model.layers[0].weights[0] # weights[0] corresponds to the kernel

# Modify only one set of weights (conv_layer weights)
# Example of assigning a new value, here generating random weights
new_weights = tf.random.normal(shape=conv_layer_weights.shape, dtype=conv_layer_weights.dtype)
conv_layer_weights.assign(new_weights)

#Continue training ...


```

This example demonstrates the retrieval of a single convolutional layer's weights. We explicitly assign a new weight set to the convolutional layer; however, we can load a specific weight from a different checkpoint to restore weights selectively.  Remember that the index `[0]` refers to the kernel weights. Biases are accessed using `weights[1]`. The critical step is the direct assignment using `.assign()`.


**Example 2: Restoring Weights for Multiple Layers from Different Checkpoints**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# create checkpoints
checkpoint_1 = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)
checkpoint_2 = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)

# save weights
checkpoint_1.save('./ckpt/ckpt1')
# ... Training occurs, resulting in a new state for model...
checkpoint_2.save('./ckpt/ckpt2')

# selective weight restoration
checkpoint_1.restore('./ckpt/ckpt1')
checkpoint_2.restore('./ckpt/ckpt2')


#Manually selecting weights based on layer names and assigning from checkpoint_1
for i in range(len(model.layers)):
    if i < 2:
        model.layers[i].set_weights(checkpoint_1.model.layers[i].weights)
    else:
        model.layers[i].set_weights(checkpoint_2.model.layers[i].weights)


```

Here, we manage two checkpoints. This example illustrates restoration from multiple checkpoints and the use of layer indexing for selective restoration, which can be particularly useful when handling models of significant size where manual weight naming would be impractical.  It leverages `set_weights` which is a safer method for assigning whole weight sets, however `assign` is still useful for targeting individual weights within a layer.


**Example 3:  Restoring Weights Based on Layer Name Patterns**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a model (example)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv1', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv2'),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense1')
])


#Create a checkpoint manager
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)

# Save weights
checkpoint.save('./ckpt/checkpoint_example')

# Load checkpoint
checkpoint.restore('./ckpt/checkpoint_example')

# Restore weights for layers containing 'conv' in their names
for layer in model.layers:
    if 'conv' in layer.name:
        # Access weights from checkpoint and assign
        layer_weights = checkpoint.model.get_layer(layer.name).weights
        layer.set_weights(layer_weights)

```

This example introduces name-based selection.  The code iterates through layers, checking their names for a pattern ('conv' in this case). This allows for flexibility when dealing with models with a large number of layers and provides a more maintainable approach when the layer indices might change with modifications to the model architecture.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on `tf.train.Checkpoint` and weight management.  Refer to the Keras documentation for layer-specific weight access and manipulation methods.  Exploring resources focused on TensorFlow's variable management and checkpointing mechanisms will provide a deep understanding of the underlying principles.  Thorough study of advanced model manipulation techniques in TensorFlow will prove valuable when dealing with complex model architectures and situations demanding precise control over individual weight restoration.
