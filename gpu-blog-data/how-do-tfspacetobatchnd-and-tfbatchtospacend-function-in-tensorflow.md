TensorFlow's `tf.space_to_batch_nd()` and `tf.batch_to_space_nd()` operations manipulate the spatial dimensions of a tensor by either splitting them into batches or consolidating batches into spatial dimensions. These operations, while seemingly complex, are instrumental in implementing various convolutional network architectures, especially those dealing with dilated convolutions or processing variable-length sequences. I've personally used these functionalities quite extensively in several image processing projects where I needed to downsample feature maps before feeding them into an analysis network, as well as during the development of custom sequence encoders. Understanding their precise behavior is crucial for effectively utilizing them within a deep learning pipeline.

`tf.space_to_batch_nd()` transforms a tensor by partitioning its spatial dimensions into blocks and arranging these blocks within the batch dimension. The operation takes three primary arguments: the input tensor, `block_shape`, and `paddings`. `block_shape` is a 1-D integer tensor specifying the size of each block along each spatial dimension. `paddings` is a 2-D integer tensor indicating the amount of padding to be added before the space-to-batch transformation occurs. The dimensions that are *not* considered spatial are treated as batch dimensions. The process involves padding the spatial dimensions, then reshaping and rearranging the tensor to effectively "squeeze" spatial information into the batch dimension.

Specifically, given an input tensor with shape `[N, D1, D2, ..., Dn, C]` (where `N` is the batch size, `D1` to `Dn` are spatial dimensions, and `C` is the channel dimension), and given a `block_shape` tensor `[b1, b2, ..., bn]` and a `paddings` tensor `[[p1_before, p1_after], ..., [pn_before, pn_after]]`, the operation first pads spatial dimensions `D1` to `Dn`. For each spatial dimension `Di`, `paddings[i][0]` is the amount of padding added before the start of the dimension, and `paddings[i][1]` is the amount added after the end.  The padded spatial dimensions will therefore be of shape `D'i = Di + p_before + p_after`.

After padding, the spatial dimensions are divided into blocks based on the given `block_shape`.  Each dimension `Di'` is divided into `D'i / bi` blocks if the division is exact; otherwise the operation raises an exception if the block size does not divide exactly into the spatial dimension. Finally, the tensor is reshaped to move these blocks to the batch dimension, resulting in the output tensor having a batch dimension of size `N * prod(bi)`, and the spatial dimensions are now of size `D'i / bi`. Importantly, the resulting spatial dimensions are integer quotients from dividing padded sizes by block sizes.

`tf.batch_to_space_nd()` performs the reverse operation, reshaping the batch dimension into spatial blocks. It takes similar arguments: the input tensor, `block_shape`, and `crops`. `crops` is a 2-D integer tensor indicating the amount to crop from each spatial dimension after the operation has occurred. Given an input tensor with shape `[N * prod(bi), D1, D2, ..., Dn, C]`, a `block_shape` of `[b1, b2, ..., bn]`, and `crops` of `[[c1_before, c1_after], ..., [cn_before, cn_after]]`, this operation rearranges spatial dimensions.

Here, the initial batch dimension `N * prod(bi)` is first conceptually "unfolded" into a batch dimension of size `N` and new dimensions representing spatial blocks. The operation effectively moves parts of the initial batch dimension to the spatial dimensions.  After re-arranging the tensor, the new spatial dimensions are of shape `D'i * bi`. The `crops` argument determines the amount of cropping to be applied to the transformed spatial dimensions. For each spatial dimension, `crops[i][0]` is removed from the beginning and `crops[i][1]` is removed from the end. After cropping, the resulting spatial dimensions will have a shape of  `D'i * bi - c_before - c_after`. Critically the input tensor's batch size must be divisible by the product of the `block_shape`. This operation is the functional inverse of `tf.space_to_batch_nd()`, assuming proper padding and cropping are used.

Here are examples that demonstrate the behavior:

**Example 1: `tf.space_to_batch_nd()` with 2D Spatial Dimensions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch_size=1, height=4, width=4, channels=1)
input_tensor = tf.reshape(tf.range(16, dtype=tf.float32), [1, 4, 4, 1])

# block_shape
block_shape = [2, 2]

# paddings (no padding)
paddings = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]

# Space to batch operation
output_tensor = tf.space_to_batch_nd(input_tensor, block_shape, paddings)

# Print shapes and the output tensor
print("Input Tensor Shape:", input_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 4, 4, 1)
print("Output Tensor Shape:", output_tensor.shape) # Output: (4, 2, 2, 1)
print("Output Tensor:\n", output_tensor.numpy())
# Output Tensor:
# [[[[ 0. ]
#   [ 1. ]]
#  [[ 4. ]
#   [ 5. ]]]
#
# [[[ 2. ]
#   [ 3. ]]
#  [[ 6. ]
#   [ 7. ]]]
#
# [[[ 8. ]
#   [ 9. ]]
#  [[12. ]
#   [13. ]]]
#
# [[[10. ]
#   [11. ]]
#  [[14. ]
#   [15. ]]]]
```

In this example, the `block_shape` is `[2, 2]`, splitting both height and width into 2x2 blocks. No padding is used. The original batch size of 1 is expanded to 4, which is the product of block shape values (2 * 2).  The spatial dimensions are halved (4 becomes 2). Each new batch entry now contains one of the 2x2 blocks from the original input.

**Example 2: `tf.batch_to_space_nd()` with 2D Spatial Dimensions and Cropping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch_size=4, height=2, width=2, channels=1)
input_tensor = tf.reshape(tf.range(16, dtype=tf.float32), [4, 2, 2, 1])

# block_shape (same as the previous example)
block_shape = [2, 2]

# crops to crop out, from start and end of spatial dimensions
crops = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]

# batch to space operation
output_tensor = tf.batch_to_space_nd(input_tensor, block_shape, crops)

# Print shapes and the output tensor
print("Input Tensor Shape:", input_tensor.shape)  # Output: (4, 2, 2, 1)
print("Output Tensor Shape:", output_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 4, 4, 1)
print("Output Tensor:\n", output_tensor.numpy())
#Output Tensor:
# [[[[ 0.]
#   [ 1.]
#   [ 4.]
#   [ 5.]]
#
#  [[ 2.]
#   [ 3.]
#   [ 6.]
#   [ 7.]]
#
#  [[ 8.]
#   [ 9.]
#   [12.]
#   [13.]]
#
#  [[10.]
#   [11.]
#   [14.]
#   [15.]]]]
```
Here, the `block_shape` is again `[2, 2]`. The input tensorâ€™s shape starts with a batch size of 4. No cropping is used so the output is simply a reversal of the previous example, reconstructing the original 4x4 spatial dimensions and having a batch size of 1.

**Example 3: `tf.space_to_batch_nd()` with Padding and `tf.batch_to_space_nd()` with Cropping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch_size=1, height=3, width=3, channels=1)
input_tensor = tf.reshape(tf.range(9, dtype=tf.float32), [1, 3, 3, 1])

# block_shape (same as the previous example)
block_shape = [2, 2]

# paddings (add 1 on each side of the spatial dimension)
paddings = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]


# Space to batch operation
output_space_to_batch = tf.space_to_batch_nd(input_tensor, block_shape, paddings)
print("Output from space to batch:", output_space_to_batch.shape) # Output: (4, 2, 2, 1)

#crops to remove the padding, from start and end of spatial dimensions
crops = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]

#batch to space operation to reverse
output_batch_to_space = tf.batch_to_space_nd(output_space_to_batch, block_shape, crops)
print("Output from batch to space:", output_batch_to_space.shape) #Output (1, 3, 3, 1)
print("Output Tensor:\n", output_batch_to_space.numpy())
# Output Tensor:
# [[[[0.]
#   [1.]
#   [2.]]
#
#  [[3.]
#   [4.]
#   [5.]]
#
#  [[6.]
#   [7.]
#   [8.]]]]
```
In this example, padding is applied before `tf.space_to_batch_nd()` and the cropping is used to remove the padding after `tf.batch_to_space_nd()`. The initial 3x3 tensor is padded to 5x5. The batch size becomes four, each with a size of 2x2. Then `tf.batch_to_space_nd()` combines these into a single batch with the spatial dimensions of 5x5. Finally, cropping is applied which removes the previously added padding resulting in the original tensor, which demonstrates the inverse relationship between the two functions.

For further understanding and practical applications, I would highly recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials related to these functions. Additionally, exploring example code involving dilated convolutions or image pyramid architectures will demonstrate these operations in context. Examination of open-source implementations of models using these operations will prove invaluable. Finally, experimenting with different `block_shape` and `paddings` values in a controlled test environment will solidify the understanding of the underlying mechanism.
