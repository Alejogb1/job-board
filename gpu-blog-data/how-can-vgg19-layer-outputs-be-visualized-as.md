Visualizing VGG19 layer outputs as images requires careful consideration of the data format and the inherent dimensionality of feature maps.  My experience with deep convolutional neural networks, specifically in the context of image classification and style transfer projects, has taught me that direct visualization isn't always straightforward.  The raw outputs aren't directly interpretable as RGB images; they represent high-dimensional feature extractions, often with multiple channels.  Effective visualization needs to address this dimensionality issue.

**1. Explanation:  Addressing the Dimensionality Challenge**

VGG19, like other Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), processes images through a series of convolutional and pooling layers.  Each layer produces a feature map, a multi-dimensional array where each element represents a feature's activation at a specific spatial location.  The number of dimensions is determined by the number of channels (filters) in that layer.  Early layers might detect low-level features like edges and corners, while deeper layers capture more complex, abstract features.  A direct attempt to display a feature map as an image will fail if the number of channels exceeds three (for RGB).

Therefore, to visualize these outputs effectively, we need strategies to handle the multi-channel nature of the feature maps.  Three common approaches are:

* **Channel-wise visualization:**  Each channel of the feature map is treated as a grayscale image, revealing the activation patterns for individual filters.  This allows us to examine how different features are activated across the input image.

* **Maximum activation visualization:** The maximum activation across all channels at each spatial location is selected, creating a single grayscale image. This gives an overview of the strongest responses within the feature map, highlighting regions of high activation regardless of the specific filter.

* **Composite visualization:**  This involves applying a colormap to each channel and then merging the color-mapped channels into a single RGB image.  This approach requires careful selection of colormaps to ensure that variations in activation are clearly represented.  This can be particularly useful for visualizing several channels simultaneously, for instance, three channels as RGB, or several as a "rainbow" representation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate these approaches using Python and a hypothetical VGG19 model loaded from a pre-trained weight file.  I'll assume the necessary libraries (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) are already installed and imported.

**Example 1: Channel-wise Visualization (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... load pre-trained VGG19 model and input image ...

model = tf.keras.applications.vgg19.VGG19(weights='imagenet') #replace with custom model loading if needed
image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img("input_image.jpg", target_size=(224, 224))
image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(image)
image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
image = tf.keras.applications.vgg19.preprocess_input(image)

# Access a specific layer's output
layer_name = 'block1_conv1'  # Replace with desired layer
intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)
intermediate_output = intermediate_layer_model(image)

# Visualize each channel
num_channels = intermediate_output.shape[-1]
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, num_channels, figsize=(15, 5))
for i in range(num_channels):
    axes[i].imshow(intermediate_output[0, :, :, i], cmap='gray')
    axes[i].axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This code snippet extracts the output of a specified layer and then iterates through each channel, displaying it as a grayscale image using `matplotlib`.  The layer name needs to be adapted depending on the specific VGG19 implementation and desired layer depth.

**Example 2: Maximum Activation Visualization (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision import models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... load pre-trained VGG19 model and input image ...

model = models.vgg19(pretrained=True)
model.eval()
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize((224, 224)), transforms.ToTensor()])
image = transform(Image.open("input_image.jpg"))
image = image.unsqueeze(0)

# Access a specific layer's output
layer_name = 'features.0' # Example layer - adjust based on VGG19 architecture
output = model.features[0](image)

# Calculate maximum activation across channels
max_activation = torch.max(output, dim=1)[0]

# Display the image
plt.imshow(max_activation[0, :, :].detach().numpy(), cmap='gray')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This PyTorch example utilizes `torch.max` to find the maximum activation across all channels at each spatial location, producing a single grayscale image.  This highlights regions of greatest activation regardless of specific features detected by individual filters.  Note the adaptation of layer access based on PyTorch's naming conventions.


**Example 3: Composite Visualization (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# ... load pre-trained VGG19 model and image (same as Example 1) ...

# Access layer output (same as Example 1)

# Select a subset of channels for visualization - example: 3 channels
num_channels_to_visualize = 3
selected_channels = intermediate_output[0, :, :, :num_channels_to_visualize]

# Apply colormaps and merge channels
cmap = plt.cm.get_cmap('viridis', num_channels_to_visualize) # Or other colormaps like 'magma'
colored_channels = []
for i in range(num_channels_to_visualize):
    colored_channel = cmap(selected_channels[:, :, i]/np.max(selected_channels[:, :, i]))[:,:,:3] #normalize and convert to RGB
    colored_channels.append(colored_channel)

composite_image = np.stack(colored_channels, axis=-1).mean(axis=-1) #average across channels, to display as a single image

plt.imshow(composite_image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates a composite visualization, selecting a limited number of channels (e.g., three for RGB representation).  It applies a colormap to each channel and then averages the color-mapped channels, creating a single image where different colors represent activation levels from different filters.  Choosing appropriate colormaps is crucial for effective visualization.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures, I suggest consulting standard deep learning textbooks.  Examining the documentation for TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch will be essential for implementing these visualizations.  Furthermore, exploring research papers on feature visualization techniques and their applications will provide additional insights and more advanced approaches.  Reviewing the official documentation for `matplotlib` will assist in fine-tuning the visualization aspects.
