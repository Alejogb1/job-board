GPU workload separation on Windows hinges fundamentally on the understanding that the operating system doesn't directly manage individual GPU threads in the same manner it handles CPU processes.  Instead, it relies on the underlying drivers and application-level mechanisms to achieve this separation.  My experience working on high-performance computing clusters, particularly those utilizing NVIDIA GPUs, has highlighted the importance of carefully choosing the appropriate approach, as blanket solutions are rarely optimal.  The best method depends heavily on the application's architecture and the desired level of isolation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Effective GPU workload separation involves assigning dedicated resources – compute units, memory bandwidth, and potentially even specific GPU cards – to individual tasks or processes. This prevents resource contention and ensures predictable performance.  This separation is not achieved through OS-level process isolation in the same way as CPU processes.  Instead, it relies on a combination of:

* **Driver-level scheduling:** The GPU driver plays a crucial role in managing the allocation of GPU resources to different processes. Modern drivers incorporate sophisticated scheduling algorithms to optimize resource utilization and minimize contention.  However, this is inherently a best-effort approach, and fine-grained control often requires application-level interventions.

* **CUDA streams and contexts (NVIDIA):**  For applications utilizing CUDA, streams and contexts provide powerful mechanisms for parallel execution and task separation.  Streams allow multiple kernels to execute concurrently, while contexts provide isolation between different applications or parts of the same application.  This approach offers a high degree of control, allowing for optimized resource allocation and the management of potential conflicts.

* **DirectX and Vulkan APIs:** For applications utilizing DirectX or Vulkan, the approach involves careful management of command queues and synchronization primitives.  These APIs provide mechanisms for parallel execution and ensure that operations are correctly ordered, preventing data races and other issues.  The granularity of control here is not as explicit as CUDA's stream and context model, but it allows for sufficient separation for many applications.

* **Multiple GPUs:** The most straightforward method, though often expensive, involves assigning different tasks to distinct GPUs. This provides complete isolation, effectively eliminating resource contention entirely.  This approach is prevalent in professional visualization and scientific computing settings.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: CUDA Streams (NVIDIA)**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>

// ... other CUDA includes and code ...

int main() {
  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  // Kernel launch on stream 1
  kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream1>>>(data1);

  // Kernel launch on stream 2
  kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream2>>>(data2);

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);

  // ... further processing ...

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the use of CUDA streams to separate two kernel launches.  `cudaStreamCreate` creates two streams, and each kernel launch specifies its associated stream.  This allows the GPU to execute both kernels concurrently, provided there are sufficient resources.  `cudaStreamSynchronize` ensures that the host waits for each stream to complete before proceeding.  This is critical for data dependency management.  Note that without proper stream management, the kernels might contend for the same resources, leading to reduced performance.


**Example 2: DirectX Command Queues**

```cpp
// ... DirectX includes and initialization ...

ID3D12CommandQueue* pCommandQueue1;
ID3D12CommandQueue* pCommandQueue2;

// ... Create two command queues ...

// Submit command lists to different queues
ID3D12CommandList* pCommandList1;
// ... Fill pCommandList1 ...
pCommandQueue1->ExecuteCommandLists(1, &pCommandList1);


ID3D12CommandList* pCommandList2;
// ... Fill pCommandList2 ...
pCommandQueue2->ExecuteCommandLists(1, &pCommandList2);

// ... Wait for completion if needed ...

// ... Release command lists and queues ...
```

This example illustrates the utilization of multiple DirectX command queues.  Each queue represents a distinct path for submitting GPU work.  This technique, similar to CUDA streams, allows for concurrent execution of independent tasks.  The precise synchronization mechanisms will vary based on the specific application needs and data dependencies between the tasks.  Using fences is a common method to ensure order and prevent race conditions.

**Example 3:  Multiple GPUs (Conceptual)**

This example doesn't involve code directly managing the GPU, but rather the application logic deciding resource allocation.  Assume a rendering application needs to process two separate 3D scenes simultaneously.

```cpp
// Pseudo-code illustrating application-level decision for GPU assignment

// Assuming access to two GPUs: gpu0 and gpu1.

if(scene1.priority > scene2.priority) {
   renderScene(scene1, gpu0);
   renderScene(scene2, gpu1);
} else {
   renderScene(scene2, gpu0);
   renderScene(scene1, gpu1);
}
```

This simplified example illustrates that the separation happens at the application level, deciding which scene to render on which GPU.  The actual rendering code itself would interact with the respective GPU's API (DirectX, Vulkan, or OpenGL).  This approach provides the strongest isolation, but requires appropriate hardware configuration and application architecture.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of CUDA programming, consult the NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide.  For advanced DirectX and Vulkan programming, refer to the relevant official documentation provided by Microsoft and the Khronos Group, respectively.  Finally, a comprehensive text on parallel computing and GPU programming will provide a broader theoretical foundation.  Exploring publications on GPU scheduling algorithms will help further one's understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
