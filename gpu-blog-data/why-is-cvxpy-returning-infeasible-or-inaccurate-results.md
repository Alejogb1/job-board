In my experience troubleshooting CVXPY models, infeasibility or inaccurate solutions for quadratic programs (QPs) often stem from subtle modeling errors, numerical instability related to ill-conditioned matrices, or an incorrect specification of the problem's structure to the solver.  These issues aren't always immediately apparent, requiring careful examination of both the problem formulation and the numerical properties of the input data.

My investigation begins with a thorough review of the problem's constraints and objective function.  Inaccurate results often arise from a mismatch between the mathematical model and its representation in CVXPY.  For example, neglecting to account for non-negativity constraints, or inadvertently introducing conflicting constraints, can lead to infeasibility. Similarly, if the objective function is improperly defined—for example, with unbounded terms or an incorrect sign—the solver will likely produce nonsensical results.

A crucial step is analyzing the condition number of the matrices involved in the QP.  High condition numbers indicate numerical instability; small perturbations in the input data can lead to significant changes in the solution. This is especially problematic for solvers relying on iterative methods, as they are more sensitive to these numerical instabilities. I've encountered numerous instances where preconditioning the data – for instance, scaling the variables or constraints – dramatically improved the accuracy and feasibility of the solution.

The choice of solver also plays a significant role. CVXPY's default solver may not always be the optimal choice for every problem.  Different solvers employ varying algorithms and have different strengths and weaknesses.  Experimenting with different solvers available within CVXPY (e.g., ECOS, SCS, OSQP) is frequently necessary to identify the most suitable option for a given problem.  Problems exhibiting ill-conditioning or degeneracy may respond better to a solver specifically designed to handle these numerical difficulties.

Let's examine three illustrative code examples, each highlighting a common cause of inaccurate or infeasible solutions in CVXPY QP problems.

**Example 1: Conflicting Constraints**

```python
import cvxpy as cp

# Define variables
x = cp.Variable(2)

# Define objective function
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(x, [[1, 0], [0, 1]]))

# Define constraints
constraints = [x[0] + x[1] <= 1,
               x[0] + x[1] >= 2,
               x >= 0]

# Define problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve problem
problem.solve()

# Print results
print("Status:", problem.status)
print("Optimal value:", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution:", x.value)
```

In this example, the constraints `x[0] + x[1] <= 1` and `x[0] + x[1] >= 2` are inherently contradictory.  This leads to an infeasible problem, and CVXPY correctly reports this.  The solution here is to review the problem formulation and identify the conflicting constraints, modifying them to ensure consistency.

**Example 2: Ill-Conditioned Matrix in the Objective**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Generate an ill-conditioned matrix
A = np.array([[1e10, 0], [0, 1]])

# Define variable
x = cp.Variable(2)

# Define objective function (using an ill-conditioned matrix)
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(x, A))

# Define constraints
constraints = [x >= 0, cp.sum(x) == 1]

# Define problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve problem
problem.solve()

# Print results
print("Status:", problem.status)
print("Optimal value:", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution:", x.value)

#Improved Version with Preconditioning
#Scale the matrix A
A_scaled = A / np.linalg.norm(A)

objective_scaled = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(x, A_scaled))
problem_scaled = cp.Problem(objective_scaled, constraints)
problem_scaled.solve()

print("\nStatus (Scaled):", problem_scaled.status)
print("Optimal value (Scaled):", problem_scaled.value)
print("Optimal solution (Scaled):", x.value)
```

This demonstrates a situation with an ill-conditioned matrix `A` in the quadratic objective. The large difference in magnitude between the eigenvalues of `A` can lead to numerical instability and inaccurate results.  The improved version illustrates preconditioning through scaling the matrix `A`, which often improves the solver's performance and accuracy.  Note that preconditioning strategies need to be tailored to the specific problem's structure.

**Example 3: Incorrect Solver Selection**

```python
import cvxpy as cp

# Define variables
x = cp.Variable(100)

# Define objective function
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.sum_squares(x))

# Define constraints
constraints = [cp.sum(x) == 1, x >= 0]

# Define problem with a potentially unsuitable solver (e.g., ECOS for large-scale problems)
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve(solver=cp.ECOS) #Try with other solvers like SCS or OSQP


# Print results
print("Status:", problem.status)
print("Optimal value:", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution:", x.value)

problem.solve(solver=cp.SCS)
print("\nStatus (SCS):", problem.status)
print("Optimal value (SCS):", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution (SCS):", x.value)

problem.solve(solver=cp.OSQP)
print("\nStatus (OSQP):", problem.status)
print("Optimal value (OSQP):", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution (OSQP):", x.value)
```

Here, we show a relatively large-scale QP. The default solver might not be the most efficient or numerically stable.  Trying different solvers like SCS or OSQP, known for their performance on large-scale problems, might yield better results. The output demonstrates the variation in results and solver status depending on the solver chosen, emphasizing the need for solver selection based on problem characteristics.


In conclusion, resolving infeasibility or inaccuracy in CVXPY QP problems necessitates a systematic approach.  Begin by thoroughly verifying the problem's formulation, paying close attention to constraint consistency and objective function correctness. Then, assess the numerical properties of the input data, specifically the condition number of relevant matrices, employing preconditioning techniques if necessary. Finally, experiment with different solvers within CVXPY, selecting the one best suited to the problem's size and structure.  Remember that careful attention to detail and iterative refinement are crucial in obtaining reliable and accurate solutions for quadratic programming problems using CVXPY.  For deeper understanding of numerical optimization and convex optimization techniques, I would recommend consulting standard texts on these subjects.  Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms employed by different solvers will greatly enhance your ability to diagnose and resolve such issues.
