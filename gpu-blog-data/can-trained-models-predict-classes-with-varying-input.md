The core challenge in applying trained models to inputs of varying shapes lies in the inherent expectation of most machine learning architectures for consistent input dimensionality.  My experience working on image classification for satellite imagery, where image resolutions varied wildly due to sensor limitations and cloud cover, highlighted this issue acutely.  Successfully handling variable input shapes requires careful consideration of the model architecture, pre-processing steps, and potentially the training strategy itself.  A naive approach will simply fail.

**1.  Explanation:**

The vast majority of machine learning models, particularly those built using common frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, are designed to operate on tensors of a fixed size.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for example, expect input images to have a specific height and width.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), while more flexible with sequence length to some extent, still require consistent input vector dimensions at each time step.  This fixed-size requirement stems from the weight matrices within these models.  These matrices are pre-defined during the model's initialization and are specifically sized to match the input tensor's dimensions.  Providing an input of a different shape will lead to a shape mismatch error, preventing the model from performing any computation.

To overcome this, several strategies can be employed.  The most common approach involves preprocessing the inputs to standardize their shape.  This could involve resizing images, padding sequences, or other transformations depending on the data type and model.  Alternatively, more sophisticated architectures can be designed to inherently accommodate variable-sized inputs.  These include models utilizing attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input regardless of its overall size, or architectures that employ techniques like pooling to summarize information across different input dimensions.  The choice of strategy depends critically on the nature of the data and the performance trade-offs involved.  In my experience, simple resizing often proves insufficient for complex tasks, leading to a drop in accuracy.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Image Resizing for CNNs (Python with TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array

def preprocess_image(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)):
    img = load_img(image_path, target_size=target_size)
    img_array = img_to_array(img)
    img_array = img_array / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    return img_array

# Example usage:
image = preprocess_image("path/to/image.jpg")
image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0) # Add batch dimension
predictions = model.predict(image)
```

This example demonstrates a common preprocessing step for CNNs.  Images are loaded using Keras's `load_img` function, automatically resized to the `target_size`.  Normalization is crucial for improved model performance.  The `tf.expand_dims` function adds a batch dimension, essential for compatibility with TensorFlow's prediction methods.  Note that this approach sacrifices information present in the original image if the aspect ratio is changed.

**Example 2: Padding Sequences for RNNs (Python with PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Assume 'sequences' is a list of sequences of varying lengths
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = [F.pad(torch.tensor(seq), (0, max_len - len(seq))) for seq in sequences]
padded_sequences = torch.stack(padded_sequences)

# Pass padded_sequences to your RNN model
output = model(padded_sequences)
```

This example showcases padding for RNNs.  We determine the maximum sequence length and pad shorter sequences with zeros using PyTorch's `F.pad` function.  `torch.stack` converts the list of padded sequences into a tensor suitable for input to the RNN.  While effective, padding can introduce noise if not handled carefully, particularly with long sequences and less relevant padded values.

**Example 3:  Using a CNN with Global Average Pooling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(None, None, 3)), # Note: (None, None, 3) allows variable input shape
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(...)
```

This example demonstrates how Global Average Pooling (GAP) can be used to handle variable input shapes within a CNN.  By specifying `input_shape=(None, None, 3)`, we tell the model to accept images with variable height and width, maintaining only the channel dimension (3 for RGB).  GAP then summarizes the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers into a fixed-size vector, regardless of the input image's dimensions, before feeding them to the final dense layer.  GAP offers a computationally efficient means of dealing with variable-sized inputs, though some information loss is inherent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

1.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on architectural choices and data preprocessing strategies.
2.  Research papers on attention mechanisms and their application in handling variable-length sequences.
3.  Documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.), focusing on layers capable of handling variable-sized inputs, and best practices in data preprocessing.


In summary, effectively dealing with variable input shapes requires a multifaceted approach.  Careful consideration of preprocessing techniques alongside the adoption of architectures designed for such flexibility are both crucial for success.  The choice of method should depend heavily on the specific characteristics of the data and the performance requirements of the application.  Relying solely on naive resizing or padding often proves suboptimal, and a deeper understanding of the underlying model architecture is essential for achieving robust results.  My personal experience underscores the necessity of thorough evaluation and experimentation to find the optimal solution for any given scenario.
