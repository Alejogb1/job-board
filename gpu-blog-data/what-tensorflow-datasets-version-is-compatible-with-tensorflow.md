TensorFlow 1.x, specifically version 1.15, predates the introduction of the `tensorflow_datasets` package in its modern form.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects during that era involved significant manual dataset management, highlighting the critical difference in data handling approaches between TensorFlow 1.x and subsequent versions.  There wasn't a dedicated, officially supported `tensorflow_datasets` library readily available for seamless integration with TensorFlow 1.15.

1. **Explanation:** The `tensorflow_datasets` library, as we know it today, emerged as a significant improvement to TensorFlow's data pipeline capabilities, primarily after the release of TensorFlow 2.x.  Its streamlined approach to downloading, preparing, and utilizing various datasets dramatically contrasts with the more manual processes necessary when working with TensorFlow 1.15.  To use datasets with TensorFlow 1.15, developers had to rely on alternative methods, including custom data loaders built using TensorFlow's lower-level APIs like `tf.data`, or by manually downloading and pre-processing datasets before feeding them into the model.

The incompatibility stems from the fundamental architectural differences between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x. TensorFlow 1.x utilized a static computational graph, requiring the entire graph to be defined before execution. This contrasts with TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution, allowing for more interactive and dynamic computation.  The `tensorflow_datasets` library leverages features and functionalities deeply embedded in TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution mode and its revamped data pipeline infrastructure.  Attempting to directly use `tensorflow_datasets` with TensorFlow 1.15 would result in immediate import errors due to missing dependencies and incompatible APIs.

2. **Code Examples and Commentary:**  The following illustrate the approach to handling datasets within the constraints of TensorFlow 1.15,  underlining the significant departure from the `tensorflow_datasets` paradigm.

**Example 1:  Manual Data Loading with `tf.data` (TensorFlow 1.15)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume 'data.npy' and 'labels.npy' contain pre-processed data and labels.
data = np.load('data.npy')
labels = np.load('labels.npy')

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))

# Batching and preprocessing
dataset = dataset.batch(32).shuffle(buffer_size=10000).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Iterate through the dataset
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
next_element = iterator.get_next()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        while True:
            batch_data, batch_labels = sess.run(next_element)
            # Process the batch
            print("Batch Shape:", batch_data.shape)
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        pass
```

*Commentary:* This code demonstrates a basic data loading pipeline using `tf.data` in TensorFlow 1.15.  Note the manual loading of data from `.npy` files (assuming prior preprocessing) and the explicit use of `tf.Session` for execution.  This approach necessitates significant upfront effort in data preparation and management, a stark contrast to the convenience offered by `tensorflow_datasets`.

**Example 2:  Using a Custom Input Function (TensorFlow 1.15)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def input_fn():
    data = np.load('data.npy')
    labels = np.load('labels.npy')
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)).batch(32)
    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
    next_element = iterator.get_next()
    return next_element

# Model definition (simplified)
features, labels = input_fn()
# ...rest of the model definition using features and labels...
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates utilizing a custom input function, a common pattern in TensorFlow 1.x for feeding data to the model.  Again, the reliance on pre-processed data is evident, emphasizing the lack of integrated dataset management.

**Example 3:  Simple CSV Loading (TensorFlow 1.15)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Assuming data is in a CSV file
csv_data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
data = csv_data.drop('label', axis=1).values  # Assuming 'label' is the target column
labels = csv_data['label'].values

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)).batch(32)
#...rest of the pipeline as in Example 1...
```

*Commentary:*  This shows a simplified example using a CSV file.  This approach, while seemingly straightforward, still requires manual handling of data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering, unlike the capabilities offered by `tensorflow_datasets`.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**  For working with datasets in TensorFlow 1.15, I'd recommend revisiting the official TensorFlow 1.x documentation related to the `tf.data` API.  Furthermore, studying examples of custom input functions within TensorFlow 1.x model tutorials would prove beneficial. Exploring documentation on NumPy and Pandas for efficient data handling and manipulation in preparation for feeding data to TensorFlow 1.15 models is crucial. Finally, a deep understanding of the intricacies of the TensorFlow 1.x computational graph is essential for optimal performance and to circumvent potential bottlenecks arising from improper data pipeline design.  These resources, combined with experience and methodical approach to data pre-processing, are key to successfully managing datasets within the constraints of TensorFlow 1.15.
