Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, by design, evaluates loss across all classes, implicitly seeking balanced performance. However, situations frequently arise where maximizing recall for a specific class, even at the potential cost of precision in others, becomes paramount. I've faced this exact scenario during anomaly detection projects, where identifying a critical fault (the minority class) outweighs the cost of occasional false positives. Directly manipulating the loss function to emphasize a particular class requires a strategic approach, as Sparse Categorical Crossentropy doesn't offer per-class weighting natively.

The fundamental challenge stems from the uniform treatment of each instance during loss calculation. While class imbalance can be addressed using sample weighting, these weights operate on a per-sample basis and do not discriminate on the output probabilities predicted for specific classes. Instead, to directly target recall, we must reshape the loss computation by introducing per-class weighting factors within the gradient update. The most direct method I've found is to redefine the loss with a custom implementation that takes into account the importance of correct classification of the specific target class. This can be realized by modifying the gradient of the standard loss function to be larger if the target class is predicted incorrectly and smaller if it is predicted correctly.

The key to this strategy is creating a custom loss function that inherits from `tf.keras.losses.Loss`. The core mechanism within this custom loss is manipulating the cross-entropy contribution for the class we are targeting. Instead of using the direct output probability, we would scale the contribution of the gradient of the target class based on whether the true label belongs to that class, thus creating an asymmetric learning rate, thus effectively maximizing recall for that class. Here's how I typically accomplish it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightedRecallLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, target_class, recall_weight, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.target_class = target_class
        self.recall_weight = recall_weight

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        y_true = tf.cast(y_true, dtype=tf.int32)
        y_true_onehot = tf.one_hot(y_true, depth=tf.shape(y_pred)[1]) # Convert sparse labels to one-hot
        loss_values = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, from_logits=True)

        target_class_mask = tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, self.target_class), dtype=tf.float32)

        # Ensure the shape matches for element-wise multiplication
        target_class_mask = tf.reshape(target_class_mask, [-1, 1])
        
        # Create a tensor for scaling the gradients
        scaling_tensor = tf.ones_like(loss_values, dtype=tf.float32)
        scaling_tensor = tf.where(tf.reduce_any(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, self.target_class), dtype=tf.int32),axis=1), tf.fill(tf.shape(loss_values), self.recall_weight), scaling_tensor)

        weighted_loss = loss_values * scaling_tensor
        
        return weighted_loss

# Example Usage
num_classes = 3
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=None) # No activation to be able to pass logits to the loss
])

# Example Usage - weighting class index 1 with a weight of 5
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
weighted_recall_loss = WeightedRecallLoss(target_class=1, recall_weight=5)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=weighted_recall_loss, metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In this implementation, I first convert the sparse labels to one-hot for compatibility with the element-wise comparison. Then I determine which samples are of the target class through the `target_class_mask`, and use `tf.where` to create the scaling tensor, with the `recall_weight` only being applied to samples of the target class. This tensor is applied to the loss values. The `recall_weight` is a hyperparameter that governs the influence of incorrect classification of the target class, higher values force the gradient to shift focus to the target class.

Another effective approach involves directly manipulating the logits before they are passed to the standard cross-entropy calculation. By scaling the logits corresponding to the target class after the final dense layer, the model is incentivized to output larger logit values for this class.  I've used this method with success, particularly when fine-tuning pre-trained models. This approach can be implemented as a custom layer that manipulates the logits on a per-class basis.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class LogitScalingLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, target_class, scale_factor, **kwargs):
        super(LogitScalingLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.target_class = target_class
        self.scale_factor = scale_factor

    def call(self, inputs):
       # Create a mask of zeros with the same shape as the input
        mask = tf.zeros_like(inputs)
        
        # Create a one-hot vector where only the target class is 1, all other classes 0
        updates = tf.one_hot(self.target_class, depth=tf.shape(inputs)[1])
        
        # Apply the scaling factor to the target class logit
        updated_values = updates * self.scale_factor
        
        # Add the updated value to the zero filled mask
        mask = mask + updated_values
        
        # Apply the mask to the input
        output = inputs + mask
        
        return output

# Example Usage
num_classes = 3
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=None), # Output logits
    LogitScalingLayer(target_class=1, scale_factor=2.0) # scale target class logits, class index 1
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In this implementation, I add the `LogitScalingLayer` after the final `Dense` layer. The layer creates a mask tensor, which contains only a scaled 1 at the target class position, with all other positions as 0. This mask is added to the final logits, thus scaling the logits of the target class by the `scale_factor`. The standard `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss is applied afterward. This technique focuses on shifting the decision boundary by amplifying the target class's output probability, which has, in my experience, improved recall specifically when used in conjunction with class weighting.

Another strategy I've employed, particularly in complex models, is implementing a recall-focused metric within the training loop. This metric is calculated on a per-epoch basis and can be used to monitor performance and, when used with callbacks, adjust the learning rate or early stop training if the recall isn't improving. While this does not directly alter the loss, it allows for a more controlled training process based on the desired metric, supplementing other loss adjustment techniques.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def recall_metric(target_class):
    def recall(y_true, y_pred):
        y_true = K.cast(y_true, dtype='int32')
        y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), dtype='int32')

        true_positives = K.sum(K.cast(K.equal(y_true, target_class), dtype='int32') * K.cast(K.equal(y_pred, target_class), dtype='int32'))
        possible_positives = K.sum(K.cast(K.equal(y_true, target_class), dtype='int32'))

        recall_value = true_positives / (possible_positives + K.epsilon())
        return recall_value
    return recall

# Example Usage:
num_classes = 3
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=None)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
recall_metric_for_class_1 = recall_metric(target_class=1) # metric for class index 1

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=[recall_metric_for_class_1])
```
This function computes the recall specifically for the target class using true and predicted labels, which allows the tracking of training progress towards maximizing recall for that class. The metric function uses `K.argmax` to determine the predicted class from the network's output logits. It then constructs a logical vector indicating whether the true label is of the specified target class. The recall is then computed as `true_positives` / `possible_positives`, with `K.epsilon()` added to avoid divide by zero errors. Using this as a training metric allows you to keep a close eye on the recall of the target class, and implement custom training loops or callbacks based on this recall.

While libraries offer tools for handling class imbalance (e.g., sample weighting) and provide metrics to monitor specific classes, they often don't offer the flexibility to directly manipulate the gradient with respect to a specific class. The custom loss function, logit manipulation, and targeted metric techniques outlined above represent essential tools I've developed for addressing these nuances.

For additional research I would recommend consulting academic literature focusing on cost-sensitive learning and class-imbalanced data. Additionally, reviewing the TensorFlow documentation regarding custom training loops and loss functions will also provide valuable insights. I also find it useful to study the implementation of common loss functions like `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` as a method of learning how to implement custom losses. Furthermore, exploring advanced metrics related to recall precision, like the F1 score, can provide a more holistic understanding of the performance of the model.
