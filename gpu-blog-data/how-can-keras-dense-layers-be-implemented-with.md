The constraint of shared weights within Keras Dense layers isn't directly supported through native layer configurations.  My experience working on large-scale neural networks for image recognition, particularly those involving Siamese networks and multi-task learning, highlighted this limitation early on.  Achieving weight sharing necessitates a more nuanced approach, leveraging custom layers or model construction techniques.  This response will delineate three distinct methods for implementing shared weights, each with its own trade-offs.


**1.  Custom Layer Implementation:**

This approach offers the most direct control.  We create a custom layer that explicitly manages weight sharing.  This involves defining a single weight tensor thatâ€™s then applied across multiple Dense layers within the model.  This avoids redundancy and ensures consistent parameter updates.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class SharedWeightDense(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SharedWeightDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='glorot_uniform',
                                      trainable=True,
                                      name='shared_kernel')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                    initializer='zeros',
                                    trainable=True,
                                    name='shared_bias')
        super(SharedWeightDense, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias

# Example usage:
shared_dense = SharedWeightDense(64)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,)),
    shared_dense,
    keras.layers.Activation('relu'),
    shared_dense, # Shares weights with the first shared_dense layer.
    keras.layers.Activation('relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10) #This layer has its own independent weights.
])
model.compile(...)
```

In this example, `SharedWeightDense` acts as a wrapper, defining a single set of `kernel` and `bias` weights.  The `build` method ensures proper weight initialization, while `call` performs the matrix multiplication. Crucially, subsequent instances of `SharedWeightDense` within the model reuse the same weights, achieving the desired sharing.  The final Dense layer showcases how independent layers can coexist alongside shared weight components.  Note that, in more complex scenarios involving multiple shared-weight groups,  a more elaborate weight management system might be necessary, potentially involving dictionaries to map layers to weight tensors.


**2.  Weight Sharing through Model Subclassing:**

For more complex architectures, model subclassing offers greater flexibility.  This involves creating a custom model class that explicitly defines the layers and their weight relationships.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class SharedWeightModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(SharedWeightModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(units, use_bias=False, kernel_initializer=self.dense1.kernel_initializer) #share weights with dense1, no bias

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        x = self.dense2(x) # Weight sharing happens automatically due to same kernel initializer and no bias
        return x

# Example usage
model = SharedWeightModel(64)
model.compile(...)
```

Here, `SharedWeightModel` instantiates two Dense layers.  The key is using the same `kernel_initializer` for both layers. This method achieves weight sharing implicitly without manual weight management, but limits control over the exact weight update procedure. Notably, the bias term is removed from `dense2` to explicitly share only the kernel weights, and ensure exact duplication; adding a bias to the second layer would disrupt perfect weight sharing.  This method is simpler for less complex configurations but might not scale well for intricate architectures requiring selective weight sharing across multiple layers.

**3.  Functional API with Layer Reuse:**

The Keras functional API offers a third approach.  We create a Dense layer instance and then reuse it within the model definition.  This again relies on referencing the same layer instance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a single Dense layer
shared_dense = keras.layers.Dense(64, name='shared_dense_layer')

# Create the model using the functional API
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = shared_dense(inputs)
x = keras.layers.Activation('relu')(x)
x = shared_dense(x) # Reuse the shared_dense layer
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.compile(...)
```

This method is concise and avoids custom layer definitions, making it relatively straightforward.  However, modifications to the original `shared_dense` layer would automatically propagate to all its instances within the model.  This can be beneficial for maintaining consistency but potentially less flexible if selective modification across shared instances is desired.  This necessitates careful management of the original layer definition.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning (e.g., *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville);  advanced tutorials on custom layer implementation and the functional API in Keras.  Focusing on these resources will provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge to tackle advanced custom layer creation and manipulation in TensorFlow/Keras.  Understanding the underlying TensorFlow graph operations will also significantly aid in debugging and optimization.


In conclusion, implementing shared weights in Keras Dense layers necessitates moving beyond the standard layer API.  Custom layers offer granular control, while model subclassing and the functional API provide alternative, more streamlined approaches.  The choice depends on the specific architecture and complexity of the weight-sharing scheme.  The selection of methods should be guided by the need for control, maintainability, and overall model complexity.  Careful consideration of these factors ensures both the correctness and efficiency of the implementation.
