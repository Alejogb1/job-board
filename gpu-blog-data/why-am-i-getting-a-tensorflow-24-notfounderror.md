The `NotFoundError` in TensorFlow 2.4, specifically when interacting with a Keras `Conv1D` layer, often stems from inconsistencies between the input tensor's shape and the layer's expected input shape. This discrepancy isn't always immediately apparent, particularly when dealing with dynamic shapes or data preprocessing that might inadvertently alter the tensor dimensions.  My experience working on large-scale time-series forecasting models has shown this error to be a persistent challenge, primarily because of the subtle ways dimension mismatches can manifest.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `Conv1D` layer, designed for processing sequential data, requires a specific input tensor format.  This format is typically a three-dimensional tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_channels)`.  The `batch_size` represents the number of samples in a batch, `sequence_length` defines the length of each input sequence (e.g., the number of time steps in a time series), and `input_channels` indicates the number of features at each time step.  If your input tensor deviates from this expected shape—for instance, if you provide a two-dimensional tensor, or if the `sequence_length` or `input_channels` values are incorrect—TensorFlow will throw a `NotFoundError`.  The error message itself might not directly point to the shape mismatch, often obscuring the root cause.  This necessitates careful examination of the input tensor's shape at various stages of your model's data pipeline.  Furthermore, issues related to data type compatibility, though less frequent, can also trigger this error. Ensure that the input data type matches the expected data type of the `Conv1D` layer.

Another less common, but crucial, aspect is the potential for the error to arise from improper handling of model saving and loading. If the model architecture is not perfectly recreated during loading, discrepancies can occur that might manifest as `NotFoundError` during inference. This usually involves carefully checking for version compatibility between TensorFlow versions when saving and loading.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Input Shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,1)), # Expecting (batch_size, 100, 1)
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect input shape: Missing batch dimension
incorrect_input = tf.random.normal((100,1)) 
try:
    model.predict(incorrect_input)
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This will raise a NotFoundError
    print("Input shape should be (batch_size, sequence_length, input_channels)")


# Correct input shape
correct_input = tf.random.normal((32, 100, 1))
model.predict(correct_input) # This will execute without error
```

This example clearly demonstrates the crucial role of the input shape.  The `NotFoundError` is explicitly triggered by providing a two-dimensional tensor instead of the expected three-dimensional tensor.  The `input_shape` argument in the `Conv1D` layer declaration specifies the expected shape for each sample within a batch, excluding the batch size dimension itself.


**Example 2:  Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 1), dtype=tf.float32),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect data type
incorrect_input = np.random.rand(32, 100, 1).astype(np.int32)
try:
    model.predict(incorrect_input)
except Exception as e:  # Catching broader Exception since error might not be specifically NotFoundError for type mismatch
    print(f"Error: {e}") #  This will likely throw an error, but not necessarily NotFoundError. The error message is key.

# Correct data type
correct_input = tf.random.normal((32, 100, 1))
model.predict(correct_input) # This will execute without error
```

While a data type mismatch might not always lead to a `NotFoundError` directly, it can trigger other exceptions that halt execution. This example highlights the importance of aligning the data type of the input with the specified `dtype` in the layer definition.  Explicit type casting using TensorFlow's `tf.cast` function is recommended for safer data handling.


**Example 3:  Reshaping for Compatibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Input data potentially requiring reshaping
input_data = tf.random.normal((32, 100)) # Incorrect shape (32,100)

# Reshape to match expected input shape (32, 100, 1)
reshaped_input = tf.reshape(input_data, (32, 100, 1))
model.predict(reshaped_input) # This will execute without error
```

This example illustrates a practical solution for resolving shape discrepancies.  By explicitly reshaping the input tensor using `tf.reshape`, we ensure its compatibility with the `Conv1D` layer's expectations.  This approach is particularly useful when dealing with data loaded from various sources that might not have the precisely required shape initially.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable, particularly the sections on Keras layers and model building.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions, including `tf.reshape`, `tf.cast`, and shape-related attributes, is crucial for debugging these types of issues.  Exploring examples in the TensorFlow tutorials that utilize `Conv1D` layers can provide practical insights into common best practices and pitfalls to avoid. Finally, I found that meticulously logging tensor shapes throughout the data preprocessing and model training pipelines using `tf.print` statements is exceptionally useful in diagnosing shape-related issues.  These practices helped me substantially during my work on similar projects.
