The SciPy optimization algorithms, specifically those within the `scipy.optimize` module like `minimize`, `curve_fit`, and related functions, feature a `callback` parameter intended to execute a user-defined function at each iteration of the optimization process. However, if the callback is observed to be executed only once, it's typically not a flaw within SciPy itself but rather a consequence of the chosen optimization method and its inherent behavior. From my experience debugging similar optimization routines, the root cause is often tied to the algorithm reaching convergence – or prematurely halting – after only a single evaluation of the objective function.

The essential characteristic of a callback function is its invocation after each iteration in the optimization loop, with an iteration defined as a complete calculation of the objective function and potential gradient updates. If an algorithm converges immediately, perhaps because it started at an optimal point or because the initial guess is very close to an optimal region within its tolerance settings, there might be only one iteration performed. Consequently, the callback would be triggered only once, leading to the apparent anomaly that it is "only called once." Consider, for instance, a trivial objective function which has an easy solution. In that case, the optimization algorithm might find it right away.

Here is an example demonstrating this concept using `scipy.optimize.minimize` and the `BFGS` method, known for its efficiency in many situations. I will begin with an objective function that provides an almost ideal starting position for the optimizer:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_func(x):
    """A simple quadratic objective function."""
    return x**2

def callback_func(xk, *args, **kwargs):
    """A simple callback function."""
    print(f"Iteration: {kwargs['nit']}, x = {xk}")

# Initial guess
x0 = 0.001
result = minimize(objective_func, x0, method='BFGS', callback=callback_func)
print(f"\nOptimization result: {result.message}")
```

In this code block, the objective function is x², a simple parabola. The `BFGS` method, initialized extremely close to zero (0.001), will typically converge in a single iteration due to the quadratic nature of the objective and the efficiency of the BFGS algorithm when near the solution. The callback function will therefore report only one iteration. The "nit" key added to the `kwargs` by `minimize` exposes the iteration number. The output will show that the `callback_func` was indeed executed only once before convergence was achieved.

However, if we alter the problem such that the initial guess is farther from the solution or make the problem more difficult by adding other components to the function, we can then observe the behavior of callback being executed on each iteration. The following modified example illustrates this.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_func_complex(x):
    """A slightly more complex objective function with local minima."""
    return 0.1*x**4 + 0.5*x**3 - 2*x**2 - 1*x + 4

def callback_func_complex(xk, *args, **kwargs):
    """A callback function printing the iteration number."""
    print(f"Iteration: {kwargs['nit']}, x = {xk}, Objective Value = {objective_func_complex(xk)}")


# Initial guess
x0_complex = 2.5
result_complex = minimize(objective_func_complex, x0_complex, method='BFGS', callback=callback_func_complex)
print(f"\nOptimization result: {result_complex.message}")
```

In this second example, the objective function is a polynomial that possesses a more complex shape with multiple local minima. Using an initial guess of 2.5, the BFGS algorithm must perform multiple steps to find the minimum within its tolerance, resulting in multiple calls to our callback function. The output of this code will display several iteration details, showcasing that the `callback` parameter functions as expected. The increase in function complexity and the change in the starting point allow the algorithm to explore the function more extensively before convergence.

Another factor that could result in the callback being called only once is setting very strict convergence tolerances. When these tolerances are very tight, the optimization algorithm may only take one or two steps before reaching the threshold. Consider the modified version of the first example.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_func(x):
    """A simple quadratic objective function."""
    return x**2

def callback_func(xk, *args, **kwargs):
    """A simple callback function."""
    print(f"Iteration: {kwargs['nit']}, x = {xk}")

# Initial guess
x0 = 0.1
result = minimize(objective_func, x0, method='BFGS', callback=callback_func, tol=1e-10)
print(f"\nOptimization result: {result.message}")
```

Here, we set a very low tolerance of `1e-10`. This means the algorithm will stop when changes in function value are extremely small. Given the shape of x², the algorithm can hit this tolerance in the early iterations. This further reinforces the fact that the number of callback executions depends heavily on the problem and the settings.

When working with complex optimization problems and debugging behaviors like the callback being called only once, consider the following resources: The SciPy documentation for `scipy.optimize`, particularly the documentation for each specific optimization method like BFGS, L-BFGS-B, and Nelder-Mead; various numerical optimization textbooks outlining optimization algorithms and their convergence properties; and finally, case studies and tutorials on applying SciPy for optimization problems.

In summary, the observed behavior of the SciPy callback function being called only once is not a defect in SciPy but is instead a direct consequence of the optimizer’s convergence or its stopping criteria after a single calculation. The specific objective function, the initial guess provided, and the tolerances specified collectively influence the number of iterations and thus the number of times the callback will execute. By adjusting these parameters, a user can ensure the callback functions as intended during optimization.
