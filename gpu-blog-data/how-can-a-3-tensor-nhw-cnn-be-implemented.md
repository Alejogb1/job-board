The core challenge in implementing a 3-tensor (N, H, W) CNN in TensorFlow/Keras lies in correctly interpreting the input data and adapting the convolutional layers accordingly.  My experience working on hyperspectral image classification projects highlighted the need for careful consideration of the tensor's dimensions: N represents the number of spectral bands, H the height, and W the width of the image.  A naive approach treating the spectral dimension as a channel in a standard RGB image often yields suboptimal results, necessitating a customized convolutional architecture.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A standard CNN expects input data in the form (N, H, W, C), where C represents the number of channels.  Our 3-tensor (N, H, W) lacks the explicit channel dimension.  To address this, we must either reshape the input data or utilize specialized convolutional operations.

The first approach involves treating each spectral band as a separate channel. This is achieved by reshaping the input tensor to (N, H, W, 1) before feeding it into the convolutional layers. This approach is straightforward but might not fully leverage the inherent spectral relationships. It treats each band independently, potentially missing crucial inter-band correlations.

Alternatively, we can employ 1D convolutions along the spectral dimension (N) before applying 2D convolutions on the spatial dimensions (H, W). This approach explicitly considers the spectral relationships, potentially leading to improved performance, especially when spectral features are highly correlated.  A third, less common approach is to employ 3D convolutions across all three dimensions (N, H, W), effectively treating the entire 3-tensor as a single input volume. This demands significantly more computational resources but offers the most comprehensive consideration of inter-band and spatial relationships.

The choice of approach depends heavily on the characteristics of the data and the computational resources available.  In my experience, the optimal solution frequently involved a hybrid approach, combining 1D and 2D convolutions to balance computational efficiency with feature extraction effectiveness.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Reshaping to (N, H, W, 1) and using 2D convolutions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample input data (replace with your actual data)
input_data = tf.random.normal((100, 64, 64, 20)) # N=20, H=64, W=64

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Reshape((64, 64, 20)), # Reshape to (H,W,N) for Keras conv2D layers
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(input_data, tf.random.uniform((100,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), epochs=10)
```

This example showcases the simplest approach. The input is reshaped to add a channel dimension, enabling the use of standard 2D convolutional layers.  The limitations are evident:  spectral information is treated independently from spatial information.


**Example 2: 1D convolutions along spectral dimension followed by 2D convolutions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_data = tf.random.normal((100, 20, 64, 64)) # N=20, H=64, W=64

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv1D(16, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(20, 64*64)), # 1D conv on spectral dimension
    keras.layers.Reshape((16, 64, 64)), # Reshape for 2D convolutions
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Before feeding to the model, reshape input to (samples, spectral_bands, height*width)
reshaped_input = tf.reshape(input_data, (100, 20, 64*64))

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(reshaped_input, tf.random.uniform((100,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), epochs=10)
```

Here, 1D convolutions are used to capture spectral correlations before applying 2D convolutions for spatial feature extraction. This approach is more computationally intensive but provides a more nuanced understanding of the data. Note the reshaping required to match the input shape of the `Conv1D` layer.


**Example 3:  3D convolutions (computationally expensive)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_data = tf.random.normal((100, 20, 64, 64)) # N=20, H=64, W=64

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(20, 64, 64)), # 3D convolution
    keras.layers.MaxPooling3D((2, 2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(input_data, tf.random.uniform((100,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates the use of 3D convolutions.  This approach is computationally intensive and may only be feasible for smaller datasets or with high-performance hardware.  The 3D convolution captures relationships across all three dimensions simultaneously.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of convolutional neural networks and their applications, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks.  Furthermore, specialized publications focusing on hyperspectral image processing and remote sensing would offer invaluable insights into effective architectures for this type of data.  Finally, thorough study of TensorFlow/Keras documentation is crucial for practical implementation.  Familiarity with tensor manipulation using NumPy is also highly beneficial.
