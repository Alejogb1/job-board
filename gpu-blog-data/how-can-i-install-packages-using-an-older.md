The core issue lies in managing the Python environment and leveraging tools designed for precisely this purpose.  Over the years, I've encountered numerous scenarios requiring the installation of packages under specific Python versions, primarily during legacy project maintenance and compatibility testing.  The inherent challenge stems from the fact that system-wide Python installations often conflict, and using `pip` directly may inadvertently install packages into the wrong environment.  This necessitates the use of virtual environments and careful attention to `pip` invocation.

My approach consistently prioritizes virtual environments. These isolated spaces prevent package conflicts and ensure that each project maintains its own distinct Python version and associated dependencies.  The `venv` module, introduced in Python 3.3, and its predecessor `virtualenv` are indispensable tools in this process.

**1.  Explanation: Utilizing Virtual Environments for Package Management**

The fundamental strategy involves creating a virtual environment, activating it, and then executing the `pip` command within the context of that environment.  This confines all package installations and their dependencies to the isolated space. Subsequently, activating the specific virtual environment ensures that the correct Python interpreter and its associated `pip` are used.  Attempting to install packages globally without a virtual environment, especially when multiple Python versions coexist, almost guarantees inconsistencies and potential system instability.

The process involves three key steps:

* **Creation:** Employing either `venv` or `virtualenv` to generate a new virtual environment, specifying the desired Python interpreter.
* **Activation:** Activating the newly created virtual environment to make it the active Python environment. This alters the system's `PATH` variable to prioritize the interpreter and `pip` within the virtual environment.
* **Installation:** Utilizing `pip` within the activated environment to install the necessary packages. The installed packages will reside solely within the confines of this environment.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `venv` with Python 3.7**

This example demonstrates the creation and use of a virtual environment using the built-in `venv` module, assuming Python 3.7 is available on your system.  I've used this method extensively for quick project setups.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'py37env' using Python 3.7
python3.7 -m venv py37env

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source py37env/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
py37env\Scripts\activate

# Install a specific package within the environment
pip install requests

# Verify the installation (optional)
pip show requests

# Deactivate the environment when finished
deactivate
```

The commentary here emphasizes the system-specific activation commands, a crucial detail often overlooked. The use of `pip show requests` post-installation provides a confirmation step, a habit I've found extremely useful in debugging.


**Example 2:  Utilizing `virtualenv` for older Python versions (Python 2.7)**

`virtualenv` offers greater flexibility, particularly when dealing with older Python versions that lack the built-in `venv` module.  In my experience, this is invaluable when working with legacy systems.  This example uses Python 2.7.  Note that `virtualenv` needs to be installed separately using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install python-virtualenv` on Debian-based systems, `brew install virtualenv` on macOS using Homebrew).

```bash
# Install virtualenv (if not already installed)
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment named 'py27env' using Python 2.7
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 py27env

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source py27env/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
py27env\Scripts\activate

# Install a package using pip
pip install numpy

# Deactivate the environment
deactivate
```

The crucial aspect here is the explicit specification of the Python interpreter path (`-p /usr/bin/python2.7`) within the `virtualenv` command.  This directly addresses the challenge of selecting the desired Python version.  The path might need adjustment based on your system's Python installation.


**Example 3: Handling package conflicts within virtual environments**

Even within a virtual environment, conflicts might arise, particularly with package dependencies.  Using `requirements.txt` files mitigate this. I've adopted this practice to ensure reproducibility and ease of collaboration.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (using venv or virtualenv - method shown above)
# Activate the environment

# Install packages from a requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate a requirements.txt file (after installation)
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Deactivate the environment
```

This approach involves listing all dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file.  This file facilitates easy recreation of the environment on other machines or after a system reinstall. Freezing the dependencies using `pip freeze` and redirecting the output to the file is crucial for project management.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official Python documentation on `venv` and `virtualenv`.  Thorough understanding of the `pip` command-line interface and its options.  A comprehensive book on Python package management would also be beneficial.


In summary, meticulously managing Python environments through the consistent use of virtual environments, coupled with the strategic use of `requirements.txt` files, provides a robust solution for installing packages with older Python versions. These practices eliminate common conflicts and foster reproducible environments, significantly improving the stability and maintainability of your projects, particularly those involving multiple Python versions.  This structured approach is, in my experience, the most effective way to navigate the complexities of cross-version package management.
