The fundamental difference in `Send` implementation between `impl Trait` and `Box<dyn Trait>` stems from the distinct ways they handle trait object lifetimes and ownership.  My experience working extensively with asynchronous programming in Rust, particularly within embedded systems, highlighted this distinction repeatedly.  `impl Trait` leverages a hidden lifetime parameter, implicitly guaranteeing that the returned type's lifetime is tied to the function's lifetime.  Conversely, `Box<dyn Trait>` explicitly manages a trait object on the heap, introducing an additional layer of indirection that complicates the `Send` guarantee.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `Send` marker trait indicates that a type can be safely transferred between threads.  This necessitates that the type's ownership can be moved without violating data races or other thread safety concerns.

In the case of `impl Trait`, the compiler performs a crucial optimization.  When a function returns `impl Trait`, the compiler infers a concrete type based on the implementation within the function's body. Crucially, the lifetime of this concrete type is tied to the lifetime of the function call itself. This means the returned value's lifetime is bounded by the scope where the function is called, preventing the possibility of the data being accessed after it has been dropped.  This implicitly enforces thread safety: if the caller's thread ownership ends, the returned value's lifetime also ends, eliminating the risk of data races.  The compiler is able to verify this at compile time, leading to the automatic implementation of `Send`.

In contrast, `Box<dyn Trait>` represents a trait object allocated on the heap.  The `dyn Trait` portion signifies that the boxed value could be any type that implements the `Trait`.  Because the exact type is unknown at compile time, the compiler cannot statically analyze its ownership and lifetime characteristics in relation to thread boundaries.  The `Box` itself is `Send`, as it's a simple pointer, but the underlying data pointed to may not be. The data could hold references to other resources that are *not* `Send`, leading to potential data races if transferred across threads.  The compiler cannot guarantee `Send` without further runtime checks, and therefore, it does not automatically implement it.

To make `Box<dyn Trait>` `Send`, every implementation of `Trait` must also be `Send`.  This is because a `Box<dyn Trait>` could hold any of these implementations.  This constraint often necessitates the use of `Arc<T>` (atomic reference counting) to ensure shared ownership across threads, avoiding data races.  However, even with `Arc<T>`, thread safety is not automatically ensured; developers must carefully manage mutable access to the data within the `Arc`.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  `impl Trait` - Automatically `Send`**

```rust
fn produce_data() -> impl Send + 'static {
    // The concrete type here will be determined at compile-time
    let data = String::from("Some data");
    data
}

fn main() {
    let data = produce_data();
    // data is Send because its lifetime is tied to the function's lifetime
    // and the concrete type (String) is Send
    // No explicit annotation needed.
}
```

In this example, the returned `impl Trait` is implicitly `Send` because the compiler can infer that the returned `String` is `Send`, and its lifetime is bound to the function's execution. The `'static` lifetime annotation ensures the data lives for the duration of the program.


**Example 2: `Box<dyn Trait>` - Not automatically `Send`**

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn get_data(&self) -> String;
}

struct MyData {
    data: String,
}

impl MyTrait for MyData {
    fn get_data(&self) -> String {
        self.data.clone()
    }
}

fn produce_data() -> Box<dyn MyTrait> {
    Box::new(MyData { data: String::from("Some data") })
}

fn main() {
    let data = produce_data();
    // data is NOT automatically Send.
    //  To make it Send, we'd need to use Arc<T>
    // let data_arc = Arc::new(data);
    //  Or we may need to change MyTrait to hold Send-capable data
}
```

Here, `Box<dyn MyTrait>` is not inherently `Send`.  The compiler cannot ascertain the `Send` nature of the underlying `MyData` struct's internal data (`String` in this case, which is `Send`, but could have been something else).  The example shows the issue - if `MyData` contained a non-`Send` component, the entire `Box<dyn MyTrait>` would not be `Send`.  Using `Arc<T>` (or implementing `Sync`) mitigates this but requires careful concurrency management.


**Example 3: `Box<dyn Trait>` - Making it `Send` using `Arc`**

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

trait MyTrait {
    fn get_data(&self) -> String;
}

struct MyData {
    data: Arc<String>, // Using Arc to enable Send
}

impl MyTrait for MyData {
    fn get_data(&self) -> String {
        self.data.clone()
    }
}

fn produce_data() -> Box<dyn MyTrait + Send> { // Explicit Send
    Box::new(MyData { data: Arc::new(String::from("Some data")) })
}

fn main() {
    let data = produce_data();
    // data is now Send because the underlying data is protected by Arc.
}
```

This corrected version uses `Arc<String>`, enabling safe thread-safe sharing.  The `+ Send` trait bound is now explicitly stated, making it clear that the function guarantees a `Send` type, which helps catch potential issues early in development.  This however introduces the overhead associated with atomic reference counting.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Rust Programming Language (the "Book"), Rust by Example, and the Rust standard library documentation are invaluable resources for understanding ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and concurrency in Rust.  Exploring the source code of established crates that heavily utilize asynchronous programming and thread management is also exceptionally beneficial.  Finally, understanding the implications of various memory allocation strategies, especially for data that could be accessed across threads, is vital.
