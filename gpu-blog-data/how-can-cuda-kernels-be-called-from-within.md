The crucial understanding regarding CUDA kernel launches within loops lies in the inherent overhead associated with each launch.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations taught me that minimizing kernel launches significantly impacts performance.  Naive looping directly over `cudaMemcpy` and `cudaLaunchKernel` calls results in unacceptable performance degradation due to the kernel launch latency dominating the computation time.  Efficient strategies focus on maximizing the work performed within a single kernel launch, rather than repeatedly launching kernels inside a host-side loop.

The primary approach involves restructuring the problem to handle a larger batch of data within a single kernel call. This reduces the number of kernel launches, thus minimizing the overhead.  This often requires careful consideration of data organization and memory access patterns. Data should be arranged to encourage coalesced memory access within the kernel to maximize throughput.  Failing to optimize memory access patterns will negate the performance gains from reducing the number of kernel launches.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The inefficiency stems from the context switching between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU). Each kernel launch requires data transfer to the device memory, kernel execution on the GPU, and then data transfer back to the host memory.  These operations are relatively slow compared to the actual computation within the kernel.  Nested loops around kernel calls multiply this overhead, creating a bottleneck.  Therefore, instead of launching a kernel repeatedly within a host-side loop for each iteration, the objective should be to design a single kernel capable of processing the entire dataset or a significantly larger chunk of it at once.  This entails designing the kernel to accept array indices or other parameters that allow it to process different parts of the input data within a single invocation.  The data organization on the device memory becomes crucial; careful planning is necessary to avoid bank conflicts and memory access patterns that hinder performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient approach (Illustrative Only)**

```c++
// Inefficient: Repeated kernel launches within a loop
for (int i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) {
    // Allocate device memory (repeatedly!) - HIGH OVERHEAD
    float* dev_data;
    cudaMalloc(&dev_data, sizeOfData);

    // Copy data to device (repeatedly!) - HIGH OVERHEAD
    cudaMemcpy(dev_data, host_data + i * dataBlockSize, sizeOfData, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Kernel launch (repeatedly!) - HIGH OVERHEAD
    kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev_data, sizeOfData, i); //Illustrative kernel call

    // Copy data back to host (repeatedly!) - HIGH OVERHEAD
    cudaMemcpy(host_data + i * dataBlockSize, dev_data, sizeOfData, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Free device memory (repeatedly!) - HIGH OVERHEAD
    cudaFree(dev_data);
}
```

This code demonstrates a highly inefficient approach.  The repeated memory allocation, data transfer, kernel launch, and deallocation create significant overhead.  The kernel itself might perform minimal computation, but the overhead overwhelms the performance gains.


**Example 2: Efficient approach (Data restructuring)**

```c++
// Efficient: Single kernel launch with index parameter
float* dev_data;
cudaMalloc(&dev_data, numIterations * sizeOfData); // Allocate memory once
cudaMemcpy(dev_data, host_data, numIterations * sizeOfData, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev_data, numIterations * sizeOfData);

cudaMemcpy(host_data, dev_data, numIterations * sizeOfData, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
cudaFree(dev_data);


__global__ void kernel(float* data, int numIterations) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < numIterations) {
      //Process data for a specific iteration.  The index 'i' helps identify which subset of the data corresponds to the iteration.
       //Perform computations using data[i * dataBlockSize + j]
    }
}

```

This example shows a more efficient approach.  The entire dataset is transferred to the device once. The kernel processes the whole dataset, using a thread index or other indexing schemes to determine which part of the data to process.  This avoids repeated data transfers and kernel launches. Note that appropriate thread and block configuration (`blocks`, `threads`) needs to be selected depending on the GPU architecture and the `sizeOfData`.


**Example 3: Efficient approach (using shared memory)**

```c++
//Efficient: Using shared memory for optimized data access.

__global__ void optimizedKernel(float* data, int numIterations, int dataBlockSize){
    __shared__ float sharedData[SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE]; //Shared memory for a block of data.

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < numIterations){
        //Load data into shared memory.  This needs proper coalesced memory access.
        int globalIndex = i * dataBlockSize;
        for (int j = 0; j < dataBlockSize; ++j){
            if (threadIdx.x + j * blockDim.x < dataBlockSize){
                sharedData[threadIdx.x + j * blockDim.x] = data[globalIndex + j];
            }
        }
        __syncthreads(); //Synchronize threads within the block.

        //Perform computations on sharedData
    }
}


```

This illustrates the utilization of shared memory to further optimize performance.  Loading data into shared memory reduces the number of global memory accesses, which are significantly slower.  The `__syncthreads()` call ensures that all threads within a block have loaded their data before computations commence.  This approach requires careful consideration of data layout and shared memory size limitations.   The dataBlockSize needs to be carefully chosen to not exceed the shared memory size per block.
