Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in TensorFlow, while powerful for complex pattern recognition, require careful consideration when applied to learning arithmetic functions.  Their inherent limitations in directly representing symbolic relationships necessitate a strategic approach involving feature engineering and appropriate loss function selection.  My experience in developing financial forecasting models using TensorFlow reinforced this understanding.  The successful training of an MLP to approximate, rather than precisely represent, arithmetic operations hinges on data preparation and network architecture.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Arithmetic functions, by their nature, are precisely defined symbolic relationships.  Unlike image classification or natural language processing, where an approximation is often acceptable, arithmetic requires a high degree of accuracy.  An MLP, being a function approximator based on weighted connections and activation functions, cannot directly "understand" addition or multiplication in the same way a symbolic processor would. Instead, it learns to approximate the output based on the input-output mappings provided during training.

The challenge lies in presenting the arithmetic function to the MLP in a format conducive to its learning process.  Simply providing raw inputs and outputs, without careful consideration of data representation, will likely lead to poor performance, particularly with complex functions or noisy data.  Effective strategies involve:

* **Feature Engineering:**  This step is critical.  Instead of presenting raw numerical inputs, transforming the input data into a representation the MLP can better learn from often yields significant improvements.  For instance, when learning addition, instead of presenting `x` and `y` as separate inputs, consider concatenating them into a single vector.

* **Appropriate Activation Functions:** The choice of activation function impacts the MLP's ability to model the target function.  While ReLU is popular for many tasks, sigmoid or tanh may be more suitable for functions with bounded outputs.  The selection should align with the range of the arithmetic function.

* **Loss Function:**  The mean squared error (MSE) loss function is a common choice for regression problems like approximating arithmetic functions.  However, for functions requiring precise results, other loss functions like mean absolute error (MAE) might be more suitable, depending on the sensitivity to outliers.

* **Network Architecture:** The depth and width of the MLP influence its expressive power.  For simple arithmetic functions, a relatively shallow network might suffice. However, more complex functions may necessitate a deeper architecture to capture intricate relationships.  Overly complex architectures, however, may lead to overfitting.  Regularization techniques, such as dropout, can help mitigate this.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Approximating Addition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate training data
x = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * 10  # Two random numbers between 0 and 10
y = x[:, 0] + x[:, 1]  # Target is the sum
y = np.reshape(y,(1000,1)) #reshape to match output layer

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=100)

# Test the model
test_x = np.array([[5, 3], [2, 8], [10, 0]])
predictions = model.predict(test_x)
print(predictions)
```

This example uses a simple MLP to approximate addition.  Note the use of MSE as the loss function and ReLU activation function. The input is a vector of two random numbers, and the output is their sum. This demonstrates the MLP's ability to learn the function through data presentation.

**Example 2: Approximating Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model (similar to the addition example but with adjustments potentially required depending on the range of the multiplication)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate training data
x = np.random.rand(2000, 2) * 10
y = x[:, 0] * x[:, 1]
y = np.reshape(y,(2000,1))

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=200)

# Test the model
test_x = np.array([[5, 3], [2, 8], [10, 0]])
predictions = model.predict(test_x)
print(predictions)

```

This example adapts the previous code to approximate multiplication. The increased complexity might necessitate a larger network and more training epochs.  Experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters may be required for better accuracy.

**Example 3: Approximating a More Complex Function (x² + 2x + 1)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate training data
x = np.random.rand(5000, 1) * 10
y = x**2 + 2*x + 1
y = np.reshape(y,(5000,1))

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=300)

# Test the model
test_x = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
predictions = model.predict(test_x)
print(predictions)

```

This example demonstrates how to approximate a more complex quadratic function. A deeper network is employed to capture the non-linear relationship.  Observe that even with a complex function, careful data preparation and network design can yield acceptable approximation.

In conclusion, while MLPs cannot directly "understand" arithmetic in a symbolic manner, they can effectively approximate arithmetic functions with careful consideration of data representation, activation function selection, loss function choice, and network architecture.  The examples provided illustrate how to achieve this using TensorFlow.  Remember that experimentation and iterative refinement are crucial in achieving optimal results.  The accuracy of the approximation depends significantly on the dataset size and quality.
