The primary determinant of performance scaling with multiple GPUs versus multiple instances on a single GPU hinges on the nature of the workload and the efficiency of inter-GPU communication.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for climate modeling has consistently shown that while multiple GPUs offer potential for raw compute power increases, the overhead of data transfer and synchronization often negates expected gains unless the application is carefully designed for parallel processing.  Multiple instances, conversely, offer a simpler approach with potentially better performance for workloads that don't benefit from extensive inter-GPU communication.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The performance comparison between multiple GPUs and multiple instances on a single GPU boils down to a trade-off between parallel processing capability and communication overhead.  Multiple GPUs provide a massive increase in raw compute resources, ideal for problems that can be readily parallelized.  However, achieving efficient parallelization requires careful consideration of data partitioning, communication strategies (e.g., MPI, NVLink), and the inherent limitations of inter-GPU communication bandwidth.  This communication bottleneck frequently becomes a limiting factor, even with high-bandwidth interconnect technologies like NVLink.  Data transfer latency and bandwidth constraints can significantly impact overall performance, potentially reducing the speedup achieved by adding more GPUs.

In contrast, multiple instances on a single GPU leverage the operating system's scheduling capabilities to distribute workload across different processes or threads. While the total compute power is inherently limited by a single GPU, the overhead associated with inter-process communication is generally lower.  This approach is often more efficient for applications that exhibit less inherent parallelism or where the cost of inter-GPU communication outweighs the benefits of additional compute units.  Further, utilizing multiple instances allows for easier resource management and fault tolerance; if one instance crashes, others can continue processing.

Factors affecting performance include:

* **Application Parallelism:**  Highly parallelizable applications (e.g., many scientific simulations) benefit more from multiple GPUs.  Applications with limited parallelism might see marginal or even negative returns.
* **Communication Overhead:**  The efficiency of inter-GPU communication significantly impacts performance.  Applications requiring frequent data exchange between GPUs will suffer from communication bottlenecks.
* **GPU Architecture:**  The architecture of the GPUs (e.g., memory bandwidth, interconnect technology) directly affects both compute capabilities and communication efficiency.
* **Data Locality:**  Efficient data partitioning is critical for multiple-GPU performance.  Poor data locality leads to increased data transfer and thus reduces performance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate performance differences using Python and CUDA. These are simplified representations, but showcase the key concepts.


**Example 1:  Multiple GPUs (CUDA with MPI)**

```python
import mpi4py
from mpi4py import MPI
import cupy as cp

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

# Assume data is already partitioned across GPUs
data_chunk = cp.array(...) # Portion of data for this GPU

# Perform computation on the local data chunk
result_chunk = perform_computation(data_chunk)

# Gather results from all GPUs
if rank == 0:
    final_result = cp.concatenate([comm.recv(source=i) for i in range(1,size)])
    final_result = cp.concatenate((final_result, result_chunk))
else:
    comm.send(result_chunk, dest=0)

# ... further processing ...
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a basic parallel computation using CUDA and MPI.  Each process (running on a separate GPU) performs computations on a portion of the data, then uses MPI to communicate results to a central node (rank 0) for aggregation.  The efficiency depends critically on the time taken for `comm.send` and `comm.recv`.  Slow inter-GPU communication will drastically limit the overall performance.


**Example 2: Multiple Instances (Single GPU, Multiprocessing)**

```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np

def process_data(data_chunk):
    # Perform computation on the data chunk
    result_chunk = perform_computation(data_chunk)
    return result_chunk

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = np.array(...)
    num_processes = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    chunk_size = len(data) // num_processes

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        results = pool.map(process_data, [data[i*chunk_size:(i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_processes)])

    final_result = np.concatenate(results)
    # ... further processing ...
```

*Commentary:* This utilizes Python's multiprocessing library to distribute the workload across multiple processes on a single CPU core (and thus a single GPU). This avoids inter-GPU communication overhead, but relies on the CPU to manage processes and transfer data between processes and the GPU.  The bottleneck here will likely be CPU bound, especially if GPU computation is significantly faster than data transfer.



**Example 3:  Hybrid Approach (Multiple GPUs with Optimized Communication)**

```python
import numba
from numba import cuda

@cuda.jit
def kernel(data_in, data_out):
    idx = cuda.grid(1)
    # Perform computation...
    data_out[idx] = data_in[idx] * 2

# ... data partitioning and transfer using optimized libraries (e.g., UCX, NCCL)...

# Launch kernel on each GPU...

# ... optimized data gathering/aggregation using efficient communication strategies...
```

*Commentary:* This example highlights the importance of optimized communication.  While employing multiple GPUs, it stresses the use of specialized libraries and techniques (like NCCL for collectives) to minimize communication overhead.  The efficiency here hinges heavily on the choice of communication library and its ability to effectively utilize high-bandwidth interconnects.  The use of Numba allows for just-in-time compilation, potentially leading to better performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU programming and parallel computing, I recommend studying the documentation for CUDA, OpenCL, and MPI.  Comprehensive texts on parallel algorithm design and high-performance computing are invaluable.  Additionally, investigating performance analysis tools specific to your GPU hardware will greatly assist in identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.  Familiarity with various communication libraries (e.g., NCCL, UCX) is crucial for efficient multi-GPU programming.  Finally, understanding the intricacies of operating system scheduling and process management will inform effective strategies for utilizing multiple instances.
