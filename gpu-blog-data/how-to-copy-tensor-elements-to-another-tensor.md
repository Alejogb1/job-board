TensorFlow, being a framework for numerical computation, offers multiple ways to move or copy data between tensors, each with specific use cases and performance characteristics. From my experience developing complex machine learning models involving dynamic reshaping and data preprocessing, understanding these methods is crucial. The most common scenarios for copying elements involve assigning specific subsets, broadcasting data, or creating entirely new tensors from existing data. Selecting the right technique profoundly impacts code readability and efficiency.

The fundamental operation to understand is tensor indexing. In TensorFlow, you access elements using multidimensional array-like indexing syntax similar to NumPy. This index can be a slice, an integer, or even another tensor of indices. Crucially, while basic indexing retrieves *views* of the data when slicing, directly copying the elements requires the use of assignment operators or more specialized functions.  When you directly access a slice, it doesn’t make a copy; rather, the slice refers to the same underlying data.

The first scenario involves copying a specific sub-section of a source tensor to a target tensor, assuming the dimensions match. Direct assignment with indexing works here. If both tensors are of the same shape, you can assign an entire source tensor into another with no special considerations. Consider I have a tensor containing numerical data that needs to be copied into a tensor that I'll use to perform some further operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 1: Copying a slice using indexing
source_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                           [5, 6, 7, 8],
                           [9, 10, 11, 12]], dtype=tf.int32)
target_tensor = tf.zeros_like(source_tensor, dtype=tf.int32)

target_tensor = target_tensor.numpy() # Convert target_tensor to NumPy array
target_tensor[0:2, 1:3] = source_tensor[0:2, 1:3].numpy() #copy slice from source to target
target_tensor = tf.constant(target_tensor, dtype=tf.int32) #Convert target_tensor back to Tensor

print("Source Tensor:\n", source_tensor)
print("Target Tensor after slice copy:\n", target_tensor)
```

In this case, I'm using NumPy to perform the copy, since TensorFlow does not have an explicit in-place assignment operator for tensor slices. Note that I convert both to NumPy arrays, use NumPy's in-place assignment to copy elements, and then convert target tensor back into a TensorFlow tensor. The output shows the section of source_tensor from indices `[0:2, 1:3]`, copied into the matching section of target_tensor. This technique works well when the dimensions of the data to copy match the dimensions into which the data is being copied. Directly assigning a tensor to another in the case of different dimensions causes errors.

When the target tensor doesn’t match the source tensor's shape, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` comes into play. This is a more versatile function that allows element-wise updates based on indices, enabling you to copy non-contiguous elements as well. Assume a situation where only specific elements at certain coordinates of a source tensor need to be copied to corresponding, but potentially non-contiguous locations, in a target tensor. The tensor_scatter_nd_update method works on both mutable tensors and tensors generated by functions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 2: Copying based on indices using scatter_nd_update
source_tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60], dtype=tf.int32)
target_tensor = tf.zeros([10], dtype=tf.int32)
indices = tf.constant([[2], [4], [7]], dtype=tf.int32)
updates = tf.gather(source_tensor, [1, 3, 5])

target_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(target_tensor, indices, updates)

print("Source Tensor:\n", source_tensor)
print("Target Tensor after scatter_nd_update:\n", target_tensor)

```

Here, indices specifies the positions within target\_tensor where the corresponding values from updates will be written, effectively allowing a specific subset of elements from the source to copy to non-contiguous locations in target. The values in `updates` are the elements extracted from `source_tensor` based on their indices `[1,3,5]`. The elements at these indices from the source tensor are copied over to the indices in `target_tensor` as defined by the tensor `indices`. This approach is particularly useful when creating sparse representations or updating specific parts of a tensor based on dynamically computed indices.

Another important scenario is the need to create a new tensor by copying all the data. This is a simple case, but is relevant in cases where I need to perform operations without altering the original tensor.  `tf.identity` effectively does that. It returns a new tensor with the same contents. This is crucial if the operation on the target tensor needs to be performed without changing the source tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 3: Copying all elements using tf.identity
source_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)
target_tensor = tf.identity(source_tensor)

target_tensor = tf.add(target_tensor, 1.0) # Perform operations on target_tensor

print("Source Tensor:\n", source_tensor)
print("Target Tensor after adding 1.0:\n", target_tensor)
```

In this example, `tf.identity` creates a copy of `source_tensor` into `target_tensor`. The subsequent addition of 1.0 only changes the values in `target_tensor`, while `source_tensor` remains unchanged. This method is simple and efficient when making a general, deep copy. This behavior differs from simply assigning one tensor variable to another because the changes to one will propagate to the other, which is a problem if the two tensors are meant to be independent.

These methods represent the core tools for copying data within TensorFlow tensors, based on my experiences. The appropriate method depends on the nature of the copy operation and the structure of your data. For contiguous block copies, directly indexing with slicing using NumPy within TensorFlow tensors where assignment is needed proves efficient. For non-contiguous updates or selective element assignments, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` provides the necessary control.  And to create a completely separate copy of the original tensor, tf.identity should be used. Understanding these distinctions is essential for writing performant and correct TensorFlow code.

For further in-depth understanding, consult the TensorFlow documentation on "Tensors" and "Tensor Transformations," which detail the indexing mechanisms and the `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` function.  Additionally, resources that address advanced NumPy indexing techniques are useful, since TensorFlow indexing is heavily influenced by it. Tutorials and guides focused on optimized data manipulation within TensorFlow would also be beneficial.
