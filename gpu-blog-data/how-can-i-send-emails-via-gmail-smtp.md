Gmail's deprecation of less secure app access necessitates the use of OAuth 2.0 for secure email sending via their SMTP servers.  This presents a more complex authentication process than using simple username/password credentials, but significantly enhances security.  My experience integrating this into a high-volume transactional email system highlighted the importance of proper exception handling and efficient resource management.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The JavaMail API provides the framework for sending emails, but OAuth 2.0 authentication requires an external library to manage the token acquisition process.  This typically involves a series of steps:

a) **Authorization:**  Your application registers with Google Cloud Console, obtaining a Client ID and Client Secret. This grants your application permission to access a user's Gmail account.  This registration specifies authorized scopes, which define the permissions granted (e.g., sending emails).

b) **Authorization Code Grant:** The user grants permission via a web browser.  The application redirects the user to a Google authorization URL containing the Client ID, redirect URI, and requested scopes.  Upon successful authorization, Google redirects the user back to your application's specified redirect URI with an authorization code.

c) **Token Exchange:** This authorization code is then exchanged for an access token and a refresh token. The access token is short-lived and used to authenticate email sending requests to the Gmail SMTP server. The refresh token is long-lived and used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authorize.

d) **Email Sending:**  The access token is included in the JavaMail session properties, authenticating your connection to the SMTP server.  The email message is then constructed and sent.

e) **Token Refresh:** Before an access token expires, it is crucial to refresh it using the refresh token to maintain continuous email sending capabilities.  This avoids repeated user authorization.  Proper error handling is essential for managing token refresh failures, potentially including user notification or retry mechanisms.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simplified OAuth2 Flow (Conceptual):**

This example simplifies the OAuth 2.0 flow for illustrative purposes.  In a production environment, a dedicated library should handle the complexities of token retrieval and management.

```java
// Requires appropriate OAuth2 library (e.g., Google API Client Library)

// ...Obtain authorization code (omitted for brevity)...

GoogleCredential credential = new GoogleCredential.Builder()
        .setTransport(httpTransport)
        .setJsonFactory(JSON_FACTORY)
        .setClientSecrets(clientId, clientSecret)
        .build()
        .setFromAuthorizationCode(authorizationCode, httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, new GenericUrl(TOKEN_URI));

Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");
props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587");
props.put("mail.smtp.ssl.trust", "smtp.gmail.com");
Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
    protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
        return new PasswordAuthentication(credential.getServiceAccountEmail(), null); //AccessToken embedded in credential
    }
});

// ...Send email using session...
```


**Example 2:  Token Refresh Mechanism (Illustrative):**

This demonstrates a basic token refresh approach. Robust error handling and retry logic would be needed for production.

```java
// ...Code to obtain initial access token...

try {
    // Use accessToken to send email
    sendMessage(session, message);
} catch (IOException e) {
    if (e.getMessage().contains("401 Unauthorized")) { //Example error indicating token expiry
        try {
            credential.refreshToken(); //Refresh using refresh token
            // Update session with new accessToken
            // ...Resend email...
        } catch (IOException refreshException) {
            //Handle refresh failure (e.g., log error, notify user)
        }
    } else {
        //Handle other exceptions
    }
}
```

**Example 3:  Error Handling and Retry (Snippet):**

This snippet showcases essential error handling and retry mechanisms for robust email delivery.

```java
int retryAttempts = 3;
int currentAttempt = 0;
boolean emailSent = false;

while (!emailSent && currentAttempt < retryAttempts) {
    try {
        sendMessage(session, message);
        emailSent = true;
    } catch (MessagingException | IOException e) {
        currentAttempt++;
        if (currentAttempt < retryAttempts) {
            // Implement exponential backoff strategy for retries
            try {
                Thread.sleep(Math.min(1000 * (2 << (currentAttempt -1)), 60000));
            } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}

            // Handle specific exception types (e.g., 401, 5xx) differently
            if (e instanceof MessagingException && ((MessagingException)e).getNextException() != null)
                System.out.println("Messaging Exception: " + ((MessagingException)e).getNextException().getMessage());
            else
                System.out.println("Exception: " + e.getMessage());

        } else {
            // Log the failure and potentially alert monitoring systems
            System.err.println("Failed to send email after multiple retries. Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **JavaMail API Documentation:**  Thoroughly understand the JavaMail API's capabilities and limitations. Pay close attention to the `Session` and `Transport` classes.

* **OAuth 2.0 Specification:**  Familiarize yourself with the OAuth 2.0 protocol and its various grant types.  Understanding the flow is crucial for correct implementation.

* **Google Cloud Platform Documentation:**  Consult Google's documentation for integrating with their APIs, specifically regarding the Gmail API and OAuth 2.0.  This covers registration, scopes, and best practices.  Pay particular attention to the security guidelines.

* **A reputable OAuth 2.0 library for Java:** Utilizing a well-maintained and tested library simplifies the token management process significantly, reducing the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.  Carefully review the security considerations associated with any such library.


This response provides a foundation for sending emails via Gmail's SMTP servers using JavaMail and OAuth 2.0. Remember that robust error handling, security best practices, and proper use of a dedicated OAuth2 library are crucial for a production-ready solution.  The code examples serve as illustrations; adapting them to a specific application will necessitate further development and testing.  Always prioritize security considerations when handling user credentials and access tokens.
