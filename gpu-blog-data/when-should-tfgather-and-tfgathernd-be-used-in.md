TensorFlow's `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd` functions both serve to extract elements from a tensor based on indices, but their application differs significantly depending on the dimensionality and structure of the index specification.  My experience optimizing large-scale recommendation models has highlighted the crucial distinction: `tf.gather` operates efficiently on single-axis indexing, while `tf.gather_nd` excels when multi-dimensional index arrays are required.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.gather` operates on a single axis of a tensor.  You provide it with the tensor, the axis along which to gather, and a 1D tensor of indices.  The output is a tensor containing the elements at the specified indices along that single axis.  Think of it as selecting specific rows (or columns, depending on the axis) from a matrix or slices from a higher-dimensional tensor. The index tensor must be a 1D vector; attempting to provide a multi-dimensional index tensor will result in an error.

`tf.gather_nd`, conversely, allows for gathering elements using multi-dimensional indices. This is crucial when you need to access elements not based on a contiguous slice along a single axis, but using a more complex indexing scheme, effectively specifying the coordinates of each desired element within the tensor.  The index tensor in `tf.gather_nd` can be of arbitrary rank, but its innermost dimension must match the rank of the input tensor. Each element in the index tensor represents the coordinates of a single element to retrieve.

The core difference lies in the flexibility and complexity of indexing.  `tf.gather` is straightforward and computationally efficient for single-axis selections, while `tf.gather_nd` provides significantly greater flexibility for multi-axis indexing at a cost of slightly increased computational overhead.  Choosing the wrong function can severely impact performance; `tf.gather_nd` when `tf.gather` suffices is inefficient, and using `tf.gather` where `tf.gather_nd` is needed leads to incorrect results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: `tf.gather` for single-axis selection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
indices = tf.constant([0, 2])  # Select rows 0 and 2

gathered_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, indices)

print(gathered_tensor)  # Output: tf.Tensor([[1 2 3] [7 8 9]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32)
```

This example showcases the basic usage of `tf.gather`. We select rows 0 and 2 from the input tensor.  Note the simplicity and directness of the index specification.  This is ideal when you require specific rows or columns, representing a straightforward selection process.  The default axis is 0, selecting rows.  Specifying another axis allows column selection.


**Example 2: `tf.gather_nd` for multi-axis selection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]) #Select [0,1,0] and [1,0,1] elements

gathered_tensor = tf.gather_nd(tensor, indices)

print(gathered_tensor) # Output: tf.Tensor([3 6], shape=(2,), dtype=int32)
```

Here, we demonstrate `tf.gather_nd`. The indices tensor is a 2x3 matrix, each row defining coordinates in a three-dimensional tensor. The first row [0,1,0] selects the element at the first row (index 0), second column (index 1), and first position (index 0) which is 3. The second row [1,0,1] selects the element at the second row, first column, second position, which is 6.  This highlights the ability to select elements based on arbitrary coordinate specification.  This method is essential for non-contiguous selections or more complex indexing needs.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Inefficiency of Mismatched Function Choice**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

#Attempting to use tf.gather_nd incorrectly
indices = tf.constant([0,1]) #incorrect index type for tf.gather_nd

try:
    gathered_tensor = tf.gather_nd(tensor, indices)
    print(gathered_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error:{e}") #Output: Error:Indices is not a matrix


#Correct usage of tf.gather
indices = tf.constant([0, 1]) #Correct usage of tf.gather
gathered_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, indices)
print(gathered_tensor) #Output: tf.Tensor([[1 2 3] [4 5 6]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32)

```
This example directly shows the critical difference.  Incorrectly applying `tf.gather_nd` with a simple index vector will result in an error.  Conversely, the correct application of `tf.gather` yields the desired outcome, proving its efficiency and suitability for simpler, single-axis indexing tasks.  My experience has shown that this type of error can be particularly insidious in complex models, requiring careful attention to index structure.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive explanations of both `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd` functions.  Reviewing the API specifications for these functions, along with examples illustrating various index types and tensor dimensions, would provide a more robust understanding.  Furthermore, studying TensorFlow's performance optimization guides will help in understanding the computational implications of different tensor operations and selection strategies. Finally, working through numerous practical examples of both functions, testing various index schemes and tensor shapes, is crucial to mastering their application.  The key is understanding the precise nature of the data access needed before selecting the appropriate function.  Incorrect usage leads not only to inefficiency but potential runtime errors.
