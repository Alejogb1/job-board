The observed discrepancy in p-value positions for Wilcoxon tests between `rstatix` and `ggpubr` arises not from miscalculation, but from differing default behaviors in annotating plots. My experience in biostatistics research, particularly involving non-parametric comparisons, has frequently required navigating these subtle differences in R libraries.

The core functionality of calculating the Wilcoxon signed-rank test p-value remains consistent across both `rstatix` and `ggpubr`. Both libraries leverage the `wilcox.test` function from R's base stats package for the underlying computations. The p-value itself, representing the probability of observing the data or more extreme data given the null hypothesis is true, is an objective result derived from the rank sums of the data. However, the manner in which this p-value is presented visually on a plot is what differs significantly. `rstatix` focuses on data summarization and statistical test execution, while `ggpubr` is concerned primarily with plotting and visualization, including the strategic placement of annotation elements.

The primary divergence stems from how these libraries determine the vertical placement of p-value annotations on plots, specifically when creating boxplots or other data visualizations. `rstatix`, when coupled with functions like `stat_compare_means` in `ggpubr`, may sometimes place p-values at a fixed position relative to the data, potentially overlapping with the data points or boxplot elements, especially when distributions have substantial differences in range or when comparisons involve smaller sample sizes. In contrast, `ggpubr` attempts to dynamically adjust p-value positions based on the underlying plot structure and the data's spread, often resulting in better visual clarity and reduced overlap. This difference reflects each library's design goals: `rstatix` for statistical analyses, and `ggpubr` for refined plot outputs. It is not a matter of mathematical error but rather of visualization strategy.

The `rstatix` approach, while sometimes visually less appealing, provides a consistent frame of reference. The p-value annotation appears at a location derived from the data. The position is usually determined based on an adjustable y coordinate parameter, or by some fraction above the maximal point of the data set used in the analysis. This makes sense, as it allows for a visual representation that is tightly coupled to the actual data points that generated the test statistic, which may have its appeal for certain users with a focus on clear association of a p-value to a specific range of the distribution.

Let’s examine this with a few code examples. Assume I've generated some fictional patient data reflecting two groups and their expression levels of some hypothetical gene.

**Example 1: Using `rstatix` only**

```R
library(rstatix)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)
groupA <- rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 1.5)
groupB <- rnorm(20, mean = 7, sd = 2)

data <- data.frame(
    group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 20)),
    value = c(groupA, groupB)
)

result <- data %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    wilcox_test(value ~ group) %>%
    adjust_pvalue(method = "BH")
result

#Visualize with boxplot and add significance
ggplot(data, aes(x=group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("A", "B")), 
              annotations = paste("p =", format(result$p.adj, digits = 3)),
              y_position = 10)
```

In this example, `rstatix` is used to compute the p-value using a Wilcoxon test, which is then adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (BH) to control for multiple testing. Then a simple boxplot is generated using ggplot, and `geom_signif` is used to add a p-value annotation at a specified y position. This allows for explicit control over the position of the annotation. Note that the `geom_signif` function is part of ggplot itself and not the `rstatix` or `ggpubr` libraries.

**Example 2: Using `ggpubr` with `stat_compare_means`**

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)

set.seed(123)
groupA <- rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 1.5)
groupB <- rnorm(20, mean = 7, sd = 2)

data <- data.frame(
    group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 20)),
    value = c(groupA, groupB)
)


ggboxplot(data, x = "group", y = "value", add = "jitter") +
  stat_compare_means(method = "wilcox.test", method.args=list(correct=TRUE),
                     label = "p.format", 
                     label.y = 10)
```
Here, `ggpubr`'s `ggboxplot` is used, with the `stat_compare_means` function added. Crucially, `stat_compare_means`, also part of `ggpubr`, is responsible for performing the statistical test, *and* determining the p-value position dynamically relative to the boxplot. Note that the method of the test and the type of p-value presentation can be customized through the method and label parameters. In this case a p-value is displayed on the y=10 position, as previously defined.

**Example 3: Discrepancy Example**

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)

groupA <- rnorm(20, mean = 2, sd = 0.5)
groupB <- rnorm(20, mean = 6, sd = 1.5)
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 20)),
  value = c(groupA, groupB)
)


result <- data %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    wilcox_test(value ~ group) %>%
    adjust_pvalue(method = "BH")

p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=group, y = value)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("A", "B")), 
                  annotations = paste("p =", format(result$p.adj, digits = 3)),
                  y_position = 8)

p2 <- ggboxplot(data, x = "group", y = "value", add = "jitter") +
  stat_compare_means(method = "wilcox.test", method.args=list(correct=TRUE),
                     label = "p.format",
                     label.y = 8)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```
In this example, I’m generating two plots side by side. One, `p1`, utilizes ggplot and `geom_signif`, similar to example 1. The other, `p2`, uses `ggpubr` directly. This visually demonstrates the different placement strategies for the p-value annotation, even when a consistent `y_position` is specified, highlighting that the position is interpreted differently by each plotting method. This is important to demonstrate that the p-value is not differently *calculated* but displayed differently on each plot.

In summary, the difference in p-value positions is a matter of how each plotting methodology is defined, rather than a divergence in the test calculations themselves. `rstatix` allows a user-defined position, whilst `ggpubr` attempts to optimize the visual appeal of the plotted p-value by taking the underlying data distribution into account.

To better understand these differences, I recommend reviewing the documentation for the `wilcox.test` function in R's base stats package. Additionally, exploring the specific functionalities of the `stat_compare_means` function in `ggpubr` as well as `geom_signif` in ggplot can aid in understanding how p-value positions are determined. Reading related tutorials on data visualization and annotation in R, particularly those that cover `ggplot2` extension packages can further enhance a user's understanding of this topic. Finally, a detailed exploration of the `rstatix` documentation regarding the `wilcox_test` and related functions can benefit those who are specifically interested in this aspect of non-parametric analysis in R.
