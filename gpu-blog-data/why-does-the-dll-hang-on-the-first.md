The initial CUDA `cudaMalloc` or `cudaMemGetInfo` call hanging often stems from an unaddressed, pre-existing condition within the CUDA context, rather than a direct fault within the functions themselves.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across various projects, including a high-frequency trading system and a large-scale molecular dynamics simulator, highlights this.  The hang isn't typically a function-specific bug; instead, it's a symptom of a deeper problem in the initialization or configuration of the CUDA environment.

**1.  Explanation:**

The CUDA runtime relies on a meticulously initialized environment.  A seemingly innocuous error during driver initialization, context creation, or device selection can manifest as a seemingly random hang on the first allocation or memory information retrieval.  These functions are fundamental; if the underlying infrastructure is flawed, they'll fail silently, or rather, hang silently, as the runtime attempts to recover from an unrecoverable state.

Several factors contribute to this behavior.  Firstly, insufficient driver permissions can prevent proper access to the GPU.  Secondly, conflicting driver versions (or even mismatched driver and CUDA toolkit versions) can lead to resource contention or outright incompatibility.  Thirdly, improper initialization of the CUDA context – failing to select a device, or attempting to use a device that's unavailable or offline – will cause these crucial calls to deadlock.  Finally, underlying system limitations, such as insufficient system memory or competing processes excessively utilizing GPU resources, can also contribute to the observed hang.

Diagnosing the root cause requires a methodical approach, starting with basic checks and progressing to more advanced debugging techniques. The hang itself provides limited diagnostic information; the true error is hidden within the CUDA runtime's internal state.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following code snippets illustrate common pitfalls and demonstrate best practices for avoiding the described issue.  These are simplified for illustrative purposes; real-world implementations require more robust error handling.

**Example 1:  Incorrect Device Selection**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // INCORRECT: Assuming device 0 always exists and is available.
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0); // Potential source of hang if device 0 is unavailable.
    std::cout << "Device 0 Name: " << prop.name << std::endl;

    cudaSetDevice(0); // Another potential point of failure if device 0 isn't accessible.
    size_t size = 1024 * 1024;
    void* devPtr;
    cudaMalloc(&devPtr, size); // This will hang if the previous steps failed silently.

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This code assumes device 0 is always available. This is problematic.  A more robust approach would enumerate available devices and choose one explicitly based on criteria like compute capability or memory capacity.  Error checking after each CUDA call is crucial for early detection of problems.

**Example 2:  Missing Error Handling**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    size_t freeMem, totalMem;
    cudaMemGetInfo(&freeMem, &totalMem); // Missing error check

    //Proceed with memory allocation without checking for error in the prior call.
    void *devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024 * 1024;
    cudaMalloc(&devPtr, size); //  This might hang if cudaMemGetInfo failed silently.

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This code lacks error checking after `cudaMemGetInfo`.  A failed call to `cudaMemGetInfo` (e.g., due to driver issues) could silently leave the CUDA context in an unstable state, leading to a hang in subsequent calls.  Always check the return value of every CUDA API call.


**Example 3:  Robust Error Handling and Device Selection**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int bestDevice = -1;
    int maxComputeCapability = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; ++i) {
        cudaDeviceProp prop;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, i);
        if (prop.major * 10 + prop.minor > maxComputeCapability) {
            maxComputeCapability = prop.major * 10 + prop.minor;
            bestDevice = i;
        }
    }

    if (bestDevice == -1) {
        std::cerr << "No suitable device found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    cudaSetDevice(bestDevice);

    size_t freeMem, totalMem;
    cudaError_t err = cudaMemGetInfo(&freeMem, &totalMem);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMemGetInfo failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    size_t size = 1024 * 1024;
    void* devPtr;
    err = cudaMalloc(&devPtr, size);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMalloc failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example incorporates proper device selection based on compute capability and comprehensive error checking after each CUDA API call.  This approach significantly improves the robustness of the code and makes debugging far easier.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and the NVIDIA developer website.  Pay close attention to the sections on error handling, driver installation, and device management.  Familiarize yourself with the `cuda-gdb` debugger for in-depth analysis of CUDA kernel execution and runtime behavior.  Understanding the nuances of CUDA context creation and management is also critical.  Debugging these low-level issues often requires a blend of system-level and CUDA-specific debugging techniques.
