The absence of the `eigen_blas_LIBRARY` during a static libTorch build on macOS stems fundamentally from the build system's inability to locate the necessary Eigen linear algebra library components, specifically those linked against a suitable BLAS implementation.  This issue arises because PyTorch's build process, while robust, requires explicit configuration regarding the location and linkage of these crucial dependencies.  Over the years, I've encountered this problem numerous times while integrating PyTorch into various proprietary projects requiring static linking for deployment purposes.  Failure to correctly specify these paths results in the linker's inability to resolve symbol references during the final linking stage.

My experience indicates that the root cause frequently lies in inconsistencies between the Eigen installation, the BLAS library (often OpenBLAS or Accelerate), and the PyTorch build configuration.  The PyTorch build system relies on environment variables and CMake options to discover these dependencies.  If these are not correctly set or if the libraries are installed in non-standard locations, the build process will fail, reporting the missing `eigen_blas_LIBRARY`.  Furthermore, issues can arise from version mismatches between Eigen, BLAS, and the version of PyTorch being compiled.

**Explanation:**

PyTorch utilizes Eigen extensively for its underlying tensor operations. Eigen itself is a header-only library, meaning its source code is primarily contained within header files.  However, Eigen can be configured to link against optimized BLAS libraries for performance enhancements.  This linkage is crucial; without it, Eigen's performance suffers significantly, and the resulting PyTorch library would be vastly slower.  The `eigen_blas_LIBRARY` variable, within the context of the PyTorch build system, represents the path to the compiled BLAS library linked against Eigen. The missing library error thus indicates that the build system could not find this linked BLAS library, which is essential for a functional Eigen and, consequently, a functional PyTorch.

The macOS environment, in particular, presents a unique challenge because it includes Accelerate, Apple's highly optimized BLAS/LAPACK implementation.  However, the build system might not automatically detect it unless explicitly instructed.  This frequently leads developers to manually specify the BLAS location.  OpenBLAS, a popular open-source BLAS implementation, can also be used, but again, requires precise configuration during the build process.

**Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate potential solutions, emphasizing the importance of CMake configuration.  Remember that paths should be adjusted to reflect your specific system setup.


**Example 1: Using Accelerate (Recommended for macOS):**

```cmake
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib \
      -DUSE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=ON \
      -DBLA_VENDOR=Accelerate \
      -DPYTORCH_BUILD_VERSION=1.13.1 \  # Adjust to your PyTorch version
      ..
```

This example utilizes CMake to explicitly set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the directory containing Accelerate, enabling the build system to find the necessary headers and libraries.  `-DUSE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=ON` instructs the build to use a system-provided Eigen installation. `-DBLA_VENDOR=Accelerate` explicitly specifies Accelerate as the BLAS vendor.  The `-DPYTORCH_BUILD_VERSION` is vital for compatibility.


**Example 2: Using OpenBLAS (Requires manual installation):**

```cmake
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local \
      -DUSE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=ON \
      -DBLA_VENDOR=OpenBLAS \
      -DOpenBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include \
      -DOpenBLAS_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libopenblas.dylib \
      -DPYTORCH_BUILD_VERSION=1.13.1 \
      ..
```

This example assumes OpenBLAS is installed in a standard location (`/usr/local`).  Crucially,  `-DOpenBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR` and `-DOpenBLAS_LIBRARY` explicitly point to the include directory and library file, respectively.  Adapt paths as needed.


**Example 3: Building Eigen from source (Less recommended):**

This approach should be avoided unless absolutely necessary due to complexity and potential for incompatibility. However, for illustrative purposes:

```cmake
cmake -DUSE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=OFF \  # Disable using system Eigen
      -DEIGEN3_DIR=/path/to/eigen/build \  # Path to your Eigen build directory.
      -DBLA_VENDOR=Accelerate \ # Or OpenBLAS as in previous examples
      -DPYTORCH_BUILD_VERSION=1.13.1 \
      ..
```

This configures PyTorch to use a locally built Eigen, necessitating a separate Eigen build process where you would have to configure Eigen to link with your chosen BLAS library (Accelerate or OpenBLAS).


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  Thorough examination of the CMakeLists.txt file within the PyTorch source code.  The Eigen documentation, specifically focusing on its build and linking instructions.  Consult any build guides or tutorials related to statically linking PyTorch on macOS. The Apple documentation on Accelerate.  The OpenBLAS documentation.


Remember that precise path specifications are paramount. Verify the existence and accessibility of all paths mentioned in your CMake configuration.  Incorrect paths are the most frequent cause of this error.  Always ensure that your system's environment variables (especially `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or its macOS equivalent) are correctly set if you're utilizing system libraries. Carefully review any compiler or linker warnings during the build process; these often provide valuable clues about the nature of the problem.  Version compatibility across Eigen, BLAS, and PyTorch is critical; use compatible versions whenever possible.  If using a custom-built Eigen, consider meticulously following the instructions for building Eigen with BLAS support.  A clean rebuild after making configuration changes is always recommended.
