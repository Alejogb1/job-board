The underlying issue with `tf.math.sqrt` not executing on the GPU often stems from a mismatch between the tensor's placement and the device's capabilities.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale deep learning projects, particularly when dealing with model parallelism and mixed-precision training.  Simply specifying `.gpu` in the tensor creation isn't always sufficient; the operation itself needs to be explicitly assigned to the GPU.  This necessitates a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's device placement mechanisms.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's flexibility in managing resources across CPUs and GPUs demands precise control over where operations are performed.  While creating a tensor on a GPU using `tf.device('/GPU:0')` (or similar) places the *tensor data* on the GPU, it doesn't automatically guarantee that subsequent operations on that tensor will also run on the GPU.  This is because TensorFlow's execution engine, by default, might optimize the graph execution, potentially selecting the CPU for specific operations even if the input data resides in GPU memory.  This optimization, while usually beneficial for performance, can inadvertently prevent GPU execution for seemingly straightforward operations like `tf.math.sqrt`.

Several factors contribute to this behavior:

* **Implicit CPU placement:** If your code doesn't explicitly specify the device for `tf.math.sqrt`, TensorFlow's default behavior might assign it to the CPU. This happens especially when the graph is constructed in a manner that doesn't clearly delineate GPU dependencies.

* **Data transfer overhead:** Even if the operation *could* be performed on the GPU, TensorFlow's runtime might decide that the overhead of transferring data between the CPU and GPU is less than the potential speedup from GPU computation, particularly for smaller tensors.

* **GPU availability and configuration:**  Improper configuration or unavailability of GPUs can lead to TensorFlow falling back to CPU execution, even with explicit device placement attempts.  This may be due to driver issues, resource contention from other processes, or incorrect environment variables.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect placement leading to CPU execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([1.0, 4.0, 9.0]) # No device specified
y = tf.math.sqrt(x) # No device specified

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(y.device) # Likely shows '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0'
    print(sess.run(y))
```

In this example, `tf.constant` creates a tensor without specifying a device.  `tf.math.sqrt` also lacks device specification.  Consequently, TensorFlow defaults to CPU execution. The output would show that the tensor `y` lives on the CPU.


**Example 2: Correct placement using `tf.device`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Explicit GPU device placement
    x = tf.constant([1.0, 4.0, 9.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    y = tf.math.sqrt(x)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(y.device) # Should show '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0'
    print(sess.run(y))
```

Here, the `tf.device` context manager explicitly places both tensor creation and the `tf.math.sqrt` operation on GPU 0.  This ensures GPU execution.  The output will indicate that `y` resides in GPU memory.  Note that the `dtype` is specified as `tf.float32` which is essential for GPU computation; using `tf.float64` might introduce unexpected behavior depending on your GPU's capabilities and CUDA installation.


**Example 3: Handling potential exceptions and GPU unavailability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        x = tf.constant([1.0, 4.0, 9.0], dtype=tf.float32)
        y = tf.math.sqrt(x)
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            print(y.device)
            print(sess.run(y))
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Fallback to CPU computation if GPU is unavailable
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
        x = tf.constant([1.0, 4.0, 9.0], dtype=tf.float32)
        y = tf.math.sqrt(x)
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            print(y.device)
            print(sess.run(y))
```

This example incorporates error handling.  The `try-except` block catches `RuntimeError` exceptions that might occur if the GPU isn't accessible.  A fallback mechanism uses the CPU as a backup, ensuring the code's robustness.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on device placement and performance optimization.
*  A strong understanding of CUDA programming and GPU architecture will aid in troubleshooting GPU-related issues.
*  Familiarize yourself with TensorFlow's profiler tools to analyze execution traces and identify performance bottlenecks, including those related to device placement.  This allows you to pinpoint exactly where and why operations are running on the CPU instead of the GPU, even when explicitly instructed otherwise.

Addressing the GPU execution problem requires a combination of careful code structuring, explicit device placement, and understanding potential error scenarios.  The examples highlight essential techniques for ensuring that operations like `tf.math.sqrt` effectively leverage the computational power of your GPU.  Ignoring these details can lead to significant performance degradation, particularly for computationally intensive deep learning models.  Remember to check for GPU availability and relevant drivers to avoid errors related to GPU access.
