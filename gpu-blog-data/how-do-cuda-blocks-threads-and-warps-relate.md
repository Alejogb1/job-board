The fundamental performance characteristic of CUDA hinges on the efficient mapping of threads, organized into blocks and warps, onto the hardware resources of the Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) within a GPU.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has consistently underscored the criticality of this mapping for achieving optimal throughput.  A misaligned or inefficient mapping can severely limit performance, regardless of algorithm sophistication.  Understanding this relationship, therefore, is paramount.

**1.  Clear Explanation of CUDA Hierarchy**

The CUDA execution model employs a hierarchical structure designed for parallel processing.  At the top level, we have the host—typically a CPU—which launches kernels (CUDA functions) executed on the GPU.  These kernels are executed by threads, the smallest units of execution.  Threads are grouped into blocks, which represent a logical grouping for synchronization and data sharing.  Several blocks collectively execute the same kernel, operating concurrently.

Critically, threads within a block are further organized into warps. A warp comprises 32 threads that execute instructions concurrently in a single instruction, multiple thread (SIMT) fashion.  This SIMT execution is the key to GPU parallelism: a single instruction is executed simultaneously by all threads within a warp.  However, if threads within a warp diverge in their execution paths (e.g., due to conditional statements), the warp suffers from serial execution, negating the benefits of SIMT.  This is often referred to as warp divergence. Minimizing warp divergence is a crucial optimization strategy.

The GPU's hardware comprises Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  Each SM is a processing unit that executes multiple blocks concurrently.  Within each SM are several Streaming Processors (SPs), also known as CUDA cores.  These SPs are the physical processing units executing the instructions of threads within a warp.  The number of SMs and SPs per SM varies depending on the GPU architecture.

The mapping process proceeds as follows: the host launches a kernel, and the CUDA runtime scheduler assigns blocks to available SMs.  Within each SM, the scheduler assigns warps to SPs.  Therefore, the performance is inherently tied to the efficient allocation of blocks to SMs and the minimization of warp divergence within individual SMs.  Over-subscription (more blocks than SMs) can lead to queuing delays, while under-subscription leaves processing resources idle.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate with three examples, highlighting different aspects of this mapping.

**Example 1: Simple Kernel Launch**

```c++
__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int N = 1024;
  int *h_data, *d_data;
  // ... memory allocation and data transfer ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  myKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N);

  // ... data transfer back to host and memory deallocation ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic kernel launch.  `threadsPerBlock` and `blocksPerGrid` define the block and grid dimensions. The calculation ensures that all elements of the input data are processed, even if `N` is not perfectly divisible by `threadsPerBlock`.  The choice of `threadsPerBlock` impacts the SM occupancy and therefore performance.  Experimentation is crucial to find the optimal value for a given GPU architecture and kernel.

**Example 2: Demonstrating Warp Divergence**

```c++
__global__ void divergentKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    if (data[i] % 2 == 0) {
      data[i] *= 2;
    } else {
      data[i] += 1;
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the conditional statement based on `data[i] % 2` introduces potential warp divergence. If threads within a warp have both even and odd values, they'll follow different execution paths, resulting in serial execution for that warp and reduced performance.  Strategies like reorganizing data to reduce divergence or using predicated execution can mitigate this.

**Example 3: Shared Memory for Coalesced Access**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *data, int N) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int idx = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[idx] = data[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block

    // Process data in shared memory
    sharedData[idx] *= 2;

    __syncthreads();
    data[i] = sharedData[idx];
  }
}
```

This illustrates the use of shared memory, a fast on-chip memory accessible to threads within a block.  Using shared memory to load data before processing improves memory access efficiency by enabling coalesced memory access. Coalesced access occurs when multiple threads access consecutive memory locations, optimizing memory transfers.  This example shows how careful memory management can improve performance significantly.  `__syncthreads()` ensures that all threads within the block have completed a phase before proceeding, preventing data races.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further in-depth understanding, I suggest consulting the official CUDA programming guide, focusing on sections detailing memory management, warp scheduling, and SM architecture.  Thorough investigation of the CUDA occupancy calculator will also prove invaluable for optimizing kernel launch parameters.  Finally, detailed analysis of GPU architecture specifications for your target hardware is crucial for effective code optimization.  Understanding the limitations and strengths of your specific GPU will enable you to write more efficient CUDA code.
