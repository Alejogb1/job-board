The efficacy of checkpointing in TensorFlow training hinges on a robust conditional saving mechanism, preventing the storage of inferior model states.  My experience optimizing large-scale NLP models highlighted the critical need for this;  unfettered checkpointing rapidly consumed storage and yielded negligible gains from inferior model iterations.  Therefore, a well-defined conditional checkpointing strategy based on a minimum training error threshold is crucial for efficient model development.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core principle involves monitoring a relevant training metric—in this case, training error—during each epoch or training step.  A threshold is predefined;  only if the current training error falls below this threshold is a checkpoint saved.  This process requires integrating a custom callback into the TensorFlow training loop. This callback intercepts the training process, accesses the current training error, compares it against the threshold, and invokes TensorFlow's checkpoint saving functionality accordingly.  The choice of training error metric depends on the specific problem. For instance, mean squared error (MSE) is suitable for regression tasks, while categorical cross-entropy is appropriate for classification.

Several considerations must be addressed:

* **Metric Selection:**  The choice of metric needs careful attention. While training error offers a direct measure of model performance on the training data, it's essential to avoid overfitting.  A validation metric, such as validation error or loss, should ideally be considered alongside training error to prevent saving checkpoints that perform poorly on unseen data.  A strategy might involve using the training error as the primary trigger and the validation error as a secondary confirmation check.

* **Threshold Determination:** The threshold value needs careful tuning based on empirical observations and the problem's complexity.  Starting with a relatively lenient threshold and gradually tightening it during experimentation is a reasonable approach.  Furthermore, incorporating a moving average of the training error can mitigate the impact of noisy fluctuations in the metric.

* **Checkpoint Directory Management:**  The checkpoint directory should be structured to prevent the accumulation of numerous checkpoints.  Strategies such as retaining only the best performing checkpoint or employing a rolling checkpoint scheme (keeping only the last N checkpoints) are beneficial for maintaining disk space and simplifying model version control.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Conditional Checkpointing with Training Error**

This example demonstrates the fundamental concept using a simple MSE-based error check:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define the optimizer and loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Define the checkpoint manager
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "ckpt_{epoch}")
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer,
                             model=model)
checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)

# Define the custom callback
class MinErrorCheckpointCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, threshold):
        super(MinErrorCheckpointCallback, self).__init__()
        self.threshold = threshold

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
            return
        if logs['loss'] < self.threshold:
            checkpoint_manager.save()
            print(f'Checkpoint saved at epoch {epoch+1} with loss {logs["loss"]:.4f}')

# Train the model with the callback
min_error_threshold = 0.1
callback = MinErrorCheckpointCallback(min_error_threshold)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, callbacks=[callback])
```

This code defines a custom callback `MinErrorCheckpointCallback` that checks the training loss ('loss' in logs) after each epoch.  If the loss is below `min_error_threshold`, it saves a checkpoint using `checkpoint_manager.save()`. `max_to_keep` in `CheckpointManager` limits the number of checkpoints stored.


**Example 2: Incorporating Validation Error for Robustness**

This example adds a validation error check to improve the robustness of the checkpointing strategy.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (model, optimizer, loss_fn definitions as in Example 1) ...

class MinErrorCheckpointCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, training_threshold, validation_threshold):
        super(MinErrorCheckpointCallback, self).__init__()
        self.training_threshold = training_threshold
        self.validation_threshold = validation_threshold

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
            return
        if logs['loss'] < self.training_threshold and logs['val_loss'] < self.validation_threshold:
            checkpoint_manager.save()
            print(f'Checkpoint saved at epoch {epoch+1} with loss {logs["loss"]:.4f} and val_loss {logs["val_loss"]:.4f}')

# Train the model
training_threshold = 0.1
validation_threshold = 0.15
callback = MinErrorCheckpointCallback(training_threshold, validation_threshold)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['mse']) # Added metrics for val_loss
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), callbacks=[callback])
```

Here, the callback checks both training and validation loss.  A checkpoint is saved only if *both* thresholds are met, providing a more reliable indication of model improvement.  Note the addition of `metrics=['mse']` in `model.compile` to obtain validation loss.


**Example 3: Using a Moving Average of Training Error**

This example incorporates a moving average to smooth out fluctuations in the training error:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# ... (model, optimizer, loss_fn definitions as in Example 1) ...

class MinErrorCheckpointCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, threshold, window_size):
        super(MinErrorCheckpointCallback, self).__init__()
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.losses = []

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
            return
        self.losses.append(logs['loss'])
        if len(self.losses) < self.window_size:
            return
        moving_average = np.mean(self.losses[-self.window_size:])
        if moving_average < self.threshold:
            checkpoint_manager.save()
            print(f'Checkpoint saved at epoch {epoch+1} with moving average loss {moving_average:.4f}')

# Train the model
min_error_threshold = 0.1
window_size = 5
callback = MinErrorCheckpointCallback(min_error_threshold, window_size)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, callbacks=[callback])

```

Here, a moving average of the last `window_size` training losses is computed. The checkpoint is saved only if this moving average falls below the threshold, reducing the effect of short-term noise in the training error.  This requires maintaining a list of past losses (`self.losses`).
