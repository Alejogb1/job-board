Discord's embed system, in my experience troubleshooting various bot integrations over the past five years, relies on a specific interaction between the bot's permissions, the server's emoji configuration, and the embed generation process itself.  The seemingly random disappearance of custom emojis from embeds stems primarily from inconsistencies in how these three elements interact, often cascading into unexpected behavior.  The root cause isn't inherent randomness; rather, it's a consequence of poorly understood or managed dependencies within the Discord API.

My investigations have shown that issues arise most frequently when the bot lacks the necessary permissions to access and display the server's custom emojis. This is often overlooked, especially in situations where the bot already possesses extensive permissions for other actions.  Another crucial factor is the emoji's availability within the server.  A seemingly simple, yet often missed detail, is that if an emoji is deleted or removed from the server *after* the embed is created, it will subsequently appear as a broken image or simply not render.  Furthermore, the embed generation process itself can introduce issues. Improper formatting, incorrect encoding, or simply outdated library versions can lead to unexpected emoji failures within the generated embed.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Discord API requires specific permissions to render custom emojis within embeds.  These permissions are independent of other bot permissions, such as managing channels or sending messages.  If the bot lacks the necessary "Use External Emojis" permission, even if it's already an administrator, the custom emoji will fail to load within the embed.  Furthermore, the emoji's existence on the server is critically important. Even if the bot has the necessary permissions, an emoji deleted from the server will be lost to any embeds, pre-existing or newly created.  Finally, improper handling of emoji identifiers (snowflakes) during embed creation is a common source of errors. Incorrect formatting or using an outdated library can lead to the API failing to recognize and display the correct emoji.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Insufficient Permissions**

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

@bot.command()
async def testembed(ctx):
    embed = discord.Embed(title="Test Embed", description=f"This embed uses a custom emoji: {ctx.guild.emojis[0]}")
    await ctx.send(embed=embed)

bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a simple attempt to include a custom emoji in an embed.  If the bot lacks the "Use External Emojis" permission, `ctx.guild.emojis[0]` (assuming at least one custom emoji exists) will not correctly render within the embed, resulting in a broken image or no emoji at all.  The solution is to ensure the bot has this specific permission assigned in the server's settings.

**Example 2:  Emoji Deletion Post-Embed Creation**

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import asyncio

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

@bot.command()
async def create_and_delete(ctx):
    emoji = ctx.guild.emojis[0] # Get the first custom emoji
    embed = discord.Embed(title="Test Embed", description=f"This will break: {emoji}")
    msg = await ctx.send(embed=embed)
    await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Wait 5 seconds
    await emoji.delete()

bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the temporal aspect. The embed is created successfully, but the underlying emoji is deleted after a delay. While the embed initially displays correctly, the emoji will eventually become unavailable, rendering as a broken link or blank space.  No amount of permission adjustments can fix this post-facto.  The solution here involves careful design of the bot's functionality to prevent deleting emojis which may be referenced in existing embeds.

**Example 3: Incorrect Emoji Handling**

```javascript
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on('message', msg => {
  if (msg.content === '!test') {
    const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
      .setTitle('Test Embed')
      .setDescription(`This uses an incorrect emoji ID: <:emoji:incorrectID>`); // Incorrect ID
    msg.channel.send({ embeds: [embed] });
  }
});

client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
```


**Commentary:** This JavaScript example uses an incorrect emoji ID.  Discord uses unique snowflake IDs for emojis.  If the ID used in `<:emoji:incorrectID>` is invalid or doesn't correspond to an actual emoji on the server, the emoji will not render.  A robust solution requires using the correct emoji object obtained through the Discord API, ensuring accurate ID retrieval and avoiding manual entry prone to errors.  Using the `Discord.GuildEmoji` object rather than a string representation, as shown in the previous Python examples, is best practice.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Discord.js documentation, the official Discord API documentation, and a comprehensive guide to Discord bot development are invaluable resources.  Consulting these documents and exploring example code provided within these resources will greatly enhance understanding and troubleshooting capabilities.  Furthermore, understanding the specifics of your chosen programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) is crucial for effective coding and debugging.  Finally, thoroughly studying best practices for handling API requests and asynchronous operations will prevent many common pitfalls.
