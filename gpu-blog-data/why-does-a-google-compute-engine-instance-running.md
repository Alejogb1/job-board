The root cause of a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance running a container multiple times instead of once frequently stems from misconfigurations within the orchestration system, the container image itself, or the instance's startup scripts.  Over the years, debugging this issue in various production environments has led me to consistently isolate three primary areas of investigation.

**1. Orchestration System Misconfiguration:**  This is by far the most common culprit.  Kubernetes, while powerful, is susceptible to errors if not meticulously configured.  Incorrectly defined deployments, replica sets, or stateful sets can easily lead to multiple container instances running where only one is intended.  For example, a Deployment specifying more than one replica will, by design, run multiple instances of your container.  Similarly, a StatefulSet, even with a replica count of one, might inadvertently create multiple instances if the underlying PersistentVolumeClaim is not properly configured to ensure uniqueness.  I've personally encountered scenarios where a seemingly innocuous typo in a YAML file resulted in an unintended scaling up of pods, effectively executing the container multiple times.  Moreover, improper handling of resource constraints can indirectly lead to multiple instances—the system might over-allocate resources, leading to the scheduler creating additional pods in an attempt to accommodate the workload.

**2. Container Image Issues:** While less frequent than orchestration problems, issues within the container image itself can induce multiple executions.  A poorly written entrypoint script is a prime suspect.  If the entrypoint script contains logic that inadvertently forks or spawns multiple processes, each acting as a separate instance of your application, the container will effectively run multiple times.  I recall an incident where a container's entrypoint script relied on a `while` loop with a faulty exit condition, leading to endless process forking and ultimately consuming system resources rapidly. Another example is if the container’s entrypoint runs a process which then itself attempts to start another instance of the same process. This is especially pertinent with daemons that might be configured to restart upon unexpected termination.  Furthermore, if the image doesn't properly handle signals or processes gracefully, abrupt terminations could trigger restarts, creating the illusion of multiple executions.


**3. Instance Startup Scripts:**  GCE instances often incorporate startup scripts to handle initial configuration and application deployment. These scripts, if improperly written, can contribute to the problem.  For instance, a script that repeatedly attempts to start the container without proper error handling or checks for existing instances can easily lead to multiple executions.  A common mistake is to not correctly check if the container process is already running before attempting to start a new one.  I've personally debugged scenarios where a poorly structured startup script would restart the container numerous times upon each instance boot-up, ultimately resulting in a runaway process.  Another pitfall is the use of cron jobs within startup scripts that inadvertently schedule multiple executions of the container's entry point without consideration for a process already running.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Kubernetes Deployment Specification:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3 # This should be 1 for a single instance
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-registry/my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

*Commentary:* This deployment specification explicitly requests three replicas.  Changing `replicas: 3` to `replicas: 1` directly addresses the problem.


**Example 2: Problematic Container Entrypoint Script (Bash):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  echo "Starting application..."
  /usr/local/bin/my-application & # This runs in the background without checking for existing instances.
  sleep 10 #check every 10 seconds. Should instead check for process status.
done
```

*Commentary:* This script uses a `while true` loop which will constantly restart the application.  A more robust approach would involve checking for the existence of `my-application` and only starting it if it’s not already running, using commands like `pgrep` or `ps aux | grep my-application`.  The `&` ensures the application runs in the background;  the absence of proper process management is the core issue.   A correct version would use a process manager like systemd.


**Example 3: Faulty GCE Startup Script (Bash):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Incorrect startup script that doesn't check for existing containers.
docker run -d my-registry/my-app:latest &
```

*Commentary:* This script lacks error handling and checks for running instances.  Before running the `docker run` command, it should verify the container isn't already running, likely using `docker ps -q` and checking the output.  If the container is already running, the script should ideally exit gracefully.  Ideally, it should also incorporate more robust error handling. A significantly better approach would utilize tools like Kubernetes or a more sophisticated initialization system to manage the container lifecycle.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a thorough understanding of Kubernetes deployments and their configuration, consult the official Kubernetes documentation. For in-depth knowledge of container image best practices and Dockerfile construction, refer to the official Docker documentation.  Finally, delve into the specifics of Google Compute Engine instance management, focusing on startup scripts and initialization procedures, by examining Google Cloud's official documentation on Compute Engine.  A strong grasp of process management concepts within Linux environments is also crucial.
