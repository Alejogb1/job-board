Successfully executing Bazel builds offline with TensorFlow 2.9.1 on CentOS 7 hinges on meticulous management of dependencies and the Bazel cache.  My experience troubleshooting similar scenarios within large-scale machine learning projects highlighted the critical role of a properly configured `.bazelrc` file and the strategic use of Bazel's remote caching features, even in an offline context.  A naive approach often leads to build failures due to missing transitive dependencies or the inability to resolve external repositories.


**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow, especially at version 2.9.1, relies on a substantial number of dependencies.  These extend beyond the core TensorFlow library itself to include various CUDA libraries (if using GPU acceleration), protobuf, Eigen, and numerous other components. When operating offline, Bazel cannot retrieve these dependencies from remote repositories. To address this, we must preemptively download and cache all necessary artifacts. This involves two primary strategies: leveraging Bazel's local cache and employing a local mirror of remote repositories.


Bazel maintains a local cache of downloaded artifacts and build outputs.  To maximize its effectiveness offline, we must ensure that all required dependencies are fetched and stored in this cache *before* disconnecting from the network.  This often involves executing a "warm-up" build with network connectivity enabled to populate the cache.


Furthermore, Bazel's remote caching capabilities, while seemingly incongruous with an offline scenario, prove instrumental.  By configuring Bazel to use a local directory as its remote cache, we effectively create a self-contained, offline-capable remote cache.  This approach allows us to store and retrieve build artifacts locally, mimicking the behavior of a remote cache without requiring network access.


**2. Code Examples:**


**Example 1:  Configuring the `.bazelrc` for Offline Operation**

```bazelrc
startup --batch
build --verbose_failures
build --experimental_use_remote_cache=true
build --remote_cache=file:///path/to/local/cache
build --genrule_strategy=standalone
```

This configuration instructs Bazel to operate in batch mode, provide verbose failure messages for easier debugging, utilize the remote cache functionality, and set the remote cache to a local directory (`/path/to/local/cache`). The `--genrule_strategy=standalone` flag ensures that rules involving external tools are executed locally, crucial for offline compatibility.  Remember to replace `/path/to/local/cache` with the actual path to a sufficiently large directory on your system.  This directory needs to exist prior to running the build. Insufficient disk space is a common reason for offline build failures.


**Example 2: A simple TensorFlow Bazel project (WORKSPACE)**

```workspace
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "tensorflow",
    urls = ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/refs/tags/v2.9.1.tar.gz"],
    strip_prefix = "tensorflow-v2.9.1",
    sha256 = "YOUR_SHA256_HASH_HERE",
)

load("@tensorflow//tensorflow:workspace.bzl", "tf_workspace")

tf_workspace(name = "tensorflow")

# Add other necessary dependencies as required
```

This `WORKSPACE` file downloads the TensorFlow source code from GitHub.  Crucially, you need to replace `YOUR_SHA256_HASH_HERE` with the correct SHA256 hash for the TensorFlow 2.9.1 release. This ensures the integrity of the downloaded code.  Verifying the hash is paramount, particularly when operating offline and unable to re-download.  This example showcases how to integrate TensorFlow into a Bazel project; expanding it for specific use cases would require adding build rules and dependencies accordingly.  You might need additional rules to handle CUDA toolchains, if needed, based on your hardware and TensorFlow configuration.



**Example 3:  A Basic Build Rule (BUILD)**

```build
load("@tensorflow//tensorflow:BUILD.bazel", "tf_py_binary")

tf_py_binary(
    name = "my_tensorflow_program",
    srcs = ["my_program.py"],
    deps = [
        "@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py",
    ],
)
```

This `BUILD` file defines a simple rule to build a Python program using TensorFlow.  The `deps` attribute specifies the TensorFlow Python library as a dependency.  This example assumes you have a Python script, `my_program.py`, located in the same directory. The `@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py` targets depend on the correct inclusion of TensorFlow in your `WORKSPACE` file from Example 2. You'll replace `my_program.py` with your actual program's source file.  This illustrates the minimal structure for building a TensorFlow program within a Bazel project.  Again, for complex projects involving GPU acceleration, further configurations for CUDA would be necessary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official Bazel documentation. This is your primary reference for understanding Bazel's features and configurations.
* The TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections related to building and installing TensorFlow from source.
* A comprehensive guide on managing software dependencies.  A strong understanding of dependency management is vital for large-scale projects like this.


Remember to carefully consider the implications of offline builds.  Thorough pre-planning and a well-organized approach are essential to minimize the risk of build failures once disconnected from the network.  The combination of a well-configured `.bazelrc`, a correctly specified `WORKSPACE` file, and clear build rules are the keys to successfully managing TensorFlow builds within an offline Bazel environment on CentOS 7.   Always verify hash sums of downloaded archives to ensure integrity.  Systematic testing, starting with small, isolated components, is a highly recommended strategy to mitigate unexpected issues.
