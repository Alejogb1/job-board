The observed lack of training effect after a deepcopy operation on a PyTorch model stems fundamentally from the model's state being detached from the optimizer's internal tracking mechanisms.  A simple deepcopy creates a structurally identical copy, but crucially, this copy doesn't inherit the optimizer's accumulated gradients or internal state.  This means that even though the model's weights are copied, the optimizer essentially starts afresh, ignoring any previous training progress.  I've encountered this issue numerous times while working on large-scale image recognition projects and have developed robust strategies to overcome it.

The primary cause is the optimizer's dependency on the *original* model's parameters.  These parameters are tracked by reference, not by value.  When performing a deepcopy, you duplicate the model's structure and weight values, but the optimizer still references the *original* parameter tensors.  Consequently, gradient updates computed during backpropagation only affect the original model, leaving the copied model untouched.

Let's clarify with three code examples demonstrating this behavior and illustrating the correct approach.

**Example 1: Incorrect Deepcopy and Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import copy

# Define a simple model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Create a deepcopy
model_copy = copy.deepcopy(model)

# Training loop (incorrect)
for i in range(100):
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    target = torch.randn(1)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = (output - target).sum()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Verify that only the original model trained
print("Original Model Weights:", list(model.parameters())[0][0][:5])
print("Copied Model Weights:", list(model_copy.parameters())[0][0][:5])
```

In this example, the `deepcopy` creates `model_copy`. However, the `optimizer` only interacts with the original `model`.  The `model_copy` remains unchanged despite the training loop's execution. The output will demonstrate near identical weights for both models.

**Example 2: Correct Approach Using Separate Optimizer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import copy

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Create a deepcopy and a NEW optimizer
model_copy = copy.deepcopy(model)
optimizer_copy = optim.SGD(model_copy.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (correct)
for i in range(100):
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    target = torch.randn(1)
    optimizer_copy.zero_grad()
    output = model_copy(input_data)
    loss = (output - target).sum()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer_copy.step()

# Verify training occurred on the copied model
print("Original Model Weights:", list(model.parameters())[0][0][:5])
print("Copied Model Weights:", list(model_copy.parameters())[0][0][:5])
```

Here, the crucial modification is the creation of a *new* optimizer, `optimizer_copy`, specifically for the copied model, `model_copy`. This ensures that the gradient updates are correctly applied to the duplicated model's parameters. The output now will reveal distinct weight values, indicating successful training of the copy.


**Example 3:  Handling State Dictionaries for More Complex Models**

For models with more intricate architectures (e.g., convolutional networks, recurrent networks), using state dictionaries provides a more robust approach.  This avoids potential issues with inadvertently copying optimizer-specific data that might not be compatible between different model instances.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(5, 1))
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop (partially training original model)
for i in range(50):
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    target = torch.randn(1)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = (output - target).sum()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save model and optimizer state
model_state_dict = model.state_dict()
optimizer_state_dict = optimizer.state_dict()

# Create a new model (same architecture)
model_copy = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(5, 1))
optimizer_copy = optim.Adam(model_copy.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# Load state dictionaries into the new model and optimizer
model_copy.load_state_dict(model_state_dict)
optimizer_copy.load_state_dict(optimizer_state_dict)

# Resume training from where we left off
for i in range(50, 100):
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    target = torch.randn(1)
    optimizer_copy.zero_grad()
    output = model_copy(input_data)
    loss = (output - target).sum()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer_copy.step()

print("Original Model Weights (Layer 1):", list(model.parameters())[0][0][:5])
print("Copied Model Weights (Layer 1):", list(model_copy.parameters())[0][0][:5])

```
This method ensures that both the model's weights and the optimizer's internal state (like momentum for Adam) are correctly transferred, leading to seamless continuation of training.

In conclusion, the apparent lack of training after a `deepcopy` is not due to an inherent flaw in `deepcopy` itself, but rather a misunderstanding of the optimizer's reference-based tracking of model parameters.  Creating a new optimizer for the copied model, or utilizing state dictionaries for more complex scenarios, are effective solutions to this issue.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive guides on model saving, loading, and optimizer usage.  Consult advanced tutorials and example code repositories focusing on deep learning model training and management.  Review materials specifically addressing object copying in Python and the implications for mutable data structures.  Understanding PyTorch's autograd system is also essential for a complete grasp of the underlying mechanisms.
