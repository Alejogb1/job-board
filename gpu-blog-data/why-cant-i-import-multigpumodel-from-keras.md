The inability to import `multi_gpu_model` from Keras stems directly from its deprecation and removal in subsequent Keras versions.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects, particularly those leveraging TensorFlow as the backend, highlighted this shift.  Early Keras versions, heavily reliant on TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`, incorporated `multi_gpu_model` as a convenient wrapper. However, this approach lacked flexibility and suffered from inherent limitations in scaling beyond a small number of GPUs.  The current best practices, emphasizing TensorFlow's distribution strategies or other dedicated multi-GPU libraries, render `multi_gpu_model` obsolete.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `multi_gpu_model` function, previously found in Keras, provided a seemingly straightforward method for distributing model training across multiple GPUs. It essentially replicated the model on each available GPU, synchronizing weights after each training step. This approach was attractive for its simplicity, but its underlying mechanism, based on data parallelism, introduced significant bottlenecks.  As model complexity and dataset sizes increased, the communication overhead between GPUs often negated the performance gains from parallelization. Furthermore, `multi_gpu_model` lacked the sophisticated features found in more modern distributed training strategies, such as gradient aggregation techniques and automatic sharding of model parameters.  This ultimately led to its removal in favor of more robust and scalable solutions.

The transition away from `multi_gpu_model` requires a shift in approach. Instead of relying on a single high-level function, developers must now explicitly define their distributed training strategy using TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.Strategy` API or utilize dedicated libraries optimized for multi-GPU training.  These modern methods offer superior control over data distribution, gradient aggregation, and model parallelism, enabling efficient scaling across many GPUs and improving overall training throughput.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate three different approaches to multi-GPU training in TensorFlow/Keras, showcasing the evolution from the deprecated `multi_gpu_model` to modern best practices.

**Example 1:  Attempting to Use the Deprecated `multi_gpu_model` (Illustrative – Will Fail)**

```python
# This code will fail in modern Keras versions.
# It serves only to illustrate the deprecated approach.

from tensorflow.keras.utils import multi_gpu_model  # This import will likely fail.
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Define your model: model = ... ) ...

try:
    parallel_model = multi_gpu_model(model, gpus=2)  # Assumes 2 GPUs available
    parallel_model.compile(...)
    parallel_model.fit(...)
except ImportError:
    print("multi_gpu_model is not available in this Keras version.")
```

This code attempts to use the deprecated `multi_gpu_model`.  As noted in the comments, this will fail in current Keras installations due to the function's removal.  It highlights the problem the original question presents.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Define your model: model = ... ) ...

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = keras.models.Model(...)  # Re-create the model within the strategy scope
    model.compile(...)
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, ...)
```

This example utilizes `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`, a data-parallel strategy that replicates the model across multiple GPUs. The crucial aspect is wrapping the model creation and compilation within `strategy.scope()`. This ensures that the model is correctly distributed across the available devices.  Note that this strategy is still data parallel and may not be optimal for all architectures or datasets.


**Example 3: Using `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` for Cluster Training (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Define your model: model = ... ) ...

cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TFConfigClusterResolver()
strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy(cluster_resolver)
with strategy.scope():
    model = keras.models.Model(...)
    model.compile(...)
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, ...)
```

This advanced example demonstrates the use of `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` for distributed training across a cluster of machines, each with multiple GPUs.  It requires configuring TensorFlow to recognize the cluster environment, typically through environment variables or a `cluster_spec` file.  This approach is essential for training very large models on extensive datasets which exceed the memory capacity of a single machine.  The benefits include better scalability and fault tolerance compared to the simpler `MirroredStrategy`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of distributed training in TensorFlow, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation's sections on distributed training and the `tf.distribute` API. The TensorFlow tutorials provide practical examples showcasing various strategies.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics like model parallelism and different gradient aggregation methods will prove invaluable for optimizing multi-GPU training performance.  Finally, reviewing relevant research papers focusing on large-scale deep learning training will provide a theoretical foundation to complement practical experience.  This multi-faceted approach – practical examples, theoretical understanding, and well-structured documentation – is crucial for mastering this topic.
