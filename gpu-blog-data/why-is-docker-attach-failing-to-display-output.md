The root cause of `docker attach` failing to display output and return control to the shell in a Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM frequently stems from misconfigurations within the Docker daemon itself, specifically regarding the logging driver and the interaction between the daemon's STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR handling and the container's process behavior.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale containerized deployments, and isolating the issue often involves a methodical examination of several potential points of failure.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `docker attach` command attempts to connect your terminal's STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR streams directly to those of a running container.  If the container's process isn't actively writing to STDOUT or STDERR, or if the Docker daemon isn't correctly forwarding these streams, your terminal will appear unresponsive.  This is exacerbated by specific logging configurations within Docker.  For example, if the logging driver is configured to write logs to a file (e.g., `json-file`, `syslog`), the standard output of the container's process might not be directed to the attached terminal at all.  Furthermore, if the container's main process exits before you attempt to attach, `docker attach` will immediately return control to the shell without any output, even if logs exist.  Finally, network connectivity issues within the GCE VM, though less common, can occasionally manifest as a seemingly unresponsive `docker attach` command.  In GCE specifically, ensuring the VM's networking is correctly configured and has sufficient resources is crucial.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct `docker run` and `docker attach` usage, illustrating successful output.**

```bash
# Create a simple container that continuously prints output to STDOUT
docker run -d --name my-test-container alpine sh -c "while true; do echo 'Hello from the container'; sleep 1; done"

# Attach to the container; output will continuously stream to the terminal.
docker attach my-test-container

# Press Ctrl+p Ctrl+q to detach gracefully.
```

This example demonstrates a basic, functioning scenario. The `-d` flag in `docker run` runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.  The `while` loop ensures continuous output to STDOUT, which `docker attach` successfully captures and displays.  The `Ctrl+p Ctrl+q` sequence is the correct method for detaching without killing the container.  Failure at this stage often indicates an issue with your Docker installation or basic system configuration.


**Example 2:  Illustrating the effect of a logging driver.**

```bash
# Configure Docker to use the json-file logging driver (check your daemon.json)
# ... edit daemon.json, adding or modifying "log-driver": "json-file", ...
# Restart Docker service.

# Run a container with a logging driver that writes to a file
docker run -d --name my-log-container alpine sh -c "while true; do echo 'This will go to the log file, not the terminal'; sleep 1; done"

# Attempt to attach; no output will be seen in the terminal.
docker attach my-log-container
```

Here, we deliberately use a logging driver that diverts STDOUT to a file.  The `docker attach` command will show nothing because the container's output is written to logs instead of directly to STDOUT.  Examination of the logs (located at `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container_ID>/<log_file>`) will reveal the missing output.   This highlights the importance of understanding your logging configuration.


**Example 3: Container process exit before `docker attach`**

```bash
# Run a container that exits immediately
docker run --name my-shortlived-container alpine sh -c "echo 'This is a short-lived message'; exit 0"

# Attempt to attach; the command will return immediately with no output.
docker attach my-shortlived-container
```

In this scenario, the container's main process finishes before the `docker attach` command is executed. Consequently, there is no active process to attach to, resulting in an immediate return to the shell without any output. Checking the container logs might offer clues, but in this example, the only output is written to STDOUT before the process terminates, meaning nothing would be seen even without a configured logging driver.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Docker documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding the `docker attach` command, container management, and logging configurations.  Consult the Docker daemon configuration reference to properly understand the `daemon.json` file and its various options.  Familiarize yourself with the intricacies of container processes and how STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR are managed within a containerized environment.  Finally, explore the Google Compute Engine documentation for troubleshooting networking problems within your VMs, as network hiccups can sometimes mimic symptoms of a faulty `docker attach` call.  A comprehensive understanding of these aspects allows for effective debugging and problem resolution.  Understanding how systemd manages services in Linux environments is also beneficial, particularly for understanding how the docker daemon itself is managed within GCE.  Consider using a debugging tool like `strace` to monitor system calls if you need a deeper look at what might be blocking the process.  Remember to carefully review the error messages returned by `docker attach` as they can provide crucial clues.  Always check the docker logs (both the container's logs and the daemon's logs) for additional diagnostic information.
