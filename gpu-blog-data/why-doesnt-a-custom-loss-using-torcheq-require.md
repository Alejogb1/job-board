The core issue stems from the inherent non-differentiability of the `torch.eq` function.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image segmentation models highlighted this repeatedly. `torch.eq` performs an element-wise equality comparison, resulting in a tensor of Boolean values (True/False or 1/0).  Crucially, this operation lacks a defined derivative.  Gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation rely on calculating gradientsâ€”the rate of change of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters.  Since a step function (as `torch.eq` effectively represents) has zero gradient almost everywhere and undefined gradient at the discontinuity, standard automatic differentiation techniques fail.


This limitation is not specific to PyTorch; it's a fundamental constraint of calculus.  Consider the gradient calculation: it requires a continuous function, allowing us to approximate the slope at a point.  The output of `torch.eq` is discontinuous; a tiny change in input doesn't smoothly translate to a change in output.  The output abruptly switches between 0 and 1.  Therefore, no meaningful gradient can be computed.


Let's illustrate this with code examples.  First, consider a simple scenario where we directly use `torch.eq` in a loss function:

**Example 1: Direct use of `torch.eq`**

```python
import torch

# Predicted values
predictions = torch.tensor([0.8, 0.2, 0.9, 0.1], requires_grad=True)

# Target values
targets = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0])

# Loss using torch.eq
loss = torch.eq(predictions, targets).float().mean() #Note the conversion to float

loss.backward()

print(predictions.grad) # Output: None
```

Here, we see `predictions.grad` is `None`.  The `torch.eq` operation produces a tensor of 0s and 1s.  The subsequent `.mean()` calculates the average accuracy, a metric that is not differentiable. This demonstrates the core problem.  The attempt to compute gradients fails because the loss is not differentiable with respect to `predictions`.


To overcome this, we need to replace `torch.eq` with a differentiable alternative that approximates the comparison operation.  One common approach is to use a differentiable approximation of the indicator function, such as a sigmoid function or a smooth approximation of the Heaviside step function.  This technique leverages the fact that the sigmoid approaches 0 or 1 as its input tends towards negative or positive infinity, respectively.

**Example 2: Using Sigmoid Approximation**

```python
import torch

predictions = torch.tensor([0.8, 0.2, 0.9, 0.1], requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0])

#Differentiable approximation of equality
loss = -torch.sigmoid(predictions - targets).mean() + 0.5 #subtracting the targets introduces a bias

loss.backward()

print(predictions.grad) #Output: A tensor of gradients
```


This example utilizes the sigmoid function to approximate the equality comparison. The subtraction ensures that predictions close to targets result in values near zero, resulting in a loss minimization. The constant 0.5 term helps to adjust for the bias introduced by the sigmoid.  Crucially, the sigmoid function *is* differentiable, allowing backpropagation to compute gradients and update the `predictions`.  The negative sign ensures that it behaves similar to a loss function (minimizing it implies approaching accurate predictions).


Another approach, if dealing with binary classification, involves directly using a binary cross-entropy loss function. This function is inherently designed to handle the differences between predicted probabilities and target labels (0 or 1), thus implicitly avoiding the issue of non-differentiable comparisons.

**Example 3: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

predictions = torch.tensor([0.8, 0.2, 0.9, 0.1], requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0])

#Binary Cross Entropy loss
loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(predictions, targets)

loss.backward()

print(predictions.grad) # Output: A tensor of gradients.
```

In this example, `F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` directly handles the comparison implicitly.  The `logits` input allows the function to interpret the inputs as pre-sigmoid outputs, which avoids explicit computation of sigmoid within the loss. This function is designed to be differentiable and therefore suitable for gradient-based optimization. Note this particular function is better suited for handling probabilities directly as opposed to making a direct comparison.  However it showcases another method to avoid the use of non-differentiable functions


In summary,  `torch.eq`'s inability to support gradient calculation arises from its non-differentiability.  Directly using it within a loss function prevents backpropagation.  To address this, replace `torch.eq` with differentiable approximations, such as the sigmoid function, or use a loss function inherently designed for binary or multi-class classification problems, which are inherently differentiable.  My experience demonstrates that overlooking this crucial distinction frequently leads to unexpected errors during model training, particularly in tasks involving pixel-wise classification or discrete labels where it may be tempting to use `torch.eq` for direct comparison.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering backpropagation.
*   A dedicated text on optimization algorithms used in deep learning.  Understanding the assumptions of these algorithms is key to understanding why `torch.eq` is unsuitable for gradient-based optimization.
*   A good reference on loss functions and their applicability to different tasks.
