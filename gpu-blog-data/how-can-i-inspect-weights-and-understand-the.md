The unexpected output shape from TensorFlow's `raw_rnn` often stems from a misunderstanding of its internal state handling and the interaction between the input sequence length and the recurrent cell's output dimensionality.  My experience debugging this involved several days spent meticulously tracing tensor shapes through the computation graph, a process significantly aided by TensorFlow's debugging tools and a deep understanding of recurrent neural network architectures.  The core issue isn't necessarily a bug in `raw_rnn` itself, but rather a consequence of its flexibility and low-level nature.  Let's clarify this with a detailed explanation, followed by illustrative code examples.

**1. Understanding `raw_rnn`'s Output:**

`tf.raw_rnn` is a powerful, low-level function for implementing custom recurrent networks. Unlike higher-level abstractions like `tf.keras.layers.RNN`, it doesn't abstract away state management.  This provides maximal control but necessitates careful attention to detail regarding the shape of inputs and outputs.  The output of `raw_rnn` is a tuple: `(output, output_state)`.

* **`output`:** This tensor represents the concatenated outputs of the recurrent cell at each time step.  Its shape is `[max_time, batch_size, cell_output_size]`.  `max_time` corresponds to the maximum length of the input sequences in a batch.  If sequences are of varying lengths, `raw_rnn` pads them to `max_time`. `batch_size` is the number of independent sequences processed in parallel.  `cell_output_size` is the dimensionality of the output produced by the recurrent cell at each time step.  This is crucial; it's determined by the cell you use (e.g., `tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell`'s output size is controlled during its instantiation).

* **`output_state`:** This is the final state of the recurrent cell after processing the entire input sequence. Its structure depends on the type of recurrent cell.  For an LSTM, it's a tuple of `(c, h)`â€”cell state and hidden state, each with shape `[batch_size, cell_state_size]` (potentially different from `cell_output_size`).  For a GRU, it's a single tensor representing the hidden state.

**2. Inspecting Weights:**

Inspecting the weights of the recurrent cell used within `raw_rnn` is typically done by accessing the cell's variables.  This requires understanding the cell's internal structure.  Most common cells (LSTMs, GRUs) have weight matrices for input-to-hidden and hidden-to-hidden transformations.  These are typically accessible via `cell.weights` or by iterating through the cell's trainable variables using `cell.trainable_variables`. The specific structure depends on the cell's implementation, so consulting the documentation for your chosen cell is essential.

**3. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic LSTM with `raw_rnn`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define LSTM cell
lstm_cell = tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=64)

# Input sequence: shape [max_time, batch_size, input_size]
input_data = tf.random.normal([10, 32, 32])

# Initial state: [batch_size, cell_state_size]  (LSTM requires both c and h)
initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size=32, dtype=tf.float32)

# Run raw_rnn
output, final_state = tf.compat.v1.nn.raw_rnn(lstm_cell, input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

# Inspect output shape
print("Output shape:", output.shape)  # Expected: (10, 32, 64)
print("Final state shape:", final_state.c.shape, final_state.h.shape)  # Expected: (32, 64), (32, 64)

# Access LSTM weights (this part might vary slightly based on TF version)
weights = lstm_cell.trainable_variables
print("Weight shapes:")
for w in weights:
    print(w.name, w.shape)
```


**Example 2: Handling Variable Sequence Lengths:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

lstm_cell = tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=64)
input_data = tf.random.normal([10, 32, 32]) #Example with max_time of 10

#Create sequence lengths tensor - this is crucial for variable length sequences
sequence_lengths = tf.constant([5, 7, 10, 3, 9, 6, 8, 4, 10, 2])

initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size=32, dtype=tf.float32)

output, final_state = tf.compat.v1.nn.raw_rnn(lstm_cell, input_data, sequence_length=sequence_lengths, initial_state=initial_state)

print("Output shape:", output.shape) #Expected: (10, 32, 64) - still padded to max_time
print("Final state shape:", final_state.c.shape, final_state.h.shape) # Expected: (32, 64), (32, 64)
```

**Example 3:  Custom Recurrent Cell:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomCell(tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.RNNCell):
    def __init__(self, output_size):
        self._output_size = output_size

    @property
    def state_size(self):
        return self._output_size

    @property
    def output_size(self):
        return self._output_size

    def __call__(self, inputs, state):
        #Simple linear transformation for demonstration
        W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([inputs.shape[-1], self._output_size]), name="custom_weight")
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, W) + state
        return output, output #output and state are the same in this simple example

custom_cell = MyCustomCell(output_size=128)
input_data = tf.random.normal([5, 16, 64]) # Batch size of 16, different max_time
initial_state = tf.zeros([16,128])
output, final_state = tf.compat.v1.nn.raw_rnn(custom_cell, input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)  # Expected: (5, 16, 128)
print("Final state shape:", final_state.shape)  # Expected: (16, 128)

#Inspect the custom cell's weights - directly accessing the variable
print("Weight shape:", custom_cell.variables[0].shape) # Expected: (64,128)

```

These examples highlight how to construct, run, and inspect the results and weights of `raw_rnn`.  Remember that careful attention to the cell's output size, state handling, and (in the case of variable-length sequences) the `sequence_length` argument is crucial for avoiding shape mismatches.  Incorrect shapes often arise from mismatched dimensions between the input, the cell's output size, and the initial state.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on recurrent neural networks and `tf.raw_rnn`,  should be consulted.  A thorough understanding of the underlying mathematics of recurrent networks, especially the workings of LSTMs and GRUs, is invaluable for debugging shape-related problems.  Textbooks focusing on deep learning and sequence modeling provide the necessary theoretical foundation.  Furthermore, leveraging TensorFlow's debugging tools (e.g., `tf.debugging.assert_shapes`) within your code can help pinpoint the source of shape inconsistencies.  Systematic debugging, including printing tensor shapes at various points in the computation graph, remains an indispensable technique.
