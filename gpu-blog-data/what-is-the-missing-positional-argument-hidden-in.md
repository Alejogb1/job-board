The apparent "missing" positional argument in an LSTM's `forward()` method isn't truly missing; rather, it's implicitly handled through the input tensor's dimensionality.  My experience debugging recurrent neural networks, particularly within the context of sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing, has repeatedly highlighted this point.  The crucial understanding lies in recognizing that the LSTM's input is not merely a single vector but a sequence of vectors, and the network's internal state implicitly tracks the positional information within that sequence.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Standard LSTM implementations expect input tensors with three dimensions: (sequence length, batch size, input features).  The `forward()` method processes this tensor sequentially.  The first dimension, *sequence length*, inherently encodes the positional information. Each element along this dimension represents a timestep, and the network processes these timesteps one after another.  Therefore, there's no need for an explicit positional argument; the positional context is inherent in the input's structure.

Consider a sentence represented as a sequence of word embeddings. The embedding for each word is a vector (input features).  The sequence of these word embeddings forms the second dimension (batch size) of a tensor.  If we have a batch of sentences, each sentence would be a separate sequence.  The LSTM’s `forward()` method operates on this three-dimensional tensor. As it iterates through the sequence dimension, the network implicitly understands the position of each word within its respective sentence in the batch.  The hidden state, updated at each timestep, carries forward information from previous timesteps, creating the sequential dependence crucial for understanding the context of each word.

The confusion often arises from comparing LSTMs with other neural network architectures where positional information might be explicitly passed as an argument (e.g., feedforward networks processing sequential data might require an index or timestamp). However, the LSTM's recurrent nature inherently manages this positional information through the sequential processing of the input tensor.  The hidden state acts as a memory, maintaining contextual information across timesteps, eliminating the need for an explicit positional parameter.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: PyTorch Implementation:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True) #batch_first=True specifies (batch, seq, feature)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x is shape (batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x) # LSTM processes sequentially
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) #Take only the output from the last timestep
        return out

# Example usage
input_size = 100 # Example embedding dimension
hidden_size = 256
output_size = 10
model = LSTMModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# Sample input: batch size 32, sequence length 20, 100 features
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 20, 100)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Output shape: (32, 10)
```

This PyTorch example clearly demonstrates that the `forward()` method takes only the input tensor.  The positional information is implicit within the tensor’s first dimension.  The `batch_first=True` argument ensures the batch size is the first dimension. The final fully connected layer (`fc`) operates on the final hidden state from the last timestep.

**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras Implementation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False, input_shape=(None, 100)),  #input_shape specifies (timesteps, features)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Sample input with batch size 32, variable sequence length
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((32, 20, 100))

output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Output shape: (32, 10)
```

The Keras implementation similarly avoids an explicit positional argument. The `input_shape` parameter defines the expected input tensor dimensionality, implicitly handling the positional information within the sequence. The `return_sequences=False` argument makes it return only the output from the last timestep, but this could be altered to process the entire sequence for different applications.

**Example 3:  Illustrative Simplified LSTM (Conceptual):**

```python
class SimpleLSTM:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        # ... initialization of weights and biases ...

    def forward(self, input_sequence):
        h = torch.zeros(self.hidden_size) # Initialize hidden state
        c = torch.zeros(self.hidden_size) # Initialize cell state
        outputs = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_sequence):
            # ... LSTM calculations using h, c, x; update h and c ...
            outputs.append(h)  # Output is based on hidden state
        return torch.stack(outputs) # Stack the outputs over the sequence length.

#example
input_sequence = torch.randn(10,100) #10 timesteps, 100 features
simple_lstm = SimpleLSTM(100, 50)
out = simple_lstm.forward(input_sequence)
print(out.shape) #output shape (10,50)
```

This simplified example, although lacking several optimizations of a production-ready LSTM, directly illustrates that the input is a sequence (list or tensor), and the position within that sequence is handled directly by the iteration. Each element `x` in the loop represents a timestep, making its position implicitly known to the model.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Deep Learning textbook by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.
* Recurrent Neural Networks, especially chapters dedicated to LSTMs and GRUs.
*  Scholarly articles on sequence modeling and LSTM architectures, particularly those exploring various LSTM variations and their applications.


These resources provide a more comprehensive understanding of recurrent neural networks and the intricacies of LSTM architectures.  By studying these materials, one can gain a deeper appreciation for the inherent handling of positional information within the LSTM model.  The core takeaway is that the LSTM's sequential processing and hidden state mechanisms inherently incorporate positional information within the input sequence itself, obviating the need for a dedicated positional argument in the `forward()` method.
