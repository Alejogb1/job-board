Ternarization, specifically the act of reducing a neural network's weights to three possible values (typically -1, 0, and 1), does not inherently prevent weight learning. It severely constrains the search space and modifies the optimization landscape, but gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms still function, leading to modified weight updates that can result in a trained, albeit likely less accurate, model. The critical adjustment is in how the weight updates are applied to the quantized weights.

I've encountered this directly while working on resource-constrained edge devices. The typical floating-point representations of weights were simply too large for the memory limits, and the energy consumption was prohibitive. This prompted exploration into quantization techniques, with ternarization presenting itself as a particularly aggressive yet intriguing compression method. My experience revealed that the key is understanding that the update isn't directly applied to the ternary representation. Instead, it's applied to a higher-precision "shadow" weight and then re-quantized, essentially “rounding” to the ternary values for storage and computation during the forward pass.

The process operates as follows: each weight has a corresponding high-precision, typically float32, “shadow” copy. Backpropagation calculates gradients for these shadow weights as it would with a standard neural network. These gradients are then applied to the shadow weights via a conventional optimization algorithm. After the weight update, the shadow weight is then re-ternarized using a defined method, and that ternary version is used for the forward pass.

A simple but common ternarization function involves first calculating a threshold, often based on a scaling factor multiplied by the L1 norm of the shadow weights within a given layer. Shadow weights exceeding this threshold receive a value of +1 or -1; all others are set to 0. The sign of each weight is preserved. The learning isn’t directly on the stored ternary weights. Rather, the ternary values are a derivative of the training. This crucial aspect allows for gradient-based learning despite having very constrained weight values during inference. The reduced precision affects the optimization process by creating a more discontinuous, "step-like" error surface, which makes it harder to navigate to an optimal solution, and often results in a loss in accuracy compared to the unquantized model. However, learning is not prevented; it’s merely altered. The learning is not directly on the stored ternary weights. Rather, the ternary values are a derivative of the training.

Here are three illustrative code examples using Python and NumPy to elaborate. I am choosing NumPy for simplicity. Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch have built-in quantization support which abstracts this further, but the core logic remains the same.

**Example 1: Ternarization Function**

This function demonstrates the ternarization process. The threshold is a simple scaled L1 norm of all weights in a layer.

```python
import numpy as np

def ternarize_weights(weights, scaling_factor=0.7):
  """Ternarizes weights to -1, 0, or 1."""
  threshold = scaling_factor * np.mean(np.abs(weights))
  ternary_weights = np.zeros_like(weights)
  ternary_weights[weights > threshold] = 1
  ternary_weights[weights < -threshold] = -1
  return ternary_weights

# Example usage
shadow_weights = np.array([-0.9, 0.2, 1.1, -0.4, 0.8, -1.3])
ternary_weights = ternarize_weights(shadow_weights)
print(f"Original Weights: {shadow_weights}")
print(f"Ternarized Weights: {ternary_weights}")
```

*Commentary:* This example illustrates the basic process. The function takes in a weight array (our "shadow" weights) and returns a new array with the ternary values. The scaling factor allows some control over the density of ternary weights (+/-1). The mean absolute weight value acts as a layer specific sensitivity for the quantization process.

**Example 2: Simulated Weight Update with Ternarization**

This example shows how shadow weights are updated with a gradient and then re-ternarized.

```python
import numpy as np

def update_and_ternarize(shadow_weights, gradient, learning_rate=0.1, scaling_factor=0.7):
  """Updates shadow weights with gradient and then ternarizes."""
  updated_shadow_weights = shadow_weights - learning_rate * gradient
  ternary_weights = ternarize_weights(updated_shadow_weights, scaling_factor)
  return updated_shadow_weights, ternary_weights

# Example usage
shadow_weights = np.array([-0.9, 0.2, 1.1, -0.4, 0.8, -1.3])
gradient = np.array([0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.1, 0.2, -0.1])
updated_shadows, ternary_weights = update_and_ternarize(shadow_weights, gradient)

print(f"Original Shadow Weights: {shadow_weights}")
print(f"Updated Shadow Weights: {updated_shadows}")
print(f"Ternary Weights: {ternary_weights}")
```

*Commentary:* The `update_and_ternarize` function simulates the core learning process. The shadow weights are updated based on gradients and a learning rate and are subsequently passed through the ternarization function. The return values illustrate the separation of high precision weights from their quantized counterparts. It is crucial to note that the ternary weights change even though the update is performed on the shadow weights.

**Example 3: Impact of Multiple Updates**

This demonstrates how multiple updates affect the ternary weights over time.

```python
import numpy as np

def train_ternary_layer(initial_shadow_weights, gradients, iterations=5, learning_rate=0.1, scaling_factor=0.7):
    shadow_weights = initial_shadow_weights.copy()
    for i in range(iterations):
        updated_shadows, ternary_weights = update_and_ternarize(shadow_weights, gradients[i], learning_rate, scaling_factor)
        shadow_weights = updated_shadows
        print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Ternary Weights: {ternary_weights}")
    return ternary_weights

# Example usage
initial_shadow_weights = np.array([-0.9, 0.2, 1.1, -0.4, 0.8, -1.3])
gradients = [
  np.array([0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.1, 0.2, -0.1]),
  np.array([-0.2, 0.3, -0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0.1]),
  np.array([0.3, -0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0.1, -0.2]),
  np.array([-0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0.1, -0.2, 0.3]),
  np.array([0.2, -0.1, 0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.1])
]
final_ternary_weights = train_ternary_layer(initial_shadow_weights, gradients)
print(f"Final Ternary Weights: {final_ternary_weights}")
```
*Commentary:* The `train_ternary_layer` method encapsulates a sequence of weight updates. Each update generates new ternary weights through the `update_and_ternarize` function. Observing these changes illustrates how the gradients (though computed using backpropagation over the full network), have changed the ternary weights over the 5 simulated training steps.

Regarding resources, I would recommend exploring the literature on neural network quantization and model compression. Specifically, papers that address "post-training quantization" and "quantization-aware training" are relevant. Look for publications from major conferences in machine learning, such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. Textbooks on deep learning often cover these topics as well. Furthermore, documentation provided by TensorFlow and PyTorch regarding their quantization APIs provides insights into practical implementations. These references provide a deeper understanding of the theoretical basis and practical considerations of this specific quantization technique. It’s crucial to understand that learning can proceed in ternarized weights, but it will likely be in a local minima as the error surfaces are more complex, and can be harder to traverse using gradient descent algorithms.
