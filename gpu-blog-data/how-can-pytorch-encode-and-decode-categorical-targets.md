One critical aspect of handling categorical data in machine learning, particularly in PyTorch workflows, is the ability to manage missing or undefined categories effectively during encoding. The standard `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` does not inherently handle missing values represented as `NaN` (Not a Number); attempting to encode a list containing `NaN` will raise an exception. My experience, specifically while developing a recommendation system based on user interactions where certain features were not always present, highlighted the necessity for a robust mechanism to handle these cases during label encoding within the PyTorch ecosystem.

To address this, a custom encoder, which I term `NaNLabelEncoder`, is necessary. This encoder must both encode categorical values, including explicit handling of `NaN`s, and, importantly, also maintain the ability to accurately decode these encoded values back into their original categorical representation. The implementation should ideally be compatible with PyTorch tensors, facilitating seamless integration with training loops.

The core principle of the `NaNLabelEncoder` revolves around treating `NaN` as another, specifically designated, category. During the encoding phase, if a `NaN` is encountered, it is assigned a unique numerical value—typically, the next available integer index after all other encountered categories. During the decoding phase, this reserved index is converted back to `NaN`. This is crucial to avoid distorting the dataset by accidentally misrepresenting actual categorical values during model operation.

Here’s a specific implementation I’ve used successfully, along with commentary:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

class NaNLabelEncoder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classes_ = []
        self.class_to_index_ = {}
        self.nan_index_ = None

    def fit(self, y):
        y = np.array(y) # Convert to numpy to handle NaN
        self.classes_ = []
        self.class_to_index_ = {}
        self.nan_index_ = None

        # Extract unique values, excluding NaN initially
        unique_values = np.unique(y[~pd.isna(y)]) # using pandas to efficiently exclude nan values

        # assign index to non-nan values
        for idx, val in enumerate(unique_values):
            self.classes_.append(val)
            self.class_to_index_[val] = idx

        # Determine if nan is present and if so, append as new class
        if np.any(pd.isna(y)):
            self.nan_index_ = len(self.classes_)
            self.classes_.append(np.nan)
            self.class_to_index_[np.nan] = self.nan_index_

        return self

    def transform(self, y):
        y = np.array(y)
        encoded = []
        for val in y:
           if pd.isna(val): # efficiently checks if value is NaN
               if self.nan_index_ is None:
                   raise ValueError("Encountered NaN during transform, but NaN was not seen during fitting.")
               encoded.append(self.nan_index_)
           elif val in self.class_to_index_:
               encoded.append(self.class_to_index_[val])
           else:
               raise ValueError(f"Encountered unseen label during transform: {val}")
        return torch.tensor(encoded, dtype=torch.long)

    def inverse_transform(self, y_encoded):
        y_encoded = y_encoded.detach().cpu().numpy() #Detach before numpy transformation
        decoded = []
        for index in y_encoded:
            if index == self.nan_index_:
                decoded.append(np.nan)
            elif index < len(self.classes_):
                decoded.append(self.classes_[index])
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Encountered invalid index during inverse transform: {index}")
        return np.array(decoded)
```

*Code Example 1: NaNLabelEncoder Implementation:*

This example presents the complete class definition. The `fit` method determines unique categories, assigns them indices, and handles `NaN`. The `transform` method converts input data into encoded PyTorch tensors. `inverse_transform` maps encoded integers back to their original categorical or `NaN` values. The code relies on `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient manipulation of lists and checking for nan values and includes error handling for cases where unseen labels are encountered during encoding or decoding.

Let’s illustrate its usage with a practical scenario:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create data with missing categories as NaN
data = ['cat', 'dog', np.nan, 'dog', 'bird', 'cat', np.nan]

encoder = NaNLabelEncoder()
encoder.fit(data)

encoded_data = encoder.transform(data)
print("Encoded data: ", encoded_data)

decoded_data = encoder.inverse_transform(encoded_data)
print("Decoded data: ", decoded_data)
```

*Code Example 2: Encoding and Decoding Example:*

Here, a list `data` containing string categories and `np.nan` is used. First, a `NaNLabelEncoder` is instantiated and fitted to the data, learning the categories and the index associated with `NaN`. The original data is then transformed into a PyTorch tensor of encoded integers. Subsequently, the `inverse_transform` function recovers the original categorical data, including the `NaN` values, demonstrating that the roundtrip encoding and decoding process works correctly.

It's also essential to verify that the encoder handles cases where `NaN` is absent during the fitting phase:

```python
data_no_nan = ['cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'bird', 'cat']

encoder_no_nan = NaNLabelEncoder()
encoder_no_nan.fit(data_no_nan)

encoded_no_nan = encoder_no_nan.transform(data_no_nan)
print("Encoded data (no NaN): ", encoded_no_nan)

decoded_no_nan = encoder_no_nan.inverse_transform(encoded_no_nan)
print("Decoded data (no NaN): ", decoded_no_nan)

# Attempting to transform with NaN without fit:

try:
    encoder_no_nan.transform(data) #Error should be raised here
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error raised: {e}")

```

*Code Example 3: Testing Absence of NaN During Fit and Error Handling:*

This example demonstrates that if a NaN value is not seen during the fitting phase of the encoder, an error is raised during subsequent transformation if nan values are encountered.  This is useful to ensure that the encoder is being used as expected and is correctly prepared for data with null values. It also showcases correct behavior when the input data does not contain `NaN` values.  This illustrates an important error case where the encoder was not trained to handle NaN values.

For further understanding of how to deal with categorical variables and more advanced encoding techniques, I recommend studying documentation on feature engineering, particularly for natural language processing, where managing variable length sequences and categories is commonplace, as well as related literature on tabular data preprocessing. Look for publications that use the terms "categorical encoding," "feature mapping," and "missing data imputation." Resources specializing in PyTorch documentation for data handling can also be very beneficial, as they often explain tensor operations on encoded data. While pandas offers great tools for data handling, familiarize yourself with operations using PyTorch tensors once data is encoded. Exploring libraries dedicated to tabular data processing and model training, beyond base pytorch, can also reveal alternative implementations and best practices.
