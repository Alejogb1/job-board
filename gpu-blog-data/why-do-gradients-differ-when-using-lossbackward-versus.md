The discrepancy observed between gradients computed using `loss.backward()` and `torch.autograd.grad` stems fundamentally from their differing handling of computational graphs and accumulation of gradients.  `loss.backward()` leverages the dynamically constructed computational graph inherent to PyTorch's autograd engine, performing an efficient backward pass optimized for a single loss function.  In contrast, `torch.autograd.grad` provides a more granular approach, allowing for explicit specification of inputs and outputs, bypassing the automatic graph construction and thus potentially leading to different results under certain circumstances. This difference becomes particularly relevant when dealing with shared parameters, multiple loss functions, or complex computational flows.

My experience working on large-scale neural network training pipelines for medical image analysis, specifically in the domain of multi-modal segmentation, consistently highlighted this distinction.  Initially, relying solely on `loss.backward()` for gradient checking proved sufficient for simpler models. However, as model complexity increased, incorporating auxiliary losses and employing intricate regularization techniques necessitated a deeper understanding of `torch.autograd.grad` to ensure accurate gradient computations and avoid subtle numerical instabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The PyTorch autograd system operates by constructing a computational graph that tracks operations performed on tensors. When a tensor requires gradients (`requires_grad=True`), the graph records all operations involved in its computation.  `loss.backward()` traverses this graph in reverse, calculating gradients of the loss function with respect to all leaf nodes (tensors with `requires_grad=True`).  Crucially, it *accumulates* gradients; subsequent calls to `loss.backward()` add gradients to the existing ones.  This accumulation behavior is often convenient, especially during training loops with multiple batches or loss components.

`torch.autograd.grad`, on the other hand, computes gradients for a specific set of outputs with respect to a specific set of inputs.  It doesn't rely on the dynamically constructed graph; instead, it directly performs automatic differentiation based on the provided inputs and outputs. Consequently, it does not accumulate gradients; each call produces a fresh gradient computation.  This allows for more precise control over the gradient calculation process, enabling techniques like calculating individual gradients for different parts of the loss function independently.

The key difference lies in how they manage the computational graph and gradient accumulation.  `loss.backward()` implicitly manages the graph and accumulates gradients, while `torch.autograd.grad` provides explicit control over the computation, preventing gradient accumulation.  This difference manifests when dealing with shared parameters or when calculations involve multiple loss functions.  If a parameter is modified through different branches of the computational graph, `loss.backward()` will correctly accumulate the gradients from all branches. `torch.autograd.grad`, however, may only compute gradients for a specific subset of the calculations, potentially leading to different results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accumulated Gradients with `loss.backward()`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)

loss1 = torch.sum(x * w)
loss1.backward()

print("Gradients after first backward pass:", w.grad)

loss2 = torch.sum(x**2)
loss2.backward()

print("Gradients after second backward pass:", w.grad)
```

This example demonstrates the gradient accumulation property of `loss.backward()`.  The gradients are summed across both `loss1` and `loss2` because subsequent calls add to the existing `w.grad`.  Note the absence of `w.grad.zero_()` which is necessary to clear gradients before subsequent calls to `loss.backward()` if accumulation is not desired.

**Example 2: Independent Gradients with `torch.autograd.grad`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)

loss1 = torch.sum(x * w)
grad1 = torch.autograd.grad(loss1, w, create_graph=True)[0]

print("Gradients of loss1:", grad1)

loss2 = torch.sum(x**2)
grad2 = torch.autograd.grad(loss2, w, create_graph=True)[0]

print("Gradients of loss2:", grad2)

print("Note: grad1 and grad2 are independent.")
```

This example shows that `torch.autograd.grad` computes gradients independently for each call.  The gradients are not accumulated; each call calculates the gradient with respect to the specific loss. The `create_graph=True` argument is crucial when higher-order derivatives are needed.


**Example 3: Shared Parameter Scenario**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = x + w  # Shared Parameter, w

loss1 = torch.sum(y**2)
loss2 = torch.sum(w**2)


# Using loss.backward()
loss1.backward()
loss2.backward()
print("Gradients using loss.backward():", w.grad)

# Resetting gradients
w.grad.zero_()

# Using torch.autograd.grad
grad1 = torch.autograd.grad(loss1, w, create_graph=True)[0]
grad2 = torch.autograd.grad(loss2, w, create_graph=True)[0]

print("Gradients using torch.autograd.grad:", grad1 + grad2)

```
Here, the shared parameter `w` demonstrates the fundamental difference.  `loss.backward()` correctly accumulates gradients from both loss functions.  `torch.autograd.grad` requires explicit summation to achieve the same result, highlighting its non-accumulation nature. Note the need to reset gradients for the `loss.backward()` case to ensure we accurately see the total accumulated gradients.
