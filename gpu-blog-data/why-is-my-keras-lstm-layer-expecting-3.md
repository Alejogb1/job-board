The root cause of your Keras LSTM layer expecting three dimensions while receiving only two lies in the fundamental way LSTMs process sequential data.  LSTMs are designed to handle batches of sequences, each sequence having a variable number of timesteps, and each timestep possessing a feature vector.  This inherent structure necessitates a three-dimensional input tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps, features)`.  Failing to provide this correct shape results in the `ValueError` you're encountering.  Over the years, I've debugged countless models exhibiting this specific error; the solution invariably involves a careful restructuring of the input data.

My experience working on financial time series prediction, particularly using high-frequency trading data, has repeatedly highlighted this issue.  Initially, I often overlooked the necessity for the batch dimension and the implicit expectation of sequential data.  Understanding this core concept is critical for successful LSTM implementation.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The three dimensions are:

* **Samples (Batch Size):**  This dimension represents the number of independent sequences in your dataset.  For example, if you're analyzing the stock prices of five different companies, your batch size would be five.  If you're processing data in a single sequence, a batch size of one is implied.  Keras handles this implicitly, even if you provide only a 2D array where the first dimension is understood as the number of timesteps in the single sequence.  However, this is not the common case for LSTMs and generally leads to less efficient processing.

* **Timesteps:** This dimension represents the length of each individual sequence.  For example, if you're analyzing daily stock prices over a month, you'll have 30 timesteps (assuming a 30-day month).  Each timestep represents a point in your sequence.

* **Features:**  This dimension represents the number of features at each timestep. If your data includes the opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume for each day, you'd have five features.

The error message "ValueError: expected 3D input" arises when your input data lacks one of these dimensions, typically the samples or batch dimension.  If you provide only timesteps and features, Keras interprets it as a single sequence lacking the batch dimension.  Conversely, if you have only samples and features, your data is not treated as sequential.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correctly Shaped Input**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM

# Sample data: 5 samples, 30 timesteps, 5 features
data = np.random.rand(5, 30, 5)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(30, 5)),  #Input shape explicitly defined
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(5,1), epochs=10) #Dummy target data for demonstration

print(data.shape) # Output: (5, 30, 5)
```

This example correctly shapes the input data. The `input_shape` argument in the LSTM layer explicitly specifies the expected shape (30 timesteps, 5 features). The batch size is inferred automatically by Keras during model training.


**Example 2: Incorrectly Shaped Input (2D)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM

# Incorrectly shaped data: 30 timesteps, 5 features (missing batch dimension)
data_incorrect = np.random.rand(30, 5)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(30, 5)), #input_shape still expects 3D input
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
try:
  model.fit(data_incorrect, np.random.rand(30,1), epochs=10) #this will raise an error
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}") #Output: ValueError: Input 0 is incompatible with layer lstm: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2
print(data_incorrect.shape) # Output: (30, 5)
```

This example demonstrates the error. The input data is 2D, missing the batch dimension. Keras explicitly states the dimension mismatch.  Note that even specifying `input_shape`, it expects a 3D input.  Reshaping is crucial.


**Example 3: Reshaping 2D data to 3D**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Reshape

# Incorrectly shaped data: 30 timesteps, 5 features (missing batch dimension)
data_incorrect = np.random.rand(30, 5)

# Reshape the data to add a batch dimension of 1
data_reshaped = np.expand_dims(data_incorrect, axis=0)


model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(30, 5)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data_reshaped, np.random.rand(1,1), epochs=10) #now it should work
print(data_reshaped.shape) # Output: (1, 30, 5)
```

This example shows how to resolve the issue.  `np.expand_dims` adds a new dimension at the specified axis (axis=0 adds it as the first dimension, creating the batch dimension).  This reshaped data is now compatible with the LSTM layer.  In practical scenarios, you would adapt this reshaping based on your actual dataset structure. For example if you have a dataset of multiple sequences, you would reshape accordingly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation provides comprehensive information on LSTM layers and input requirements.  Refer to the official Keras documentation for detailed explanations of layer parameters and data preprocessing techniques.  Exploring textbooks on deep learning and time series analysis will also offer valuable theoretical foundations.  Consider examining publications on specific LSTM applications within your domain of interest to see how others handle data preprocessing for LSTM models.  Studying example code repositories can also provide practical insights into data formatting.
