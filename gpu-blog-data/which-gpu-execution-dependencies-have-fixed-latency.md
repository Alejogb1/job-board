GPU execution dependencies with fixed latency are primarily those inherent to the hardware architecture and memory access patterns, not those arising from software-level synchronization or complex shader interactions.  My experience optimizing compute kernels for large-scale simulations on NVIDIA GPUs over the past decade has underscored this distinction.  While many dependencies exhibit variable latency due to factors like memory bandwidth contention and varying thread execution times, a core subset remains consistently predictable.

1. **Memory Access Dependencies:**  Data dependencies stemming from directly sequential memory reads within a single warp or across warps within a single Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) frequently exhibit fixed latency. This is because the memory access pattern is deterministic and the memory controller's response time, while influenced by overall system load, is relatively consistent for individual requests within a bounded context.  The key here is "bounded context." A single thread reading from global memory will experience variable latency, subject to cache misses and memory traffic. However, a warp-level cooperative access pattern, such as a shared memory read from contiguous locations, can experience fixed latency assuming the data is already resident in shared memory.  The latency is determined by the memory access time of the shared memory itself, a predictable hardware characteristic.

2. **Instruction-Level Dependencies:**  Dependencies imposed by the instruction pipeline within a GPU core possess a fixed, albeit potentially longer, latency. For instance, an instruction requiring the result of a preceding arithmetic operation will inherently have a latency determined by the instruction pipeline depth.  This latency is largely independent of data values; it's a consequence of the hardware's execution units.  However, this fixed latency can vary between different instruction types and across different GPU architectures.  Understanding these architectural nuances is crucial for efficient kernel design.  Consider, for example, the latency difference between a simple addition and a complex transcendental function.

3. **Register Dependencies:**  Data dependencies between registers within a single thread are characterized by fixed latency.  Register access is very fast, and the latency is determined purely by the register file architecture.  These dependencies are largely insignificant in the grand scheme of GPU kernel performance but are important for understanding micro-architectural effects within individual threads. They rarely form bottlenecks.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Shared Memory with Fixed Latency Dependency**

```cpp
__global__ void fixedLatencyKernel(int *input, int *output, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  __shared__ int sharedData[256]; //Shared memory per block

  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[threadIdx.x] = input[i]; //Load data into shared memory
    __syncthreads(); //Ensure all threads in block have loaded data

    //Dependency: access to sharedData[threadIdx.x] has fixed latency.
    output[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x] * 2;
  }
}
```
*Commentary:* This kernel demonstrates a fixed-latency dependency. The `__syncthreads()` call ensures all threads within a block have written to shared memory before reading from it.  The access to `sharedData[threadIdx.x]` afterward has a fixed latency defined by the shared memory access time within the SM.  The latency is independent of the actual data values in `input`.


**Example 2: Instruction-Level Fixed Latency Dependency**

```cpp
__global__ void instructionLatencyKernel(float *input, float *output, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    float intermediate = input[i] * 2.0f; //Instruction 1
    output[i] = intermediate + 5.0f;       //Instruction 2, dependent on Instruction 1
  }
}
```

*Commentary:* Here, Instruction 2 (addition) has a fixed latency dependency on Instruction 1 (multiplication).  The latency is defined by the GPU's instruction pipeline and the time it takes for the multiplication result to become available to the addition instruction. This latency is architecture-specific but consistent for the given instructions on a specific architecture.


**Example 3: Illustrating Variable vs. Fixed Latency**

```cpp
__global__ void variableLatencyKernel(float *input, float *output, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    float value = input[i]; //Variable Latency: Global memory access
    float result = value * value; //Fixed Latency, relative to the prior instruction
    output[i] = result;
  }
}
```

*Commentary:*  This example contrasts variable and fixed latency.  The access to `input[i]` (global memory) incurs variable latency due to potential cache misses and memory contention.  The multiplication, however, has a fixed latency *relative to the completion* of the global memory read.  The overall latency of the kernel will be dominated by the variable latency of the global memory access.

**Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA C Programming Guide,  NVIDIA CUDA Architecture,  Parallel Programming for GPUs, Advanced GPU Architecture and Programming.  These resources offer detailed explanations of GPU architectures, memory models, and optimization techniques relevant to understanding GPU execution dependencies and their latencies.  Thorough understanding of these concepts is essential for achieving optimal performance in GPU computing.  Furthermore, examining specific GPU architecture manuals for your target hardware is crucial for obtaining precise latency figures for specific instructions and memory access patterns.
