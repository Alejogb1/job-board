The core challenge in training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for single-value regression from multiple image inputs lies in effectively aggregating the learned features from each image before the final regression layer.  Simple averaging or concatenation often proves insufficient, particularly when the images exhibit varying levels of relevance to the target value.  My experience working on similar problems in medical image analysis, specifically predicting patient survival rates from a series of MRI scans, highlighted the importance of sophisticated feature aggregation strategies.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The typical CNN architecture for image classification involves a convolutional base followed by fully connected layers that culminate in a softmax layer for probability distribution over classes. For regression, we replace the softmax layer with a single neuron with a linear activation function.  However, when dealing with multiple images, we need a mechanism to combine the feature representations extracted from each image before feeding them to this final regression layer.  This necessitates careful consideration of both the convolutional base and the aggregation method.

The convolutional base should be designed to extract relevant features from the input images.  The specifics of the architecture (number of layers, filter sizes, etc.) depend heavily on the nature of the images and the desired level of feature abstraction.  Pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, Inception) can provide a strong starting point, often requiring only fine-tuning on the target dataset.  Transfer learning is particularly beneficial when the dataset is limited.

Once the convolutional base extracts features from each image, the crucial step is aggregating these features.  Simple concatenation can lead to high dimensionality and overfitting if not carefully managed. Averaging, while computationally efficient, might disregard potentially important variations between images. More effective approaches involve using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially LSTMs, to process the sequence of image features, or employing attention mechanisms to weigh the contribution of each image based on its relevance to the target value.

The final layer is a single neuron with a linear activation function. The output of this neuron represents the predicted single value. The loss function should be chosen appropriately; Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common choice for regression tasks.  However, depending on the distribution of the target variable, other loss functions like Huber loss (less sensitive to outliers) might be more suitable.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Averaging**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense

# Assume img_shape is the shape of a single image (e.g., (224, 224, 3))
# num_images is the number of images per input sample

def create_model(img_shape, num_images):
    base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=img_shape)
    base_model.trainable = False # Fine-tuning can be added later

    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(num_images,) + img_shape)
    processed_images = []
    for i in range(num_images):
        x = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:, i])(inputs)
        x = base_model(x)
        x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
        processed_images.append(x)

    x = tf.keras.layers.Average()(processed_images) # Average the features
    x = Dense(1, activation='linear')(x)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Example usage:
model = create_model((224, 224, 3), 3) # 3 images as input
model.summary()
```

This example uses pre-trained ResNet50 to extract features. It then averages the Global Average Pooled features from each image.  This is a basic approach and might not capture complex interdependencies between images.  The `Lambda` layer selects each image from the input tensor.

**Example 2:  LSTM Aggregation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, TimeDistributed, GlobalAveragePooling2D

def create_lstm_model(img_shape, num_images):
  base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=img_shape)
  base_model.trainable = False

  inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(num_images,) + img_shape)
  x = TimeDistributed(base_model)(inputs)
  x = TimeDistributed(GlobalAveragePooling2D())(x)
  x = LSTM(64)(x) # LSTM to process the sequence of image features
  x = Dense(1, activation='linear')(x)
  model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  return model

# Example usage:
model = create_lstm_model((224, 224, 3), 5)
model.summary()
```

This model utilizes an LSTM to capture temporal dependencies (or sequential relationships) between the image features.  `TimeDistributed` applies the base model and pooling to each image in the sequence.  The LSTM processes the resulting sequence of feature vectors. This is more sophisticated than simple averaging but computationally more intensive.


**Example 3: Attention Mechanism**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense, Reshape, Multiply, Permute, Softmax

def create_attention_model(img_shape, num_images):
    base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=img_shape)
    base_model.trainable = False

    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(num_images,) + img_shape)
    x = TimeDistributed(base_model)(inputs)
    x = TimeDistributed(GlobalAveragePooling2D())(x)
    x = Reshape((num_images, -1))(x) # Reshape for attention mechanism

    # Attention mechanism
    attention = Dense(num_images, activation='softmax')(x)
    attention = Permute((2, 1))(attention) # Adjust dimensions for multiplication
    weighted_features = Multiply()([x, attention])
    weighted_features = tf.reduce_sum(weighted_features, axis=1)

    x = Dense(1, activation='linear')(weighted_features)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Example usage:
model = create_attention_model((224, 224, 3), 4)
model.summary()
```

This example incorporates an attention mechanism.  The attention layer learns weights for each image, emphasizing the more relevant images.  This allows the model to selectively focus on the most informative images when making its prediction.  The `Permute` layer rearranges dimensions for element-wise multiplication.

Remember to carefully preprocess your image data (normalization, resizing) and use appropriate data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.  Experimentation with different architectures, aggregation methods, and hyperparameters is crucial for optimal performance.  Regularization techniques, like dropout and weight decay, should also be considered to prevent overfitting, especially with large models and limited data.
