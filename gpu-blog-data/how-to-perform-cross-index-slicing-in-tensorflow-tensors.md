Cross-index slicing in TensorFlow tensors, specifically selecting elements based on coordinates defined in separate index tensors, is a frequent requirement in advanced data manipulation tasks, such as gathering embeddings or creating sparse matrices. This operation deviates from standard single-dimension slicing and demands a more nuanced approach.  I've encountered this challenge numerous times while building custom layers for sequence modeling and graph convolutional networks, highlighting its practical significance.

The core concept involves treating the index tensors as coordinate pairs (or triplets, etc., depending on tensor dimensionality). These coordinates point to specific locations within the target tensor that you want to extract.  TensorFlow provides the `tf.gather_nd` operation to accomplish this, efficiently handling the complex logic of extracting elements based on these multi-dimensional index sets. The key distinction from `tf.gather` is that `tf.gather` operates on a single dimension, while `tf.gather_nd` allows for addressing elements with arbitrary-dimensional index tuples.

To clarify, consider a two-dimensional tensor, essentially a matrix.  With a standard slice, such as `tensor[1:3, :]`, you're selecting rows 1 and 2 across all columns. Cross-index slicing allows for selecting elements at seemingly scattered, arbitrary row and column combinations. For example, you might want to extract the elements at locations (0, 1), (2, 3), and (1, 0). These coordinates (0,1), (2,3), (1,0) would form the index tensor used with `tf.gather_nd`. The output would be another tensor containing only the values present at these specific indices from original target tensor.

Let's explore how this works through examples.

**Example 1: Basic 2D Tensor Extraction**

Suppose I have a 2D tensor (a matrix) representing a feature map and a tensor containing row and column indices for specific features I need.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a 2D tensor
target_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                            [5, 6, 7, 8],
                            [9, 10, 11, 12],
                            [13, 14, 15, 16]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Define indices. Each row is a (row, col) coordinate.
indices = tf.constant([[0, 1],  #  Extract element at row 0, col 1 (value 2)
                      [2, 2],  # Extract element at row 2, col 2 (value 11)
                      [3, 0]], dtype=tf.int32) # Extract element at row 3, col 0 (value 13)


# Use tf.gather_nd to perform the cross-index slicing.
extracted_elements = tf.gather_nd(target_tensor, indices)

print("Original Tensor:\n", target_tensor.numpy())
print("\nIndices:\n", indices.numpy())
print("\nExtracted Elements:", extracted_elements.numpy())
# Output: Extracted Elements: [ 2 11 13]
```

In this code, `target_tensor` is our matrix. The `indices` tensor specifies which elements to extract by providing their (row, column) coordinates. Each row in indices corresponds to a single coordinate, and `tf.gather_nd` fetches the value located at these coordinates in the `target_tensor`. The result is a 1D tensor `extracted_elements` containing the values 2, 11, and 13, the corresponding values in `target_tensor` pointed to by `indices`.

**Example 2: Higher-Dimensional Tensor Extraction**

The principle extends beyond 2D tensors. Let's consider a 3D tensor, perhaps a series of matrices over time, and perform cross-index slicing. This example shows a more complex scenario, resembling how I've had to extract specific locations from time-series data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a 3D tensor (batch size 2, 3x4 matrices)
target_tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1,  2,  3,  4],
                                 [5,  6,  7,  8],
                                 [9, 10, 11, 12]],

                                [[13, 14, 15, 16],
                                 [17, 18, 19, 20],
                                 [21, 22, 23, 24]]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Indices (batch, row, col). Note each of the coordinates have three dimensions.
indices_3d = tf.constant([[0, 1, 2], # Extracts from batch 0, row 1, col 2 -> value 7
                         [1, 2, 0], # Extracts from batch 1, row 2, col 0 -> value 21
                         [0, 0, 0]], dtype=tf.int32) # Extracts from batch 0, row 0, col 0 -> value 1


# Extract elements using tf.gather_nd.
extracted_elements_3d = tf.gather_nd(target_tensor_3d, indices_3d)


print("Original 3D Tensor:\n", target_tensor_3d.numpy())
print("\nIndices:\n", indices_3d.numpy())
print("\nExtracted Elements:\n", extracted_elements_3d.numpy())

# Output: Extracted Elements: [ 7 21  1]
```

Here, the `target_tensor_3d` is a 3D tensor. The `indices_3d` tensor now has three values per index: batch, row, and column. Each row of `indices_3d` indicates which value in the 3D target tensor to extract.  `tf.gather_nd` interprets these triplets and retrieves the corresponding values from the 3D tensor.

**Example 3: Dynamic Index Creation**

In practical applications, I've rarely encountered a situation where the index tensors were static like this. More often, they are the result of calculations or other preprocessing steps. This example shows how the indices can be generated dynamically, making the entire process more versatile. This could be useful if your indices depend on some property of the source data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[10, 20, 30],
                           [40, 50, 60],
                           [70, 80, 90]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Example condition. I want to extract elements where both row and column indices are the same.
row_indices = tf.range(tf.shape(input_tensor)[0])
col_indices = tf.range(tf.shape(input_tensor)[1])

# Filter to get coordinates to extract.
indices = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices], axis=1)

# Convert to coordinate indices
same_indices = tf.boolean_mask(indices, tf.equal(indices[:,0],indices[:,1]))


extracted_values = tf.gather_nd(input_tensor, same_indices)

print("Original Tensor:\n", input_tensor.numpy())
print("\nComputed Indices: \n", same_indices.numpy())
print("\nExtracted Values:\n", extracted_values.numpy())
# Output: Extracted Values: [10 50 90]
```

In this example, we are dynamically creating indices. Here, I created a mask to pick out values where the row index equals the column index from the original matrix, and `tf.gather_nd` extracts those values. This shows the power of dynamically creating these indices for complex slicing operations. I've used similar dynamic approaches to extract data from embeddings based on user session history.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend focusing on these TensorFlow areas. The official TensorFlow documentation provides in-depth descriptions of core functionalities. Explore `tf.gather_nd` in the API documentation. Pay close attention to the data type requirements and shape rules of the input tensors, particularly the index tensors, as errors in shape are common. Examining the documentation for `tf.stack` and `tf.range` will assist with more complex index generation. Understanding `tf.boolean_mask` will help with creating masks to filter indices based on conditional logic. Finally, working through tutorials that address sparse tensor manipulation and embedding lookups is beneficial to see how cross-index slicing is frequently applied. These areas of focus will deepen your understanding of how to apply cross-index slicing effectively.
