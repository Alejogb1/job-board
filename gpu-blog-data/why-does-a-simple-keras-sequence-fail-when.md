The underlying issue with a Keras `Sequence` failing on a simple array often stems from a misunderstanding of its intended purpose and the inherent expectation of data *generation*, not direct data feeding.  A `Sequence` isn't a direct replacement for `numpy.array` in model training; it's designed for handling datasets too large to fit in memory, requiring on-the-fly data preparation and batching.  Attempting to use it with a readily available array bypasses this core functionality and consequently leads to unexpected behaviors or errors.  In my experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects—including a large-scale image classification task involving terabytes of data and a smaller-scale time-series analysis—the root cause usually boils down to improper data structuring or overlooking the `__len__` and `__getitem__` method implementations within the custom `Sequence` class.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras `Sequence` classes are subclasses of `keras.utils.Sequence`.  They offer a way to stream data during model training, which is crucial when dealing with datasets exceeding available RAM.  They achieve this by implementing two essential methods:

* `__len__(self)`:  Returns the number of batches in the dataset.  This is vital for Keras to determine the number of steps per epoch.  Incorrect implementation leads to unexpected epoch lengths or training termination.
* `__getitem__(self, index)`:  Returns a batch of data (X, y) at index `index`. This is where the actual data preparation and batch slicing happens.  Errors here directly affect the data fed to the model, resulting in incorrect training or runtime exceptions.

When attempting to use a `Sequence` with a simple array, the problem arises because the `Sequence` is still expecting to generate data batches.  It doesn't inherently understand how to directly handle the pre-existing array.  The array needs to be treated as the *source* from which batches are generated, not as the batches themselves.  If the `__getitem__` method tries to access array elements beyond its bounds or fails to return properly formatted batches (e.g., incorrect shape), Keras will encounter an error.  Furthermore, an incorrectly implemented `__len__` method will lead to inconsistencies between the expected and actual number of batches, resulting in premature termination or infinite loops during training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation Leading to IndexError**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class SimpleArraySequence(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, data, batch_size):
        self.data = data
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)  # Incorrect: Should be number of batches

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx*self.batch_size:(idx+1)*self.batch_size]

data = np.arange(100)
seq = SimpleArraySequence(data, 10)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile('adam', 'mse')

# This will raise an IndexError after a few batches.
model.fit(seq, epochs=10)
```

This code fails because `__len__` returns the number of samples, not the number of batches.  The `__getitem__` method then attempts to access indices beyond the array bounds.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation for a Simple Array**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class CorrectArraySequence(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, data, batch_size):
        self.data = data
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.num_samples = len(data)

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(self.num_samples / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        start = idx * self.batch_size
        end = min((idx + 1) * self.batch_size, self.num_samples)
        return self.data[start:end]

data = np.arange(100).reshape(100,1) #Reshaped for a single feature
labels = np.random.randint(0,2,100) # adding some labels
seq = CorrectArraySequence(data, 10)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'), keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile('adam', 'binary_crossentropy')

model.fit(seq, labels, epochs=10)
```

This corrected version calculates the correct number of batches in `__len__` and handles potential incomplete batches at the end of the array in `__getitem__`.  Crucially, note the addition of labels to enable proper model training.


**Example 3:  Handling Multi-Dimensional Data**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class MultiDimensionalSequence(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, data, labels, batch_size):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.num_samples = len(data)

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(self.num_samples / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        start = idx * self.batch_size
        end = min((idx + 1) * self.batch_size, self.num_samples)
        return self.data[start:end], self.labels[start:end]

data = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 1)  # Example image data
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)  # Example labels
seq = MultiDimensionalSequence(data, labels, 10)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
                          keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
                          keras.layers.Flatten(),
                          keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile('adam', 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(seq, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates how to correctly handle multi-dimensional data, such as images, within a `Sequence`.  It highlights the importance of returning both the features (`self.data`) and labels (`self.labels`) in the `__getitem__` method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation on custom data loaders (specifically `keras.utils.Sequence`) should be consulted.  Furthermore, review materials on Python's `__len__` and `__getitem__` dunder methods for a deeper understanding of their application in class definitions.  Finally, exploring tutorials on NumPy array manipulation and reshaping techniques is beneficial for efficient data pre-processing within the `__getitem__` method.
