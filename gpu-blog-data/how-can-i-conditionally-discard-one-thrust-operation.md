The crux of conditionally discarding a Thrust operation to facilitate fusion lies in understanding Thrust's execution model and leveraging its ability to conditionally execute kernels based on predicate functions.  Naively attempting to simply skip a kernel call will likely fail to achieve the desired fusion, as Thrust's internal optimization passes rely on a predictable sequence of operations.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations using Thrust taught me the importance of manipulating data flow rather than bypassing individual operations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Thrust's strength stems from its ability to fuse multiple operations into a single kernel launch. This significantly reduces kernel launch overhead, a major bottleneck in GPU computing.  However, conditional discarding of an operation disrupts this potential fusion. Instead of trying to selectively skip a Thrust operation, the optimal strategy is to modify the input data such that the operation becomes effectively a no-op for certain elements, while maintaining the continuous data flow required for kernel fusion.  This requires careful consideration of the specific operation and its relation to subsequent operations in the pipeline.

We achieve this by employing a boolean mask. This mask, representing the condition under which the operation should be executed, is used to conditionally modify the input data.  For operations like `transform`, `reduce_by_key`, or `sort_by_key`, we can construct a mask that either leaves the data unchanged (effectively bypassing the operation for those elements) or modifies it in a way that preserves the integrity of the subsequent operations.  The key is that the conditionally modified data still allows for a coherent downstream processing.

Crucially, this approach differs from branching within the kernel itself.  Conditional branching inside a kernel often hinders fusion due to increased divergence.  By pre-processing the data using a mask, we maintain data parallelism and allow Thrust's optimizer to efficiently fuse operations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Conditional Addition using `transform`**

Let's say we have two vectors, `x` and `y`, and a boolean vector `mask`. We want to add `y` to `x` only where `mask` is true.

```c++
#include <thrust/transform.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/logical.h>

struct conditional_add {
  template <typename T>
  __host__ __device__
  T operator()(const T& x, const T& y, const bool& mask) const {
    return mask ? x + y : x;
  }
};

int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<int> x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  thrust::device_vector<int> y = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
  thrust::device_vector<bool> mask = {true, false, true, false, true};

  thrust::transform(thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(x.begin(), y.begin(), mask.begin())),
                    thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(x.end(), y.end(), mask.end())),
                    x.begin(),
                    conditional_add());

  // x will now be {11, 2, 33, 4, 55}
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `conditional_add` performs the addition only when the mask is true.  This operation, although conditionally executed on the data level, maintains a continuous data flow that Thrust can effectively fuse with subsequent operations.  Note the use of `make_zip_iterator` to efficiently process data in parallel.


**Example 2: Conditional `reduce_by_key`**

Consider reducing a key-value pair only when a condition is met.

```c++
#include <thrust/reduce_by_key.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/functional.h>

int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<int> keys = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3};
  thrust::device_vector<int> values = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
  thrust::device_vector<bool> mask = {true, false, true, false, true, false};

  // Create a new vector to hold the masked values
  thrust::device_vector<int> masked_values = values;
  thrust::transform(thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(values.begin(), mask.begin())),
                    thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(values.end(), mask.end())),
                    masked_values.begin(),
                    thrust::if_else<thrust::placeholders::_2>(thrust::placeholders::_1, 0)); //Values become zero where the mask is false


  thrust::device_vector<int> result_keys;
  thrust::device_vector<int> result_values;
  thrust::reduce_by_key(keys.begin(), keys.end(), masked_values.begin(), result_keys.begin(), result_values.begin(), thrust::equal_to<int>());

  // Result will reflect only the reductions where the mask was true.
  return 0;
}
```

Here, values are set to zero where the mask is false, preserving the structure and allowing `reduce_by_key` to function correctly, effectively bypassing the reduction for those elements without explicit branching inside the reduction kernel.


**Example 3: Conditional Sorting with `sort_by_key`**

Suppose we need to sort only a subset of data defined by a mask.

```c++
#include <thrust/sort.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/functional.h>

int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<int> keys = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6};
  thrust::device_vector<int> values = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
  thrust::device_vector<bool> mask = {false, true, true, false, true, false};

  // Create a sorted index vector to sort only the relevant values.
  thrust::device_vector<int> sorted_indices(keys.size());
  thrust::sequence(sorted_indices.begin(), sorted_indices.end());

  thrust::stable_sort_by_key(thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(keys.begin(), values.begin(),sorted_indices.begin())),
                             thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(keys.end(), values.end(),sorted_indices.end())),
                             sorted_indices.begin(),
                             thrust::make_transform_iterator(mask.begin(), thrust::placeholders::_1));


  // Extract the sorted elements using the sorted indices.
  // ... subsequent operations will use the sorted elements.
  return 0;
}
```
This example uses a stable sort to preserve the order of elements not included in the sort.  By filtering the sort based on the mask we selectively engage the sort function only for the relevant data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Thrust documentation is invaluable.   "Programming Massively Parallel Processors" by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu provides a strong foundation in GPU programming concepts.  Familiarize yourself with the CUDA programming model, particularly concerning memory management and kernel optimization techniques.  Finally, understanding the intricacies of parallel algorithms and their efficient implementation is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of Thrust.  Thorough testing and profiling are essential steps in validating fusion optimizations.
