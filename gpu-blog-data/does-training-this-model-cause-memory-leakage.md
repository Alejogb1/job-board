The question of memory leakage during model training hinges critically on the interaction between the model's architecture, the training data's size, and the chosen framework's memory management capabilities.  In my experience working on large-scale natural language processing projects,  I've observed that memory leaks are less a fundamental property of the training process itself and more a consequence of poor resource management within the implementation.  Addressing the issue effectively requires a systematic approach rather than a blanket statement about inherent leakage.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Memory leakage in the context of model training refers to the gradual accumulation of unreferenced memory allocated during the training process. This isn't a sudden crash, but a slow, insidious drain that eventually leads to performance degradation, slowdown, and potentially application crashes. The root causes are multifaceted.  One common issue arises from improper handling of intermediate tensors or variables.  Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch employ automatic differentiation, generating a computational graph that, if not carefully managed, can retain references to objects long after they're needed.  Another critical aspect is the management of datasets.  Loading an excessively large dataset into memory without employing efficient batching or data generators can easily overwhelm available resources. Finally, poorly written custom layers or loss functions can introduce memory leaks through unintentional persistent references.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Data Loading**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# Inefficient: Loads the entire dataset into memory at once
dataset = np.random.rand(1000000, 1000)  # Simulates a large dataset
dataset_tensor = torch.tensor(dataset, dtype=torch.float32)

# ... training loop ...

# Memory leak: dataset_tensor remains in memory even after training
```

Commentary: This example demonstrates a blatant memory leak.  Loading the entire dataset (a million samples with a thousand features each) directly into a tensor is a recipe for disaster. The `dataset_tensor` consumes substantial memory, and even after the training loop completes, it remains allocated unless explicitly deleted using `del dataset_tensor` or garbage collection (which is not guaranteed to happen immediately).  The correct approach involves using data loaders, which provide efficient batch processing, minimizing the memory footprint at any given time.


**Example 2: Unmanaged Intermediate Variables**

```python
import torch

# ... within a training loop ...

for epoch in range(100):
    for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(dataloader):
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        intermediate_result = torch.matmul(outputs, outputs.T) #Potential leak
        #... other computations ...


```

Commentary:  While this example might seem innocuous, `intermediate_result` is a potential source of memory leaks. If not carefully managed within the scope of the loop (e.g. deleting it explicitly or ensuring that it’s not referenced elsewhere), it could accumulate over the epochs and lead to a gradual memory increase.  This is particularly relevant for computationally intensive operations. In practice, large intermediate results are often not required after the backward pass is complete.  A good practice is to explicitly delete them, using `del intermediate_result`.


**Example 3:  Poorly Designed Custom Layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LeakyLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.buffer_tensor = torch.rand(1000,1000) #Persistent buffer


    def forward(self, x):
        result = x + self.buffer_tensor
        return result


# Usage within a model
model = nn.Sequential(LeakyLayer(), nn.Linear(1000,10))

```

Commentary:  This custom layer demonstrates a common pitfall. The `buffer_tensor` is allocated during the layer’s initialization and persists throughout the training process. Unless explicitly designed to be dynamic and cleared under specific conditions (such as at the end of an epoch), this will lead to an increase in consumed memory proportional to the number of layers of this type used in the model.  The correct approach might involve re-computing this tensor every forward pass or using a different method that doesn't require persistent memory allocation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of memory management in Python and relevant frameworks, I strongly advise consulting the official documentation for both Python and your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch).  These resources often include detailed explanations of garbage collection mechanisms and best practices for efficient memory utilization.  Additionally, exploring materials on memory profiling tools within these frameworks is crucial for identifying and addressing memory leaks in your specific applications.  Finally, researching efficient data loading techniques and strategies for handling large datasets is of paramount importance for preventing memory-related problems in model training.
