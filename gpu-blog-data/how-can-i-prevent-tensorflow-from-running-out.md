TensorFlow's GPU memory management, particularly when training multiple models concurrently, often presents a significant challenge.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning pipelines has highlighted the critical role of memory fragmentation and inefficient resource allocation in such scenarios.  Simply increasing GPU VRAM isn't always a viable solution; a strategic approach to memory management is crucial.  This necessitates a multi-pronged strategy incorporating model architecture considerations, data handling techniques, and TensorFlow's built-in memory management tools.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The primary reason TensorFlow exhausts GPU memory when training two models simultaneously is the cumulative memory demand exceeding available resources. This isn't solely determined by the model parameters;  intermediate activation tensors, gradients, and optimizer states also consume significant VRAM.  Furthermore, memory fragmentation—where small, unusable memory gaps arise between allocated blocks—can exacerbate the issue, preventing the allocation of even relatively large, contiguous blocks of memory required for tensors.  Finally, inefficient data loading practices, like loading the entire dataset into memory at once, can lead to memory exhaustion.

To address this, we must focus on minimizing the memory footprint of both models and their training processes.  This involves several strategies:

* **Model Architecture Optimization:** Reducing model complexity directly lowers memory consumption. Using smaller layers, fewer layers, or quantization techniques can significantly impact memory usage.  For instance, replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers or employing pruning techniques can reduce parameter counts.
* **Data Handling:** Efficient data loading is paramount.  Techniques like using TensorFlow's `tf.data` API for efficient batching and preprocessing, employing data generators instead of loading the entire dataset at once, and implementing techniques like on-the-fly data augmentation significantly reduce memory pressure.
* **TensorFlow Memory Management:** TensorFlow provides tools to control memory allocation and deallocation.  These include `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth()` to allow TensorFlow to dynamically allocate memory as needed, and `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` for distributing training across multiple GPUs.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Utilizing `tf.data` for Efficient Batching**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a dataset pipeline using tf.data
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(training_data).batch(batch_size)

# Prefetch data for improved performance
dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Train the model using the efficient dataset pipeline
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataset:
        # Training step with the batch
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(batch[0])
            loss = loss_function(predictions, batch[1])
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```
**Commentary:** This example demonstrates using `tf.data` to create a highly optimized data pipeline.  `batch(batch_size)` controls memory usage per iteration, while `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` enables asynchronous data loading, overlapping I/O with computation and preventing idle GPU time waiting for data.  This significantly improves throughput and reduces memory consumption compared to loading the entire dataset at once.


**Example 2: Implementing Model Parallelism with `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model1 = create_model1()
    model2 = create_model2()
    optimizer1 = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    optimizer2 = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Training loop within the strategy scope
# ... Training logic for both models ...
```
**Commentary:** This showcases `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`.  This distributes the model parameters and computations across multiple GPUs, effectively reducing the memory burden on any single GPU.  Crucially, the `with strategy.scope():` block ensures that all model creation and training operations occur within the scope of the distribution strategy.  This is essential for proper synchronization and memory management across GPUs.


**Example 3: Employing `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth()` for Dynamic Memory Allocation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

# ... Model training code ...
```
**Commentary:** This utilizes `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)` to allow TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed. This prevents TensorFlow from reserving all available GPU memory at the start, a common cause of memory issues when training multiple models simultaneously.  The code first checks for available GPUs and then attempts to set memory growth for each.  The `try...except` block handles potential `RuntimeError` exceptions, which can occur if this setting is attempted after GPU initialization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections detailing the `tf.data` API and distributed training strategies, are essential.  Explore resources on efficient deep learning practices, including model compression techniques and optimized data preprocessing methods.  Furthermore, familiarizing yourself with memory profiling tools for TensorFlow can prove invaluable in pinpointing memory bottlenecks.  Studying the design of large-scale deep learning systems and examining the architectures of efficient models will further enhance your understanding.  These resources combined will provide a robust foundation for tackling GPU memory constraints effectively.
