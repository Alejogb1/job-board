Fitting a partial orbital trajectory around a given focal point relies heavily on the principles of conic sections and Keplerian orbital mechanics. While a complete orbit requires six orbital elements for full definition, a partial trajectory can be approximated using observed position and velocity data, coupled with knowledge of the central body's gravitational parameter. This approach often involves numerical methods since analytical solutions for the full orbit are computationally expensive for partial arcs. I’ve successfully implemented such fitting procedures numerous times, initially during my work on satellite tracking systems.

The fundamental concept is that a body’s motion under a central gravitational force traces a path described by a conic section, which could be an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. In our context, the focal point is the center of the attracting mass (e.g., a planet or a star). Given a partial trajectory, we are not directly handed the full set of orbital elements. Instead, we possess a series of positional vectors and velocity vectors, taken at different points in time, each with its associated timestamp. These vectors form the basis for reconstructing the orbital path. The challenge lies in extracting orbital parameters from this limited dataset, acknowledging that observed measurements always contain some noise. A critical first step involves transforming these raw observations into a suitable coordinate system, typically an inertial frame centered at the focal point. This transformation ensures consistency when performing calculations over different observation times.

The fitting process generally proceeds in two major stages. First, an initial guess of the orbital parameters is established. Techniques vary here; a simplistic approach could calculate an approximate orbit using only three position vectors, then refine this guess iteratively. The second stage involves an optimization procedure, which iteratively adjusts the initial parameter set to minimize the difference between the modeled trajectory and the actual observations. These differences are captured in a cost function, commonly the sum of squared errors between the observed positions and the predicted positions based on the current orbital parameter guess.

Several techniques can be employed for this optimization, including gradient descent methods or non-linear least squares methods. The choice depends on the size of the dataset and the computational resources available. For instance, a relatively simple partial orbit with only a few data points might be well-suited for basic gradient descent, whereas complex orbital arcs with hundreds of observations might require a more sophisticated approach like the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The gradient information, which represents the direction of steepest descent in the cost function, is commonly computed via finite differences or analytical derivations. The former is easier to implement but can be slower, while the latter is computationally more efficient but more difficult to implement. I have found, in my work, that finite differences are usually sufficient for practical satellite tracking systems with reasonably sized datasets.

Below are several code examples using Python to demonstrate this fitting process. The following code blocks provide essential numerical functionalities, using NumPy to represent vectors, and Scipy for its minimization routines.
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.constants import G

def kepler_propagation(r0, v0, t, mu):
    # Simplified Keplerian propagation for a given time t
    # Returns position at time t
    r = np.linalg.norm(r0)
    v = np.linalg.norm(v0)
    vr = np.dot(r0, v0) / r
    h = np.cross(r0, v0)
    h_norm = np.linalg.norm(h)
    e_vec = (1/mu) * ((v*v - mu/r) * r0 - r * vr * v0) # Eccentricity vector
    e = np.linalg.norm(e_vec)
    a = 1/(2/r - v*v/mu) # Semi-major axis
    if e < 1:
        E = np.arccos(1-r/a) if vr>0 else 2*np.pi - np.arccos(1-r/a)
        M = E-e*np.sin(E)
        n = np.sqrt(mu/a**3) #Mean motion
        M_t = M + n * t
        E_t = M_t  # Initial Guess for Eccentric Anomaly
        for _ in range(10):
             E_t = M_t + e * np.sin(E_t)
        x_t = a * (np.cos(E_t) - e)
        y_t = a * np.sqrt(1 - e*e) * np.sin(E_t)
        r_t = np.array([x_t, y_t, 0.0])  #simplified 2d
        
        return r_t 
    else:
        return np.array([np.inf, np.inf, np.inf]) # Handle Hyperbolic Case later for simplicity
```
This first code example shows a simplified Keplerian propagator. It takes the initial position (`r0`), initial velocity (`v0`), time step (`t`), and gravitational parameter (`mu`) as inputs. It returns the position vector after time `t`. Note that for simplification, only the elliptic case is implemented and a 2d plane is considered.  This assumes a purely Newtonian gravitational force acting on the body. The implementation iteratively calculates the eccentric anomaly from the mean anomaly, which is then used to compute the updated position. This propagation method is the core of how the trajectory is modeled, and it needs to be sufficiently accurate to generate effective predictions. In a real setting, this would also include perturbing forces and more robust root-finding algorithms.
```python
def cost_function(params, observations, times, mu):
    # Defines the cost function to minimize.
    r0 = params[0:3] #Initial position
    v0 = params[3:6] # Initial velocity
    total_error = 0
    for obs, time in zip(observations, times):
      
        r_predicted = kepler_propagation(r0, v0, time, mu)
        error = np.linalg.norm(r_predicted - obs)**2
        total_error += error
    return total_error

```
This second code block defines the cost function. This function is what the optimizer attempts to minimize. It accepts a vector of parameters (`params`), which contains the initial position and velocity estimates (`r0` and `v0`). It also takes the `observations`, the time of each observation (`times`), and the gravitational parameter `mu` as inputs. The function propagates the position at each time using the kepler_propagation function and calculates the sum of squared errors between the predicted positions and the actual observations, returning that scalar error value to be minimized. The goal of the optimization is to find the `r0` and `v0` that minimizes this function, effectively producing the best-fit orbital arc.
```python
def fit_partial_orbit(observations, times, mu, initial_guess):
    # Fit a partial orbit to observations
    result = minimize(cost_function, initial_guess, args=(observations, times, mu), method='Nelder-Mead')
    return result.x # Return the optimized parameters

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mu = G * 5.972e24 #Earth gravitational parameter

    observations = [np.array([6500e3, 0, 0]), np.array([5500e3, 2000e3, 0]), np.array([4500e3, 4000e3, 0])] #observed position at different times
    times = [0.0, 500.0, 1000.0] #Times of observations

    initial_guess = np.array([6500e3, 0, 0, 0, 7000, 0]) # Initial guess for position and velocity.
    optimized_params = fit_partial_orbit(observations, times, mu, initial_guess)

    print("Optimized Initial Position (m):", optimized_params[0:3])
    print("Optimized Initial Velocity (m/s):", optimized_params[3:6])

```
This last code block demonstrates how to utilize the `cost_function` for orbit fitting. This example defines example observations at given times, an initial parameter guess, and calls the minimize function, using the Nelder-Mead method, to produce an optimized set of initial position and velocity parameters. The `fit_partial_orbit` function utilizes `scipy.optimize.minimize` to perform the parameter optimization. The optimized parameters are then printed out. This is a simple example, and real-world orbital fitting would require significantly more data points, consideration of error bounds, and perhaps additional constraints.

In conclusion, fitting a partial orbital trajectory involves a combination of orbital mechanics and numerical optimization. The process begins with transforming raw observations into a suitable coordinate frame, using these observations to form a cost function, and finally, numerically optimizing the initial orbital parameters to minimize the chosen cost function. While these code examples offer a starting point, real-world application requires attention to numerical stability and robustness to handle a wide array of potential orbital scenarios and uncertainties.

For those seeking deeper knowledge of this field, I would recommend exploration of textbooks on orbital mechanics and astrodynamics. Additionally, many open-source libraries offer readily available tools for numerical propagation and parameter estimation, often with better algorithms than the ones I’ve shown here. Resources focusing on numerical methods for optimization will greatly aid in understanding the various optimization algorithms. Finally, the documentation of scientific computing libraries such as `NumPy` and `SciPy` is extremely valuable for those building their own software.
