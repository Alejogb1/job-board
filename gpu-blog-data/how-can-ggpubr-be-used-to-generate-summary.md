The `ggpubr` package, while primarily known for its ease of use in generating publication-ready plots, offers a less-explored, yet powerful, feature: the ability to directly integrate summary statistics onto violin and box plots.  I've personally found this functionality invaluable in streamlining my data visualization workflow, particularly when presenting results from multiple experimental groups or conditions within a single figure.  This isn't immediately apparent from the basic documentation; it requires understanding how `stat_summary()` interacts with `ggviolin()` and `ggboxplot()`.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`ggpubr` doesn't possess dedicated functions solely for calculating and displaying summary statistics. Instead, its strength lies in its seamless integration with `ggplot2`'s statistical transformation functions.  The key is leveraging `stat_summary()`, a function that allows adding custom summary statistics to a plot.  This function requires specifying a function to calculate the statistic (e.g., `mean`, `median`, `sd`, `IQR`) and a `fun.data` argument to control how these statistics are displayed (e.g., as points, error bars, or even custom shapes).  When combined with `ggviolin()` or `ggboxplot()`, this provides a concise visualization of both the data distribution and key descriptive measures.  Crucially, proper specification of the `fun.data` argument is vital for generating informative and visually appealing displays. I've spent considerable time optimizing this aspect for clarity and accuracy in numerous scientific publications.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Mean and Standard Deviation on a Violin Plot**

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)

# Sample data (replace with your own)
data <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 20)),
  Value = c(rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(20, mean = 15, sd = 3), rnorm(20, mean = 12, sd = 2.5))
)

# Generate violin plot with mean and standard deviation
ggviolin(data, x = "Group", y = "Value",
         add = "mean_sd",  # Adds mean and standard deviation
         fill = "Group") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_sdl", fun.args = list(mult = 1),
               geom = "pointrange", color = "black")
```

This code first loads `ggpubr` and `dplyr`.  I prefer using `dplyr` for data manipulation prior to plotting, though itâ€™s not strictly necessary.  The sample data simulates three groups with normally distributed values. `ggviolin()` generates the violin plot, and `add = "mean_sd"` conveniently adds points representing the means and error bars for standard deviations.  `stat_summary()` is added for more precise control, using `mean_sdl` (mean and standard deviation) and defining error bar length with `mult = 1`. The `geom = "pointrange"` argument ensures error bars are displayed.


**Example 2:  Median, Interquartile Range, and Box Plot**

```R
# Using the same data as Example 1

# Generate box plot with median and IQR
ggboxplot(data, x = "Group", y = "Value",
          fill = "Group") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "median_hilow",
               fun.args = list(conf.int = 0.5),
               geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5,
               color = "black")
```

Here, we use `ggboxplot()` for a box plot representation.  `stat_summary()` is used with `median_hilow` to display the median and the range covering 50% of the data (IQR).  `conf.int = 0.5` specifies this range.  The `geom = "crossbar"` displays a horizontal line segment representing the IQR with the median marked by a cross.  The `width` parameter controls the horizontal extent of the crossbar.


**Example 3:  Custom Summary Statistics Function**

```R
# Using the same data as Example 1

# Define a custom function to calculate mean, median, and 95% confidence interval
my_summary <- function(x) {
  m <- mean(x)
  med <- median(x)
  se <- sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
  ci <- se * qt(0.975, df = length(x) - 1)
  data.frame(y = m, ymin = m - ci, ymax = m + ci, median = med)
}

# Generate violin plot with custom summary statistics
ggviolin(data, x = "Group", y = "Value",
         fill = "Group") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = my_summary,
               geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2,
               color = "black") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = my_summary,
               geom = "point", size = 3, color = "black")
```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of `stat_summary()`. A custom function, `my_summary`, is defined to calculate the mean, median, and 95% confidence interval. This function is then passed to `stat_summary()`. Two layers of `stat_summary` are used: one to display error bars (`geom = "errorbar"`) and another to display the mean as a point (`geom = "point"`). This allows for precise customization beyond the pre-built options.  This is particularly helpful when dealing with non-standard metrics or error calculations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official `ggplot2` documentation.  A comprehensive guide to data visualization with `ggplot2` covering statistical transformations in detail.

A well-structured introductory textbook on statistical graphics.  This should provide a solid foundation in the principles of visual data representation and the interpretation of summary statistics.

Advanced statistical modelling textbooks. This will provide more nuanced approaches to the calculation and interpretation of confidence intervals, particularly beneficial for handling different data distributions.



In conclusion, generating summary statistics on violin and box plots using `ggpubr` relies heavily on understanding and effectively utilizing `stat_summary()` within the `ggplot2` framework.  By carefully selecting appropriate statistical functions and geometric elements, highly informative and visually appealing visualizations can be created, directly integrating descriptive statistics within the graphical representation of data distribution. Remember that the choice of summary statistics should always be guided by the specific research question and the nature of the data.
