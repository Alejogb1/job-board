Discrepancies in prediction probabilities and outputs across different TensorFlow models trained on identical datasets stem fundamentally from the inherent variability in the model architecture, training hyperparameters, and the stochastic nature of the training process itself.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects, particularly those involving medical imaging analysis, has consistently highlighted this issue.  Inconsistent results are not necessarily indicative of flawed models, but rather reflect the complex interplay of factors determining model behavior.

**1. Architectural Differences:**

The most obvious source of variation lies in the model architecture itself.  Consider two models: a simple sequential model with two dense layers and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.  Even if both models are trained on the same data, their internal representations of the data will differ significantly.  The dense model learns global features, while the CNN learns hierarchical features, detecting patterns at various scales. This difference in feature extraction leads to distinct probability distributions and, ultimately, differing predictions. The expressive power and capacity of each architecture to capture the underlying data patterns inherently vary.  A more complex model, such as a deep CNN, may have the capacity to learn more intricate relationships and thus provide subtly different—though not necessarily superior—predictions.  Furthermore, the choice of activation functions within each layer also contributes to this variability.  ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, while all nonlinear, introduce different nonlinearities that shape the decision boundaries learned by the model.

**2. Hyperparameter Variation:**

The training process is governed by numerous hyperparameters.  Variations in these parameters, even seemingly minor ones, can profoundly impact the final model's performance and predictions.  The learning rate, for instance, directly affects the magnitude of parameter updates during backpropagation. A smaller learning rate leads to slower convergence but potentially a more refined solution, whereas a larger learning rate may result in faster but potentially less accurate convergence or even divergence.  Similarly, the choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop) influences the trajectory of the optimization process within the loss landscape.  Each optimizer employs different strategies for updating model weights, leading to variations in the learned parameters and, subsequently, in predictions.  Regularization techniques, such as dropout and L1/L2 regularization, also play a crucial role.  Stronger regularization suppresses model complexity, potentially reducing overfitting and leading to different, perhaps more generalized, predictions.  The batch size, controlling the number of samples used in each gradient update, affects the stochasticity of the gradient estimation, further contributing to variability in model learning.

**3. Stochasticity in Training:**

The training process itself is inherently stochastic.  Data shuffling, random weight initialization, and the inherent randomness in the optimization algorithms all introduce variability. Even with identical hyperparameters and architecture, multiple runs of training the same model on the same data will likely result in slightly different models due to the stochasticity of the gradient descent process.  This means that the model's parameters will settle at different points in the loss landscape, leading to variations in predictions.  Furthermore, the order in which data is presented during training can influence the model's learning process, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced datasets or complex data dependencies. This effect is often mitigated through techniques like data augmentation and careful data shuffling, but it remains a factor contributing to the overall variability.

**Code Examples:**

Below are three examples demonstrating potential sources of prediction variability in TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Architectural Differences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simple sequential model
model_seq = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Convolutional neural network
model_cnn = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile both models (assuming identical optimizer and loss)
model_seq.compile(...)
model_cnn.compile(...)

# Train both models on the same data
model_seq.fit(...)
model_cnn.fit(...)

# Predict on the same input; expect different outputs
predictions_seq = model_seq.predict(...)
predictions_cnn = model_cnn.predict(...)
```

This example showcases how different architectures (sequential vs. convolutional) will yield different predictions even when trained on the same data.  The crucial difference lies in how these models extract features; the CNN is better suited for image data.


**Example 2: Hyperparameter Variation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential(...)

# Train the model with different learning rates
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), ...)
model.fit(...)

model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1), ...)
model.fit(...)

# Predict using both models; expect differences due to learning rate
predictions_low_lr = model.predict(...)
predictions_high_lr = model.predict(...)
```

Here, altering a key hyperparameter (learning rate) demonstrates the impact on model training and subsequent predictions.  A lower learning rate might lead to a more refined solution while a higher rate may result in instability or premature convergence.


**Example 3: Stochasticity of Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a model and compile it
model = tf.keras.Sequential(...)
model.compile(...)

# Train the model multiple times with different random seeds
for i in range(3):
    np.random.seed(i)  # Setting the seed for reproducibility (within the loop)
    model.fit(...)  #Note:  data shuffling should still occur within the fit method
    predictions = model.predict(...)
    print(f"Predictions for seed {i}: {predictions}")
```


This example highlights the inherent stochasticity of training, even when all other factors (architecture and hyperparameters) are kept constant.  The use of different random seeds for weight initialization and data shuffling will influence the training trajectory and consequently yield different prediction results.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting standard TensorFlow documentation, introductory machine learning texts, and research papers on deep learning optimization techniques.  Specific resources concerning the impact of various optimizers, regularization methods, and the effect of stochasticity on model training are invaluable.  Further exploration into theoretical frameworks of model capacity and generalization would provide a strong foundation for understanding these variations.
