The core misconception surrounding Keras model fitting lies in the understanding of the `fit` method's behavior and its interaction with model weights.  Contrary to some initial impressions, calling `model.fit` repeatedly doesn't simply append training epochs; it *replaces* the existing model weights with the newly trained ones.  This behavior is crucial for correctly managing model training across multiple fitting sessions, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex training pipelines.  In my experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models, this distinction was fundamental to achieving consistent results and avoiding unexpected behavior.

This necessitates careful consideration of several factors when refitting a Keras model.  First, the choice between overwriting existing weights and continuing training from a previous state directly influences the training strategy. Second, appropriate data management is essential to ensure consistent results across fitting sessions.  Finally, utilizing callbacks effectively can allow for intricate control over this process, including saving checkpoints and monitoring performance metrics across multiple fitting iterations.

**1. Overwriting Existing Weights:**

The most straightforward approach, and the default behavior, is to simply overwrite the model's weights with each call to `fit`.  This is suitable for scenarios where each `fit` call represents an independent training session. For example, one might split a large dataset into subsets, training on each subset independently.  The final model weights would then reflect training only on the last subset. This method lacks the ability to build upon previous training unless one utilizes specific callbacks (discussed later).


**Code Example 1: Independent Fitting Sessions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training data (replace with your actual data)
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)


# First fit
model.fit(x_train[:20000], y_train[:20000], epochs=10)

# Second fit (overwrites weights from the first fit)
model.fit(x_train[20000:40000], y_train[20000:40000], epochs=10)

# Evaluate the model after the second fit (only trained on the second dataset)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This example demonstrates independent fitting. Each `model.fit` call trains on a different portion of the data, completely replacing the weights established in the previous call.  The final model's performance is solely determined by the last training phase.


**2. Continuing Training from a Checkpoint:**

To continue training from a previously saved state, one must leverage model checkpoints. These checkpoints save the model's weights and optimizer state at specific intervals during training.  By loading a checkpoint, training can resume from where it left off.  This approach is crucial for handling large datasets that cannot fit into memory, requiring training to be split across multiple sessions. This method preserves the benefits of incremental learning, allowing the model to refine its understanding of the data over multiple iterations.

**Code Example 2: Training Continuation with Checkpoints**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import os

# Define the model (same as before)
# ... (Model definition from Example 1) ...


checkpoint_path = "training_checkpoints/cp-{epoch:04d}.ckpt"
checkpoint_dir = os.path.dirname(checkpoint_path)

# Create a callback that saves the model's weights
cp_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=checkpoint_path,
    verbose=1,
    save_weights_only=True,
    save_freq='epoch')

# First training session
model.fit(x_train[:20000], y_train[:20000], epochs=5, callbacks=[cp_callback])

# Load the weights from the checkpoint
model.load_weights(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))

# Continue training with the remaining data
model.fit(x_train[20000:40000], y_train[20000:40000], epochs=5, callbacks=[cp_callback])

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

Here, the `ModelCheckpoint` callback saves the model's weights after each epoch.  The subsequent `model.load_weights` call restores these weights, allowing training to continue from the point where the first session ended.  The model's performance benefits from the cumulative training across both sessions.



**3.  Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models:**

Another common scenario involves refitting pre-trained models.  This often necessitates a different approach to manage the training process.  Instead of re-training all layers, often only specific layers (usually the top layers) are fine-tuned to adapt the model to a new dataset or task.  This strategy balances leveraging the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained weights with adapting the model to a specific application.

**Code Example 3: Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load a pre-trained model (replace with your pre-trained model)
base_model = keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the base model's layers
base_model.trainable = False

# Add custom classification layers
global_average_layer = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()
prediction_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

# Create the new model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  base_model,
  global_average_layer,
  prediction_layer
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (only the top layers will be trained)
model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=10)

# Unfreeze some layers of the base model for fine-tuning
base_model.trainable = True

# Recompile the model to include the newly trainable layers
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-5),  # Use a lower learning rate for fine-tuning
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fine-tune the model
model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=5)
```


This example demonstrates fine-tuning.  Initially, only the added classification layers are trained.  Subsequently, by setting `base_model.trainable = True`, deeper layers of the pre-trained model can be included in the training process, allowing for more granular adaptation.  A reduced learning rate is employed during fine-tuning to prevent overwriting the pre-trained weights.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, TensorFlow documentation, and various deep learning textbooks offer comprehensive details on model training, callbacks, and checkpointing.  Consider exploring publications on transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies for further insights.  Exploring advanced training techniques like learning rate schedulers will enhance your understanding of model training and the intricacies of Keras's `fit` method.
