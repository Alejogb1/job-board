The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in the output of a TensorFlow Sequential model almost invariably stems from numerical instability during training.  Over the course of my eight years developing and deploying machine learning models, I've observed this issue frequently, and its root cause is rarely a single, easily identifiable error. Instead, it typically arises from a confluence of factors relating to data preprocessing, model architecture, and the training process itself.  Let's systematically address potential sources.

**1. Data Preprocessing Issues:**

The most frequent culprit is poorly preprocessed data.  NaNs in the input data will almost certainly propagate through the model, leading to NaN outputs.  However, even seemingly clean data can harbour subtle problems.  For example, extreme outliers, particularly in features with large ranges, can lead to numerical overflow during calculations within the activation functions (like sigmoid or softmax) or loss functions, ultimately resulting in NaN values.  Furthermore, if your data contains features with vastly different scales, gradient descent optimization algorithms can struggle to converge, potentially generating NaNs.  Robust data normalization or standardization—techniques designed to centre and scale features to a common range (e.g., zero mean and unit variance)—is crucial to prevent these issues. I've personally witnessed this problem manifest in several projects, particularly when dealing with datasets containing financial time series data with highly variable magnitude.

**2. Model Architecture and Hyperparameter Selection:**

The architecture of your Sequential model itself can contribute to NaN generation.  Issues often arise from inappropriate activation functions. For instance, using a ReLU activation in a layer that might receive significantly negative inputs can cause vanishing gradients or even produce NaN values.  Similarly, an overly complex model with a large number of layers and neurons can lead to overfitting and subsequently to unstable training dynamics, which can manifest as NaN outputs.  The learning rate of the optimizer is another critical hyperparameter.  An excessively high learning rate can cause the optimizer to "overshoot" the optimal parameter values, leading to numerical instability and NaN values. Conversely, a learning rate that's too low can result in extremely slow convergence and exacerbate any existing numerical issues.  Regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay help alleviate this, but misapplication can still lead to trouble.

**3. Problems During the Training Process:**

Beyond data and architecture, problems during the training loop itself can lead to NaNs.  One common issue is exploding gradients. This happens when the gradients become excessively large during backpropagation, leading to numerical overflow in weight updates. Gradient clipping can mitigate this—it limits the magnitude of gradients, preventing them from becoming excessively large.  Another factor is the use of inappropriate loss functions. Some loss functions are more sensitive to outliers or numerical instability than others.  For example, using mean squared error with data containing significant outliers can potentially lead to NaN values.  Finally, the choice of optimizer significantly influences the training stability. Adam, for example, is generally more robust than simple gradient descent. However, improper hyperparameter tuning for Adam (or any optimizer) can still result in numerical instability.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Preprocessing and Normalization**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data with an outlier
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [1000, 1000, 1000]])

# Separate features and target (replace with your actual target)
X = data[:, :2]
y = data[:, 2]

# Normalize using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Create and train your model using X_scaled and y
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_scaled, y, epochs=100)
```
This demonstrates the importance of scaling using `StandardScaler`. The outlier is effectively mitigated by this pre-processing step.


**Example 2: Addressing Exploding Gradients with Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) # Gradient clipping

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```
Here, `clipnorm=1.0` limits the norm of the gradients to 1.0, preventing exploding gradients.  Adjust this value based on your specific model and data.


**Example 3:  Choosing a Robust Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(7,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='huber_loss') # Using Huber loss instead of MSE
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)

```
Huber loss is less sensitive to outliers than mean squared error (MSE), making it a more robust choice when dealing with potentially noisy data.  Replacing MSE with Huber loss can significantly improve training stability.

**Resource Recommendations:**

* The TensorFlow documentation on optimizers and loss functions.
* A comprehensive textbook on numerical methods for machine learning.
* A practical guide to data preprocessing and feature engineering.


By carefully considering these aspects—data preprocessing, model architecture, and training dynamics—and systematically addressing potential issues, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering NaN values in your TensorFlow Sequential model outputs. Remember that debugging this issue requires a methodical approach and potentially iterative adjustments to your data pipeline and model configurations.  Thorough understanding of numerical stability and the nuances of deep learning frameworks is paramount in preventing and resolving this common challenge.
