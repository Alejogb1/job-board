TensorFlow operations, fundamentally, do not directly translate into tensors. Instead, they represent computations within the TensorFlow computational graph. My experience debugging complex model architectures often leads to the same error: attempting to use the result of an operation—a node in the graph—directly as a tensor. The solution invariably involves evaluating that operation within a TensorFlow session or using eager execution, which fundamentally transforms it from a graph node to a concrete numerical array in memory.

The key distinction lies between the symbolic representation of computation (the TensorFlow graph) and the actual execution of that computation yielding numerical results. A TensorFlow operation defines a function or transformation, such as matrix multiplication or addition, on input tensors. It does not hold the computed result itself. It’s a recipe, not the cooked meal. When you define an operation, you are effectively adding a node to the computational graph, which outlines how data will flow through the defined structure. The actual computation only happens when the graph, or a part of it, is executed within a session (in graph mode) or immediately if eager execution is enabled.

To obtain a tensor from a TensorFlow operation, you need to explicitly trigger its execution.  In graph mode (TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x when using `@tf.function`), this requires a `tf.Session`. The `Session` manages the execution of the graph, feeding it input data and fetching computed values from specific operations. In eager mode (default in TensorFlow 2.x), the operations execute immediately, and their output is a tangible tensor. Essentially, eager execution removes the intermediary step of graph construction and evaluation. Instead, each operation is evaluated as it’s defined, yielding its numerical tensor result immediately. 

Let's consider examples to clarify. Suppose I'm building a simple network where I need to calculate the sum of two tensors.

**Example 1: Graph Mode**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input tensors (symbolic)
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.int32)
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.int32)

# Define the addition operation (still symbolic)
sum_op = tf.add(a, b)

# Print the operation type
print("Type of sum_op:", type(sum_op)) # Output: <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor'>

# Initialize a session
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()

# Execute the operation within the session to get the tensor
sum_tensor = sess.run(sum_op)

# Print the resulting tensor
print("Type of sum_tensor:", type(sum_tensor)) # Output: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
print("Value of sum_tensor:", sum_tensor)      # Output: [5 7 9]

# Close the session
sess.close()
```

In this first example, `sum_op` is of type `tf.Tensor`, but it's a symbolic reference to a node in the graph. It does not contain the actual numerical values. The `sess.run(sum_op)` call is what triggers the evaluation of this node in the graph and returns the result as a NumPy array. Notice that the type changes from `tf.Tensor` to `numpy.ndarray`. This NumPy array is the actual numerical tensor we desired.  Without the `sess.run()`, the code would fail if you attempt direct numerical computations on `sum_op`, because it represents a mathematical expression not a value.

**Example 2: Eager Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Enable eager execution (if not already on by default)
tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)

# Define input tensors
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.int32)
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.int32)

# Define and immediately execute the addition
sum_tensor = tf.add(a, b)

# Print the type of sum_tensor (and its value)
print("Type of sum_tensor:", type(sum_tensor)) # Output: <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'>
print("Value of sum_tensor:", sum_tensor)      # Output: tf.Tensor([5 7 9], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
```

In this second example, eager execution means that `tf.add(a, b)` immediately produces a `tf.Tensor` whose value can be accessed directly without requiring the creation of a `tf.Session` and calling the `run()` method. The operation executes immediately and gives the numerical result, as can be seen by printing the value. It's still a TensorFlow tensor object, but it encapsulates actual numbers. Eager mode is much simpler for simple computations and debugging. The downside of this is the lack of performance gains which you can gain from graph mode.

**Example 3: Conversion within a Function decorated with tf.function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Function decorated with tf.function
@tf.function
def add_tensors(a, b):
    sum_op = tf.add(a, b)
    return sum_op

# Input tensors (as numpy)
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]

# The add_tensors function returns a tensor of type EagerTensor,
# after the function is executed
sum_tensor = add_tensors(a, b)

print(f"Type of sum_tensor: {type(sum_tensor)}") # Output: <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'>
print(f"Value of sum_tensor: {sum_tensor}")      # Output: tf.Tensor([5 7 9], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)

```

In this third example, we define a function that uses TensorFlow operations within its body and decorate it using `tf.function`. What happens here is that, the first time you execute this function, Tensorflow creates a computation graph from the steps defined in it. In the subsequent calls, the function uses the previously created graph, leading to performance gains. Notice that the input is NumPy but what the function returns when executed is a tensor. 

The key takeaway is that regardless of whether you are in graph or eager mode, it is always necessary to trigger the computation of a TensorFlow operation to obtain a tensor with actual numeric values. In graph mode, you need a `tf.Session` and its `run()` method; in eager mode, the operations evaluate directly as they are executed. Furthermore, using `tf.function`, when applicable, provides the best of both worlds, combining the simplicity of eager mode with the performance optimization of graph mode.

For further understanding, I would suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on eager execution and graph execution. There are also excellent resources explaining the TensorFlow core mechanics in relation to computations graphs, available in multiple research papers from the Google research team. Finally, many blog posts focus on practical debugging of graph and eager mode, which would further improve one's practical ability. Learning how to identify when your program creates a computation graph would also help you use the most appropriate mode of tensor computations.  The core aspect of this distinction is critical to effectively developing and debugging complex TensorFlow models.
