Accessing the weights of a quantized-aware training (QAT) model, specifically a 4-bit one, requires careful consideration of the quantization scheme employed.  My experience working on embedded systems with stringent memory constraints led me to extensively investigate various QAT implementations, revealing that direct access isn't always straightforward. The key fact is that the weights aren't typically stored in their original floating-point representation after quantization.  Instead, they reside in a quantized format, often requiring dequantization to recover a representation approximating the original floating-point values.

**1.  Explanation:**

The process hinges on understanding the quantization parameters used during training.  QAT typically employs post-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT) techniques. In PTQ, the model is trained with full-precision weights, then quantized after training.  QAT, however, incorporates quantization into the training process itself, allowing for better accuracy.  Regardless of the method, the core components influencing weight access are the scaling factor (or scale) and zero point.

For 4-bit quantization, a common approach uses symmetric quantization with a scale factor and no zero point.  This means the quantized weight `w_q` is related to the floating-point weight `w_f` by:

`w_q = round(w_f / scale)`,  where `scale` is chosen to map the range of weights to the available integer range of a 4-bit representation (-8 to 7).

To recover an approximation of the original floating-point weight, we dequantize:

`w_f_approx = w_q * scale`

However, asymmetric quantization using both a scale and a zero point is also frequent.  Here, the relationship is:

`w_q = round((w_f - zero_point) / scale)`

The dequantization then becomes:

`w_f_approx = (w_q * scale) + zero_point`


Accessing the weights necessitates obtaining both the quantized weight values (`w_q`) and the quantization parameters (scale and zero point).  The exact method for accessing this information depends on the deep learning framework used (e.g., TensorFlow Lite Micro, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  Framework-specific APIs usually provide ways to traverse the model's layers and extract weight tensors.  These tensors contain the quantized weights.  The scale and zero point are often stored as metadata associated with each quantized layer.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how to access and dequantize weights in different scenarios, assuming the framework provides access to quantized weights and quantization parameters.  Note that these are illustrative and the specific API calls will vary depending on the framework.

**Example 1: TensorFlow Lite Micro (C++)**

```c++
// Assuming 'model' is a loaded TFLite Micro model.
TfLiteInterpreter* interpreter = ...; // Obtain interpreter object.
TfLiteTensor* weights_tensor = interpreter->tensor(weight_tensor_index); // Get weights tensor
int32_t* quantized_weights = weights_tensor->data.i32; // Access quantized weights

// Assuming scale and zero_point are accessible via metadata:
float scale = ...; // Obtain scale from model metadata
int32_t zero_point = ...; // Obtain zero_point from model metadata

for (int i = 0; i < weights_tensor->bytes / sizeof(int32_t); ++i) {
  float dequantized_weight = (float)quantized_weights[i] * scale + zero_point;
  //Process dequantized_weight
}
```


**Example 2: TensorFlow (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the quantized model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_qat_model.tflite")

# Access a specific layer's weights (replace 'my_layer' with actual layer name)
layer = model.get_layer('my_layer')
quantized_weights = layer.weights[0]  # Assuming weights are stored in weights[0]

# Access quantization parameters (method depends on the quantization technique used during model creation)
scale = layer.quantization.scale
zero_point = layer.quantization.zero_point

dequantized_weights = (quantized_weights.numpy() * scale) + zero_point

#Process dequantized_weights
```


**Example 3: PyTorch (Python)**

```python
import torch

# Load the quantized model
model = torch.load("my_qat_model.pt")

# Access a specific layer's weights (replace 'my_layer' with actual layer name)
layer = model.my_layer # Assuming the model has attribute my_layer

# PyTorch's quantization implementation varies, accessing scale and zero point directly may not be straightforward.
# You will often find the quantized weights within the layer's parameters.  Dequantization usually involves the use of the observer object that tracked the data statistics during training or calibration.
# This requires examining the model architecture and how quantization was applied during the model's creation.

#Illustrative example (may require modification based on how quantization was implemented):
quantized_weights = layer.weight.int_repr().float() # Assuming integer representation is stored
#Obtaining scale and zero point would require inspecting the model's quantizer object or accessing metadata from the model definition.
scale = 1.0 # Placeholder, replace with actual value from model metadata
zero_point = 0.0 # Placeholder, replace with actual value from model metadata

dequantized_weights = (quantized_weights * scale) + zero_point

#Process dequantized_weights

```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) is the primary resource.  Consult the sections on model quantization and weight access.  Furthermore, research papers on quantized neural networks and QAT techniques will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, refer to examples and tutorials showcasing the implementation of quantization and dequantization within your framework.  These resources will provide the specifics necessary to tailor the above examples to your particular QAT model and framework.
