Singularity containers, by default, are designed to promote reproducibility and immutability; this characteristic introduces a challenge when file modification inside the container is required. The standard execution model of Singularity mounts the container image as a read-only filesystem. To alter files within the environment, one must understand the different methods available, each having specific use cases and limitations. My experience, primarily with data analysis pipelines involving large genomic datasets and custom software stacks, has highlighted the importance of these techniques.

The primary approach to modifying container files involves overlay filesystems or bind mounts. Understanding the distinction and proper application of these methods is paramount. Overlay filesystems, specified during runtime via the `--overlay` flag, create a writable layer on top of the read-only container image. This effectively captures any changes made within the container session without modifying the underlying image. These changes are volatile, persisting only as long as the container instance is active, making this ideal for temporary modifications, configuration adjustments, or scratch-space needs. Bind mounts, on the other hand, map a directory or file from the host system into the container's filesystem using the `-B` or `--bind` option. Any alteration performed within the container affects the host's file system directly. Bind mounts are essential when persistent changes are needed or when external data needs access from within the container.

The choice between overlays and bind mounts depends entirely on the intended use case. If the aim is to patch a configuration file within a containerized application without permanently altering the container image, overlay filesystems are the suitable solution. If, conversely, large datasets outside the container are the target for manipulation, bind mounts provide a means to access the local files. Overlays are generally faster for smaller, volatile changes as opposed to bind mounts that rely on the host system file system performance.

Here are three code examples with detailed commentary, illustrating different scenarios and their respective configurations:

**Example 1: Temporary Configuration Modification using an Overlay Filesystem**

```bash
singularity exec --overlay /tmp/my_overlay.ext3:ro  my_container.sif bash
```

*   **Commentary:** This command initiates a Singularity container named `my_container.sif`. The `--overlay` flag specifies that a file `/tmp/my_overlay.ext3` will act as the overlay. The `:ro` suffix indicates that the overlay will start with the filesystem in a read-only state, but changes will be recorded in the overlay. If the file `/tmp/my_overlay.ext3` does not exist, it is created at the start of the container session. Inside the container, within the bash environment, all changes made to files that existed in the base container image will be written into this overlay file.  After the `bash` command exits, this temporary overlay file will be destroyed. The `ext3` file system is a common choice for overlays due to its simplicity and widespread compatibility. The read-only option is critical, as it ensures that the overlay filesystem is not inadvertently modified outside of the container session. This is frequently used to alter temporary configuration files and test software without affecting the base image.

    Within this session you could make changes like:

    ```bash
    echo "NEW_VALUE" > /opt/my_app/config.ini
    ```
    These changes will only live during the session. After the session ends they are discarded.

**Example 2: Persistent Data Access via Bind Mount**

```bash
singularity exec -B /mnt/large_data:/data  my_container.sif python my_script.py
```

*   **Commentary:**  This example starts `my_container.sif` and executes the `python my_script.py` command. The `-B /mnt/large_data:/data` option is the key here. It binds the directory `/mnt/large_data` on the host machine to the `/data` directory inside the container. Now, all files and subdirectories within `/mnt/large_data` are accessible via the `/data` path from within the container. More importantly, any modification to files within `/data` from the Python script will directly affect `/mnt/large_data` on the host machine, establishing persistence. This is critical for processing datasets too large to be included inside the container image itself, or when requiring persistent writes on the host system. I have used this frequently when processing raw sequencing reads and storing the results back to the host system for further analysis. This approach ensures that the actual data resides outside the container, preventing data bloat of container images.

    Within `my_script.py` you could include actions like:
    ```python
    with open("/data/my_dataset.txt", 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
           print(line.strip())

    with open("/data/my_output.txt", "w") as f:
       f.write("data processed by script\n")
    ```
    The changes to `/data/my_output.txt` will be reflected in `/mnt/large_data/my_output.txt` on the host.

**Example 3:  Combined Usage with an Overlay for Configuration and a Bind Mount for Results**

```bash
singularity exec --overlay /tmp/my_temp.ext3:rw -B /results:/output my_container.sif  /app/process.sh
```

*   **Commentary:** This example demonstrates combining both approaches. Here `/tmp/my_temp.ext3`, is used as a read-write overlay filesystem and the host directory `/results` is bound to `/output` inside the container. Inside the container, the command `/app/process.sh` is executed. Modifications to application configuration files located within the image are stored in the `/tmp/my_temp.ext3` overlay. At the same time, any output data generated by `process.sh` and directed to `/output` are directly written into `/results` on the host. This scenario reflects a frequent pattern, one where the container needs some specific configurations for operation but produces final results outside of the container. Using a read-write overlay allows configuration changes to exist for the container's session, which can be adjusted and tested before being added permanently to the container definition.

    For instance, if `/app/process.sh` contains code like:
    ```bash
    sed -i 's/oldvalue/newvalue/' /opt/my_app/config.ini
    my_app > /output/final_results.txt
    ```
    The first line will modify `config.ini` in the overlay and the second will write to the `/results` directory on the host machine. Once the container session exits, the changes to `/opt/my_app/config.ini` will be discarded, but changes to `/results/final_results.txt` will be persisted.

    In addition to file-level modifications, directories can also be bound in the same way as files. The general principle remains the same: changes within the container are reflected on the host file system.

For further reference and to expand on the topics discussed, I would suggest consulting the official Singularity documentation; specifically the sections pertaining to overlays and bind mounts. Articles and presentations about reproducible science and workflow management often touch on use cases and best practices for container manipulation. Additionally, exploration of container-oriented Linux system administration manuals will offer foundational knowledge about layered filesystems.
