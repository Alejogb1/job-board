Python's inherent interpreted nature often necessitates leveraging external libraries for GPU acceleration. While Numba is a popular choice, its just-in-time compilation approach isn't universally applicable.  In my experience optimizing large-scale scientific simulations, I've found that a more direct approach, utilizing libraries that manage the GPU interaction at a lower level, often yields better performance and control, especially for complex algorithms or when dealing with heterogeneous hardware.  This typically involves leveraging CUDA or OpenCL directly, although the specifics depend heavily on the chosen library and the nature of the computation.

**1.  Clear Explanation of GPU Execution in Python without Numba:**

The core principle involves managing GPU memory allocation, kernel launches, and data transfer explicitly. This contrasts with Numba's automatic code generation and optimization.  Libraries like PyCUDA and CuPy provide Python interfaces to CUDA, allowing for this granular control. PyCUDA provides a more direct mapping to CUDA's C API, offering maximum flexibility but requiring a deeper understanding of CUDA programming concepts. CuPy, on the other hand, provides a NumPy-like API, making it easier to port existing NumPy-based code to the GPU.  The choice depends on the programmer's CUDA expertise and the complexity of the task.  In both cases, the process involves the following key steps:

* **Data Transfer:**  Moving the necessary data from the host (CPU) memory to the GPU's memory.  This is a crucial step as it dictates the overall performance.  Inefficient data transfer can negate any gains from GPU acceleration.

* **Kernel Launch:** Executing the CUDA kernel, a function designed to run on the GPU. This involves specifying the number of threads and blocks to be used for parallel execution.  Careful consideration of thread and block configuration is vital for optimal performance and to avoid underutilization or divergence.

* **Data Retrieval:** Transferring the results computed on the GPU back to the host memory for further processing or visualization.  Similar to the data transfer step, this process significantly impacts the overall efficiency.

* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is critical in GPU programming.  This includes checking for CUDA errors at each step and implementing appropriate fallback mechanisms.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: PyCUDA for Matrix Multiplication**

This example demonstrates a simple matrix multiplication using PyCUDA.  It showcases the explicit management of memory allocation, kernel execution, and data transfer.

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
from pycuda.compiler import SourceModule
import numpy as np

# Define the CUDA kernel
mod = SourceModule("""
__global__ void matrixMul(float *A, float *B, float *C, int width) {
  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (row < width && col < width) {
    float sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
      sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
    }
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}
""")

# Initialize matrices on the host
width = 1024
A = np.random.rand(width, width).astype(np.float32)
B = np.random.rand(width, width).astype(np.float32)
C = np.zeros((width, width), dtype=np.float32)

# Allocate memory on the GPU
A_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(A.nbytes)
B_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(B.nbytes)
C_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(C.nbytes)

# Copy data to the GPU
cuda.memcpy_htod(A_gpu, A)
cuda.memcpy_htod(B_gpu, B)

# Get the function from the module
matrixMul = mod.get_function("matrixMul")

# Configure grid and block dimensions
threadsPerBlock = (16, 16)
blocksPerGrid = ((width + threadsPerBlock[0] - 1) // threadsPerBlock[0],
                 (width + threadsPerBlock[1] - 1) // threadsPerBlock[1])

# Launch the kernel
matrixMul(A_gpu, B_gpu, C_gpu, np.int32(width), block=threadsPerBlock, grid=blocksPerGrid)

# Copy the result back to the host
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(C, C_gpu)

# Free GPU memory
A_gpu.free()
B_gpu.free()
C_gpu.free()

#Verification (optional - for smaller matrices)
#print(np.allclose(np.dot(A, B), C))

```


**Example 2: CuPy for Image Processing**

CuPy's NumPy-like API simplifies GPU programming for array-based operations, as shown in this image filtering example.

```python
import cupy as cp
from scipy import ndimage

# Load image (replace with your image loading method)
image_cpu = ndimage.imread("image.png").astype(cp.float32)

# Transfer image to GPU
image_gpu = cp.asarray(image_cpu)

# Apply Gaussian blur
blurred_gpu = cp.ndimage.gaussian_filter(image_gpu, sigma=3)

# Transfer result back to CPU
blurred_cpu = cp.asnumpy(blurred_gpu)

#Further processing...

```


**Example 3:  Managing Multiple GPUs with PyCUDA (Conceptual)**

This example outlines the approach for utilizing multiple GPUs with PyCUDA; however, fully functional code requires more complex context management and inter-GPU communication.

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
# ... (other imports) ...

# Initialize multiple contexts
contexts = []
for i in range(num_gpus):
    ctx = cuda.Device(i).make_context()
    contexts.append(ctx)

# Allocate memory and execute kernels on each GPU individually
# ... (kernel execution on each context) ...

# Synchronize and gather results from each GPU
# ... (result aggregation) ...

# Teardown contexts
for ctx in contexts:
    ctx.pop()
```

* **CuPy Documentation:**  Detailed documentation explaining CuPy's NumPy-compatible API and its functionalities.

* **OpenCL Programming Guide:**  If considering OpenCL for broader hardware compatibility, this guide is indispensable.  Note that OpenCL support within Python is less mature than CUDA support.


This detailed response covers the fundamental aspects of GPU-accelerated Python code without relying on Numba.  Remember that optimizing GPU code often requires iterative refinement, profiling, and a thorough understanding of both Python and CUDA/OpenCL programming.  The efficiency heavily depends on the specific algorithm, hardware, and the chosen library.  Careful consideration of memory management and kernel design is paramount for optimal performance.
