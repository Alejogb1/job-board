My experience with TensorFlow indicates that debugging seemingly non-functional code often boils down to a methodical examination of several core areas.  Specifically, an unresponsive TensorFlow program seldom stems from a single, glaring error; rather, it typically arises from a combination of subtle issues related to execution contexts, resource management, and data pipeline construction.  A systematic approach to troubleshooting, focusing on these key areas, usually resolves the issue.

First, it is critical to understand how TensorFlow handles execution. The framework operates using a graph-based computational model.  You define a graph, representing the computations you want to perform, and then execute this graph.  There are two primary ways of executing this graph: eagerly or using `tf.function`.  Eager execution, enabled by default in TensorFlow 2, executes operations immediately, as they are encountered. This is useful for interactive debugging. However, for optimized performance in larger models, especially when deploying, it is beneficial to use `tf.function`. Decorating a function with `@tf.function` causes TensorFlow to trace the function's operations and compile them into a static graph that can be optimized for speed and resource utilization.  The lack of execution can stem from confusion in this dichotomy. If one expects a line-by-line execution akin to standard Python when using `tf.function`, the behavior is not what is anticipated, and errors may seem to disappear since they are only checked during graph compilation. For instance, a side effect like a print statement inside a `tf.function` might only execute during initial tracing or not at all if the graph does not need that operation, leading to the perception that the code is not running.

Second, the input data pipeline is a notorious source of issues. TensorFlow utilizes the `tf.data` API to build scalable and efficient data processing pipelines. Errors frequently arise due to incorrect shaping of data, inappropriate datatypes, or problems within the dataset creation itself.  If a `tf.data.Dataset` iterator becomes exhausted, without explicitly handled exceptions, the entire process might appear to stall without producing any errors on the surface. Moreover, memory limitations are often overlooked. When the dataset is very large, it is important to utilize batching and prefetching mechanisms via the `tf.data.Dataset` methods.  Failure to do so can lead to out-of-memory errors that, in some cases, are not explicitly communicated as the program hangs, and may not be immediately obvious based on a static code analysis.

Thirdly, GPU resource management is critical when leveraging hardware acceleration with TensorFlow.  By default, TensorFlow attempts to use all available GPUs. If insufficient GPU memory is present or if there are conflicts with existing processes using the same GPUs, the code may not run as intended. Explicitly controlling GPU usage, including specifying which GPUs to use, or limiting the memory consumption per GPU is vital. Incorrect configurations, or the absence thereof, are a common reason for seemingly stalled processes. Additionally, when working with multiple GPUs, a proper distribution strategy should be defined using `tf.distribute`. An attempt to perform multi-GPU calculations without an established distribution strategy leads to erroneous behavior and can prevent the execution.

Let's examine some code examples to illustrate typical scenarios:

**Example 1: Eager Execution vs. tf.function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Eager execution
x = tf.constant(5)
y = x * 2
print(f"Eager result: {y}")  # This works as expected

@tf.function
def my_func():
  a = tf.constant(10)
  b = a * 3
  print(f"Inside tf.function: {b}") # This might not appear

my_func()

@tf.function
def my_func2(a):
    b = a * 3
    return b

result = my_func2(tf.constant(5))
print(f"Result from tf.function with a return: {result}")

```
*Commentary:*
In this first block, we see eager execution behaving normally: the `print` statement reveals the result of the multiplication of the tensor `x`. The function `my_func` decorated by `@tf.function` does *not* print "Inside tf.function: 30" during its execution. This is because the `print` is not a part of the computation graph TensorFlow will optimize, and is often ignored. However the  `my_func2` function that *returns* a value will execute during its function tracing, and the result can be seen through the print. This illustrates how functions need to return values for their output to be seen. It demonstrates the crucial difference between eager execution and the graph-based approach of `@tf.function`, which is a common point of confusion. The lack of output can easily mislead one into believing that the code is not executing.

**Example 2: Issues in a tf.data pipeline.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect data shape
data = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.float32)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data).batch(2)

# Attempt to iterate over batches
for batch in dataset:
  print(batch)
  # Missing an explicit stop after processing all batches may look like a hang

# Incorrect data type
data_str = tf.constant(["a", "b", "c"])
dataset_str = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data_str).batch(1)
try:
  for batch in dataset_str:
      print(batch * 2)  # Causes an error
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Data type error: {e}")


# Exhausted dataset iterator
dataset_ex = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([1,2,3]).batch(2)
iterator = iter(dataset_ex)

print(next(iterator))
print(next(iterator))
try:
  print(next(iterator))
except StopIteration:
  print("Dataset Iterator exhausted")
```

*Commentary:*
The first part of the code successfully iterates over the dataset. However the absence of explicit logic to terminate after the dataset runs out might be perceived as the code not terminating.  Secondly, we see an explicit error when multiplying string tensors, but the program at least stops explicitly with an error. The last section demonstrates a dataset iterator being fully consumed. When `next(iterator)` is called after the iterator has been exhausted, it raises a `StopIteration` exception, handled here. If this handling wasn't explicit, the program would simply hang and provide little insight as to why.

**Example 3: GPU Resource Management**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check GPU devices
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  print("GPUs found:", gpus)
  try:
    # Attempt to limit memory usage (important)
    tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(gpus[0],
                                           [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=2048)]) # Limit to 2GB
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print("Logical GPUs:", logical_gpus)
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error setting memory limits: {e}")

  #  Incorrectly using multiple GPUs without strategy
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    x = tf.random.normal((100,100))
    y = tf.matmul(x,x)
  try:
      with tf.device('/GPU:1'): # Incorrect use without a distribution strategy
          z = tf.random.normal((100,100))
          w = tf.matmul(z,z)
  except ValueError as e:
      print(f"Error incorrect multi-GPU: {e}")


else:
  print("No GPUs found")


# Example of using a distribution strategy
if len(gpus)> 1:
  strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
  with strategy.scope():
      x = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
      y = tf.matmul(x, x)
      print(f"Computation using Mirrored Strategy on {len(gpus)} GPUs")
```
*Commentary:*
Here, the code first identifies available GPUs. If GPUs are found, it attempts to limit the memory used per GPU. A `RuntimeError` is raised if memory limits cannot be applied. Furthermore, it demonstrates how directly specifying different GPUs using `tf.device` is not sufficient for proper multi-GPU utilization, especially without an appropriate distribution strategy, leading to an explicit error. Finally, it illustrates the proper way to use multiple GPUs with a `MirroredStrategy`.  If memory is over allocated or multi-GPU strategies are absent, the code may not run.

To further improve your debugging process I recommend consulting these additional resources. The official TensorFlow documentation is crucial, providing comprehensive information on all aspects of the framework, particularly the sections concerning `tf.function`, `tf.data`, and GPU management. The TensorFlow tutorials on the official website offer practical examples and case studies covering many of these topics. Lastly, discussions and resolved problems on community forums, though more specific to different implementations, often contain invaluable insights into common pitfalls and debugging strategies when running TensorFlow code. Carefully evaluating these three areas – execution context, data pipelines, and GPU resource management – along with consistent consultation of official and community resources, will generally lead to the successful resolution of most “non-running” TensorFlow code.
