The root cause of the "OpError: The system cannot find the file specified" error, commonly encountered in programming and system administration, is a fundamental mismatch between the program's expectation of a file's existence and the actual state of the filesystem. This mismatch typically stems from incorrect file paths, permissions issues, or files that have been moved or deleted. Over my years working on backend systems, I've debugged this error in various contexts, ranging from scripting batch processes to troubleshooting complex application deployments, and the core problem always boils down to the program failing to locate a file it believes should be present.

A significant portion of these errors arises from the use of *relative paths*. When a path is relative, it is interpreted in relation to the current working directory of the process executing the program. If the program assumes a particular working directory, while the script or program is actually invoked from another location, then relative paths won't resolve as intended. For instance, a Python script that attempts to open 'data/input.txt' expects the 'data' directory to be a subdirectory of the directory where the script is run from. If invoked from a different folder the program won't be able to locate the input file.

Incorrect absolute paths are another common source of error. These paths provide the complete location of a file, starting from the root directory of the filesystem. Mistakes in typing the path, such as a missing or extra character, or inconsistent use of forward and back slashes can prevent the operating system from locating the target file. Platform discrepancies also contribute to this issue. Windows, for example, uses backslashes as directory separators, whereas Unix-like systems, such as Linux and MacOS, utilize forward slashes. Manually constructing paths that aren't platform-aware is almost a guarantee of an "OpError". It's also imperative that path casing matches the underlying operating system’s requirements. While Linux filesystems are case-sensitive, Windows filesystems, by default, are not. Discrepancies in naming can also lead to the error.

Insufficient file system permissions constitute another frequent cause. If the process doesn’t have the required permissions to access the file or directory, it’ll result in the “file not found” message, irrespective of whether the file exists or not. This is most often the case in multi-user systems with strict access control settings.

Finally, the target file may simply not be present. Files may have been deleted or moved, renamed, or never actually created. In some situations, network drives may become inaccessible leading to this error for resources thought to be present on a network share. It may also be the case where a file is expected to exist in a temporary directory, however, due to system maintenance or incorrect assumption about the process execution, that directory might not be there.

To clarify these scenarios, consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: Relative Path Issue (Python)**

```python
import os

def read_data(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Attempt to read a data file assuming it is in a 'data' subdirectory
    content = read_data('data/my_data.txt')
    if content:
      print(f"Content read: {content[0:50]}...")
    print(f"Current working directory {os.getcwd()}")
```

In this Python snippet, the function `read_data` attempts to open 'data/my_data.txt'. If you execute this script from a location where no directory named 'data' exists in the current directory or the current working directory is not the same one that has the data folder, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, resulting in printing the error message. The current working directory is logged for verification.

**Example 2: Absolute Path and Platform Variation (Java)**

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Paths;


public class FileRead {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String absolutePath = Paths.get("/home/user/data/config.txt").toString();
        try {
          FileReader fr = new FileReader(absolutePath);
          BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

          String line;
          while((line=br.readLine()) != null)
          {
              System.out.println(line);
          }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

```

Here, the Java code attempts to open a file using an absolute path. This path is hardcoded, which introduces platform dependency. On a Windows machine, this path will be incorrect because the path separator will be an incorrect slash and there is no root directory named `/home`. Additionally, an error will be reported if the 'config.txt' file does not exist in the given location, or the process running the Java program doesn't have permission to open this specific file.

**Example 3: Permission Issues (Bash)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Attempt to read a file owned by root
if cat /root/secure.log; then
    echo "File content printed"
else
  echo "Failed to print file content, check permissions"
fi
```

This Bash script attempts to read a file, `/root/secure.log`, which typically is owned by the root user and inaccessible for users without the required permissions. If the script is executed by a non-root user, the command ‘cat’ will fail with a permission error, which the script detects via the ‘if’ conditional, and will print a message stating the permissions could be the reason of failure. Note that `cat` will print an error in the shell rather than the string being output to the `stdout`. The error message “No such file or directory” can occur in a similar case where the file doesn't exists, or isn't readable to the user.

To mitigate "OpError: The system cannot find the file specified," employing robust path handling strategies is crucial. Using absolute paths wherever practical reduces reliance on the current working directory, ensuring paths resolve correctly regardless of where the program is launched. Dynamically constructing paths that account for OS differences is another good practice. Using methods such as `os.path.join` in Python and `Paths.get()` in Java can automate the handling of forward or backslash, while also ensuring correctness.  Always check the file system for the existence of the file before attempting to operate on it. Error handling should be put into place to detect failed attempts at accessing the file. Finally, carefully manage permissions, particularly in multi-user environments, to guarantee programs have the necessary read and write access.

For further information on troubleshooting this error, I recommend exploring the documentation for your specific programming language or system utilities. Resources explaining filesystem concepts, including absolute vs. relative paths, and the difference in permission models between Windows and Linux operating systems, are also highly beneficial. Books covering OS interaction in programming languages can also prove useful in gaining more knowledge on this area. Consulting online guides that detail file system access with specific scripting languages, like Bash, may help in addressing related errors.
