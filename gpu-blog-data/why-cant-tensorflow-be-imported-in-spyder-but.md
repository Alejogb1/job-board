The inability to import TensorFlow within Spyder while successfully importing it in the command prompt stems primarily from discrepancies in the Python environment context each utilizes. From my experience resolving similar issues across numerous projects involving machine learning and scientific computing, the problem usually points to how Spyder and the command prompt handle Python paths, virtual environments, and package installations differently.

The command prompt, by default, operates within the system’s primary Python environment or the specific environment activated using tools like `conda activate` or `venv/Scripts/activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux. This means any package installation using `pip install` or `conda install` within the active command prompt environment directly updates the associated Python interpreter. This ensures the command prompt session can locate and load the installed TensorFlow library.

Spyder, on the other hand, operates within its own isolated Python environment configuration. Although it uses the system’s default Python interpreter or a user-specified one, it does not necessarily inherit the same active virtual environment context or the precise system path settings. It can run in several ways – using a base interpreter, a user-specified interpreter, or within a dedicated Spyder environment. When TensorFlow is not importable in Spyder, it frequently indicates that the environment configured for Spyder does not have TensorFlow installed, or the environment path settings are incorrect. The issue isn’t that Spyder is inherently incapable of using TensorFlow, but that its operational context has not been properly aligned with the environment where TensorFlow is installed.

The import process relies on Python’s ability to find modules based on a defined search path. The command prompt session’s `sys.path` usually contains entries pointing to the relevant package installation locations (e.g., `site-packages`). Spyder’s interpreter might have a completely different `sys.path`, which may lack these relevant paths or point to different or outdated installations. Furthermore, using a virtual environment within a project isolates dependencies, so that only explicitly installed packages are available. If the user has TensorFlow installed within a virtual environment, and Spyder is using a base interpreter or a different virtual environment, TensorFlow will be unavailable.

To address this, one must ensure that Spyder uses the same Python interpreter and environment where TensorFlow is available. This is achievable by explicitly setting the desired Python interpreter within Spyder’s preferences. If a virtual environment is being used, the correct environment interpreter (with TensorFlow) must be selected as Spyder's active interpreter. Another common point of failure is inconsistent package installation. A `pip install` or `conda install` command in a command prompt might not necessarily install a package into the environment being used by Spyder.

Now, consider some illustrative code examples.

**Example 1: Confirming Python Interpreter Paths**

This first example demonstrates how to display the Python interpreter's path for both the command prompt and Spyder. The purpose is to pinpoint the interpreter being used, and observe any discrepancies.

```python
# In both command prompt (after activating your desired environment) and Spyder
import sys
print(sys.executable)
print(sys.path)
```

Executing this code in the command prompt (within the appropriate environment) and in Spyder allows for a side-by-side comparison of the interpreter paths and search paths. The output of `sys.executable` will indicate which specific Python executable is being used by each system. The output of `sys.path` will display the paths Python uses to look for packages. If these paths differ, especially the location containing the `tensorflow` module, that is a primary source of the import error.  If Spyder uses a different path for `sys.executable`, one needs to either ensure that packages are installed into the Spyder interpreter, or reconfigure Spyder to use the correct interpreter path.

**Example 2: Activating a Virtual Environment Within a Spyder Console**

While Spyder does not directly use shell commands to activate virtual environments, it can be configured to use a specific environment’s interpreter. This example illustrates the idea behind the configuration change rather than code executed within a Spyder console. However, it simulates how Spyder might be configured if a specific virtual environment is being used.

```python
# Hypothetical Spyder configuration equivalent
# Assuming a virtual environment named 'myenv' exists

# Scenario 1: Using the system interpreter (or a different one without TensorFlow)
# Spyder Python interpreter path configured as: /usr/bin/python3 (or similar)
# This would cause the import error

# Scenario 2: Using the 'myenv' interpreter where TensorFlow is installed
# Spyder Python interpreter path configured as:
#  /path/to/myenv/bin/python3 (macOS/Linux)
#  or /path/to/myenv/Scripts/python.exe (Windows)

# In Spyder, we need to manually select the correct path in preferences. Then, upon restart or re-connecting to the Python console, the import will work
# import tensorflow # This import will be successful only when the correct interpreter is selected

```

The core point here is that Spyder needs to point to the Python executable from the correct environment (e.g. `/path/to/myenv/bin/python3`). Simply having a virtual environment will not fix the import error unless Spyder has been explicitly configured to utilize its corresponding interpreter. Within Spyder’s preference settings, look for the option to change the Python interpreter, and enter the path of the appropriate executable. This approach directly addresses the issue of inconsistent environments.

**Example 3: Checking TensorFlow Installation in Spyder**

This example focuses on a diagnostic check directly within Spyder after setting the correct environment. The goal is to definitively confirm that the correct interpreter and TensorFlow installation are being used by Spyder.

```python
# Within Spyder's console, after selecting correct environment
import sys
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
    print("TensorFlow found in sys.path:", any("tensorflow" in p for p in sys.path))
except ImportError:
    print("TensorFlow not found. Ensure correct environment is set.")
```

This script attempts to import TensorFlow and, upon success, prints the version and checks if "tensorflow" is present in the Python search path, `sys.path`. If `ImportError` occurs, it means that even after configuring Spyder, the TensorFlow package cannot be located. This indicates that either the selected interpreter does not have TensorFlow installed, or the installation process did not place it in an accessible path.

In my experience, these troubleshooting steps generally pinpoint the cause of the issue. However, there are some other points to consider. Package management tools such as pip and conda can sometimes exhibit inconsistencies, or get confused between user-level and system-level installs. If problems persists, the virtual environment may be rebuilt from scratch, and packages may be reinstalled within it, before a configuration change is attempted. The environment creation method must be matched to the package installation methods (i.e. using conda environments together with conda, or venv environments together with pip). Spyder sometimes stores cached configurations, so restarting Spyder (even after changing the path in the preferences), may not resolve the issue. In this case, the process should be repeated after restarting Spyder, and potentially clearing any cached configurations.

For further knowledge on these topics, I recommend exploring documentation regarding Python virtual environments, specifically the `venv` module for environment creation and pip for package management, and `conda` environments for environment creation and package installation, and Spyder's documentation concerning interpreter configuration. Further, understanding the details behind Python's module import mechanism, especially the `sys.path` attribute, can provide valuable insights when addressing these types of environment related import errors.
