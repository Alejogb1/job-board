TensorFlow 1.12, while superseded by later versions, offers a robust, albeit less streamlined, approach to custom training.  My experience working on a large-scale image recognition project using this version highlighted the crucial role of `tf.train.Saver` and the manual management of the training loop.  Understanding these elements is paramount for effective custom training within this framework.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Custom training in TensorFlow 1.12 fundamentally involves defining your own training loop, distinct from the higher-level APIs introduced in later versions. This necessitates explicit control over data input pipelines, model definition, loss function calculation, optimizer selection, and the process of saving model checkpoints.  The core components are:

* **Data Pipeline:** You'll need to construct a mechanism to feed data into your model during training. This often involves using `tf.data.Dataset` to create efficient iterators over your training data, potentially incorporating preprocessing steps within the pipeline.  For large datasets, careful management of batch size and prefetching is critical to maximize GPU utilization and training speed.

* **Model Definition:** This entails constructing the computational graph representing your model's architecture. This is typically done using TensorFlow's core operations (e.g., `tf.layers`, `tf.nn`) to define layers and their connectivity.  This stage involves specifying the model's input, hidden layers, and output layers, including activation functions and weight initializations.

* **Loss Function:** The loss function quantifies the discrepancy between your model's predictions and the ground truth labels.  Choosing an appropriate loss function is crucial for successful training. Common choices include mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks and cross-entropy for classification problems.  This is where you would define your objective function that the training process aims to minimize.

* **Optimizer:** The optimizer governs the update process for your model's weights. Popular optimizers include gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop. The choice of optimizer often depends on the characteristics of your data and model.  Configuration of learning rate and other hyperparameters is integral here.

* **Checkpoint Saving:** Regularly saving the model's weights during training allows you to resume training from a previous point or to restore the best-performing model.  `tf.train.Saver` facilitates this process, allowing you to save the entire graph or only specific variables.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define model
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
pred = tf.matmul(X, W) + b

# Define loss function
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(pred - Y))

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss)

# Training loop
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    saver = tf.train.Saver()
    # ... (Data loading and iteration through training data) ...
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... (Feed data to the model and run the optimizer) ...
        _, c = sess.run([optimizer, loss], feed_dict={X: batch_X, Y: batch_Y})
        print("Epoch:", '%04d' % (epoch + 1), "cost=", "{:.9f}".format(c))
        saver.save(sess, 'my_model', global_step=epoch)
```

This example demonstrates a basic linear regression model. The placeholder `X` and `Y` represent input features and target variables, respectively.  The model is defined by a single weight matrix `W` and bias `b`.  The mean squared error is used as the loss function, and gradient descent is used as the optimizer. The `tf.train.Saver` object saves the model's parameters after each epoch.


**Example 2:  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define model
def mlp(x):
  layer1 = tf.layers.dense(x, 128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
  layer2 = tf.layers.dense(layer1, 64, activation=tf.nn.relu)
  output = tf.layers.dense(layer2, num_classes)
  return output

X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, input_dim])
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, [None])
logits = mlp(X)

# Define loss function
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=logits, labels=Y))

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001).minimize(loss)

# Training loop (similar structure to Example 1, including saver)
```

This example extends to a more complex MLP for classification.  `tf.layers` simplifies the definition of dense layers.  Sparse softmax cross-entropy is used as the loss function, suitable for multi-class classification with integer labels. Adam optimizer is employed for potentially faster convergence.  The training loop remains similar in structure, incorporating data feeding and checkpoint saving.


**Example 3:  Custom Layer Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      trainable=True)
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

# ... (rest of the model definition incorporating MyCustomLayer) ...
```

This demonstrates the creation of a custom layer, providing flexibility beyond the standard layers.  The `__init__` method initializes layer parameters.  `build` creates the trainable weight `kernel`, and `call` defines the layer's forward pass computation.  This allows for highly specialized operations within the model architecture.  Integration into the larger training loop remains consistent with previous examples.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.12 documentation provides comprehensive details on its APIs and functionalities.  The book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" offers a practical introduction to TensorFlow, covering fundamental concepts and techniques.  Furthermore, numerous online tutorials and blog posts focusing on TensorFlow 1.x offer valuable insights and practical examples.  Exploring these resources will provide a deeper understanding of the framework and facilitate the implementation of more sophisticated custom training procedures.  Reviewing published research papers on the specific models and applications will provide more advanced strategies for handling nuanced aspects of model design and training optimization.
