In my experience training deep learning models for medical image segmentation, I've frequently encountered negative values during the computation of the Dice Loss, particularly in the initial epochs or when dealing with particularly challenging datasets. This isn't inherently problematic but signals a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the ground truth segmentations, which requires careful understanding and observation rather than immediate alarm. It's a characteristic behavior stemming from the Dice Loss's mathematical formulation and how it interacts with probabilistic model outputs.

The Dice Loss, often used in tasks involving overlapping regions such as segmentation, is defined as one minus the Dice coefficient. The Dice coefficient, in turn, is calculated as `2 * |X ∩ Y| / (|X| + |Y|)`, where X is the predicted segmentation and Y is the ground truth segmentation. For binary segmentation problems, these are typically represented as binary masks. When dealing with probabilistic outputs, as generated by many neural networks, these outputs are typically transformed (e.g., via softmax for multi-class problems or sigmoid for binary ones) and are then often thresholded into hard segmentation masks to match the ground truth masks for the Dice coefficient calculation. In this probabilistic context, especially before the network has learned to produce meaningful outputs, predicted probabilities might have little to no overlap with the actual regions.

The problem arises because, to compute the Dice Loss, we need to work with hard segmentation masks. When the model's output is transformed to a binary mask and that mask bears little or no resemblance to the ground truth, the intersection part of the Dice Coefficient, `|X ∩ Y|`, may approach zero or even become zero. When this intersection is very small, or even zero, while the `|X|` and `|Y|` terms are not zero (representing the size of the predicted and ground truth areas), the resulting Dice coefficient might be very small and close to zero, or in extreme cases zero itself, leading to the loss, which is 1 - Dice coefficient, getting close to 1. However, negative values are possible due to the way PyTorch (or similar frameworks) handles the computational process internally, particularly when working directly with raw predictions before final thresholding.

Consider the typical implementation of dice loss:

```python
import torch

def dice_loss(predicted, target, smooth=1e-6):
  """
  Calculates the Dice Loss for binary segmentation.
  Args:
    predicted (Tensor): Predicted probabilities or logits (before activation).
    target (Tensor): Ground truth binary mask (0 or 1).
    smooth (float): Smoothing factor to avoid division by zero.
  Returns:
    Tensor: Dice Loss value.
  """
  predicted = torch.sigmoid(predicted)  # Ensure predicted values are in [0, 1]
  predicted = (predicted > 0.5).float()   # Convert probabilities to hard masks

  intersection = torch.sum(predicted * target)
  union = torch.sum(predicted) + torch.sum(target)

  dice_coeff = (2.0 * intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)
  loss = 1.0 - dice_coeff
  return loss

# Example 1: Large mismatch
predicted1 = torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64)  # Random prediction (logits)
target1 = torch.randint(0, 2, (1, 1, 64, 64)).float() # Ground Truth mask
loss1 = dice_loss(predicted1, target1)
print(f"Loss 1: {loss1.item()}")
```

In this example,  `predicted1` consists of random values before they are processed by the `torch.sigmoid()` function to yield a probability between 0 and 1. After converting to a binary mask by thresholding, and if the initial random logits were unfavorable, the overlap with the ground truth (`target1`) is likely to be minimal, resulting in a loss close to 1. This situation illustrates the behavior before significant learning. Note, in this version, with a clear thresholding, negative values do not appear directly.

However, the negative losses occur due to internal mechanisms during calculations, especially if you do not apply thresholding before computations. The code example below provides a clue about this behavior:

```python
import torch

def dice_loss_no_threshold(predicted, target, smooth=1e-6):
  """
  Calculates the Dice Loss directly using probabilities.
  Args:
    predicted (Tensor): Predicted probabilities (after sigmoid).
    target (Tensor): Ground truth binary mask (0 or 1).
    smooth (float): Smoothing factor to avoid division by zero.
  Returns:
    Tensor: Dice Loss value.
  """
  # Note: NO THRESHOLDING here

  intersection = torch.sum(predicted * target)
  union = torch.sum(predicted) + torch.sum(target)
  dice_coeff = (2.0 * intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)
  loss = 1.0 - dice_coeff
  return loss

# Example 2: Direct probabilities (potential negative loss)
predicted2 = torch.sigmoid(torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64)) # Probabilities
target2 = torch.randint(0, 2, (1, 1, 64, 64)).float() # Ground Truth
loss2 = dice_loss_no_threshold(predicted2, target2)
print(f"Loss 2: {loss2.item()}")
```

In the above example, notice the absence of the `.float()` thresholding. Instead, the calculation operates directly on the probabilities output by the sigmoid function, which can be any value between 0 and 1. This can cause issues. Consider the formula again: `2 * |X ∩ Y| / (|X| + |Y|)`. The `|X|` and `|Y|` are now the sum of the probability values. If these are close to zero, and by chance, the intersection is computed to be significantly higher than these totals (even though this makes no real world sense in terms of hard segmentation), the resulting Dice coefficient *can become greater than 1* which would translate into a negative Dice loss. This behavior occurs because the function now sums probabilities rather than the binary mask itself, leading to unexpected numerical effects. This is a mathematical artifact and does not represent actual overlap in the segmented regions, but it results in a negative loss.

Another less common situation occurs when the smooth factor is small or zero and, simultaneously, the denominator (union term) becomes extremely small due to small or zero masks on either predicted or target. The following code example demonstrates this.

```python
import torch

def dice_loss_small_denominator(predicted, target, smooth=1e-10):
  """
  Calculates the Dice Loss with a very small smoothing factor.
  Args:
    predicted (Tensor): Predicted probabilities (after sigmoid).
    target (Tensor): Ground truth binary mask (0 or 1).
    smooth (float): Smoothing factor, very small.
  Returns:
    Tensor: Dice Loss value.
  """
  predicted = torch.sigmoid(predicted)
  predicted = (predicted > 0.5).float()

  intersection = torch.sum(predicted * target)
  union = torch.sum(predicted) + torch.sum(target)
  dice_coeff = (2.0 * intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)
  loss = 1.0 - dice_coeff
  return loss

# Example 3: Very small smoothing factor, denominator approaching zero
predicted3 = torch.rand(1, 1, 64, 64) * 0.0001  # Small probability
target3 = torch.randint(0, 2, (1, 1, 64, 64)).float()
loss3 = dice_loss_small_denominator(predicted3, target3)
print(f"Loss 3: {loss3.item()}")
```

In the third example, the predicted values, *after* sigmoid are set to be extremely small. When thresholded, they form an almost all-zero mask. If `target3` also contains very little overlap, then the `union` is very small. This might lead to a large Dice coefficient (due to extremely small values, especially with very small smooth factors) before we subtract from 1, also potentially causing negative loss.

To address these issues in practice, it's vital to observe loss trends carefully and not rely solely on single data point values. Initial negative values during training are usually a sign that the network hasn't learned the data patterns yet. You should monitor the loss trend to ensure it starts to improve as training progresses. Employing proper numerical checks is vital to rule out edge cases due to numerical underflows/overflows. The common solution in training is the use of a thresholded version of the loss function, as in the first code example given. Using a threshold to ensure a binary mask is created before performing any calculations will ensure the value of the dice coefficient is in the range between 0 and 1.

Further, there are techniques to stabilize the learning process, such as using a higher learning rate in the beginning of training or pre-training the model on a large dataset to help learn the general features prior to specialized training.

For resources, I would recommend looking into papers on the Dice Loss itself and the related IOU loss, noting the common numerical instabilities encountered in both. Texts explaining common pitfalls in deep learning, especially those emphasizing mathematical derivations behind the loss function and the practical effects, would also be useful. Online courses dealing with medical image segmentation often provide real-world examples of loss behavior, including troubleshooting scenarios which could provide better insights than general theory. Also, thorough review of official PyTorch documentation, especially on loss functions and tensor operations, is invaluable for understanding the implementation details that cause the observed behavior.
