In my experience developing custom neural networks using PyTorch, encountering `None` when attempting to access the `.grad` attribute of a tensor is a fairly common, and often initially confusing, issue. This typically arises because gradients are not automatically computed for all tensors; rather, PyTorch only computes gradients for tensors that are part of a computation graph that requires gradient tracking. Understanding this implicit graph construction and gradient propagation is essential to debugging why `.grad` might return `None`.

The core reason for this behavior lies in how PyTorch manages memory and computational resources. For computational efficiency, PyTorch only stores information necessary to compute gradients when explicitly told to do so. This behavior is controlled by the `requires_grad` attribute of a tensor, which defaults to `False`. If `requires_grad` is set to `False`, the tensor will not be part of the computational graph, and consequently, no gradients will be calculated for it. When we access the `.grad` attribute of such a tensor, PyTorch returns `None`, indicating that no gradient information is available.

The fundamental process, then, hinges on the concept of a computation graph. In essence, every operation performed on a tensor with `requires_grad=True` creates a node in this dynamic graph, connecting the input tensors to the output tensors through the respective operation. When `backward()` is called on a scalar output of this graph (typically a loss value), PyTorch traverses this graph in reverse, calculating the gradient of the output with respect to all tensors involved in its computation that have `requires_grad=True`. These gradients are accumulated into the `.grad` attribute of the tensors. Consequently, if a tensor is not part of such a graph – either because its `requires_grad` attribute is `False` or it's not involved in the specific calculations that lead to the loss – no gradient will be computed for it, and therefore, `.grad` will return `None`.

Consider the following example illustrating this:

```python
import torch

# Tensor with requires_grad=False (default)
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=False)
# Tensor with requires_grad=True
w = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

# Simple linear operation
y = x * w
# Note: y does NOT inherit requires_grad=True from w since x.requires_grad is False.

# Attempt to compute gradients and access .grad
# Does not have any effect on w, given the lack of loss function.
# In real case, backward would be called on loss
y.sum().backward()

print(f"x.grad: {x.grad}")
print(f"w.grad: {w.grad}")
print(f"y.grad: {y.grad}") # will be None
```

In this code snippet, `x` is created without `requires_grad=True`. Even though `w` has `requires_grad=True`, the result of the multiplication, `y`, does not have gradients computed. The `.grad` attribute of `y` is `None` and `x.grad` is also `None` because no gradients were computed concerning these tensors, while `w.grad` is also `None` as there was no loss function that was propagated, and backward() was just called on y.sum().

Let’s examine a slightly more practical example using a simple model, where we do want to compute gradients for parameters and see them get populated:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(2, 1)

# Input data, requires_grad not needed
inputs = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])

# Target data
targets = torch.tensor([[5.0], [11.0]])

# Loss function
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Forward pass
outputs = model(inputs)
loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

# Backward pass
optimizer.zero_grad()  # Reset gradient accumulation
loss.backward()
optimizer.step() # Updates the weights using the gradients

# Check gradients of model parameters
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"{name}.grad: {param.grad}")
```

Here, the model parameters, which are instances of `torch.Tensor` and are automatically registered to track gradients, will have the `grad` attribute populated by the `backward()` function call because a loss was calculated, and backward() is called on it. The parameters, which are learnable weights and biases, have `requires_grad=True`. The `optimizer.step()` call subsequently updates the model's parameters using these gradients.

Finally, there's the common scenario involving intermediate tensors in a computation that inadvertently loses gradient tracking because of in-place operations, or when a tensor is created from another tensor that doesn't require gradients. In the following example, an intermediate tensor `z` has gradients stripped during the re-assignment:

```python
import torch

w = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

x = w + 1
x = x + 1
x = x + 1
z = x.clone() # preserves x's gradient tracking behavior
y = z * 2
y.sum().backward()
print(f"w.grad: {w.grad}")

w = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

x = w + 1
x += 1
x += 1
y = x * 2
y.sum().backward()
print(f"w.grad: {w.grad}") # gradients will still be present

```

Here, using the augmented assignment `x+=1` strips away the ability to keep the gradient history. Note that, `z` does have gradient, and this is propagated to `y`, and back to `z`. However, we cannot access it directly since it's not a parameter that we're optimizing in this example.

To prevent the `None` gradient problem, it’s important to maintain an awareness of how each tensor's `requires_grad` attribute is set. When creating new tensors from existing ones, understand that if any of the base tensors have `requires_grad=True`, the resulting tensor will often inherit this behavior, unless you explicitly detach, clone, or operate in-place. Additionally, any tensor involved in a computation chain for a loss calculation must have `requires_grad=True`. If `None` is returned for `.grad`, the backward() call may not have been performed, or that tensor is not in the computational graph. Using debugging tools and thoroughly examining the code to see if the computational graph was created is often the most effective method.

I have found resources such as the PyTorch documentation regarding autograd mechanics, particularly the section on how gradients are computed, to be an invaluable resource. Tutorials on building neural networks and understanding the computation graph can provide additional clarity on these principles. Furthermore, books covering deep learning concepts, including backpropagation and automatic differentiation, offer a robust theoretical foundation for understanding how PyTorch computes gradients.
