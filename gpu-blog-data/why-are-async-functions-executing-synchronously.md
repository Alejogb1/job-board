The apparent synchronous behavior of asynchronous functions stems from a misunderstanding of the event loop's interaction with the underlying thread pool and the implications of I/O-bound versus CPU-bound operations.  My experience debugging high-throughput server applications has repeatedly highlighted this crucial distinction.  It's not that the `async` function itself is running synchronously; rather, the *effect* of asynchronicity is being masked by other factors within the application architecture.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Asynchronous functions, defined using `async` and `await` keywords (in Python, for example, though the principles apply across languages with similar constructs), leverage the power of concurrency.  They don't create new threads; instead, they relinquish control to the event loop. When an `await` expression is encountered, the function suspends execution, allowing the event loop to handle other tasks â€“ notably, I/O operations.  The function resumes execution only when the awaited operation completes.  The perceived synchronous behavior arises when the awaited operation is extremely fast, or when the application lacks sufficient concurrency to utilize the asynchronous capabilities fully.

A common scenario where this occurs involves an asynchronous function making a call to a local database or performing a very short computation.  If the database query or computation is completed almost instantly, the time spent awaiting its completion is negligible compared to the function's overall runtime.  The overhead of context switching between tasks becomes more significant than the benefits of asynchronicity.  The result is that, from the perspective of the observer, the function appears to run synchronously, even though it's technically asynchronous.

Another factor is the presence of blocking calls within the asynchronous function.  Any synchronous operation, especially a CPU-bound one (e.g., a complex computation that fully utilizes a CPU core), will block the event loop.  Even if the function is declared `async`, this synchronous blocking will effectively negate the concurrency gains, causing the program's execution to proceed sequentially.  This is why proper design, separating CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks, is vital in harnessing the power of asynchronous programming.  In my experience with large-scale data processing pipelines, this was a frequent source of performance bottlenecks.

Finally, limitations in the system's resources (available threads in the thread pool, for example) can also impact the observable behavior.  If the number of concurrent asynchronous tasks exceeds the capacity of the system to handle them efficiently, the event loop may become overwhelmed, leading to increased wait times and the illusion of synchronous execution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Apparent Synchronous Behavior due to Fast I/O:**

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def fast_io():
    start = time.time()
    await asyncio.sleep(0.001) # Very short delay
    end = time.time()
    print(f"fast_io took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")

async def main():
    start = time.time()
    await fast_io()
    end = time.time()
    print(f"main took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, `asyncio.sleep(0.001)` simulates a very fast I/O operation.  The time taken by `fast_io` will be minimal, making it appear that `main` executes synchronously.  The overhead of the event loop is noticeable, but the overall execution time remains short.

**Example 2:  Blocking Call Negating Asynchronicity:**

```python
import asyncio
import time

def cpu_bound_task(n):
    # Simulate CPU-bound work
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i * i
    return total

async def blocking_async_func():
    start = time.time()
    result = cpu_bound_task(10000000) #Heavy CPU work
    end = time.time()
    print(f"blocking_async_func took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")
    return result


async def main():
    start = time.time()
    result = await blocking_async_func()
    end = time.time()
    print(f"main took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")
    print(f"Result: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, `cpu_bound_task` is a synchronous, CPU-intensive function.  Even within an `async` function, its execution blocks the event loop, nullifying the benefits of asynchronicity.  `main` will wait for `cpu_bound_task` to complete before proceeding.

**Example 3:  Proper Asynchronous Design:**

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def slow_io():
    start = time.time()
    await asyncio.sleep(1) #Simulates a longer operation
    end = time.time()
    print(f"slow_io took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")

async def another_slow_io():
    start = time.time()
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    end = time.time()
    print(f"another_slow_io took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")

async def main():
    start = time.time()
    await asyncio.gather(slow_io(), another_slow_io()) # Concurrent execution
    end = time.time()
    print(f"main took: {end - start:.4f} seconds")

asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage of `asyncio.gather`, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple I/O-bound tasks.  The `main` function will complete approximately in 2 seconds (the time of the longest task), showcasing true asynchronous behavior.  The total execution time is not the sum of individual task times.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   A comprehensive textbook on concurrent and parallel programming.
*   Detailed documentation on your chosen language's asynchronous programming features.
*   Articles and tutorials focusing on asynchronous patterns and best practices.


Understanding the nuances of asynchronous programming, particularly the distinction between I/O-bound and CPU-bound operations, and the proper use of concurrency primitives, is vital for writing efficient and scalable applications.  Ignoring these aspects can lead to performance issues and the illusion of synchronous execution, even when using asynchronous constructs.  Careful profiling and performance analysis are essential in identifying and resolving such bottlenecks.
