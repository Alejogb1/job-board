The crux of `test_split` compatibility hinges on whether X and Y possess matching row counts and whether Y is structured in a way suitable for stratification if requested. I’ve encountered issues countless times where mismatched dimensions between the feature matrix (X) and the target variable(s) (Y), or using a single target variable when stratification requires multiple, have led to errors or unreliable model evaluation. This is a fundamental aspect of proper dataset preparation in machine learning pipelines, and subtle differences can have substantial consequences.

When discussing `test_split`, especially within the context of popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, the primary goal is to partition your dataset into distinct training and testing sets. The 'X' conventionally represents the feature matrix. This is a two-dimensional array, or a similar data structure like a Pandas DataFrame, where each row corresponds to a single data point, and each column represents a specific feature or attribute. The shape of X is typically expressed as (n_samples, n_features), indicating the number of data points and the number of features observed for each data point respectively. Conversely, ‘Y’ typically represents the target variable. It is used to predict or classify during the supervised learning process. The structure of Y can vary, but generally, it must have a length (number of rows) consistent with the number of rows in X. Failure to maintain this consistency will directly lead to errors within `test_split`, because the split would result in mismatched indices between the training and testing sets. Furthermore, the data type of Y becomes important during stratified splits.

Compatibility problems commonly arise in three main scenarios: size mismatches between X and Y, incorrect Y structures for stratified splitting, and errors within Y itself (such as NaN values where the splits cannot determine the proper distribution). Let’s delve into how these manifest and how to correct them.

**Scenario 1: Size Mismatch**

The most basic error occurs when X and Y have different numbers of rows. This discrepancy can result from data loading mistakes, inappropriate preprocessing, or a simple misunderstanding of the shape requirements for input data during training. Imagine you’ve constructed X properly from a data source, but during the process of assigning a target variable you have somehow missed or added records. `test_split` won't work. Here's a demonstration with Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Incorrect Size
X = np.array([[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]])
Y = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # Y has 3 elements instead of 4

try:
    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

#Correct Size
Y_fixed = np.array([0,1,0,1])
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y_fixed, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42)
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}, Y_train shape: {Y_train.shape}")
```

In this code, the first attempt throws a `ValueError` because `test_split` detects the mismatch between the number of samples in X (4) and Y (3). This mismatch prevents the algorithm from correctly associating each data point with its corresponding target. The corrected code resolves this issue by ensuring that the length of Y matches the number of rows in X, enabling a successful execution. The print statement at the end confirms the expected shape for the training sets. The error message returned by the library during the size mismatch is often explicit in its explanation, and it is imperative to address this type of error prior to model training.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Y Structure for Stratified Splitting**

Stratification, in `test_split` is useful when you have imbalanced datasets. You want to ensure that each split contains the same proportion of each category in your target variable. To correctly stratify `test_split` needs the correct shape for your input Y data. For instance, if you were to try to stratify on a regression task with an incorrectly shaped Y variable, this will not work. This is often confused when multiple classification targets are introduced without a correct structure. Suppose you're working on a multi-label classification problem, where a single data point can belong to multiple classes. Stratification in such scenarios requires 'Y' to be a 2D array where each column represents a binary indicator of presence/absence of a class. Consider the following code example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Incorrect Y Structure for stratification
X = np.array([[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]])
Y = np.array([1,2,1,2]) # A single column

try:
    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y, random_state=42)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct Y Structure for stratification
Y_correct = np.array([[1,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,1]]) # Two columns to stratify on
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y_correct, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y_correct, random_state=42)
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}, Y_train shape: {Y_train.shape}")

```

In this instance, the initial attempt to use `stratify = Y` throws a `ValueError`. `test_split` expects that it can perform stratification on all rows, but the single column for Y prevents this. The corrected example converts Y into a two dimensional array where each class is represented in its own column; this allows the algorithm to balance classes across training and testing sets. The output verifies the correct shapes of the training set with the two dimensional target variable.

**Scenario 3: Errors Within Y Data**

While not strictly a compatibility issue between X and Y shapes, the presence of errors within Y, like `NaN` values, can also cause issues in `test_split`. `test_split` operates under the assumption that all values are valid for indexing and categorization, which is a problem when a target variable contains errors. For example, imagine you're working with survey data, and some responses for the target variable are missing. This missing data would be represented by `NaN` values which cannot be used when splitting data.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Errors within Y Data
X = np.array([[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]])
Y = np.array([0, 1, np.nan, 1]) # Y has a NaN value

try:
    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.2, stratify = Y, random_state=42)
except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
# Correct Y (without NaN):
Y_fixed = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y_fixed, test_size = 0.2, stratify = Y_fixed, random_state=42)

print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}, Y_train shape: {Y_train.shape}")
```

The initial attempt to split the data in this example resulted in a value error. The library cannot accurately split or stratify when `NaN` values are present within the Y matrix. The corrected code replaces the NaN value to ensure an error-free operation. Addressing such errors will help in model reliability.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding and to develop a more robust approach, I would recommend a few resources. First, the official documentation of the machine learning library you are using will be your best friend. This document usually includes detailed explanation and examples of correct usage, common errors, and available parameters. Secondly, the documentation on data structures, such as Pandas dataframes or Numpy arrays is essential. Understanding how each is used, and their inherent limitations during model training or data preparation will greatly help. And finally, there are numerous online machine learning courses, some freely available, that focus on proper data handling techniques. These courses go into considerable detail about pre-processing pipelines and correct machine learning practices.

In summary, the compatibility of X and Y for `test_split` is not merely a check of dimensional equality. It involves a comprehensive consideration of the structural requirements and content of both datasets, particularly when stratification is utilized. Thorough understanding of these aspects forms a bedrock for reliable machine learning workflows.
