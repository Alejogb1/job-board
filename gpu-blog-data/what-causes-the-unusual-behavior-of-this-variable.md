The erratic behavior you're observing in your variable stems from a subtle, yet frequently overlooked, aspect of C++'s memory management: the interaction between automatic storage duration, the scope of variables, and the implicit creation and destruction of temporary objects.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my fifteen years developing high-performance trading systems, where even microsecond-level inconsistencies can significantly impact profitability.  The underlying problem frequently manifests as unexpected values or, in more extreme cases, segmentation faults, particularly when dealing with complex objects or function calls returning dynamically allocated memory.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The root cause typically lies in the lifecycle of temporary objects.  When a function returns a value, C++ often creates a temporary object to hold the return value.  This temporary object resides in a temporary memory location, distinct from the memory allocated for your receiving variable.  Crucially, the lifetime of this temporary object is strictly limited to the expression in which it's created.  Once the expression completes, the temporary object's destructor is called, potentially invalidating any references or pointers you've stored referencing the temporary's memory.  This destruction occurs even if you have seemingly "copied" the value into your variable.  Shallow copies, instead of deep copies, are the culprit in such scenarios.  If your variable is a pointer or reference to data within that temporary object, after the temporary's destruction, your variable now points to deallocated memory, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.

This effect is exacerbated when working with objects containing dynamically allocated memory (using `new` or `malloc`).  If the object's destructor doesn't explicitly deallocate that memory, you have a memory leak.  However, even with proper memory management in the destructor, if the object is temporary and a shallow copy is performed, the variable after the assignment ends up referencing deallocated memory after the temporary object's destruction.

Let's illustrate this with examples to clarify the concept.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Shallow Copy with a Simple Class**

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
  int* data;

  MyClass(int val) {
    data = new int(val);
  }

  ~MyClass() {
    delete data;
  }

  //Copy constructor (Shallow copy - the problem!)
  MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
    data = other.data; //Shallow copy: points to the same memory
  }


  int getVal() const { return *data; }
};

MyClass myFunction() {
  MyClass temp(10);
  return temp; // Temporary object created here
}

int main() {
  MyClass myVar = myFunction();
  std::cout << myVar.getVal() << std::endl; // Might crash here or print garbage

  // Further attempts to access myVar.data are dangerous.
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** In this example, `myFunction` returns a `MyClass` object. A temporary object is created. The copy constructor performs a shallow copy, meaning `myVar.data` points to the same memory location as `temp.data`.  Once `myFunction` returns, the temporary `temp` is destroyed, deallocating `temp.data`.  `myVar.data` now points to freed memory, resulting in undefined behavior.

**Example 2:  Correcting the Shallow Copy**

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;

    MyClass(int val) {
        data = new int(val);
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;
    }

    //Deep copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        data = new int(*other.data); //Allocate new memory and copy the value.
    }

    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other){
        if(this != &other){
            delete data;
            data = new int(*other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }


    int getVal() const { return *data; }
};

MyClass myFunction() {
  MyClass temp(10);
  return temp;
}

int main() {
  MyClass myVar = myFunction();
  std::cout << myVar.getVal() << std::endl; //Prints 10 safely.
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This corrected version uses a deep copy constructor and assignment operator.  It allocates new memory for `data` and copies the value, avoiding the dangling pointer issue.  This ensures that `myVar` possesses its own independent copy of the data, unaffected by the destruction of the temporary object.  The assignment operator is also crucial to handle proper assignment.


**Example 3:  Using `std::unique_ptr` for better memory management**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class MyClass {
public:
    int data;

    MyClass(int val) : data(val) {}
    int getVal() const { return data; }
};

std::unique_ptr<MyClass> myFunction() {
  return std::make_unique<MyClass>(10);
}

int main() {
  auto myVar = myFunction();
  std::cout << myVar->getVal() << std::endl; //Prints 10 safely.
  return 0;
}
```


**Commentary:** This example leverages `std::unique_ptr`, a smart pointer that automatically manages memory.  `myFunction` now returns a `unique_ptr`, which transfers ownership to `myVar`.  When `myVar` goes out of scope, its destructor is automatically called, freeing the memory safely without the risk of dangling pointers or manual memory management.  This approach is often preferable for simpler classes, eliminating the need for explicit copy constructors and destructors.

Addressing the issues highlighted above, by employing deep copies, smart pointers, or carefully managing the lifetimes of temporary objects, ensures robust and predictable behavior of your variables, avoiding the pitfalls of dangling pointers and undefined behavior.  Remember that understanding the nuances of memory management is crucial for writing reliable and efficient C++ code, particularly in performance-critical applications.
