An LSTMCell's internal hidden state size does not change based on the batch size during model.fit(). Rather, the *shape* of the hidden state tensor is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the batch size, but the underlying dimensionality, representing the number of hidden units, remains constant as defined during initialization. This distinction is crucial for understanding how recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, handle batches during training.

My experience training various sequence models, often working with time series data, has revealed common misunderstandings surrounding state management in LSTMs. Many assume the hidden state’s dimensionality fluctuates with batch size, leading to errors when manually manipulating states or interpreting outputs. The core mechanism lies in how the recurrent cell applies its learned transformations to inputs and states and how tensors are reshaped to leverage vectorized operations.

Here's a breakdown:

The hidden state, often represented as 'h' in equations, is an internal representation of the cell’s memory. Its dimensionality is determined during cell initialization, when we specify `units` (e.g., `tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=128)`). This ‘units’ argument establishes the size of the hidden vector, such as a vector of 128 elements in this instance. The cell learns how to update this vector using input data and previous state, outputting the new state at each time step of a sequence.

When using a Keras or similar framework’s `model.fit()` function, the provided batch size determines how many sequences are processed in parallel, not the size of the hidden vector. Consequently, the hidden state isn't resized; it's *replicated* across the batch dimension. If you have a hidden state vector of size (128) and a batch size of 32, during forward propagation, the framework will manage the state such that it's shaped as (32, 128). The learned transformations within the LSTM cell are applied to all vectors within that batch in parallel. This is accomplished by operating on tensors with larger dimensions where the first dimension corresponds to batches. Thus, we leverage vectorized, optimized operations in the backend instead of processing each sequence individually.

This distinction avoids costly iterative loops which would be required if batch processing wasn’t used and each sequence were processed individually. Instead of running the LSTM cell 32 times for each of the 32 sequences, we run it only once, but across the batch dimension. Effectively, this means that we are performing the same computations in parallel for each sequence in the batch, leveraging the power of vector and tensor operations.

The shape of tensors representing the hidden and cell states changes to match the batch size by design, optimizing computational efficiency. However, the fundamental, learned dimensionality defined by 'units' remains constant. The batch dimension is merely a means to compute over many sequences simultaneously using tensor operations.

Here are some code examples with commentary:

**Example 1: Basic LSTM with batch dimension management**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the LSTM cell with 64 hidden units
lstm_cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=64)

# Assume batch size is 32, and sequence length is 10
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 10
input_dim = 128
# Create a dummy input of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim)
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim))

# Initialize the hidden state, a vector of 64 elements.
# This is replicated across the batch dimension.
initial_hidden_state = tf.zeros(shape=(batch_size, 64))
initial_cell_state = tf.zeros(shape=(batch_size, 64))

# Perform the forward pass
states = (initial_hidden_state, initial_cell_state)
for t in range(sequence_length):
    output, states = lstm_cell(dummy_input[:, t, :], states)

# Output and final hidden state will have a shape of (batch_size, 64)
print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Output shape: (32, 64)
print("Hidden state shape:", states[0].shape)  # Hidden state shape: (32, 64)
```

*Commentary*: This example illustrates how the state's shape is automatically handled to match the batch dimension. The hidden and cell states are initialized as tensors of zeros with a shape that corresponds to (batch size, units). The LSTM cell's forward pass computes the new states. Note that both the output and the new states have a shape of (32, 64), despite the hidden state originally having a dimensionality of 64. It is the tensor shape, and not the underlying learned features that are changing.

**Example 2: LSTM Layer with Batch Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define an LSTM layer with 128 hidden units
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

# Assume a batch size of 16, sequence length of 20, and input dimension of 64
batch_size = 16
sequence_length = 20
input_dim = 64
# Create dummy input data
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim))

# Get output, last hidden state, and last cell state
output, hidden_state, cell_state = lstm_layer(dummy_input)


# Check the shapes of the output and states
print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Output shape: (16, 20, 128)
print("Hidden state shape:", hidden_state.shape) # Hidden state shape: (16, 128)
print("Cell state shape:", cell_state.shape)  # Cell state shape: (16, 128)
```

*Commentary*: This example demonstrates the usage of an LSTM layer with a batch. The `return_sequences=True` argument outputs the hidden states at every time step, while `return_state=True` also returns the last hidden state and cell state after processing all time steps. The output shape is (16, 20, 128), where 16 is batch size, 20 is sequence length, and 128 is the hidden dimensionality. The hidden state and cell state both have a shape of (16, 128), reflecting the state across the batch dimension after processing all sequences. Again, notice that only the tensor shape is affected by the batch, and not the hidden units of size 128.

**Example 3: Manual state manipulation with batch context**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define an LSTM cell with 32 hidden units
lstm_cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=32)

batch_size = 8
sequence_length = 5
input_dim = 16

# Create dummy input
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim))

# Initialize the hidden and cell states with a batch size of 8.
hidden_state = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 32))
cell_state = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 32))
states = (hidden_state, cell_state)

# Process the input for a single time step
for t in range(sequence_length):
    output, states = lstm_cell(dummy_input[:, t, :], states)

# Final state shape
print("Final hidden state shape:", states[0].shape) # Final hidden state shape: (8, 32)

# Manipulating individual states
new_hidden_state = states[0].numpy()
new_hidden_state[0, :] = np.ones(32)
new_hidden_state = tf.convert_to_tensor(new_hidden_state)

# Verify that hidden state shape is still (8, 32)
new_states = (new_hidden_state, states[1])
for t in range(sequence_length):
    output, new_states = lstm_cell(dummy_input[:, t, :], new_states)

print("Final hidden state shape after manual update:", new_states[0].shape) # Final hidden state shape after manual update: (8, 32)
```

*Commentary*: This example shows how the hidden state is initialized with the batch size in mind, and demonstrates manually updating individual hidden states. The initial hidden state and cell state are initialized to a shape of (8, 32), which corresponds to a batch size of 8 and a hidden dimensionality of 32. A random normal distribution is used here. Crucially, when we alter a specific hidden vector in the batch dimension, the size of the new hidden state and the processed outputs during the second loop remains (8, 32), reflecting the batch context. Manipulating a single sequence’s state within the batch does not alter the hidden unit count.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further study of recurrent neural networks, especially LSTMs, I would recommend several resources. Begin by thoroughly reviewing the Keras documentation on recurrent layers and their configurations. It provides an in-depth look at how layers are instantiated and integrated. Study mathematical texts and lecture notes focusing on sequence modeling and recurrent computation. Furthermore, papers detailing the original LSTM architecture, alongside works expanding on related concepts such as batch normalization and optimization for recurrent nets, offer considerable insight. Examination of open-source codebases of various RNN models can also illuminate practical aspects of state management and tensor operations. Finally, experimental studies, particularly those examining the effect of different hidden sizes and optimization techniques, contribute to a strong conceptual and practical understanding of LSTMs and their use in sequence modeling. These different angles should together provide a more holistic understanding of the dynamic shape of hidden states.
