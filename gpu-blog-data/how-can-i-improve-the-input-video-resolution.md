Improving input video resolution for real-time object detection necessitates a nuanced approach balancing resolution enhancement with the computational constraints of real-time processing.  My experience optimizing object detection pipelines for resource-limited embedded systems has highlighted the critical role of pre-processing techniques and judicious hardware selection in achieving this.  Simply increasing the raw resolution without careful consideration leads to unacceptable latency and potential performance degradation.

The core challenge lies in the inverse relationship between resolution and processing speed.  Higher resolutions result in significantly more pixels, directly increasing the computational burden on the object detection model.  This impacts both inference time (the time taken to process a single frame) and the overall frame rate, making real-time operation difficult or impossible.  Therefore, the strategy should not focus solely on brute-force resolution upscaling, but rather on a multi-faceted approach that enhances effective resolution while managing computational costs.

**1.  Pre-processing for Enhanced Resolution:**

Instead of directly increasing the input video resolution, focusing on pre-processing techniques to improve image quality before object detection proves more effective.  These techniques aim to enhance crucial features relevant to the detection model without significantly increasing the pixel count.  Super-resolution techniques, while computationally expensive when applied directly to the full-resolution video, can be strategically applied.

One effective approach I've found involves applying super-resolution only to regions of interest (ROIs) identified by a lower-resolution, faster preliminary detection. A lightweight model processes the lower-resolution stream to pinpoint potential object locations. These ROIs are then upscaled using a super-resolution algorithm before being passed to the main object detection model. This selective upscaling dramatically reduces computational load compared to upscaling the entire frame.

**2.  Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Region of Interest (ROI) Based Upscaling using OpenCV:**

```python
import cv2

# Load pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5s) for ROI detection
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromONNX("yolo-v5s.onnx")

# Load super-resolution model (e.g., ESRGAN)
sr = cv2.dnn_superres.DnnSuperResImpl_create()
sr.readModel("ESRGAN_x4.pb")
sr.setModel("esrgan", 4)

# Video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Object detection on lower-resolution frame
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255, (640, 480), swapRB=True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    outs = net.forward(net.getUnconnectedOutLayersNames())
    # ... (Process outputs to get bounding boxes of ROIs) ...

    for x, y, w, h in rois:
        roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        upscaled_roi = sr.upsample(roi)
        frame[y:y+h, x:x+w] = upscaled_roi

    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```

This example demonstrates a pipeline where a smaller model identifies ROIs, these regions are upscaled, and then passed to the main detection model (the code is simplified to focus on the upscaling process).  The choice of the smaller and super resolution models is crucial for real-time performance.

**Example 2:  Bilinear Upsampling for a Balanced Approach:**

For less computationally intensive scenarios, simple bilinear upsampling can be sufficient.  While not as visually appealing as more sophisticated techniques, it offers a good balance between computational cost and resolution improvement.

```python
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Upscale using bilinear interpolation
    upscaled_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (frame.shape[1]*2, frame.shape[0]*2), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)

    # ... (Object detection on upscaled_frame) ...

    cv2.imshow('upscaled_frame', upscaled_frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This approach directly upsamples the input frame, which increases the workload for the object detection model, but it's significantly less computationally expensive than learning-based super-resolution.

**Example 3: Utilizing Hardware Acceleration:**

Optimizing performance often requires leveraging hardware acceleration capabilities.  Modern GPUs and specialized hardware such as Intel Movidius NCS or NVIDIA Jetson series offer substantial speedups for both object detection and image processing.

```python
# This example focuses on framework selection, not specific code.
# This would require utilizing frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile with GPU/VPU support.

# Choose appropriate framework and hardware
# Load object detection model optimized for target hardware
# Pre-process input (potential upsampling included)
# Run inference on target hardware

# ... (Process outputs and display results) ...

```

The choice of hardware and framework (TensorFlow Lite, OpenVINO, PyTorch Mobile) is critical here.  Each offers different levels of optimization for various hardware architectures.  The example above outlines the general structure; detailed implementation depends on the selected hardware and framework.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of super-resolution techniques,  research papers on ESRGAN, Real-ESRGAN, and other deep learning-based methods are invaluable.  Understanding the trade-offs between different upsampling methods (bilinear, bicubic, etc.) is essential for efficient implementation.  Finally, exploring the documentation for OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, and PyTorch Mobile will be crucial for optimizing the code for specific hardware targets.  Consulting publications on embedded systems and real-time processing will provide additional context on optimizing for resource-constrained environments.
