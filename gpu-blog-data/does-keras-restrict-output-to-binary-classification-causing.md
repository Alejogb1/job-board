Keras, by itself, does not restrict output to binary classification, and observing a model’s accuracy dropping to zero for non-binary targets likely indicates a configuration issue rather than an inherent limitation within the framework. My experience building various classification models, ranging from image recognition to natural language processing, reinforces this. I've witnessed this particular behavior, typically tracing back to inappropriate loss functions or output layer activations being used for multi-class problems as though they were binary.

The core of the matter lies in how Keras handles different classification types through the selection of the final layer activation and the loss function. Binary classification, dealing with two exclusive classes, relies heavily on the sigmoid activation function, outputting a probability between 0 and 1. This probability is typically interpreted as the likelihood of belonging to the positive class. The corresponding loss function here is usually binary cross-entropy, which measures the dissimilarity between predicted and true probabilities.

However, multi-class classification, involving more than two mutually exclusive classes, requires a different approach. The standard practice shifts to using the softmax activation function in the output layer. Softmax produces a probability distribution over all possible classes, where each value represents the probability of the input belonging to that specific class. Crucially, these probabilities sum to one across all classes. Paired with this, categorical cross-entropy (or sparse categorical cross-entropy if using integer labels instead of one-hot encoding) becomes the appropriate loss function.

Failing to adjust these two components appropriately when dealing with multi-class datasets is a common cause of zero accuracy or similarly poor model performance. Treating a multi-class problem as if it were binary forces the model to squeeze the output into a single probability, a task it fundamentally cannot handle correctly. The resulting predictions become virtually meaningless and hence, the accuracy collapses to zero. The issue isn't about the inherent capabilities of Keras, but rather a mismatch between the chosen model configuration and the nature of the data.

Here are some illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Configuration for Multi-class using Sigmoid and Binary Cross-entropy**

This example attempts to classify images into three classes using a model intended for binary classification:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Example 3-class data - typically one-hot encoded, shown here for brevity.
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 3, 100)

# Incorrect Model configuration
model_incorrect = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Binary output!
])

# Incorrect loss function
model_incorrect.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# y_train needs to be one-hot encoded if using categorical_crossentropy
# Using integer labels is more common with sparse_categorical_crossentropy 
# for multi-class

model_incorrect.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0) # Accuracy drops very low

# Demonstrating the problem
_, accuracy = model_incorrect.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Accuracy with incorrect setup: {accuracy:.4f}")

```

In this setup, I use a sigmoid activation, implying that the output represents a single probability – designed for two classes. I coupled it with binary cross-entropy as the loss function, which is incompatible with the multi-class target. When fit on data containing three classes (0, 1, and 2), the accuracy will converge to a very low value, often near zero. Keras is not restricting the output, it is simply following the defined model architecture, which is, in this case, incorrect.

**Example 2: Correct Configuration for Multi-class using Softmax and Categorical Cross-entropy**

This example demonstrates how to correctly configure a model for the same 3-class dataset as above:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Example 3-class data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 3, 100)

# Convert to one-hot encoding for categorical_crossentropy
y_train_encoded = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=3)


# Correct Model configuration
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Multi-class output, 3 nodes
])

# Correct loss function and metrics
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model_correct.fit(X_train, y_train_encoded, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Demonstrating the correct performance
_, accuracy = model_correct.evaluate(X_train, y_train_encoded)
print(f"Accuracy with correct setup: {accuracy:.4f}")

```

Here, I use softmax activation in the output layer, producing three outputs, which sum to one, each interpreted as the probability of the respective class. The corresponding loss function is categorical cross-entropy, designed to compare these probability distributions. By making these correct choices, the model will be able to learn patterns in the multi-class data and demonstrate a good accuracy rate.

**Example 3: Correct Configuration for Multi-class using Softmax and Sparse Categorical Cross-entropy**

This example demonstrates an alternative approach, utilizing sparse categorical cross-entropy for the same dataset as the previous two examples. It does not require one-hot encoding of target labels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Example 3-class data (integer labels)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 3, 100)

# Correct Model configuration
model_sparse = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Multi-class output, 3 nodes
])

# Correct loss function for integer labels
model_sparse.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model_sparse.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Demonstrating the correct performance
_, accuracy = model_sparse.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Accuracy with sparse setup: {accuracy:.4f}")

```

The primary difference from Example 2 lies in utilizing the `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function instead of `categorical_crossentropy`. This obviates the need to one-hot encode the target data (`y_train`), as this loss function works with integer class labels directly. Both loss functions are equally valid, and the choice between them is often based on data preprocessing requirements. Both result in effective training.

In summary, the reduction of accuracy to zero is almost always caused by incorrect model configuration rather than any inherent limitations within Keras. It is imperative to use the appropriate activation functions (e.g., softmax for multi-class, sigmoid for binary) and the corresponding loss functions (e.g., categorical cross-entropy, sparse categorical cross-entropy or binary cross-entropy).

For further learning, I recommend exploring the following resources to solidify your understanding of loss functions and activation layers in deep learning: the official TensorFlow Keras documentation; textbooks on deep learning that discuss classification problems; and online courses that cover supervised learning and neural network fundamentals. Focusing on the interplay between model architecture, loss function, and activation, you can resolve these issues and build effective models with Keras for both binary and multi-class classification.
