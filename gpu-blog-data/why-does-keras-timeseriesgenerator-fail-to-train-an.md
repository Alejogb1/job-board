The fundamental reason a Keras `TimeseriesGenerator` might impede LSTM training while a dense neural network (DNN) succeeds often lies in the way the generator structures time-series data, specifically its impact on the LSTM's sequential learning. I've observed this behavior repeatedly in projects involving forecasting energy consumption, where subtle temporal dependencies are critical, while coarser time-aggregated features lend themselves to DNN approaches. The issue isn't an inherent flaw in `TimeseriesGenerator`, but rather its potential to produce data sequences that are either insufficient in length or inconsistent for effective LSTM learning, while such shortcomings may not hinder a DNN.

The core functionality of an LSTM relies on its internal memory cells to retain information over time, thus capturing temporal patterns within a sequence. `TimeseriesGenerator`, by design, generates sliding windows of data sequences. These sequences, if improperly configured, can disrupt the LSTM's ability to learn the underlying temporal dynamics. A DNN, on the other hand, processes data samples independently, and is less impacted by poorly structured sequences. It doesn’t maintain state between training instances.

Consider a scenario where the time series data represents hourly temperature fluctuations. If the `length` parameter of `TimeseriesGenerator` is set too low (e.g., 2 hours), the sequences passed to the LSTM might be too short to capture meaningful daily patterns (diurnal cycles). Consequently, the LSTM struggles to correlate past data with present and future trends. A DNN operating on the same data, however, would learn to associate individual hourly values with target values; its learning relies less on the relationships *between* data points in the sequence and more on the relationship of *each* data point with its corresponding label.

The crucial point here is that the LSTM needs a *sufficient* context window, both in length and information, to leverage its sequential learning capabilities. The `stride` parameter, which controls the sampling frequency within the generator, also plays a significant role. A large `stride` might skip important segments of the time series, potentially breaking the temporal continuity necessary for effective LSTM training. Conversely, a DNN treats each input as an independent sample, making it largely immune to the issues caused by the `length` and `stride` choices.

Let's illustrate this with code examples. I'll use a synthetic temperature dataset to demonstrate the problem:

**Code Example 1: Inadequate Sequence Length for LSTM**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import TimeseriesGenerator
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Generate synthetic temperature data (24 hours, one year)
data = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 365 * 2 * np.pi, 24 * 365)).reshape(-1, 1) # daily cycle
targets = np.sin(np.linspace(np.pi/2, 365 * 2 * np.pi + np.pi/2, 24*365)).reshape(-1, 1)

# Data split for training
train_size = int(len(data) * 0.8)
train_data = data[:train_size]
train_targets = targets[:train_size]

# Define data generator with short length
length = 3 # very small time window, 3 time steps
batch_size = 32
generator = TimeseriesGenerator(train_data, train_targets, length=length, batch_size=batch_size)

# Define LSTM model
model_lstm = Sequential()
model_lstm.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(length, 1)))
model_lstm.add(Dense(1))
model_lstm.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training attempt
history_lstm = model_lstm.fit(generator, epochs=10, verbose=0)
print(f"LSTM Training Loss (Short sequence): {history_lstm.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")

#DNN Approach for comparison

# Define DNN Model
model_dnn = Sequential()
model_dnn.add(Dense(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)))
model_dnn.add(Dense(1))
model_dnn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')


#Reshape data to make it compatible with DNN input shape

train_data_dnn = train_data[:-length]
train_targets_dnn = train_targets[length:]
history_dnn = model_dnn.fit(train_data_dnn, train_targets_dnn, epochs=10, batch_size = batch_size, verbose=0)

print(f"DNN Training Loss: {history_dnn.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")
```
In this example, the `length` parameter is set to 3, which creates sequences that are too short to capture the daily trends. While the DNN makes a reasonable prediction (because each element of the input data and target data is close in the time-series), the LSTM, being trained on short windows of data, yields an inferior result as shown by the training loss. This demonstrates the challenge the LSTM faces with insufficient temporal context, which does not impact the DNN due to the architecture’s inherent lack of sequence awareness. The sequential nature of the time series data is not properly represented for the LSTM.

**Code Example 2: Improved Sequence Length for LSTM**
```python
# Updated generator with longer length
length_long = 24  # One day's worth of data.
generator_long = TimeseriesGenerator(train_data, train_targets, length=length_long, batch_size=batch_size)

# Train with increased sequence length
model_lstm_long = Sequential()
model_lstm_long.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(length_long, 1)))
model_lstm_long.add(Dense(1))
model_lstm_long.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

history_lstm_long = model_lstm_long.fit(generator_long, epochs=10, verbose=0)

print(f"LSTM Training Loss (Long sequence): {history_lstm_long.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")
```
Here, by increasing the `length` parameter to 24 (representing a complete day), the LSTM now receives input sequences that capture more meaningful temporal patterns. The model’s improved training loss exemplifies the benefit of an adequate context window. This highlights the importance of choosing the proper length hyperparameter for sequential model learning. The DNN training from the previous example is still viable, as it is not affected by the temporal dependency structure.

**Code Example 3: Incorrect stride leading to data fragmentation**

```python
# Update generator with longer length
length_long = 24  # One day's worth of data.
stride_large = 8 # Example with a large stride
generator_stride = TimeseriesGenerator(train_data, train_targets, length=length_long, batch_size=batch_size, stride=stride_large)

# Train with a large stride value
model_lstm_stride = Sequential()
model_lstm_stride.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(length_long, 1)))
model_lstm_stride.add(Dense(1))
model_lstm_stride.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

history_lstm_stride = model_lstm_stride.fit(generator_stride, epochs=10, verbose=0)

print(f"LSTM Training Loss (Large Stride): {history_lstm_stride.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")
```

In this example, I've used a `stride` value of 8. While the `length` parameter is set appropriately, using a large `stride` causes the data sequences passed to the LSTM to be disjointed; that is, they do not represent a smoothly evolving time-series. This is detrimental to learning temporal dependencies, and the training loss may not reduce as much compared to the previous example. The problem is that there is a lack of continuous temporal connection between successive samples. This doesn’t affect the DNN, since it treats individual datapoints as independent of one another.

To effectively train LSTMs with `TimeseriesGenerator`, I recommend careful consideration of the following:

1.  **Context window size:** The `length` parameter must be set to a value that allows the LSTM to learn relevant temporal dependencies. If the expected patterns are daily, then `length` should at least represent a whole day.
2.  **Stride Frequency:** The `stride` parameter should be chosen such that there is enough data for the LSTM to learn from, without skipping meaningful patterns. Avoid large values that might skip vital context.
3.  **Data Normalization:** Normalize time series data before passing it to the generator. This can help the LSTM converge faster and avoid large activation values during training.
4.  **Data Characteristics:** Understand the time series itself. Ensure the `length` and `stride` parameters are consistent with the time dependencies inherent in the data. For example, if there are very high frequency changes, the `stride` must be small to capture these fluctuations, otherwise information will be skipped.

For further exploration, I recommend examining resources covering time-series analysis, specifically focusing on LSTM networks. Research materials explaining hyperparameter tuning for LSTMs can be useful, and looking into best practices for data pre-processing for deep learning models are essential. Furthermore, studying advanced techniques like windowing methods can provide further depth of knowledge for preparing time-series data. It’s critical to understand how changes to these parameters impact the temporal relationships that LSTMs rely on for effective training.
