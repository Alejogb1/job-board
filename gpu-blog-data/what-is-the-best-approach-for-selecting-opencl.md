The optimal OpenCL hardware target selection hinges critically on understanding the interplay between application requirements, available hardware capabilities, and the inherent limitations of the OpenCL runtime environment.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications across diverse platforms has underscored the importance of a systematic approach, rather than relying on heuristics or simplistic benchmarks.  Effective target selection necessitates a deep dive into device properties, workload characteristics, and potential performance bottlenecks.

**1.  A Comprehensive Understanding of Device Properties:**

Before embarking on target selection, a thorough assessment of available OpenCL devices is paramount.  This involves querying the OpenCL runtime for relevant device parameters.  These parameters, readily accessible through the OpenCL API, are crucial for informed decision-making.  Key attributes include:

* **Device Type:** This identifies the nature of the computing unit (CPU, GPU, Accelerator).  Each type exhibits unique architectural characteristics affecting performance.  CPUs generally offer greater general-purpose computing capabilities, while GPUs excel in massively parallel computations.  Accelerators, such as FPGAs, provide a spectrum of customization options but require specialized programming expertise.

* **Max Compute Units:**  This indicates the number of parallel processing units available on the device.  More compute units generally translate to higher throughput for parallel workloads.

* **Max Work Group Size:** This specifies the maximum number of work-items that can be executed concurrently within a single work-group.  Optimizing work-group size to align with the device architecture is pivotal for maximizing performance.

* **Global Memory Size:**  This parameter defines the total amount of memory accessible to the entire kernel execution.  Sufficient global memory is essential for avoiding performance-crippling memory transfers.

* **Local Memory Size:** This represents the memory space dedicated to each work-group.  Effective utilization of local memory can significantly reduce memory access latencies.

* **Clock Frequency:** This determines the speed at which the processing units operate. Higher clock frequencies generally lead to faster execution times, but other factors, such as memory bandwidth and architecture, must also be considered.

* **Memory Bandwidth:** The rate at which data can be transferred to and from the device memory plays a significant role in overall performance.  High bandwidth is particularly important for data-intensive applications.


**2.  Code Examples Illustrating Device Query and Selection:**

The following code examples (using C++) demonstrate how to query device properties and select an appropriate target based on specific criteria.

**Example 1: Basic Device Information Retrieval:**

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  cl_platform_id platform;
  clGetPlatformIDs(1, &platform, NULL);

  cl_device_id device;
  clGetDeviceIDs(platform, CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, 1, &device, NULL);


  cl_ulong max_compute_units;
  clGetDeviceInfo(device, CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS, sizeof(max_compute_units), &max_compute_units, NULL);
  std::cout << "Max Compute Units: " << max_compute_units << std::endl;

  // Similar queries for other parameters (e.g., global memory size, clock frequency) can be added here.


  return 0;
}
```

This example shows a basic retrieval of the maximum compute units.  Similar queries for other parameters like global memory, local memory, and clock frequency can be added by replacing `CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS` with the appropriate parameter.

**Example 2: Selecting a Device Based on Compute Units:**

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  // ... (Platform and device ID retrieval as in Example 1) ...

  cl_device_id selected_device = NULL;
  cl_uint num_devices;
  clGetDeviceIDs(platform, CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, 0, NULL, &num_devices);
  std::vector<cl_device_id> devices(num_devices);
  clGetDeviceIDs(platform, CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, num_devices, devices.data(), NULL);

  cl_ulong max_compute_units;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_devices; ++i){
      clGetDeviceInfo(devices[i], CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS, sizeof(max_compute_units), &max_compute_units, NULL);
      if (max_compute_units > 10){ //Select device with more than 10 compute units
          selected_device = devices[i];
          break;
      }
  }

  if (selected_device == NULL){
      std::cout << "No suitable device found." << std::endl;
  } else {
      std::cout << "Selected device with more than 10 compute units." << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a selection criterion based on the number of compute units. A threshold of 10 is used here â€“ this should be adjusted based on the application's computational needs.

**Example 3:  Prioritizing GPU Devices:**

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  // ... (Platform and device ID retrieval as in Example 1) ...

  cl_device_id selected_device = NULL;
  cl_uint num_devices;
  clGetDeviceIDs(platform, CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, 0, NULL, &num_devices);
  std::vector<cl_device_id> devices(num_devices);
  clGetDeviceIDs(platform, CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, num_devices, devices.data(), NULL);

  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_devices; ++i) {
    cl_device_type device_type;
    clGetDeviceInfo(devices[i], CL_DEVICE_TYPE, sizeof(device_type), &device_type, NULL);
    if (device_type == CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU) {
      selected_device = devices[i];
      break;
    }
  }

  if (selected_device == NULL) {
    std::cout << "No GPU device found.  Falling back to CPU." << std::endl;
    //  Select a CPU device as a fallback if no GPU is available.
    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_devices; ++i) {
      cl_device_type device_type;
      clGetDeviceInfo(devices[i], CL_DEVICE_TYPE, sizeof(device_type), &device_type, NULL);
      if (device_type == CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU) {
        selected_device = devices[i];
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  //Proceed using the 'selected_device'
    if (selected_device != NULL){
        std::cout << "Selected device successfully" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No suitable device found" << std::endl;
    }

  return 0;
}
```

This example prioritizes GPU devices. If no GPU is detected, it falls back to a CPU device. This strategy ensures functionality even when a preferred GPU is unavailable. Remember to handle error conditions appropriately in a production environment.


**3.  Resource Recommendations:**

The Khronos OpenCL specification provides a comprehensive overview of the API and device capabilities.  Furthermore, several books dedicated to high-performance computing with OpenCL offer in-depth discussions on device selection and optimization strategies.  Consult the relevant OpenCL documentation, which contains precise details about error codes and device properties.  Additionally, studying detailed performance analysis tools can greatly aid in fine-tuning your target selection based on runtime profiling data.  Familiarize yourself with the intricacies of various GPU and CPU architectures to understand the implications of your choices.  A solid grasp of parallel programming concepts is fundamental for effective OpenCL development.
