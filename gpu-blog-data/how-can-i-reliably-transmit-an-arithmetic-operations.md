The core challenge in reliably transmitting an arithmetic operation's result using `DataOutputStream` lies not in the stream itself, but in the inherent ambiguity of representing numerical data types across different architectures and Java Virtual Machines (JVMs).  While `DataOutputStream` provides methods for writing primitive data types, the lack of explicit type information necessitates careful consideration of data encoding and endianness.  In my experience working on distributed systems, overlooking these subtleties has led to subtle, yet devastating, data corruption issues.

My approach prioritizes a robust, platform-independent solution leveraging explicit type encoding.  Instead of directly writing the result of an arithmetic operation, I encapsulate the result along with its data type within a custom serialization scheme. This ensures that the receiving end correctly interprets the data, regardless of the underlying system's architecture or JVM implementation.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The proposed solution utilizes a simple yet effective approach:  Before writing the numerical result to the `DataOutputStream`, I prepend it with a single byte representing the data type.  This acts as a type identifier, disambiguating between different numerical types (e.g., `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`).  The receiver reads this type identifier first, and uses it to guide its deserialization process, thereby avoiding incorrect type casting and subsequent errors.

This approach addresses endianness concerns by implicitly enforcing a consistent byte order.  The byte representing the data type is written first and remains consistent across platforms.  While the numerical data itself might differ in byte order depending on the systemâ€™s architecture (big-endian vs. little-endian), this variation is handled correctly because the receiver knows precisely which data type to expect and can perform appropriate byte ordering adjustments if necessary.

Furthermore, using a dedicated type identifier extends this solution to encompass potential future expansion.  Adding support for new data types only requires adding new type identifiers and updating the serialization/deserialization logic accordingly, without affecting the core functionality.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Integer Transmission**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataOutputStreamArithmetic {

    public static void sendInteger(DataOutputStream dos, int result) throws IOException {
        dos.writeByte(1); // Type identifier: 1 for integer
        dos.writeInt(result);
    }

    public static int receiveInteger(DataInputStream dis) throws IOException {
        byte type = dis.readByte();
        if (type == 1) {
            return dis.readInt();
        } else {
            throw new IOException("Unexpected data type received.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(baos);
        int result = 12345;
        sendInteger(dos, result);
        dos.flush();

        ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());
        DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(bais);
        int receivedResult = receiveInteger(dis);
        System.out.println("Received Integer: " + receivedResult); // Output: 12345
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates sending and receiving an integer.  The `writeByte(1)` method explicitly states the data type before the integer itself is sent.  Error handling ensures robustness by raising an exception if an unexpected type is encountered.  Using `ByteArrayOutputStream` and `ByteArrayInputStream` for testing simplifies the process and makes it independent of file I/O.


**Example 2: Double Precision Floating Point Transmission**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataOutputStreamArithmetic { // Extended class for clarity

    // ... (sendInteger and receiveInteger methods from Example 1 remain unchanged) ...

    public static void sendDouble(DataOutputStream dos, double result) throws IOException {
        dos.writeByte(2); // Type identifier: 2 for double
        dos.writeDouble(result);
    }

    public static double receiveDouble(DataInputStream dis) throws IOException {
        byte type = dis.readByte();
        if (type == 2) {
            return dis.readDouble();
        } else {
            throw new IOException("Unexpected data type received.");
        }
    }

    // ... (main method can be extended to test double transmission) ...
}
```

This extends the previous example to include double precision floating-point numbers.  A new type identifier (2) is used to differentiate it from integers.  The `writeDouble` and `readDouble` methods handle the transmission accordingly. The consistency in the error handling is critical for robust code.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Data Types**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataOutputStreamArithmetic { // Further extended class

    // ... (Previous methods remain unchanged) ...


    public static void sendData(DataOutputStream dos, Object data) throws IOException {
        if (data instanceof Integer) {
            sendInteger(dos, (Integer) data);
        } else if (data instanceof Double) {
            sendDouble(dos, (Double) data);
        } else {
            throw new IOException("Unsupported data type: " + data.getClass());
        }
    }

    public static Object receiveData(DataInputStream dis) throws IOException {
        byte type = dis.readByte();
        switch (type) {
            case 1: return receiveInteger(dis);
            case 2: return receiveDouble(dis);
            default: throw new IOException("Unexpected data type received.");
        }
    }
    // ... (main method updated to test multiple types) ...
}
```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of the type-identifier approach. The `sendData` method now handles both integers and doubles, illustrating the extensibility of this method. This avoids tightly coupling the client and server to specific data types, which enhances maintainability and scalability.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of data serialization in Java, I recommend exploring the official Java documentation on `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream`,  a comprehensive text on network programming, and a reference book focusing on Java's I/O APIs.  Furthermore, reviewing articles and documentation on big-endian and little-endian architectures will provide invaluable context for understanding the importance of byte order handling in cross-platform data transmission.  Studying best practices for exception handling in Java will also ensure the robustness of any implemented solution.
