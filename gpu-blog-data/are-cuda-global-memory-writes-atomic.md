CUDA global memory writes are not atomic.  This is a fundamental limitation stemming from the architecture's parallel nature and the need for high throughput.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications on NVIDIA GPUs has consistently highlighted the criticality of understanding this non-atomicity.  Failure to account for this can lead to race conditions and unpredictable results, severely impacting the correctness and reliability of your code.


**1. Explanation of Non-Atomic Behavior**

Global memory in CUDA resides in the GPU's relatively slow DRAM.  To achieve high bandwidth, multiple threads can access and modify global memory concurrently.  However, the hardware doesn't guarantee atomic operations on arbitrary memory locations without explicit synchronization mechanisms.  An atomic operation is one that appears to execute indivisibly; it completes entirely without interruption from other threads.  If multiple threads attempt to write to the same global memory location simultaneously without synchronization, the final result is indeterminate.  The outcome depends on factors like thread scheduling, memory controller behavior, and even microarchitectural details which are not predictable or portable across different GPU generations or models.  The behavior might appear consistent in certain scenarios due to fortuitous scheduling, but reliance on such behavior is erroneous and will almost certainly lead to problems as your application scales or runs on different hardware.  This differs significantly from shared memory, where atomic operations are provided by the hardware for efficiency in thread cooperation within a warp.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the non-atomic behavior and how to mitigate it using appropriate synchronization techniques.

**Example 1: Race Condition in Global Memory Write**

```c++
__global__ void incorrect_summation(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    atomicAdd(&data[0], i); // Appears atomic, but is NOT in global memory
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...
  int *d_data;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, sizeof(int));
  *d_data = 0; // Initialize to 0

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  incorrect_summation<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N);

  // ... error-prone result retrieval ...
  int host_result;
  cudaMemcpy(&host_result, d_data, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  // host_result will likely be incorrect due to race condition

  // ...cudaFree(d_data)...
  return 0;
}
```

This code attempts to sum numbers using `atomicAdd`. While `atomicAdd` is provided, its atomicity only applies to the *atomic operation itself*  â€“  in this case, adding a value. However, the memory location involved, `data[0]`, is still in global memory, making it susceptible to race conditions if multiple threads are concurrently accessing this memory location.


**Example 2: Correct Summation with Atomic Operations (Limited Scope)**

```c++
__global__ void correct_summation_atomic(int *data, int N, int *partialSums) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
      int sum = 0;
      // Simulate some work
      for(int j = 0; j < 100; ++j){
          sum += i;
      }

      atomicAdd(&partialSums[blockIdx.x], sum);
  }
}

int main() {
    // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...
    int *d_data, *d_partialSums;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, sizeof(int) * N);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_partialSums, sizeof(int) * blocksPerGrid);

    // ... kernel launch ...
    int finalSum = 0;
    cudaMemcpy(&d_partialSums, 0, sizeof(int) * blocksPerGrid, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    correct_summation_atomic<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N, d_partialSums);

    int *h_partialSums = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * blocksPerGrid);
    cudaMemcpy(h_partialSums, d_partialSums, sizeof(int) * blocksPerGrid, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < blocksPerGrid; ++i)
        finalSum += h_partialSums[i];

    // ... cleanup ...
    return 0;
}

```

This improved example uses atomic operations in a more controlled manner. Each block accumulates its own partial sum atomically into a dedicated location in `partialSums`, which is then summed up on the host. This avoids race conditions inherent in Example 1, but still has limitations. It requires pre-allocated space to accumulate partial sums.


**Example 3: Correct Summation with Reduction (Optimal Approach)**

```c++
__global__ void summation_reduction(int *data, int N, int *sums, int block_size) {
    extern __shared__ int sdata[];
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int sum = 0;

    if (i < N) {
        sum = data[i];
    }
    sdata[threadIdx.x] = sum;
    __syncthreads();


    for (int s = block_size / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
        if (threadIdx.x < s) {
            sdata[threadIdx.x] += sdata[threadIdx.x + s];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        sums[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
    }
}
int main() {
  // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...
  int *d_data, *d_sums;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, sizeof(int)*N);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_sums, sizeof(int)*blocksPerGrid);

  summation_reduction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock * sizeof(int)>>>(d_data, N, d_sums, threadsPerBlock);

  int finalSum = 0;
  int *h_sums = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * blocksPerGrid);
  cudaMemcpy(h_sums, d_sums, sizeof(int) * blocksPerGrid, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  for(int i = 0; i < blocksPerGrid; i++){
      finalSum += h_sums[i];
  }

  // ... cleanup ...
  return 0;
}

```

This example uses a reduction algorithm in shared memory, which is significantly faster than global memory atomic operations. The reduction is performed within each block, using shared memory for efficient communication between threads.  The final sums from each block are then accumulated on the host. This approach avoids the atomicity issue entirely by performing the summation efficiently within the confines of the shared memory.  Note: shared memory is limited per block.  Larger datasets require algorithmic adjustments.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, consult the NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide and the CUDA C++ Programming Guide.   Additionally, review documentation on the specific CUDA atomic functions and their limitations. Explore literature on parallel algorithms and reduction techniques for efficient and correct parallel computations on GPUs. Thoroughly understand shared memory usage and its implications for performance and thread cooperation within a block. Studying examples of concurrent programming and synchronization techniques in general is also highly beneficial.  Practice implementing various synchronization strategies in small code snippets before integrating into larger applications.
