Arithmetic intensity, the ratio of arithmetic operations to memory accesses in a kernel, is paramount to achieving optimal performance in CUDA elementwise operations.  My experience optimizing hundreds of such kernels reveals that insufficient arithmetic intensity often leads to memory bandwidth becoming the primary bottleneck, negating the potential of the GPU's massive computational resources.  Focusing solely on optimizing for raw computational throughput, without considering memory access patterns, is a common pitfall.  Therefore, increasing arithmetic intensity requires a multi-pronged approach targeting both algorithmic restructuring and efficient memory management.

**1. Algorithmic Restructuring for Increased Intensity:**

The most effective method to boost arithmetic intensity involves increasing the number of computations performed per memory access.  This can be achieved by several techniques.  One approach is to fuse multiple operations into a single kernel.  Consider a scenario where you initially have separate kernels for addition, multiplication, and a square root operation performed sequentially on the same data. This results in three memory reads and writes per element.  By merging these into a single kernel, the memory accesses remain the same, while the arithmetic operations triple.

Another powerful technique is to leverage multiple operations within a single arithmetic instruction. For instance, using fused multiply-accumulate (FMA) instructions available on many GPUs significantly reduces memory traffic compared to separate multiplication and addition operations.  This is particularly beneficial for computationally intensive algorithms like matrix multiplication or convolution, where a large number of multiply-accumulate operations are performed on the same data.  Furthermore, exploring SIMD-friendly algorithms that can leverage vector operations offered by the GPU's architecture contributes significantly to arithmetic intensity.  Vectorization allows multiple data elements to be processed concurrently within a single instruction, significantly increasing the computation-to-memory ratio.  The choice of algorithm can be just as significant as the coding choices.

**2. Memory Management Strategies:**

Minimizing memory accesses is equally crucial. Techniques like shared memory usage and memory coalescing play a vital role.  Shared memory, a fast on-chip memory, can be used to store frequently accessed data, reducing global memory accesses.  However, efficient use requires careful consideration of memory bank conflicts and thread organization.  Coalescing, ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations, is crucial for efficient global memory access.  Non-coalesced memory accesses lead to significant performance penalties, negating gains from increased arithmetic intensity elsewhere.

Furthermore, careful data layout in memory significantly impacts performance.  Using appropriate data structures that promote data locality and minimize memory jumps can considerably improve arithmetic intensity. For example, arranging data in a row-major or column-major order depending on the access patterns within the kernel will minimize cache misses.  Pre-fetching data is also an approach which can prevent latency issues from causing stalls in the arithmetic operations.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these concepts with examples.

**Example 1: Fused Multiply-Accumulate (FMA)**

```cuda
__global__ void fmaKernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i]; // FMA operation
  }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates the use of FMA.  The single line `c[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i];` performs a fused multiply-accumulate operation, effectively combining multiplication and addition into one instruction. This significantly improves arithmetic intensity compared to separate multiplication and addition operations.  The efficiency heavily relies on the underlying hardware supporting FMA, a crucial consideration during the kernel design.


**Example 2: Shared Memory Usage**

```cuda
__global__ void sharedMemKernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
  __shared__ float sharedA[256]; // Shared memory array
  __shared__ float sharedB[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < n) {
    sharedA[tid] = a[i];
    sharedB[tid] = b[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads load data

    c[i] = sharedA[tid] * sharedB[tid];
    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads write back
  }
}
```

This kernel illustrates the use of shared memory. Data from global memory (`a` and `b`) is loaded into shared memory (`sharedA` and `sharedB`). The `__syncthreads()` ensures that all threads in a block have loaded their data before performing calculations.  This reduces global memory accesses, increasing arithmetic intensity. The size of the shared memory array (256 in this example) needs to be chosen carefully based on the GPU's architecture and the number of threads per block.  Poorly chosen sizes can lead to performance degradation due to bank conflicts.


**Example 3:  Loop Unrolling and Vectorization**

```cuda
__global__ void unrolledKernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j += 4) { // Unroll the loop
      c[i + j] = a[i + j] * b[i + j];
      c[i + j + 1] = a[i + j + 1] * b[i + j + 1];
      c[i + j + 2] = a[i + j + 2] * b[i + j + 2];
      c[i + j + 3] = a[i + j + 3] * b[i + j + 3];
    }
  }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates loop unrolling. This increases instruction-level parallelism. The compiler can potentially vectorize these operations further, processing multiple elements concurrently.  The extent of vectorization depends on the compiler and the target hardware.  Carefully choosing the loop unrolling factor is crucial, as excessive unrolling may lead to increased register pressure and reduced performance.  This optimization is more effective when combined with appropriate data alignment to maximize vectorization potential.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting the CUDA C Programming Guide, the NVIDIA CUDA documentation, and textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming.  Understanding the specifics of memory hierarchy, cache behavior, and warp scheduling are essential for effective optimization.  Profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight Compute are invaluable in identifying performance bottlenecks and guiding optimization efforts.  Experimentation and iterative refinement are paramount; theoretically optimal solutions do not always translate directly into real-world performance gains.  Always profile your kernels to validate the effectiveness of the chosen techniques.
