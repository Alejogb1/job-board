A primary challenge with TensorFlow model persistence arises because the default `tf.keras.Model` object, along with many custom layers, contains Python objects that are not inherently serializable by standard Python methods like `pickle`.  This necessitates employing TensorFlow's specific mechanisms for saving and loading, which often involve restructuring the model's graph and data into a format suitable for storage and later reconstruction. My own experience debugging distributed training jobs often highlighted the fragility of improperly saved models, leading me to develop robust strategies detailed below.

The fundamental approach to saving a non-serializable TensorFlow model revolves around utilizing the `tf.saved_model.save` function. This function doesn't attempt to pickle the Python objects directly. Instead, it serializes the TensorFlow graph and the trained weights into a directory structure.  This directory holds a protocol buffer containing the model's architecture, checkpoint files containing the model's variables (weights, biases, etc.), and potentially additional assets needed for its operation. When loading, `tf.saved_model.load` reconstructs the model based on this saved representation, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments. This methodology is designed to circumvent the inherent limitations of Python serialization when dealing with complex TensorFlow structures. A direct pickle, especially on models utilizing custom layers or classes, will often result in errors.

Here is an initial example illustrating the recommended `tf.saved_model` approach:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model
class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
    
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True)
    
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomLayer(units=64, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Example dummy input
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

# Forward pass to build model
y = model(x)


# Saving using tf.saved_model.save
save_path = "my_model_directory"
tf.saved_model.save(model, save_path)

print("Model saved successfully.")
```

This example defines a rudimentary model incorporating a custom layer. The key aspect here is not the model’s complexity, but the use of `tf.saved_model.save(model, save_path)`. This line serializes the model's structure, operations, and variables (including those within the `CustomLayer`) into the specified directory (`my_model_directory`). Attempting to pickle this model object before using `tf.saved_model.save`, will throw a `TypeError: cannot pickle` because of `CustomLayer` and other layers in the model itself. This saving process ensures the model can be reloaded, even if its Python class definitions are not directly available in the loading environment, which can be essential when deployed across different machines or environments.

Loading the model, subsequent, is achieved using `tf.saved_model.load` as such:

```python
# Loading the saved model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)

# Inferencing after loading
loaded_output = loaded_model(x)

print("Loaded output:", loaded_output)
```
This code segment illustrates the ease with which the saved model can be reconstructed using `tf.saved_model.load`. The loaded model (`loaded_model`) is callable, allowing for inferences and further operations. The beauty of this system lies in its abstraction - we are not dealing with the underlying serialization and reconstruction mechanisms directly; the TensorFlow API handles this transparently. This mechanism was invaluable in many of the large-scale model deployments I've worked on. The use of `save_path` should also be explicit as, in a previous project, a relative path was assumed and subsequently caused a very hard to debug error.

A second approach focuses on situations where model creation and saving are separated processes. This often occurs in distributed training. In such contexts, instead of saving the entire model directly, you might want to save just the model weights. This can reduce storage space and complexity, particularly when the model architecture is defined elsewhere.

Here is an example demonstrating the saving and loading of only model weights:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the same model
class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
    
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True)
    
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomLayer(units=64, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Create an example
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

# Build model
y = model(x)

# Saving only weights
checkpoint_path = "my_checkpoint/model.ckpt"
model.save_weights(checkpoint_path)

print("Weights saved successfully.")
```
In this instance, we utilize `model.save_weights(checkpoint_path)`.  This saves the model's weights to the checkpoint path in a binary format. This approach is valuable, for example, when your model definition is contained in a separate code repository from your training job. In our work, separating the model design from its operational deployment was a crucial step in ensuring project maintainability. The use of the checkpoint file format requires the model definition to be recreated before weights can be loaded which might require a dedicated class.

Subsequently, the saved weights can be loaded onto a new instance of the same model architecture like so:

```python
# Load the weights
new_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomLayer(units=64, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Build model again to get proper shape.
y = new_model(x)


new_model.load_weights(checkpoint_path)

# Inferencing with the loaded weights
new_output = new_model(x)

print("Output with loaded weights:", new_output)
```

Here, `new_model` is instantiated with the identical architecture and weights loaded using `new_model.load_weights(checkpoint_path)`. Crucially, this ensures the weights are correctly applied to the corresponding variables. This approach is typically more compact than saving the entire model when the architecture is stable and defined elsewhere. This method was often utilized in our batch prediction jobs, where we loaded the pre-trained weights from a central storage location, and ran predictions on various data slices.

Finally, when working with complex, custom model objects beyond the scope of the Keras model, you might need to use the lower-level TensorFlow API to save and restore the model variables. This often involves explicitly creating a Saver object and specifying what should be saved. This more complicated method was useful for some projects that used custom loss functions or optimizers. I avoided it otherwise due to its complexity and preference for Keras.

Here is an example demonstrating explicit saving using the Saver object:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the trainable variables directly
class MyComplexModel():
  def __init__(self, input_shape, hidden_units, output_shape):
    self.w1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(input_shape, hidden_units)), name="w1")
    self.b1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=(hidden_units,)), name="b1")
    self.w2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(hidden_units, output_shape)), name="w2")
    self.b2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=(output_shape,)), name="b2")

  def forward(self, x):
      hidden = tf.matmul(x, self.w1) + self.b1
      output = tf.matmul(hidden, self.w2) + self.b2
      return output

model = MyComplexModel(10, 64, 10)
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
y = model.forward(x)

# Create a saver
saver = tf.train.Saver([model.w1, model.b1, model.w2, model.b2])

# Save variables
checkpoint_path = "my_checkpoint2/model.ckpt"

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  saver.save(sess, checkpoint_path)
print("Saved variables.")
```

In this example, a `tf.train.Saver` instance is instantiated using a list of trainable variables. The session must be initialized and then variables are saved through the `save` method using the active session. This approach provides granular control, allowing the explicit inclusion of any variable defined using the TensorFlow API. This method, while offering the most flexibility, requires a deeper understanding of TensorFlow’s core mechanics.

Subsequently these weights can be loaded as follows:

```python
# Load variables.
new_model = MyComplexModel(10, 64, 10)
saver = tf.train.Saver([new_model.w1, new_model.b1, new_model.w2, new_model.b2])
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  saver.restore(sess, checkpoint_path)
  loaded_output = sess.run(new_model.forward(x))
  print("Loaded output:", loaded_output)

```
Here, `new_model` is initialized and the weights are reloaded with the `saver.restore` method. All saved model weights must be loaded and it is up to the user to re-establish the architecture before loading.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation for `tf.saved_model`, `tf.keras.Model.save_weights`, `tf.train.Saver`, and related topics. Reading through the official TensorFlow guides on saving and restoring models, especially the sections detailing custom objects, provides crucial insights.  Additionally, browsing through example projects on platforms like GitHub, focusing on implementations that involve custom model architectures or distributed training, offers practical learning opportunities. Consulting advanced TensorFlow tutorials that describe the internal mechanisms of the graph and checkpointing processes will also significantly deepen your understanding and ability to effectively handle non-serializable models.
