The key to efficiently computing the Jacobian of the log probability of a multivariate normal distribution in PyTorch lies in leveraging the library's automatic differentiation capabilities and understanding the analytical form of the log-likelihood.  My experience developing probabilistic models for high-dimensional financial time series data highlighted the importance of this optimization; naive approaches proved computationally intractable for anything beyond a small number of dimensions.

The log probability of a multivariate normal distribution with mean  µ and covariance matrix Σ is given by:

log p(x|µ, Σ) = -0.5 * (d * log(2π) + log|Σ| + (x - µ)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x - µ))

where 'd' is the dimensionality of x.  The Jacobian, then, is the matrix of partial derivatives of this log-probability function with respect to each element of x, µ, and the unique elements of Σ.  Directly computing this Jacobian analytically for a general covariance matrix becomes increasingly complex with dimensionality, making automatic differentiation a far more practical solution.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `autograd` functionality provides a powerful tool for this.  Instead of manually deriving and implementing the Jacobian, we define the log-probability function and then use PyTorch's automatic differentiation to compute the gradients. This avoids the laborious task of manually deriving and implementing potentially complex partial derivatives. For a multivariate normal, calculating these derivatives manually, especially for the covariance matrix, involves matrix calculus which quickly escalates in complexity with dimension increase and can easily be prone to error.  Furthermore,  this approach benefits from PyTorch's optimized backpropagation algorithms, leading to significant computational efficiency gains.

The process involves three steps:

* **Define the log-probability function:** This function should take x, µ, and Σ as inputs and return the log-probability.  Careful consideration needs to be given to efficient computation, particularly concerning the matrix inversion and determinant calculation for the covariance matrix.  For large covariance matrices, Cholesky decomposition is generally preferred for numerical stability and efficiency.

* **Compute gradients using `torch.autograd.grad`:** This function calculates the gradients of the log-probability with respect to each input variable. The gradient with respect to x will be the Jacobian vector. For µ and Σ, the Jacobian will be the vector and matrix of partial derivatives, respectively.

* **Reshape the output:** The output of `torch.autograd.grad` needs to be reshaped into the appropriate Jacobian matrix form based on the dimensions of x, µ and Σ.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Jacobian with respect to x:**

```python
import torch

def log_prob_mvn(x, mu, Sigma):
    d = x.shape[0]
    Sigma_chol = torch.linalg.cholesky(Sigma)
    inv_Sigma = torch.linalg.solve(Sigma_chol, torch.eye(d))
    inv_Sigma = torch.mm(inv_Sigma, inv_Sigma.t()) #avoid unnecessary extra calculation
    log_det_Sigma = 2 * torch.sum(torch.log(torch.diag(Sigma_chol)))
    diff = x - mu
    exponent = torch.mm(diff.t(), torch.mm(inv_Sigma, diff))
    logp = -0.5 * (d * torch.log(torch.tensor(2 * torch.pi)) + log_det_Sigma + exponent)
    return logp

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
mu = torch.randn(3)
Sigma = torch.randn(3, 3)
Sigma = torch.mm(Sigma, Sigma.t()) + 0.1 * torch.eye(3) # Ensure positive definite

logp = log_prob_mvn(x, mu, Sigma)
logp.backward()
jacobian_x = x.grad

print(jacobian_x)
```

This example demonstrates calculating the Jacobian with respect to x.  The `requires_grad=True` flag enables gradient tracking for x.  `logp.backward()` triggers the backpropagation, and `x.grad` holds the resulting Jacobian vector.  Note the use of Cholesky decomposition for computational efficiency and numerical stability in calculating the inverse and determinant of the covariance matrix.

**Example 2: Jacobian with respect to µ:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3)
mu = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
Sigma = torch.randn(3, 3)
Sigma = torch.mm(Sigma, Sigma.t()) + 0.1 * torch.eye(3)

logp = log_prob_mvn(x, mu, Sigma)
logp.backward()
jacobian_mu = mu.grad

print(jacobian_mu)
```

This example is similar to the first, but now the gradient is calculated with respect to µ. The resulting `jacobian_mu` is the Jacobian vector.

**Example 3: Jacobian with respect to Σ (challenging due to symmetry):**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3)
mu = torch.randn(3)
Sigma = torch.randn(3, 3, requires_grad=True)
Sigma = torch.mm(Sigma, Sigma.t()) + 0.1 * torch.eye(3) #Ensuring positive definiteness and symmetry

logp = log_prob_mvn(x, mu, Sigma)
logp.backward()
jacobian_Sigma = Sigma.grad

print(jacobian_Sigma)

```
Computing the Jacobian with respect to Σ is more involved due to the symmetry of the covariance matrix.  This example calculates the gradient with respect to all entries of Σ, even though only the upper triangular part is independent.  Post-processing might be needed to extract the relevant independent Jacobian elements, possibly by averaging the symmetric off-diagonal elements. This example directly uses automatic differentiation, avoiding the complex analytical derivation that would be necessary for a manual approach.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of multivariate normal distributions and their properties, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on probability and statistics.  Similarly, detailed explanations of PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism are readily available in the official PyTorch documentation and various online tutorials.  Finally, resources covering matrix calculus and its applications in machine learning are highly beneficial for gaining a more theoretical understanding of the underlying mathematics.  These resources collectively provide the theoretical grounding and practical implementation details necessary for mastering this computation.
