The assertion error regarding missing infinity checks during optimization typically stems from a failure to properly handle unbounded or diverging objective function values within your optimization algorithm.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale portfolio optimization and reinforcement learning projects, often masked by seemingly innocuous coding practices. The root cause is usually a lack of robust error handling for situations where the objective function returns `inf` or `-inf`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and premature termination of the optimization process.  The optimizer, unable to meaningfully compare these values with finite numbers, throws the assertion error to signal this problem.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Most optimization algorithms rely on comparisons and ordering of function values to determine search direction and convergence.  The presence of infinity disrupts this process.  For instance, gradient-based methods might attempt to move along a gradient that points towards infinity, leading to numerical instability.  Similarly, line search methods, which aim to find an optimal step size along a search direction, may fail if the objective function becomes unbounded along this direction.  Many optimizers internally use tolerances and comparisons to determine termination criteria (e.g., convergence of objective function values or changes in parameters).  Infinity values bypass these tolerance checks, leading to assertions that are designed to catch such invalid states.

The specific implementation of infinity handling varies across different optimization libraries.  Some might explicitly check for infinite values before performing any comparisons or calculations. Others might rely on numerical properties of floating-point representation (e.g.,  `np.isinf()` in NumPy).  However, a common oversight is the failure to properly handle these conditions within the objective function itself or the surrounding code that interfaces with the optimizer.  This can manifest even when using sophisticated optimization libraries, if the objective function or its derivatives are not carefully designed to avoid returning unbounded values.

The assertion error is thus a crucial safety mechanism to prevent silent failures and erroneous results. It explicitly alerts you to a potential flaw in your objective function or the interaction between your code and the chosen optimizer.  Ignoring this error will likely lead to inaccurate or unreliable optimization results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unbounded Objective Function**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def unbounded_objective(x):
    # This function is unbounded for x[0] > 10
    return 1/(10-x[0]) + x[1]**2

x0 = np.array([5, 5])  # Initial guess
result = minimize(unbounded_objective, x0, method='L-BFGS-B')

#If this returns inf, there is issue with the optimization
print(result)
```

This code uses `scipy.optimize.minimize` with the L-BFGS-B method. The `unbounded_objective` function becomes unbounded as `x[0]` approaches 10.  The optimizer may encounter `inf`, triggering the assertion error if it explores values beyond this limit.  The solution requires modifying the objective function to prevent it from becoming unbounded within the feasible region. This could involve constraints or a re-formulation of the objective function.


**Example 2:  Improper Handling of Constraints**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def constrained_objective(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2

cons = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x:  x[0] -10}) #Constraint violated results in unbounded function if not handled

x0 = np.array([-20, 0]) #Initial guess violates the constraint

result = minimize(constrained_objective, x0, constraints=cons, method='SLSQP')

print(result)
```

This example showcases how violating constraints can lead to infinity values.  The `constrained_objective` function is well-behaved, but if the optimizer explores regions that violate the constraint `x[0] > 10`, the optimizer might generate values leading to assertion error.  The solution would involve a more sophisticated constraint handling mechanism, such as penalty functions or barrier methods, within the optimization algorithm itself or stricter constraints to prevent exploration of infeasible regions.


**Example 3:  Numerical Instability in Derivatives**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_with_unstable_derivative(x):
    if x[0] < 0:
      return np.inf

    return x[0]**2 + np.exp(x[1])

x0 = np.array([-1,0])

result = minimize(objective_with_unstable_derivative, x0, method='BFGS')
print(result)
```

Here, the derivative of the objective function becomes numerically unstable for `x[0] < 0`. A derivative calculation could return `inf` or `NaN` triggering an assertion.  The solution is to either re-formulate the objective function to avoid numerical instability (e.g., by using a different parameterization or smoothing techniques) or to choose an optimization algorithm that is less sensitive to derivative inaccuracies. Methods such as Nelder-Mead, which are derivative-free, might be preferable in situations where derivative computation is problematic.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of optimization algorithms and numerical stability, I recommend consulting standard numerical optimization textbooks.  These texts often cover topics such as numerical error analysis, handling of constraints, and choosing appropriate optimization algorithms for various problem types.  Furthermore, the documentation of your chosen optimization library is invaluable; it often provides detailed information on the algorithm's behavior, error handling mechanisms, and potential numerical issues.  Finally, reviewing the source code of the optimization library itself (if available and accessible) can offer insights into its internal checks and assertions.  Understanding the specific checks employed will assist in identifying the precise source of the failure in your particular case.
