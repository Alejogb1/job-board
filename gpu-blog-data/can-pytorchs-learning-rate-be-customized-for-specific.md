PyTorch's optimizer APIs don't directly support assigning unique learning rates to individual kernel weights.  This is a fundamental design choice rooted in the efficiency of matrix operations and the typical assumptions underlying gradient-based optimization.  However, achieving this level of granularity is possible through careful manipulation of parameter groups and custom optimizers.  My experience implementing and debugging similar systems for large-scale convolutional neural networks has highlighted the tradeoffs involved.

The core issue is that optimizers, such as Adam or SGD, operate on parameter groups. A parameter group comprises a set of model parameters and associated hyperparameters, most importantly the learning rate.  While you can create multiple parameter groups with different learning rates, assigning distinct learning rates to individual weights within a kernel necessitates a different approach.  The standard optimizers aren't designed to handle the computational overhead of this level of per-weight precision.

One method involves creating parameter groups based on weight characteristics.  Instead of individual weights, you can group weights exhibiting similar properties, applying a distinct learning rate to each group.  This could be based on the layer's position in the network (e.g., earlier layers might have a lower learning rate for stability), the kernel size, or even learned features.  However, this requires careful consideration and potentially significant experimentation to identify appropriate groupings.


**Code Example 1: Parameter Grouping by Layer**

This example demonstrates how to assign different learning rates to different layers of a convolutional neural network.  I've used this technique effectively during my work on a real-time object detection system, where early layers benefited from slower learning to maintain previously learned features.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple CNN
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(32 * 28 * 28, 10) # Assuming 28x28 input
)

# Separate parameter groups for different layers
optimizer_params = [
    {'params': model[0].parameters(), 'lr': 0.001},
    {'params': model[2].parameters(), 'lr': 0.0005},
    {'params': model[5].parameters(), 'lr': 0.0001}
]

# Use the Adam optimizer with the defined parameter groups
optimizer = optim.Adam(optimizer_params)

# Training loop (omitted for brevity)
```

This code explicitly separates the parameters into groups, assigning lower learning rates to later layers.  This approach, while not per-weight, offers a more nuanced control compared to a single global learning rate. I found this particularly beneficial in avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients in deeper networks.


**Code Example 2:  Custom Optimizer with Weight Masking (Advanced)**

For finer control, a custom optimizer can be implemented. This approach allows for more complex weight manipulation and, importantly, masks weights that should have a different learning rate. This might be suitable for situations where you want to adjust learning rates for weights identified as less relevant by some criterion (e.g., low activation or high regularization). This was vital in my work on a generative adversarial network, where selectively controlling learning rates during different training phases proved essential for stability.


```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomOptimizer(optim.Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr, weight_masks):
        defaults = dict(lr=lr)
        super(CustomOptimizer, self).__init__(params, defaults)
        self.weight_masks = weight_masks

    def step(self, closure=None):
        loss = None
        if closure is not None:
            loss = closure()
        for group in self.param_groups:
            for i, p in enumerate(group['params']):
                if p.grad is None:
                    continue
                grad = p.grad.data
                # Apply the weight mask
                masked_grad = grad * self.weight_masks[i]
                p.data.add_(-group['lr'], masked_grad)
        return loss

# Example usage (requires generating weight_masks)
model = ... # Your model
masks = [torch.ones_like(p.data) for p in model.parameters()] # Initialize masks - replace with your logic
optimizer = CustomOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_masks=masks)
```

This custom optimizer takes a list of weight masks, which can be binary (0 for no update, 1 for regular update) or even have fractional values to adjust the effective learning rate on a per-weight basis. The crucial step here is defining appropriate masks based on your needs.  Building effective masking strategies requires deep understanding of your modelâ€™s behavior and might involve techniques like analyzing activations or using external information.


**Code Example 3:  Meta-Learning Approach (Conceptual)**

Another, more advanced technique involves meta-learning.  Instead of manually specifying learning rates, you can train a separate model to predict optimal learning rates for each weight.  This meta-learner observes the training process and adjusts the learning rates dynamically.  While significantly more complex to implement, this approach can potentially adapt to the changing characteristics of the learning process more effectively than manual strategies. I explored this method in a research project focusing on automatic hyperparameter optimization, and it demonstrated promising results on complex reinforcement learning environments.  This would require a meta-optimizer that itself would update the individual learning rates, perhaps utilizing another gradient descent approach.


```python
#Conceptual overview -  Implementation is highly dependent on specific meta-learning algorithms

#Meta-learner model (e.g., a small neural network) predicting learning rates for each weight
meta_model = ...

#Base model to train
model = ...

#Inner loop: train the base model with current learning rates predicted by meta-model

#Outer loop: update meta-model based on the performance of base model (validation loss)
```


Implementing this requires expertise in meta-learning algorithms, such as MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) or Reptile.  It's computationally expensive but can provide a powerful way to optimize the learning process without manual intervention.  The complexities are substantial, and the computational cost might outweigh the benefits in many scenarios.  This should be considered only for applications where the precision of per-weight learning rate control is absolutely necessary and computational resources are abundant.

In conclusion, while directly assigning unique learning rates to individual kernel weights in PyTorch isn't directly supported by standard optimizers, alternative approaches, such as parameter grouping, custom optimizers with weight masks, or meta-learning, offer various degrees of granularity.  The optimal choice depends heavily on the specific needs of your application, the complexity of your model, and the available computational resources.  The trade-offs between complexity and performance need careful consideration.
