A CNN model consistently predicting the same class, regardless of input, typically points to a fundamental issue in either the training data, the model architecture, or the training process itself. This is commonly referred to as mode collapse or a degenerate solution, where the model effectively learns to ignore the input features and favor a single output. In my experience, I've encountered this in diverse scenarios, ranging from image classification with insufficient data augmentation to complex NLP tasks with severely imbalanced datasets.

The root cause often lies in a combination of factors, and identifying the specific culprit requires systematic investigation. A primary reason for a model consistently predicting the same class is insufficient data variance. If the dataset primarily contains samples belonging to a single class or if the variation within the classes is minimal, the model can easily latch onto a solution that favors the dominant class. In this scenario, the gradient descent algorithm effectively finds a local minimum that corresponds to predicting the most frequently observed class. The model is never exposed to the diversity required to learn discriminating features.

Another contributing factor can be a significant class imbalance within the dataset. If one class vastly outnumbers the others, the model may learn to simply predict the majority class, as it yields a comparatively lower loss during training, even though it lacks genuine predictive power. This occurs because the error signal from the minority classes is dwarfed by the error signal from the majority class, and the model becomes biased towards minimizing overall error rather than learning nuanced decision boundaries.

Problems can also arise from an improperly initialized model. While random weight initialization is standard, it's important to consider the distribution from which the weights are drawn. Suboptimal weight initialization can lead to slow or stagnated learning, and in some cases, can directly contribute to mode collapse. If weights are initialized in such a way that it's easier to predict a single class than learn feature mappings, then the model is incentivized towards the simpler solution. Furthermore, a model with poorly constructed architecture, such as a very shallow network, may lack the capacity to learn complex features effectively and thus falls back to a simpler, less nuanced, solution.

Finally, the training process itself can be problematic. Insufficient training epochs or a poorly chosen learning rate can hinder convergence. A learning rate that is too high can cause instability and prevent the model from converging to an optimal solution, while one that is too low will stall the learning process entirely. In addition, inadequate data augmentation, poor regularization, or inappropriate loss functions can directly influence a model's propensity to fall into mode collapse.

To illustrate these issues and how to debug them, let's consider three code examples using the TensorFlow Keras API. I will describe common problems I have encountered and the steps taken to rectify these issues.

**Example 1: Imbalanced Dataset and Class Weights**

Here is an example where we create a very imbalanced dataset and demonstrate that a simple CNN trained on such a dataset falls into predicting only a single class. Then we improve the model's accuracy using class weights.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create an imbalanced synthetic dataset
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 10
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, num_samples)
y[:900] = 0  # Make class 0 dominant
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=2) # One-hot encoding

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# Define a simple CNN model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
_, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Baseline model Accuracy: {accuracy}") # Output around 0.90 because it favors the dominant class.


# Compute class weights for training
class_0_count = np.sum(y_train[:,0])
class_1_count = np.sum(y_train[:,1])

total_samples = len(y_train)
weight_for_0 = (1 / class_0_count) * (total_samples / 2.0)
weight_for_1 = (1 / class_1_count) * (total_samples / 2.0)

class_weight = {0: weight_for_0, 1: weight_for_1}

# Retrain the model with class weights
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weight, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
_, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Class weights model Accuracy: {accuracy}") # Output closer to 0.5 which is still not perfect due to limited data but is a significant improvement.
```

The initial model performs very well, accuracy wise, but upon closer look, it only predicts the first class. The output from this run demonstrates the failure of the baseline model due to class imbalance, however, with the addition of class weights we see a noticeable improvement in the accuracy which indicates the model has learned to differentiate between the classes and not simply predict the majority class.

**Example 2: Insufficient Data Augmentation**

This example demonstrates the failure of a model that does not utilize data augmentation and then shows how data augmentation can rectify the problem. The baseline model performs poorly because it doesn't have a chance to see enough different images with different attributes, it overfits and is unable to generalize to unseen data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic image data (very limited variation)
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 100
img_height = 32
img_width = 32
X = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(num_samples, img_height, img_width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_samples)
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)


# Split dataset
X_train, X_test = X[:80], X[80:]
y_train, y_test = y[:80], y[80:]

# Define a CNN model without data augmentation
model_no_aug = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile and train the model without augmentation
model_no_aug.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_no_aug.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model without augmentation
_, accuracy_no_aug = model_no_aug.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"No augmentation Accuracy: {accuracy_no_aug}") # Likely a poor score close to 0.5 or slightly worse.

# Define a CNN model with data augmentation
data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomFlip("horizontal_and_vertical"),
    tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomRotation(0.2)
])

model_aug = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    data_augmentation,
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile and train the model with augmentation
model_aug.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_aug.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model with augmentation
_, accuracy_aug = model_aug.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"With augmentation Accuracy: {accuracy_aug}") # Expected to have a better score than the model without augmentation.
```

The accuracy of the model trained without augmentation is much worse than the model trained with augmentation. This highlights how data augmentation is key to preventing overfitting and ensuring the model can learn more general features.

**Example 3: Learning Rate Issues**

This code demonstrates the effect of the learning rate on training, where a learning rate that is too large can cause the model to not converge on a useful solution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create synthetic dataset
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 500
num_features = 20
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, num_samples)
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)

X_train, X_test = X[:400], X[400:]
y_train, y_test = y[:400], y[400:]


# Define a simple model
model_bad_lr = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile and train the model with a high learning rate
optimizer_high_lr = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
model_bad_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_high_lr, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_bad_lr.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model with the bad learning rate
_, accuracy_bad_lr = model_bad_lr.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"High Learning rate model accuracy: {accuracy_bad_lr}") # Output around 0.5 or worse due to non convergence.

# Define a simple model
model_good_lr = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile and train the model with a better learning rate
optimizer_good_lr = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model_good_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_good_lr, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_good_lr.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model with the good learning rate
_, accuracy_good_lr = model_good_lr.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Good Learning rate model accuracy: {accuracy_good_lr}") # Expected output to be significantly better than high learning rate model.
```

The model with an overly large learning rate performs poorly, demonstrating that the training algorithm diverged from a useful solution. However, the model using a well-tuned learning rate achieves a better result, showing the importance of proper hyperparameter selection.

To systematically debug a CNN that is consistently predicting a single class, it is crucial to start with a thorough data analysis. Check the class distribution and ensure it isn't significantly imbalanced. Then, apply appropriate data augmentation techniques to introduce variation and prevent overfitting. Use class weights or loss functions that are resilient to class imbalance. Carefully consider the model's architecture, ensuring it has enough capacity to learn the features of the training set. Experiment with different learning rates, optimizers, and regularization techniques to find a configuration that promotes convergence. Review literature pertaining to the specific problem domain. Lastly, visualize the model's predictions on validation samples to get insights into its specific shortcomings. A debugging checklist is valuable here: data analysis, augmentation, class imbalance correction, architecture review, learning rate tuning, and finally, thorough validation and testing. Addressing these areas one at a time will often pinpoint the problem and allow for corrective actions.
