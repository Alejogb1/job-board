The core challenge in migrating from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2 concerning sequence modeling lies in the shift from the lower-level `tf.contrib` functionalities to the higher-level Keras API.  Specifically, `tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example`, a staple for calculating sequence-level loss in TensorFlow 1, doesn't have a direct, single-function equivalent in TensorFlow 2.  Its functionality, however, is readily replicated using the `tf.keras.losses` module and potentially custom loss functions. This necessitates a more nuanced approach focusing on the underlying loss calculation mechanism.

My experience working on large-scale neural machine translation systems in TensorFlow 1 extensively utilized `sequence_loss_by_example`.  The transition to TensorFlow 2 required a deep understanding of how this function operates and how its functionality can be reconstructed using TensorFlow 2's tools. The key is recognizing that `sequence_loss_by_example` computed a weighted average loss across time steps, considering sequence lengths.  This weighting is crucial for handling variable-length sequences, a common scenario in many sequence-to-sequence tasks.

The absence of a direct equivalent necessitates a more modular approach. We leverage Keras's flexibility to build custom loss functions or adapt existing ones. The process fundamentally involves:

1. **Calculating per-time-step loss:** This typically involves using a loss function like `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` or `categorical_crossentropy`, depending on the nature of your output (integer labels or probability distributions).

2. **Masking:**  Applying a mask to account for variable sequence lengths. This prevents padding tokens from influencing the loss calculation.

3. **Averaging (weighted or unweighted):** Averaging the per-time-step losses, either weighting by the sequence length or taking a simple average, depending on the desired behavior.

Let's illustrate these steps with concrete code examples:

**Example 1:  Using `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` with masking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_sequence_loss(y_true, y_pred, mask):
    """
    Calculates sequence loss using sparse_categorical_crossentropy with masking.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length]).
        y_pred: Predicted logits (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_classes]).
        mask: Boolean mask indicating valid tokens (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length]).

    Returns:
        The average loss across all valid tokens.
    """
    loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, from_logits=True)
    masked_loss = tf.boolean_mask(loss, mask)
    return tf.reduce_mean(masked_loss)


# Example usage:
batch_size = 32
max_len = 50
num_classes = 10

y_true = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, max_len), maxval=num_classes, dtype=tf.int32)
y_pred = tf.random.normal((batch_size, max_len, num_classes))
mask = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, max_len), maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32) > 0  # Generate random boolean mask

loss = custom_sequence_loss(y_true, y_pred, mask)
print(f"Custom sequence loss: {loss}")
```

This example demonstrates the crucial role of masking.  The `tf.boolean_mask` function effectively ignores the loss contributions from padded positions.  The use of `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` is suitable when dealing with integer labels.


**Example 2:  Using `categorical_crossentropy` for probability distributions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_sequence_loss_prob(y_true, y_pred, mask):
    """
    Calculates sequence loss using categorical_crossentropy with masking for probability distributions.

    Args:
        y_true: One-hot encoded true labels (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_classes]).
        y_pred: Predicted probability distributions (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_classes]).
        mask: Boolean mask indicating valid tokens (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length]).

    Returns:
        The average loss across all valid tokens.
    """
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, from_logits=False)
    masked_loss = tf.boolean_mask(loss, mask)
    return tf.reduce_mean(masked_loss)

# Example Usage (similar structure to Example 1, but y_true is one-hot encoded)

```

This example highlights the adaptation for probability distributions instead of integer labels. The choice between `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` and `categorical_crossentropy` depends entirely on your data representation.


**Example 3:  Weighted averaging based on sequence length**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_sequence_loss(y_true, y_pred, seq_len):
    """
    Calculates sequence loss with weighting based on sequence length.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length]).
        y_pred: Predicted logits (shape: [batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_classes]).
        seq_len: Sequence lengths for each example (shape: [batch_size]).

    Returns:
        The weighted average loss.
    """
    loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, from_logits=True)
    weights = tf.sequence_mask(seq_len, maxlen=tf.shape(y_true)[1], dtype=loss.dtype)
    weighted_loss = loss * weights
    return tf.reduce_sum(weighted_loss) / tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(seq_len, dtype=loss.dtype))

#Example Usage (requires seq_len tensor representing actual sequence lengths)
```

This example incorporates a weighted average, giving more importance to longer sequences. The weights are derived from `tf.sequence_mask`, ensuring that only valid time steps contribute to the final loss.


In conclusion, migrating from `sequence_loss_by_example` in TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2 requires a compositional approach.  There isn't a direct replacement, but the functionality is easily recreated using TensorFlow 2's built-in loss functions, masking mechanisms, and the flexibility offered by custom loss function definition within Keras.  Careful consideration of your data representation (one-hot encoded or integer labels) and the need for length-based weighting dictates the specifics of your implementation.  Remember to always meticulously handle masking to prevent biases from padding tokens.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 2 documentation, particularly the sections on Keras losses and masking, are invaluable.  Additionally, a thorough understanding of sequence-to-sequence models and their associated loss functions from a broader machine learning perspective is crucial.  Exploring relevant chapters in standard machine learning textbooks and research papers on sequence modeling will provide a comprehensive understanding.  Finally, studying examples of custom loss implementations in TensorFlow 2 repositories on platforms like GitHub can offer practical guidance.
