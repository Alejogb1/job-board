Extracting features from intermediate layers of a Keras autoencoder requires a nuanced understanding of the model's architecture and the manipulation of its internal state.  My experience debugging complex generative models for industrial image processing has highlighted the critical role of careful layer selection and the potential pitfalls of naive approaches.  Simply accessing layer outputs isn't sufficient; one must account for the encoder's internal data flow and ensure compatibility with downstream processing.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Keras autoencoder consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (the latent space), while the decoder reconstructs the input from this representation.  The intermediate layers within the encoder progressively extract increasingly abstract features from the input.  To utilize these intermediate features as output, we must modify the autoencoder's functionality to output the activations of a chosen intermediate layer instead of the final reconstruction. This involves creating a new model that shares weights with the original autoencoder but terminates at the desired intermediate layer.  This "feature extractor" model effectively utilizes the pre-trained weights of the encoder to perform feature extraction on new data.  Importantly, the performance of the extracted features is intrinsically linked to the quality and training of the original autoencoder.  Poorly trained autoencoders will produce poor features, regardless of the extraction method.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate feature extraction from different layers of a simple autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset. I assume familiarity with Keras and TensorFlow/Theano backend specifics.  These examples build upon each other, increasing in complexity.

**Example 1:  Simple Feature Extraction**

This example showcases a straightforward method for accessing and using the features from a single hidden layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define the autoencoder
input_dim = 784
encoding_dim = 32

input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
encoder = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu')(input_layer)
decoder = Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(encoder)

autoencoder = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=decoder)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Load pre-trained weights (assuming they exist)
autoencoder.load_weights('my_autoencoder_weights.h5')

# Create a feature extractor model
feature_extractor = keras.Model(inputs=autoencoder.input, outputs=encoder)

# Extract features from a sample image
sample_image = tf.random.normal((1,784))
extracted_features = feature_extractor(sample_image)

print(extracted_features.shape) #Output: (1, 32)  (1 sample, 32 features)
```

This code defines a simple autoencoder, loads pre-trained weights, and then creates a new model (`feature_extractor`) using the encoder's layers. The output of this model represents the extracted features.  Note the critical step of loading pre-trained weights.  This is essential; using untrained weights would result in meaningless feature extractions.

**Example 2:  Multi-Layer Feature Extraction**

This example expands on the first to extract features from multiple layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# ... (same autoencoder definition as Example 1) ...

# Load pre-trained weights
autoencoder.load_weights('my_autoencoder_weights.h5')

# Get intermediate layers
encoder_layers = autoencoder.layers[1:3] # access 2nd and 3rd encoder layers

# Create feature extractors for each layer
feature_extractors = []
for layer in encoder_layers:
    feature_extractor = keras.Model(inputs=autoencoder.input, outputs=layer(autoencoder.layers[0].output))
    feature_extractors.append(feature_extractor)

# Extract features from multiple layers
sample_image = tf.random.normal((1, 784))
extracted_features = [extractor(sample_image) for extractor in feature_extractors]

for i, features in enumerate(extracted_features):
    print(f"Features from layer {i+1}: {features.shape}")
```

Here, we iterate through multiple encoder layers, creating a separate feature extractor for each. This allows for the extraction of features at different levels of abstraction.  Error handling (e.g., checking the number of layers) would be essential in a production environment.

**Example 3:  Handling Variable Input Sizes**

This example addresses the critical issue of handling varying input sizes, a frequent problem in real-world applications.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Reshape

# Define autoencoder with variable input size capability using Reshape
input_shape = (None,) # Variable input size
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)
reshape_layer = Reshape((1,-1))(input_layer) # Reshape to adapt layer
encoder = Dense(32, activation='relu')(reshape_layer)
decoder = Dense(tf.shape(reshape_layer)[-1], activation='sigmoid')(encoder)
decoder = Reshape(input_shape)(decoder)

autoencoder = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=decoder)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Load pre-trained weights
autoencoder.load_weights('my_autoencoder_weights_variable.h5')

#Create feature extractor
feature_extractor = keras.Model(inputs=autoencoder.input, outputs=encoder)

#Extract features (handles different input lengths)
sample_image_1 = tf.random.normal((10,))
sample_image_2 = tf.random.normal((5,))
extracted_features_1 = feature_extractor(sample_image_1)
extracted_features_2 = feature_extractor(sample_image_2)
print(extracted_features_1.shape) #Output will have batch size of 1, and 32 features
print(extracted_features_2.shape) #Output will have batch size of 1, and 32 features
```

This example incorporates a `Reshape` layer to handle inputs of varying lengths, making the feature extractor more versatile. This is crucial for handling real-world data where consistent input dimensions aren't guaranteed. Note the adjustment to the decoder to mirror the reshape operation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of autoencoders and Keras, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation and exploring introductory machine learning textbooks that cover neural networks and deep learning.  Furthermore, research papers on advanced autoencoder architectures (variational autoencoders, denoising autoencoders) can provide valuable insights.  A solid understanding of linear algebra and calculus is also beneficial.  Finally, practical experience with debugging and modifying Keras models is invaluable.
