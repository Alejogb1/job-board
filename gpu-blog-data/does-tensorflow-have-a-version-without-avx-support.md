TensorFlow's performance heavily relies on optimized linear algebra operations, many of which leverage Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) instructions for significant speedups.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects for several years has shown that AVX support is, in almost all modern TensorFlow builds, considered a standard feature.  However, the question of a completely AVX-less version is nuanced and requires careful consideration of compilation options and target architectures.  A completely AVX-free TensorFlow is not readily available as a standard distribution, but achieving a functionally equivalent, albeit slower, version is possible through specific build configurations.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow's core operations are implemented using highly optimized libraries like Eigen and BLAS. These libraries frequently utilize SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, with AVX being a prominent example.  AVX instructions allow parallel processing of multiple data points within a single instruction, leading to substantial performance gains, especially in matrix multiplications and other computationally intensive tasks central to deep learning.  Removing AVX support necessitates the use of fallback implementations that perform the same computations but without the parallelism offered by AVX. This inevitably results in a significant performance reduction.

The absence of AVX support is often associated with older hardware lacking the instruction set or specific compilation choices aiming to build TensorFlow for a broader range of devices, perhaps focusing on compatibility over peak performance.  However, even on older hardware, utilizing alternative, less efficient, SIMD instructions can still provide some performance benefits compared to completely scalar computations.  The trade-off is always between performance and compatibility.

The compilation process of TensorFlow offers mechanisms to control which instruction sets are enabled during the build. By disabling AVX support explicitly during compilation, one can generate a TensorFlow binary that avoids using AVX instructions.  This process typically involves setting specific compiler flags and configuring the build environment appropriately. The implications of this are critical: expect drastically slower training and inference times, particularly on larger datasets and complex models.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples don't directly demonstrate AVX-less TensorFlow compilation, as that requires altering the build process itself. Instead, they illustrate scenarios where the lack of AVX would significantly affect performance.  Remember that these performance differences would be magnified in real-world applications with larger datasets.


**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

# Define large matrices
matrix_size = 10000
A = np.random.rand(matrix_size, matrix_size).astype(np.float32)
B = np.random.rand(matrix_size, matrix_size).astype(np.float32)

# TensorFlow computation
tf_A = tf.constant(A)
tf_B = tf.constant(B)

start_time = time.time()
C = tf.matmul(tf_A, tf_B)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"TensorFlow matrix multiplication time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

# NumPy computation (for comparison, lacks TensorFlow optimizations)
start_time = time.time()
C_numpy = np.matmul(A, B)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"NumPy matrix multiplication time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

This example highlights the performance advantage of TensorFlow's optimized matrix multiplication over NumPy's, which generally doesn't leverage SIMD instructions to the same extent.  The difference would be far greater if TensorFlow were compiled without AVX support, making it significantly slower than NumPy's implementation in this case.


**Example 2: Convolutional Layer Performance**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# Define a simple convolutional layer
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Generate dummy data
x = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28, 1))

# Time the forward pass
start_time = time.time()
model(x)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Convolutional layer forward pass time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Convolutional layers are heavily reliant on optimized matrix operations.  An AVX-less TensorFlow would exhibit a pronounced slowdown in this example.  The performance difference would increase proportionally to the size of the input data and the complexity of the convolutional layer.

**Example 3:  Simple Model Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate dummy data
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = y_train.astype('float32')

# Time the training process
start_time = time.time()
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Model training time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

This example shows a basic model training process. The training speed would be dramatically impacted if TensorFlow were built without AVX support due to the repeated computationally intensive operations within the backpropagation and gradient descent steps.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's build process and the impact of instruction set support, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on building from source.  Examine the compiler flags available for controlling instruction set support.  Furthermore, research on SIMD instruction sets and their performance implications in linear algebra operations would prove beneficial.  Finally, exploring materials on performance optimization within deep learning frameworks will provide context for understanding the significant impact of AVX on TensorFlow's efficiency.
