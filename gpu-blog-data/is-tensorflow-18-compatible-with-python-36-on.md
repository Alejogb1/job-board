TensorFlow 1.8's official support matrix explicitly excluded Python 3.6 on Windows 64-bit.  This is a crucial detail often overlooked, leading to considerable debugging frustration.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines in a production environment highlighted this incompatibility repeatedly.  While unofficial builds or community-provided wheels might *seem* to work, relying on them introduces significant risks concerning stability, security, and long-term maintainability.  Therefore, a straightforward answer is no, robust and reliable support is not provided.

Let's examine this incompatibility further.  TensorFlow 1.8's build process, particularly for Windows, depended heavily on specific versions of Visual Studio and associated compilers.  Python 3.6, while released around the same time, didn't align perfectly with the compilation toolchain TensorFlow 1.8 utilized. This mismatch resulted in unresolved dependencies, leading to runtime errors, segmentation faults, or unexpected behavior.  This wasn't simply a matter of minor version differences; it involved deeper integration issues at the binary level.

Furthermore, the absence of official support means a lack of guaranteed bug fixes and performance optimizations specifically tailored for that Python/Windows configuration.  Any reported issues encountered within that specific environment wouldn't have received priority attention from the TensorFlow development team during the 1.x era.  This lack of official support also impacts the availability of comprehensive documentation and community assistance focusing on this particular configuration.

Now, let's illustrate this incompatibility and explore potential workaround strategies (though they are discouraged for production settings due to the inherent risks).

**Code Example 1: Attempting Installation (Expected Failure)**

```python
import subprocess

try:
    subprocess.check_call(['pip', 'install', 'tensorflow==1.8'])
    print("TensorFlow 1.8 installed successfully.") # This will likely not execute
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error installing TensorFlow 1.8: {e}") # This will likely execute, showing errors
```

This code snippet attempts a direct installation using pip.  On a Windows 64-bit system with Python 3.6, this will almost certainly result in an error.  The error messages will vary, but they will generally indicate missing dependencies or compilation issues stemming from the incompatibility described previously. The `subprocess` module is employed for greater control over the installation process and allows for more detailed error reporting than simply using `pip install` directly.


**Code Example 2:  Verifying Installation (Post-Attempted Installation)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    print(tf.__version__)
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
    print(a)
except ImportError:
    print("TensorFlow 1.8 not found.  Installation failed.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Even if the previous step *seemed* to succeed, this code attempts to verify a successful installation and basic functionality.  An `ImportError` indicates a complete failure. Other exceptions, such as `AttributeError` or `NotFoundError`, might suggest partial installation success but critical components missing or corrupted. The simple tensor creation allows for a quick check of core functionality.


**Code Example 3: Demonstrating a Potential (Unsafe) Workaround (Using Unofficial Wheels â€“ STRONGLY DISCOURAGED)**

```python
#  THIS CODE IS PROVIDED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

#  Assume a hypothetical unofficial wheel exists for TensorFlow 1.8, Python 3.6, Windows 64-bit (This is unlikely to be safe or stable).
#  The path below would need to be replaced with the actual path to the wheel file.

import subprocess

try:
    subprocess.check_call(['pip', 'install', 'path/to/tensorflow-1.8-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl'])  
    print("Unofficial TensorFlow 1.8 wheel installed. (Proceed with extreme caution)")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error installing unofficial wheel: {e}")
```

This example highlights the dangers of relying on unofficial builds.  The critical comment emphasizes the risks associated with using such a solution.  It's essential to understand that installing unofficial wheels significantly compromises the integrity and stability of the environment.  Unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, and lack of support are all inherent risks.  I have encountered instances where such workarounds led to project-crippling errors and significant time spent troubleshooting.  In most cases, this path will lead to more problems than it solves.


**Resource Recommendations:**

To avoid the issues highlighted above, consult the official TensorFlow documentation regarding supported versions for your specific operating system and Python version.  Review the release notes for TensorFlow 1.8 and subsequent releases for detailed information on compatibility.  Familiarize yourself with the process of managing virtual environments to isolate your TensorFlow installations and avoid conflicts between different project dependencies.  Furthermore, consider using a more recent, actively supported version of TensorFlow, as TensorFlow 1.x is no longer actively maintained.  Consult Python and Windows system administrator guides for best practices in managing dependencies and maintaining a stable development environment.  Proper package management strategies and virtual environment usage are crucial for mitigating issues like these.
