The Angular CLI’s `ng build` command, when executed with the `--prod` flag (or implied in a production build pipeline), frequently triggers optimization-related errors. These stem primarily from the aggressive minification, tree-shaking, and dead code elimination processes applied during production builds, processes that are designed to minimize bundle size and improve application performance. I’ve personally encountered these issues across multiple large Angular projects, and they often manifest as cryptic JavaScript errors at runtime, rather than explicit compile-time failures. Effective resolution involves understanding the Angular compiler's constraints and employing techniques that promote compatibility with its optimization steps.

One common root cause is the modification or direct manipulation of Angular’s component metadata. The Angular compiler relies on static analysis of component definitions. When dynamically altering properties such as `@Component.selector`, `@Component.templateUrl`, or `@Component.template`, the optimization process, particularly during AoT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, may misinterpret the structure of your application. The compiler can’t see those modifications, and may strip out code that seems unused. For instance, attempting to dynamically change a component’s template using string interpolation or variable assignments can lead to unexpected errors where the Angular change detection system fails to function correctly after minification.

A secondary issue arises from incorrect use of Angular's change detection strategies. While `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` can significantly enhance performance, improper implementation, coupled with dependency injection patterns, can cause components not to re-render as intended. If a component uses `OnPush` and its inputs are not explicitly updated through immutability or references change, then the associated logic might fail after a production build due to aggressive optimization removing apparently unused binding code. Similarly, components with complex input structures that rely on mutation for change detection can be flagged as incorrectly updated after minification removes code or references that are thought to be unused.

Another frequent source of problems is the interaction between third-party libraries and Angular's optimized build process. Certain libraries might not be fully compatible with Angular's Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation or tree-shaking mechanisms. This is particularly true of older libraries or those which rely on dynamic or eval-based JavaScript execution within the component. The build process might then produce a build which is missing code, or is improperly structured to allow a library to operate as intended. This can result in unexpected runtime exceptions, or components which seem to function properly in development but fail in production due to code elimination.

Here are three code examples illustrating these issues and potential resolutions:

**Example 1: Dynamic Template Manipulation**

```typescript
// Incorrect: Dynamic manipulation of component metadata
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-dynamic-template',
  template: '<p>Initial Text</p>', // Initial template
})
export class DynamicTemplateComponent {
  constructor() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Problem: This will cause issues in a production build
      // Dynamically try to modify the template
       (this as any).constructor.ɵcmp.template = '<p>Changed Text</p>';
      console.log("Attempted to change template")
    }, 1000);
  }
}

```

**Commentary:** This code attempts to dynamically alter the component's template after a delay. While this might appear to work in development builds, the production build, during AOT, calculates the component's template statically. The attempted modification after compilation is ineffective, and in some cases can create instability. It is an anti-pattern when used to update templates. The solution is to use component properties and directives to dynamically control displayed content through Angular's standard binding syntax.

**Corrected Example 1**

```typescript
// Correct: Using component properties and binding
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-dynamic-template',
  template: '<p>{{ displayText }}</p>',
})
export class DynamicTemplateComponent {
  displayText = 'Initial Text';

  constructor() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.displayText = 'Changed Text';
    }, 1000);
  }
}
```

**Commentary:** In this corrected example, we introduce a component property `displayText` bound to the template. Changing `displayText` will correctly trigger an update in the Angular view after change detection is performed. The Angular compiler can statically analyze the usage of the property, and appropriately create the binding code.

**Example 2: Incorrect OnPush Change Detection**

```typescript
// Incorrect: Mutation within OnPush component
import { Component, Input, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-on-push-component',
  template: '<p>{{ data.value }}</p>',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class OnPushComponent {
  @Input() data: {value: string} = {value: "initial"};

  constructor() {
      setTimeout(() => {
       //Problem: This won't trigger a change detection in OnPush without the reference changing
        this.data.value = 'updated';
      }, 1000);
  }
}
```

**Commentary:** Here, the component uses `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`. It receives data via the `data` input which is being mutated directly. This mutation does not trigger the component's change detection, and the view will not reflect the change after a production build (or in development with OnPush active).  Since the reference to the `data` object has not changed, the component will not detect a change, and so it will not update.

**Corrected Example 2**

```typescript
// Correct: Immutability with OnPush
import { Component, Input, ChangeDetectionStrategy, OnChanges, SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-on-push-component',
  template: '<p>{{ data.value }}</p>',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class OnPushComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() data: {value: string} = {value: "initial"};
  currentData: {value: string} = {value: "initial"}

    ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
        if(changes["data"]) {
            this.currentData = {...changes["data"].currentValue}; // creates new copy of input object
        }
    }

  constructor() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.currentData = {value: 'updated'};
        this.data = {...this.currentData}; // trigger change detection
    }, 1000);
  }
}
```

**Commentary:** In this corrected version, the component implements `OnChanges` to maintain its own copy of the data, and only re-assigns the input when a new reference is provided to the component. The reference changes which are detected by OnPush. A new object is constructed in the timeout, and assigned to the component. This will cause a change detection cycle to occur, and the output to update. Note the `...` spread operator is used to create a copy of the object to ensure a new reference is provided.

**Example 3: Issues with Third-Party Libraries**

```typescript
// Incorrect: Dynamic eval statement from a library

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import * as someLibrary from 'some-problematic-library';


@Component({
    selector: 'app-library-component',
    template: '<div>{{ result }}</div>'
})
export class LibraryComponent{
    result: any;
    constructor() {
        this.result = someLibrary.someFunction({ data: 'initial' });
    }

}


```

**Commentary:** Assume the `some-problematic-library` internally makes use of `eval` statements or similar methods to generate its output dynamically. Angular's production build may remove code or optimize in such a way that the execution within `someLibrary.someFunction` fails or throws an exception, because the needed code or dependencies have been removed during the build optimization process.  This isn’t visible in a development build, and may be hard to trace down.

**Corrected Example 3:**
```typescript
// Correct: Use a library with AOT support
import { Component, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';
import * as someLibrary from 'some-alternative-library';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-library-component',
    template: '<div>{{ result }}</div>'
})
export class LibraryComponent implements AfterViewInit {
    result: any;
    ngAfterViewInit(): void {
        this.result = someLibrary.someFunction({ data: 'initial' });
    }
}
```

**Commentary:** The fix here involves migrating to an alternative library, `some-alternative-library`, which does not rely on dynamic code execution or eval statements that may not be handled properly by the build. The `some-alternative-library` has been constructed with Angular AoT compatibility in mind. The use of `ngAfterViewInit` is also illustrative of avoiding operations that need a complete and stable view before executing.

To address Angular build optimization errors effectively, it’s important to:

1. **Avoid direct DOM or component metadata manipulation.** Leverage data binding, properties, and directives.
2. **Be meticulous with `OnPush` change detection.** Ensure input properties are updated using new references and immutability principles.
3. **Review library compatibility.** Prioritize libraries that are explicitly Angular-compatible or those that do not heavily rely on dynamic Javascript execution such as `eval`.
4. **Enable detailed build logging.** Angular CLI provides a `--verbose` flag with the `ng build` command to expose additional information.
5. **Gradually introduce build optimizations.** Enable optimization flags incrementally and test to localize any introduced issues.

Resource recommendations include the official Angular documentation, specifically the sections on AOT compilation and change detection. Articles from credible sources such as the Angular team's blog also provide valuable information. Familiarizing with optimization best practices and Angular's compiler are key to avoiding many production build issues. I've found that a strong understanding of the compiler, and of how the framework functions, has allowed me to resolve a multitude of these often opaque errors.
