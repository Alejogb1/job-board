My experience has shown that optimizing feature selection for Naive Bayes classifiers directly impacts both model performance and computational efficiency, often more significantly than fine-tuning the classifier's internal parameters. The naive independence assumption of Naive Bayes, while computationally advantageous, makes it particularly sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features. Therefore, a well-executed feature selection strategy is critical.

Feature selection, in essence, aims to reduce the dimensionality of the input data by choosing a subset of the most relevant features, thereby minimizing noise and focusing the classifier on the information that truly matters for predicting the target variable. This process avoids overfitting the model to irrelevant data, which can occur if we include too many features, some of which might be only coincidentally correlated with our target variable in our training set and not generalizable to new data.

There are primarily two classes of feature selection methods: filter methods and wrapper methods. Filter methods are generally simpler and computationally less expensive, operating independently of the learning algorithm, by using statistical measures to score features and select the top-ranked ones. Wrapper methods, on the other hand, utilize the learning algorithm itself to evaluate the performance of different feature subsets, typically employing an iterative search approach to find the optimal combination.

A third less frequently used category is embedded methods. These incorporate feature selection as part of the model training process itself. This approach offers a balance between filter and wrapper methods. Some algorithms inherently perform this, like regularization methods in Logistic Regression, but theyâ€™re not directly used in Naive Bayes, thus less relevant here.

I will focus here on filter methods and one practical example of wrapper methods because of their frequent use with Naive Bayes and because of my own practical experiences with their effectiveness.

Filter methods I regularly employ include:

1.  **Variance Thresholding:** This simple approach removes features with low variance, assuming that features that do not vary significantly across the dataset provide little discriminatory power. It does not consider the target variable. If a feature has the same value (or near the same value) for all samples, it provides no predictive signal.
2.  **Univariate Feature Selection:** These methods use statistical tests to assess the relationship between each feature and the target variable. The features are ranked based on their scores, and top-scoring features are selected. I regularly utilize methods such as chi-squared for categorical target variables or ANOVA f-test for numerical targets.
3.  **Information Gain/Mutual Information:** These measure the information shared between each feature and the target variable, quantifying the reduction in uncertainty about the target variable upon observing a given feature. These are suitable for a mix of feature types.

Wrapper methods I use involve iterative approaches. I'll focus on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). RFE trains the model with the current set of features, removes the least important ones based on coefficients or feature importance metrics (not typically available in Naive Bayes, so I need to work with the performance scores after removing features in each iteration), and repeats the process.

Here are concrete examples illustrating these techniques:

**Example 1: Variance Thresholding**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold

# Dummy data.
data = np.array([[0, 2, 0.1, 1],
                 [0, 1, 0.2, 0],
                 [0, 3, 0.1, 1],
                 [1, 2, 0.3, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0.2, 1]])

selector = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0.1) #Threshold based on variance
selector.fit(data)

selected_features = selector.transform(data)

print("Original data shape:", data.shape)
print("Data with variance thresholding:", selected_features.shape)
print("Selected features indices:", selector.get_support(indices=True))

```
In this example, I demonstrate using `VarianceThreshold` to eliminate features with variances below 0.1. The selected indices shows the features kept, and the shape of `selected_features` showcases the dimensions reduction after the transformation. Note, setting the correct threshold is often the result of trial and error with validation datasets.

**Example 2: Univariate Feature Selection (Chi-Squared)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Dummy data with categorical features and target variable.
X_cat = np.array([['A', 'X'],
                ['B', 'Y'],
                ['A', 'X'],
                ['C', 'Y'],
                ['B', 'Z'],
                ['A', 'Z'],
                ['C', 'X']
                ])
y_cat = np.array(['p','p','p','n','n','n','p'])

#Convert the categorical features to numeric indices before applying chi2
label_encoder_x1 = LabelEncoder()
label_encoder_x2 = LabelEncoder()
X_cat_encoded = np.column_stack((label_encoder_x1.fit_transform(X_cat[:,0]), label_encoder_x2.fit_transform(X_cat[:,1])))
label_encoder_y = LabelEncoder()
y_cat_encoded = label_encoder_y.fit_transform(y_cat)


selector_chi2 = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=1) #Select top 1 feature
selector_chi2.fit(X_cat_encoded, y_cat_encoded)

selected_features_chi2 = selector_chi2.transform(X_cat_encoded)

print("Original data shape:", X_cat_encoded.shape)
print("Data with Chi2 selection:", selected_features_chi2.shape)
print("Selected feature index:", selector_chi2.get_support(indices=True))

```
In this instance, I apply the chi-squared test to assess the dependence between categorical features and target variables. The `SelectKBest` chooses the best features given a k value, determined by scoring the features using `chi2`. Label encoding is required since the chi-square test requires non-negative numbers.

**Example 3: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Dummy data.
X_rfe = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                [4, 5, 6, 7],
                [2, 3, 4, 5],
                [5, 6, 7, 8],
                [3, 4, 5, 6],
                [6, 7, 8, 9],
                [2, 4, 6, 8],
                [7, 8, 9, 10]])

y_rfe = np.array(['p','n','p','n','p','n','n','p'])
label_encoder_y_rfe = LabelEncoder()
y_rfe_encoded = label_encoder_y_rfe.fit_transform(y_rfe)

num_features = X_rfe.shape[1]
best_accuracy = 0
best_features = None

for k in range(num_features, 0, -1):
    subset_features_rfe = X_rfe[:, :k]
    
    #Cross-Validation
    skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    
    accuracies = []
    for train_index, test_index in skf.split(subset_features_rfe, y_rfe_encoded):
      X_train, X_test = subset_features_rfe[train_index], subset_features_rfe[test_index]
      y_train, y_test = y_rfe_encoded[train_index], y_rfe_encoded[test_index]

      model = GaussianNB()
      model.fit(X_train, y_train)
      y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
      accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred))
    
    avg_accuracy = np.mean(accuracies)

    if avg_accuracy > best_accuracy:
      best_accuracy = avg_accuracy
      best_features = list(range(k))

print("Best accuracy:", best_accuracy)
print("Best features indices:", best_features)
```
This example illustrates RFE performed via a custom implementation instead of relying on external libraries that directly use a feature importances (not available in naive Bayes). By iterating over different feature set sizes, and measuring the cross-validated performance of a Naive Bayes classifier, I demonstrate the core concept of wrapper feature selection.

In practice, I recommend adopting a systematic approach: start by applying filter methods for preliminary dimensionality reduction, then employ wrapper methods like RFE or forward selection to further refine the feature selection process. It is also critical to evaluate the performance of the model on an entirely held-out test set (that has not been used in any training or validation procedure) after selecting the features, to accurately understand if generalization was achieved. Additionally, data preprocessing tasks, such as scaling or normalization, are often beneficial before feature selection to guarantee the statistical validity of the techniques used.

For further study, I recommend exploring texts on statistical learning and machine learning, specifically covering feature engineering and model selection. Books detailing the fundamentals of statistical hypothesis testing can also be beneficial. Furthermore, the documentation of Python libraries such as scikit-learn provides more information about specific implementations of the techniques that I have presented.
