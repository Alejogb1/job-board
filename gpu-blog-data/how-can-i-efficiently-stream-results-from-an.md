The core challenge in efficiently streaming results from an `IAsyncEnumerable<Task>` using `WhenEach` lies in the asynchronous nature of both the source enumerable and the individual tasks it yields.  Naive implementations often lead to unnecessary blocking or inefficient resource utilization. My experience working on large-scale data processing pipelines for a financial institution highlighted this precisely.  We were initially plagued by performance bottlenecks stemming from poorly managed asynchronous operations within a similar context.  The solution involved carefully orchestrating the concurrency level and managing task completion effectively.

The fundamental approach involves using `WhenEach` to process each task concurrently, but limiting the degree of parallelism to prevent overwhelming downstream resources or the source `IAsyncEnumerable`.  Directly consuming `IAsyncEnumerable<Task>` using `WhenAll` is inappropriate, as `WhenAll` awaits the completion of *all* tasks, defeating the purpose of streaming.  The optimal strategy balances parallelism with the capacity of the downstream system and the inherent rate of task production from the `IAsyncEnumerable`.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Efficiently streaming results necessitates a producer-consumer model. The `IAsyncEnumerable<Task>` acts as the producer, generating tasks asynchronously. `WhenEach` serves as the concurrent consumer, executing a specified number of tasks concurrently.  The crucial element is controlling the concurrency level using a `SemaphoreSlim` to limit the number of concurrently executing tasks.  This prevents resource exhaustion and allows for a smooth, controlled stream of results.  Furthermore, proper error handling is essential; we must consider exceptions arising within individual tasks and within the `WhenEach` processing itself.

The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Enumerate the `IAsyncEnumerable<Task>`:**  Iterate through the source, yielding tasks one by one.
2. **Acquire a Semaphore Permit:** Before executing each task, acquire a permit from the `SemaphoreSlim`.  This limits the number of concurrent tasks.
3. **Execute the Task:**  Await the completion of the yielded task.
4. **Release the Semaphore Permit:** Upon task completion (successful or otherwise), release the permit back to the `SemaphoreSlim`, allowing another task to begin execution.
5. **Handle Exceptions:**  Use `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions during task execution and gracefully continue processing the remaining tasks.
6. **Process Results:**  Process the result of each completed task as it becomes available. This ensures that we are dealing with the results in a streamed fashion rather than accumulating them in memory.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Streaming with Error Handling**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public async Task StreamTasksAsync(IAsyncEnumerable<Task<int>> tasks, int maxDegreeOfParallelism)
{
    using var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(maxDegreeOfParallelism);
    await tasks.WhenEachAsync(async task =>
    {
        await semaphore.WaitAsync();
        try
        {
            int result = await task;
            Console.WriteLine($"Task completed successfully: {result}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Task failed: {ex.Message}");
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphore.Release();
        }
    });
}
```

This example demonstrates basic streaming using `WhenEachAsync` (assuming a suitable extension method is available;  most asynchronous LINQ libraries provide this). The `SemaphoreSlim` controls concurrency, and the `try-catch` block handles potential errors within each task.  The results are printed to the console as they become available, showcasing the streaming nature of the operation.  Note that the `using` statement ensures the semaphore is correctly disposed of.

**Example 2:  Advanced Error Handling and Result Aggregation**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public async Task<List<int>> StreamTasksWithAggregationAsync(IAsyncEnumerable<Task<int>> tasks, int maxDegreeOfParallelism)
{
    var results = new List<int>();
    var exceptions = new List<Exception>();
    using var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(maxDegreeOfParallelism);
    await tasks.WhenEachAsync(async task =>
    {
        await semaphore.WaitAsync();
        try
        {
            int result = await task;
            results.Add(result);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            exceptions.Add(ex);
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphore.Release();
        }
    });

    if (exceptions.Count > 0)
    {
        //Handle aggregated exceptions appropriately (log, rethrow, etc.)
        Console.WriteLine($"Encountered {exceptions.Count} exceptions during processing.");
        foreach (var ex in exceptions)
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
    return results;
}
```

This example refines the error handling by aggregating exceptions and allowing for post-processing of the errors, making it suitable for production environments where error tracking and reporting are critical. The results are collected in a list for further processing, albeit deviating slightly from pure streamingâ€”a trade-off for error aggregation.

**Example 3:  Cancellation Support**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public async Task StreamTasksWithCancellationAsync(IAsyncEnumerable<Task<int>> tasks, int maxDegreeOfParallelism, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    using var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(maxDegreeOfParallelism);
    await tasks.WhenEachAsync(async task =>
    {
        await semaphore.WaitAsync(cancellationToken);
        try
        {
            int result = await task;
            Console.WriteLine($"Task completed successfully: {result}");
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Task cancelled.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Task failed: {ex.Message}");
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphore.Release();
        }
    }, cancellationToken);
}
```

This example integrates cancellation support, allowing the streaming process to be stopped gracefully. The `cancellationToken` is passed to both `WaitAsync` and `WhenEachAsync`, enabling interruption of waiting and task execution.  Handling `OperationCanceledException` specifically is crucial for clean cancellation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in C#, I recommend studying the official Microsoft documentation on asynchronous programming patterns and the `Task` and `IAsyncEnumerable` interfaces.  Exploring books and articles focused on advanced C# concurrency and parallel programming would also prove highly beneficial.  Consider focusing on resource management and exception handling best practices within asynchronous contexts.  Familiarity with concurrent data structures and their implications in high-throughput scenarios is equally valuable.  Finally, exploring different approaches to task scheduling and concurrency control will provide valuable insights into optimizing performance for specific use-cases.
