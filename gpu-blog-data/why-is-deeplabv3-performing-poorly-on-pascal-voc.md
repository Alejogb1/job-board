The disappointing Intersection over Union (IoU) scores observed with DeepLabV3 on Pascal VOC when implemented in TensorFlow frequently stem from misconfigurations in crucial areas: data preprocessing, model architecture instantiation, training methodology, and post-processing steps. Having wrestled with similar issues during a project involving urban scene understanding, I’ve found that meticulous attention to each stage is critical for achieving acceptable performance. Specifically, a low IoU usually indicates that the model is struggling to accurately delineate object boundaries and distinguish between different semantic classes, resulting in substantial overlap of predicted and ground truth masks.

Firstly, the preprocessing pipeline requires careful consideration. Pascal VOC’s image resolutions are not uniform, and naïve resizing without proper aspect ratio management can distort the image and thus degrade segmentation accuracy. Often, a simple `tf.image.resize` can lead to significant information loss or distortion, particularly in smaller objects. The key here is to maintain the aspect ratio as much as possible during resizing. This might involve padding the image with zeros to ensure a consistent input size for the network, or cropping the image after resizing to fit a specific aspect ratio.

Another preprocessing pitfall lies in the normalization of image data. If the input data is not appropriately normalized (e.g., pixel values between 0 and 1), the gradients during training can become unstable, leading to poor convergence. It is vital to ensure the inputs to the DeepLabV3 model align with its expected range, typically normalized across the mean and standard deviation of the training set, as was often used in the original research. Furthermore, issues during data loading, including incorrect ordering of data or inaccurate labels mapping, can manifest as reduced IoU scores.

Secondly, discrepancies often exist when instantiating the DeepLabV3 model in TensorFlow compared to its original specifications. DeepLabV3 employs an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module, and incorrect configuration of the ASPP, including the rates of atrous convolutions and number of feature maps can significantly impair performance. Further, one must pay attention to the specific backbone employed. Typically, DeepLabV3 is used with a ResNet backbone, and mismatch of the backbone architecture, specifically the number of layers or pre-training weights can have an impact. In my experience, neglecting to employ weights pre-trained on ImageNet has been a common reason for slower convergence and poor final performance. A model trained from scratch would need significantly more data and time to achieve similar performance as a model that starts with good features extracted on a large dataset like ImageNet. Further, if the TensorFlow implementation does not precisely mimic the described skip connections from the backbone to the ASPP module, the model would not perform as expected.

Thirdly, training parameters, including the choice of loss function, optimizer and learning rate schedule need scrutiny. The cross-entropy loss function is often used for semantic segmentation but needs to be implemented correctly with specific focus on class imbalance. Pascal VOC exhibits some classes with fewer samples than others which can bias the learning. I have found that introducing class weights during the loss calculation greatly ameliorates this issue. A proper learning rate schedule, like polynomial decay, is required to achieve convergence. Additionally, inappropriate mini-batch sizes, especially using ones that are too small, can introduce noise during the training process, slowing convergence and leading to sub-par IoU scores. Finally, lacking sufficient regularization, such as dropout or weight decay, can cause the model to overfit the training dataset leading to poor generalization on test data.

Finally, post-processing errors can also significantly contribute to lower IoU scores. For example, if the model produces class probabilities for each pixel, taking the `argmax` over these probabilities will generate the final segmentation map. If the class labels used in the prediction do not match the original Pascal VOC class encoding, the IoU values will be misleadingly low. Moreover, employing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to refine the segmentation masks, as originally suggested by the DeepLab researchers, may be crucial to achieve state-of-the-art results. Omitting CRF will lead to jagged segmentation masks which will lower the IoU.

Let us look at some code examples illustrating these points.

**Code Example 1: Aspect-ratio preserving resizing with padding**

This example demonstrates aspect-ratio preserving resizing with padding using TensorFlow. Here we calculate the resize ratio, add padding to the image, and finally perform the resize with linear interpolation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def resize_with_padding(image, target_height, target_width):
    """Resizes an image while preserving aspect ratio and padding as needed."""
    img_height = tf.shape(image)[0]
    img_width = tf.shape(image)[1]

    height_ratio = tf.cast(target_height, tf.float32) / tf.cast(img_height, tf.float32)
    width_ratio = tf.cast(target_width, tf.float32) / tf.cast(img_width, tf.float32)
    
    ratio = tf.minimum(height_ratio, width_ratio)
    new_height = tf.cast(tf.round(tf.cast(img_height, tf.float32) * ratio), tf.int32)
    new_width = tf.cast(tf.round(tf.cast(img_width, tf.float32) * ratio), tf.int32)

    resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, [new_height, new_width], method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR)

    padding_height = target_height - new_height
    padding_width = target_width - new_width

    padding_top = padding_height // 2
    padding_bottom = padding_height - padding_top
    padding_left = padding_width // 2
    padding_right = padding_width - padding_left

    padded_image = tf.pad(resized_image, [[padding_top, padding_bottom],
                                         [padding_left, padding_right],
                                         [0, 0]], constant_values=0) # pad with zeros

    return padded_image

# Example usage
image = tf.random.normal(shape=[200, 300, 3])
resized_padded_image = resize_with_padding(image, 512, 512)
print(resized_padded_image.shape) # Output will be (512, 512, 3)
```

This function helps achieve consistent input sizes for the DeepLabV3 model without losing important object context through naive resizing. Here, we calculate the ratios and pad the image such that the original aspect ratio of the image is preserved. This function also pads the image with zeros so that a fixed sized input tensor is obtained for the model.

**Code Example 2: Correct implementation of ASPP with specific rates**

This example demonstrates a basic ASPP implementation within TensorFlow. I have included the atrous convolutions and batch normalization to mirror the original architecture. The rate parameters are specific for DeepLabV3 architecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class ASPP(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, rate1=6, rate2=12, rate3=18, **kwargs):
        super(ASPP, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.conv1 = layers.Conv2D(filters, 1, padding='same', use_bias=False)
        self.bn1 = layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.conv2 = layers.Conv2D(filters, 3, padding='same', dilation_rate=rate1, use_bias=False)
        self.bn2 = layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.conv3 = layers.Conv2D(filters, 3, padding='same', dilation_rate=rate2, use_bias=False)
        self.bn3 = layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.conv4 = layers.Conv2D(filters, 3, padding='same', dilation_rate=rate3, use_bias=False)
        self.bn4 = layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.global_avg_pooling = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()
        self.conv5 = layers.Conv2D(filters, 1, padding='same', use_bias=False)
        self.bn5 = layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.concat = layers.Concatenate()
        self.final_conv = layers.Conv2D(filters, 1, padding='same', use_bias=False)
        self.final_bn = layers.BatchNormalization()


    def call(self, x, training=False):
        y1 = tf.nn.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x), training=training))
        y2 = tf.nn.relu(self.bn2(self.conv2(x), training=training))
        y3 = tf.nn.relu(self.bn3(self.conv3(x), training=training))
        y4 = tf.nn.relu(self.bn4(self.conv4(x), training=training))
        
        y5 = self.global_avg_pooling(x)
        y5 = tf.expand_dims(tf.expand_dims(y5, axis=1), axis=1)
        y5 = tf.nn.relu(self.bn5(self.conv5(y5), training=training))
        
        y5 = tf.image.resize(y5, tf.shape(x)[1:3], method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR)

        y = self.concat([y1, y2, y3, y4, y5])
        y = tf.nn.relu(self.final_bn(self.final_conv(y), training=training))

        return y
    
# Example usage:
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, 64, 64, 256])
aspp_module = ASPP(filters=256)
output_tensor = aspp_module(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Output shape should be (1, 64, 64, 256)

```

This demonstrates a clear instantiation of the ASPP module with correct rates. We include 1x1 convolution, different rates of atrous convolutions, batch normalization and global average pooling. All these are crucial for correct ASPP operation. This module can be plugged into the DeepLabV3 model to generate proper features.

**Code Example 3: Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss Implementation**

This code example shows how to implement a class weighted cross entropy loss to address imbalanced data. The class weights are calculated from the training data, with more frequently seen classes having lower weights.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred, class_weights):
    """Calculates the weighted cross-entropy loss."""
    y_true_reshaped = tf.reshape(y_true, [-1])
    y_pred_reshaped = tf.reshape(y_pred, [-1, tf.shape(y_pred)[-1]])

    one_hot_labels = tf.one_hot(tf.cast(y_true_reshaped, tf.int32), depth=tf.shape(y_pred)[-1])
    weights = tf.gather(class_weights, tf.cast(y_true_reshaped, tf.int32))

    loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=one_hot_labels, logits=y_pred_reshaped)
    weighted_loss = loss * weights
    return tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss)


#Example Usage
# Assuming you have computed class weights:
class_weights_values = [0.1, 1.2, 0.8, 1.1, 0.9] # Replace with your actual class weights

class_weights_tensor = tf.constant(class_weights_values, dtype=tf.float32)
y_true = tf.random.uniform(shape=[4, 128, 128], minval=0, maxval=4, dtype=tf.int32)
y_pred = tf.random.normal(shape=[4, 128, 128, 5]) # assuming 5 classes

loss = weighted_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred, class_weights_tensor)
print(loss)
```

Here, we see that the pixel-wise cross-entropy loss is weighted by the class weights so that the contribution of smaller classes to the overall loss is increased and thus better represented in the training. This can improve the final accuracy as well as the IoU score of the model.

In summary, several factors can lead to low IoU scores when using DeepLabV3 on the Pascal VOC dataset in TensorFlow. By addressing issues in data preprocessing, accurately implementing the model architecture, using appropriate training procedures and implementing suitable post-processing, the performance of DeepLabV3 can be significantly improved. It requires a detailed understanding and implementation of all its components.

For further study, I recommend researching the original DeepLabV3 paper, and familiarizing yourself with other semantic segmentation best practices. The TensorFlow documentation itself and examples in the keras repository are also excellent resources. Reviewing materials from recent computer vision conferences can also help provide detailed analysis. Experimentation and debugging with a structured approach are crucial to ensure optimal performance.
