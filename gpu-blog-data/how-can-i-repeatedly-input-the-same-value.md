The core challenge in repeatedly inputting the same value to a Keras model without escalating memory consumption lies in understanding how Keras handles data during training and inference.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network deployments has shown that naive repetition leads to redundant data allocation in memory, especially when dealing with substantial datasets or complex model architectures. The solution hinges on leveraging TensorFlow's underlying mechanisms for efficient tensor management and avoiding unnecessary data duplication.  This necessitates a shift from directly feeding repeated data to employing techniques that effectively recycle tensor objects.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The problem stems from Keras's default behavior. When you feed data to a Keras model, it typically creates new TensorFlow tensors for each input batch. Repeatedly feeding the same input thus generates many identical tensors, leading to a linear increase in memory usage with the number of repetitions.  To mitigate this, we need to prevent the creation of new tensors for each input iteration.  Instead, we should reuse the same tensor object.  This can be achieved through careful manipulation of TensorFlow tensors and the understanding of Keras's data handling pipeline.  Specifically, we need to maintain a single tensor representing the repeated input and directly pass this object to the Keras model's `predict` or `fit` methods in each iteration.  Garbage collection will then handle the removal of the tensor only when it's no longer referenced, preventing the memory leak.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using a Pre-allocated Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,))])

# Repeated input data
repeated_input = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])

# Pre-allocate a TensorFlow tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant(repeated_input, dtype=tf.float32)

# Repeated prediction without memory increase
for _ in range(1000):
    prediction = model(input_tensor)
    # Process prediction...

```

*Commentary:* This example avoids memory bloat by creating a single `tf.constant` tensor holding the repeated input data.  Subsequent predictions reuse this same tensor object, preventing the creation of new tensors for each iteration. This is efficient for repeated inference.


**Example 2: Using tf.function for Computational Graph Optimization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,))])

@tf.function
def predict_repeated(input_tensor):
    return model(input_tensor)

# Repeated input data
repeated_input = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])

# Pre-allocate a TensorFlow tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant(repeated_input, dtype=tf.float32)

# Repeated prediction leveraging tf.function
for _ in range(1000):
    prediction = predict_repeated(input_tensor)
    # Process prediction...

```

*Commentary:*  This approach leverages `tf.function` to compile the prediction loop into a TensorFlow graph. This graph optimization significantly improves performance and reduces memory overhead by minimizing the creation of intermediate tensors during repeated executions.


**Example 3: Handling Batched Repeated Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,))])

# Repeated input data (batched)
repeated_input = np.tile([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]], (100, 1))  # 100 repetitions

# Pre-allocate a TensorFlow tensor for batched input
input_tensor = tf.constant(repeated_input, dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform prediction on the batch
predictions = model(input_tensor)

# Process predictions (accessing individual predictions via indexing)
# for i in range(100):
#     individual_prediction = predictions[i]
#     #Process individual_prediction

```

*Commentary:* For numerous repetitions, creating a batched input tensor is more efficient than iterating.  The model processes the entire batch in a single operation.  This reduces the overhead associated with multiple individual calls to the model.  Individual predictions can then be accessed through indexing.  However, if memory is severely constrained, this approach might still exceed limitations for an extremely large number of repetitions.  In such cases, the first two methods may need to be combined with careful batch size selection to balance memory use and processing time.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow tensor management, I would strongly suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, exploring materials on computational graph optimization within TensorFlow will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms used in the second code example.  Finally, reviewing Keras's internal data flow mechanisms will illuminate the subtle points of data handling crucial to efficient memory management. These resources, combined with practical experimentation, will solidify your understanding and help you tailor these techniques to your specific application.
