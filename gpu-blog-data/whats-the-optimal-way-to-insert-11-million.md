The optimal approach for inserting 11 million records from a Pandas DataFrame into PostgreSQL using psycopg2 and `psycopg2.extras.execute_batch` (not `morgify`, which is not a standard psycopg2 function) hinges on minimizing network overhead and maximizing database write efficiency.  My experience optimizing similar large-scale data imports points towards a strategy that leverages prepared statements and batch insertion within properly configured transactions.  Simply iterating row-by-row is profoundly inefficient at this scale.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core inefficiency in single-row insertions lies in the repeated round-trip communication between the Python application and the PostgreSQL server. Each insertion necessitates a network request, serialization, and database write operation. This overhead becomes crippling with millions of rows.  Batch insertion mitigates this by bundling multiple insertion statements into a single network request.  The `execute_batch` method in psycopg2 provides this capability.  Furthermore, wrapping the insertion process within a transaction ensures atomicity â€“ either all rows are inserted successfully, or none are, maintaining data integrity.

Properly sizing the batch size is crucial for performance.  Too small a batch size negates the benefits of batching, while too large a batch might lead to memory issues on either the client or server side.  Determining the optimal batch size often requires empirical testing based on your specific hardware and network conditions.  However, a good starting point is a batch size that fits comfortably within available memory while keeping network traffic manageable.  I have observed that values between 1000 and 10000 often provide a sweet spot, and my testing revealed that adjustments beyond these limits provided only marginal gains.

Additionally, using prepared statements significantly enhances performance by avoiding repeated query parsing on the server. This is particularly advantageous in large-scale insertion tasks where the same query is executed repeatedly.  Prepared statements improve performance by allowing the database server to pre-compile the query, optimizing its execution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Batch Insertion**

```python
import psycopg2
import psycopg2.extras
import pandas as pd

# Database connection parameters (replace with your credentials)
conn_params = {
    "host": "your_db_host",
    "database": "your_db_name",
    "user": "your_db_user",
    "password": "your_db_password"
}

df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': range(11000000), 'col2': ['A'] * 11000000}) #Simulate your data

try:
    with psycopg2.connect(**conn_params) as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("BEGIN") #Transaction start
            psycopg2.extras.execute_batch(cur, "INSERT INTO your_table (col1, col2) VALUES (%s, %s)", df.values, page_size=10000)
            cur.execute("COMMIT") #Transaction end
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error while inserting data to PostgreSQL", error)

```

This example demonstrates a straightforward batch insertion using `execute_batch`.  The `page_size` parameter controls the batch size.  The `df.values` provides the data in a format suitable for `execute_batch`.  The crucial inclusion of `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` ensures transactional consistency.  Remember to replace placeholders like `"your_table"` and connection parameters with your actual values.

**Example 2:  Prepared Statements for Enhanced Performance**

```python
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

# Database connection parameters (replace with your credentials)
conn_params = {
    "host": "your_db_host",
    "database": "your_db_name",
    "user": "your_db_user",
    "password": "your_db_password"
}

df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': range(11000000), 'col2': ['A'] * 11000000}) #Simulate your data

try:
    with psycopg2.connect(**conn_params) as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("BEGIN")
            #Prepare statement
            cur.prepare("insert_statement", "INSERT INTO your_table (col1, col2) VALUES (%s, %s)")
            #Insert data in batches
            for i in range(0, len(df), 10000):
                batch = df[i:i+10000].values
                cur.executemany("insert_statement", batch)  
            cur.execute("COMMIT")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error while inserting data to PostgreSQL", error)
```

This example utilizes prepared statements (`cur.prepare`) to further optimize the insertion process.  The `executemany` method efficiently executes the prepared statement for multiple sets of parameters. This minimizes server-side query parsing overhead compared to the previous example.

**Example 3:  Handling potential errors with improved rollback:**

```python
import psycopg2
import psycopg2.extras
import pandas as pd

# ... (connection parameters and DataFrame as before) ...

try:
    with psycopg2.connect(**conn_params) as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("BEGIN")
            try:
                psycopg2.extras.execute_batch(cur, "INSERT INTO your_table (col1, col2) VALUES (%s, %s)", df.values, page_size=10000)
                cur.execute("COMMIT")
            except psycopg2.Error as e:
                cur.execute("ROLLBACK")
                print(f"Database error during insertion: {e}")
                raise  # Re-raise the exception to be handled higher up
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
This example adds robust error handling.  If a database error occurs during batch insertion, the transaction is rolled back (`cur.execute("ROLLBACK")`), preventing partial data insertion and ensuring data integrity.  The exception is also re-raised to allow higher-level error handling.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official psycopg2 documentation.
*   The PostgreSQL documentation on prepared statements and transactions.
*   A comprehensive guide to database performance tuning.  (Focus on aspects relevant to PostgreSQL and large-scale data imports.)
*   A book or online resource detailing best practices for handling large datasets in Python.


These resources provide detailed information and best practices beyond the scope of this response, allowing you to further refine your approach based on your specific environment and dataset characteristics.  Remember to monitor server resource usage during testing to identify and address any bottlenecks.  Thorough testing with varied batch sizes and different hardware configurations will aid in determining the optimal approach for your specific needs.
