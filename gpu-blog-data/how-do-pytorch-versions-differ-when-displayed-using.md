The discrepancy observed between the PyTorch version reported by `pip3 show torch` and `torch.__version__` stems from the nuanced interaction between Python's package management system and PyTorch's internal versioning mechanism.  My experience working on large-scale deep learning projects, often involving distributed training setups, has highlighted the importance of understanding this difference to avoid unexpected behavior and compatibility issues.  It's crucial to appreciate that `pip3 show torch` reflects the installed package's metadata, while `torch.__version__` accesses the version string embedded within the PyTorch library itself. This distinction becomes critical when dealing with pre-built wheels, custom builds, or situations where the installation process hasn't perfectly synchronized these two aspects.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`pip3 show torch` queries the `pip` package manager for information about the installed 'torch' package. This information is sourced from the package metadata, specifically the `PKG-INFO` file within the installed distribution.  This metadata is populated during the installation process and usually reflects the version number of the PyTorch package as declared by the installer. It represents the external view of the installed PyTorch version, governed by the package manager.

`torch.__version__` on the other hand, directly accesses a string variable within the PyTorch library itself. This variable is set during the PyTorch build process and contains the version number as it was compiled. This reflects the internal view of the PyTorch version, determined at compile time.

Inconsistencies arise primarily due to a mismatch between these two version numbers.  Several scenarios can cause this:

* **Pre-built wheels:** When installing PyTorch using pre-compiled wheels, a discrepancy may arise if the wheel's metadata (used by `pip`) is not perfectly synchronized with the version number embedded within the library code itself. This is often due to packaging discrepancies or updates during the wheel creation process.

* **Custom builds:** If PyTorch was compiled from source, the version string in the library (`torch.__version__`) might differ from the version specified during installation if custom versioning was employed. The `pip` metadata might not be updated to reflect this custom version string.

* **Installation errors:** Partial or incomplete installations can lead to inconsistencies. In such cases, `pip` might report a version while the actual library files might not reflect that version, potentially leading to `torch.__version__` reporting an older or even completely different version, or even raising an error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Standard Installation**

```python
import torch
import subprocess

pip_version = subprocess.check_output(['pip3', 'show', 'torch']).decode('utf-8')
torch_version = torch.__version__

print(f"pip3 show torch output:\n{pip_version}\n")
print(f"torch.__version__ output:\n{torch_version}\n")
```

This example demonstrates a standard approach to retrieving both versions.  The `subprocess` module is used to run the `pip3 show` command externally and capture its output. The `decode('utf-8')` call ensures proper string handling across different systems. In a typical, correctly installed scenario, both versions should match.

**Example 2: Simulated Discrepancy using Virtual Environments**

```python
import torch
import subprocess
import sys
import os

# Create a virtual environment (replace with your preferred method if needed)
venv_path = "test_env"
os.makedirs(venv_path, exist_ok=True)
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "venv", venv_path])

# Activate the virtual environment
venv_bin = os.path.join(venv_path, "bin" if sys.platform != "win32" else "Scripts")
activate_script = os.path.join(venv_bin, "activate")
os.environ["VIRTUAL_ENV"] = venv_path
subprocess.run([activate_script], shell=True)

# Install a specific PyTorch version (replace with your desired version)
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "torch==1.13.1"], check=True)

#Import torch after installation.
import torch

pip_version = subprocess.check_output([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "show", "torch"]).decode('utf-8')
torch_version = torch.__version__


print(f"pip3 show torch output:\n{pip_version}\n")
print(f"torch.__version__ output:\n{torch_version}\n")


# Deactivate the virtual environment
subprocess.run([activate_script, "deactivate"], shell=True)
```

This example simulates a scenario where you might encounter version discrepancies by installing different PyTorch versions within virtual environments, highlighting the importance of consistent management. The use of a virtual environment ensures the example doesn't interfere with your system's default PyTorch installation.  Note that the specific version numbers are placeholders; adjust them as needed.


**Example 3: Handling Potential Errors**

```python
import torch
import subprocess

try:
    pip_version = subprocess.check_output(['pip3', 'show', 'torch']).decode('utf-8')
    torch_version = torch.__version__
    print(f"pip3 show torch output:\n{pip_version}\n")
    print(f"torch.__version__ output:\n{torch_version}\n")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: PyTorch not found.  Ensure it is installed.")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error executing pip3 show: {e}")
except ImportError:
    print("Error: torch module not imported correctly.")

```

This example incorporates robust error handling, critical for production-level code. It gracefully handles scenarios where PyTorch is not installed (`FileNotFoundError`), the `pip` command fails (`subprocess.CalledProcessError`), or the `torch` module can't be imported (`ImportError`). This defensive programming prevents abrupt crashes and provides informative error messages.
