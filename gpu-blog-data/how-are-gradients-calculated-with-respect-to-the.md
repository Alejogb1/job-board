Gradients in Keras, specifically concerning the output node, are calculated via the backpropagation algorithm, which relies heavily on the chain rule of calculus. I’ve personally wrestled with understanding this during my deep learning work, particularly when debugging complex, custom layer implementations. The core idea is to iteratively compute partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases at each layer, working backwards from the final output layer.

The backpropagation process begins by calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the output layer's activations. If we denote the loss function as *L*, the output layer activations as *a*, and the weighted sum input to the output layer as *z*, then the initial gradient is *∂L/∂a*. This derivative represents the sensitivity of the loss to changes in the output activations. For example, with a mean squared error loss function, where *L = 1/2 * (y_true - y_pred)^2*, and *y_pred* represents the output activations *a*, then *∂L/∂a = -(y_true - y_pred)*. This value is dependent on the activation function used for the output layer. If the activation function is linear, which is common for regression tasks, then the derivative of the activation with respect to the input is 1, but if using sigmoid or softmax for classification tasks, the derivative will be based on the activation equation.

After calculating the derivative with respect to output activations, the next step is to compute the derivative of the output activations with respect to the weighted input, *∂a/∂z*. This derivative depends entirely on the activation function used in the output layer. Once obtained, we use the chain rule to combine the previous two results to calculate the derivative of the loss with respect to the weighted inputs: *∂L/∂z = ∂L/∂a * ∂a/∂z*. For instance, if a sigmoid activation function was applied at the output, then *∂a/∂z = a(1-a)*, which would be multiplied with the *∂L/∂a* result.

The core of the backpropagation algorithm is that these derivatives, *∂L/∂z*, are now used to update the weights and biases of the output layer. This is done based on the equation *∂L/∂w = ∂L/∂z * x*, where *x* is the input to the output layer. Similarly, the derivative with respect to bias *b* is *∂L/∂b = ∂L/∂z*. Once the gradients for the output layer have been calculated, the process is repeated for each layer, moving backwards towards the input layer. The chain rule is employed repeatedly in each layer to propagate the gradients from the output all the way back to the first layer.

Crucially, Keras handles most of this gradient computation automatically through its underlying tensor manipulation libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The framework keeps track of the operations performed during the forward pass, including the activation functions used. This recorded graph is used during backpropagation to compute the required gradients at each step.

Here are three illustrative code examples with brief commentary:

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple linear model (1 input, 1 output)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear', input_shape=(1,))
])

# Mean squared error as the loss function
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Sample training data
x_train = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_train = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      y_pred = model(x_train)
      loss = loss_fn(y_train, y_pred)

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

  if epoch % 100 == 0:
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}')
```

*Commentary:* In this example, the output layer has a linear activation. The `tf.GradientTape` automatically tracks operations, and when `tape.gradient` is called, TensorFlow computes the *∂L/∂w* and *∂L/∂b* for the dense layer, taking the derivative of the mean squared error loss and the linear activation into account. The `optimizer.apply_gradients` applies these calculated gradients to update the weights and bias.

**Example 2: Binary Classification with Sigmoid Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a dense layer with a sigmoid output
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(2,))
])


# Binary cross-entropy loss
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)


# Sample training data
x_train = tf.constant([[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_train = tf.constant([[0.0], [1.0], [1.0], [0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(5000):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x_train)
        loss = loss_fn(y_train, y_pred)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


    if epoch % 500 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}')
```

*Commentary:* This example uses a sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification. The binary cross-entropy loss function is used. When gradients are calculated by `tape.gradient`, both the derivative of the loss function and the derivative of the sigmoid activation are used to correctly update the network parameters. The computed gradients will therefore take into account that the output is constrained to the (0, 1) range due to the sigmoid.

**Example 3: Multi-class classification with Softmax Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition with softmax output
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax', input_shape=(4,))
])

# Categorical cross-entropy loss
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Sample training data
x_train = tf.random.normal((10, 4))
y_train = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((10,), minval=0, maxval=3, dtype=tf.int32), depth=3)


# Training Loop
for epoch in range(2000):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x_train)
        loss = loss_fn(y_train, y_pred)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


    if epoch % 200 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}')
```

*Commentary:* This final example showcases multi-class classification with a softmax activation in the output layer. The categorical cross-entropy loss is applied. The gradients computed via `tape.gradient` take the derivative of both this loss function and the softmax into account. Specifically, the derivative of the softmax will be a Jacobian matrix, as there are multiple output units. The backpropagation algorithm will correctly propagate the loss through this output layer to update all weights and biases.

For further exploration, I recommend examining resources dedicated to the mathematics of backpropagation, specifically looking for detailed explanations of the chain rule. Publications focused on deep learning theory, as well as documentation of the specific backend libraries used by Keras, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are valuable. These resources provide the mathematical underpinnings necessary for an in-depth comprehension of how gradients are computed with respect to output nodes.
