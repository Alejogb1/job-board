Tensor creation from existing tensors and numbers is fundamentally about leveraging broadcasting and tensor manipulation functions provided by libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow.  My experience working on large-scale physics simulations highlighted the critical importance of efficient tensor construction, particularly when dealing with multi-dimensional data representing fields, particle properties, and their interactions.  Understanding the interplay between broadcasting rules and explicit reshaping is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The creation of new tensors from existing ones and scalar values (numbers) relies heavily on the concept of broadcasting.  Broadcasting is a mechanism that implicitly expands the dimensions of smaller tensors to match the larger tensor's shape before element-wise operations.  This avoids explicit reshaping in many cases, leading to more concise and often faster code.  However, it is crucial to understand that broadcasting has specific rules; mismatch in dimensions can lead to errors.  When broadcasting is insufficient or undesirable, explicit reshaping using functions like `reshape()`, `transpose()`, and `concatenate()` becomes necessary.  Further, various tensor creation functions directly build new tensors based on provided data, including initialization with specific values or random number generation.

When creating tensors from existing ones and numbers, we should consider the following:

* **Data Types:** Ensure consistent data types across all input tensors and scalar values to avoid implicit type conversions that can negatively impact performance or lead to unexpected results.
* **Shape Compatibility:**  Understand the broadcasting rules to ensure that operations are well-defined.  Explicit reshaping might be required to align dimensions.
* **Memory Management:**  For extremely large tensors, creating new tensors through concatenation or stacking can lead to significant memory overhead.  Consider in-place operations or more memory-efficient alternatives when dealing with limited resources.
* **Library Specific Functions:**  Different libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch) offer their own set of tensor creation functions, with some variations in syntax and capabilities.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Broadcasting and Element-wise Operations:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Existing tensor
tensor_a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Scalar value
scalar_value = 5

# Broadcasting: scalar is implicitly expanded to match tensor_a's shape
tensor_b = tensor_a + scalar_value  # tensor_b will be [[6, 7], [8, 9]]

# Broadcasting with another tensor (must follow broadcasting rules)
tensor_c = np.array([10, 20])
tensor_d = tensor_a * tensor_c #tensor_d will be [[10, 40], [30, 80]]

print(tensor_b)
print(tensor_d)
```

This example demonstrates how broadcasting seamlessly expands the scalar `scalar_value` and `tensor_c` to match the dimensions of `tensor_a` before performing element-wise addition and multiplication, respectively.  Note that the shapes of the tensors involved must be compatible for broadcasting to work correctly.  Incompatible shapes would result in a `ValueError`.


**Example 2:  Explicit Reshaping and Concatenation:**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor_e = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
tensor_f = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10]])

# Reshape tensor_e to be 2x3
tensor_e_reshaped = tensor_e.reshape((2, 3))

# Concatenate tensor_e_reshaped and tensor_f along axis 0 (vertically)
tensor_g = np.concatenate((tensor_e_reshaped, tensor_f), axis=0)

print(tensor_e_reshaped)
print(tensor_g)
```

This showcases explicit reshaping using `reshape()` and concatenation using `concatenate()`.  `reshape()` modifies the shape of `tensor_e` without changing its data. `concatenate()` joins tensors along a specified axis. Note that the axis argument is crucial for correct concatenation; incorrect axis specification will result in an error.  Careful consideration of tensor shapes is necessary to avoid errors.



**Example 3:  Tensor Creation with Initialization and Random Numbers:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a tensor filled with zeros
tensor_h = np.zeros((2, 3))

# Creating a tensor filled with ones
tensor_i = np.ones((3, 2), dtype=np.int32) #explicit dtype for demonstration


# Creating a tensor with random values from a uniform distribution
tensor_j = np.random.rand(4, 4)

#Creating a tensor from a list
list_data = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
tensor_k = np.array(list_data)

print(tensor_h)
print(tensor_i)
print(tensor_j)
print(tensor_k)

```

This demonstrates several ways to create new tensors from scratch, rather than manipulating existing ones.  `np.zeros()` and `np.ones()` initialize tensors with all elements set to zero or one, respectively. `np.random.rand()` generates a tensor with random values drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.  The last example shows how a simple list can be directly converted into a NumPy array which is a tensor.  Data type specifications (e.g., `dtype=np.int32`) can be included for explicit type control.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation, I highly recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen library (NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).  Furthermore, textbooks on linear algebra and numerical methods often provide valuable theoretical background on the underlying mathematical concepts.  Finally, exploring online tutorials and example code repositories can greatly enhance your practical skills.  These resources will significantly aid you in mastering more advanced tensor operations and optimizing your code for efficiency.  Remember that consistent practice is key to developing proficiency in tensor manipulation.
