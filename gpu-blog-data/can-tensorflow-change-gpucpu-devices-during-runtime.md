TensorFlow's device placement strategy isn't inherently dynamic; it primarily relies on a static assignment at graph construction or during eager execution.  However, achieving runtime device switching necessitates leveraging specific TensorFlow functionalities and carefully managing the computational graph's structure.  My experience with large-scale model training and deployment has underscored the importance of understanding this nuanced behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's core mechanism for device assignment involves specifying the target device (CPU or GPU) for each operation within the computational graph.  This is typically done during graph construction using `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` or similar constructs for specific operations or variable placement.  Once the graph is finalized, TensorFlow optimizes the execution plan based on the assigned devices.  Changing devices *during* runtime requires more sophisticated techniques.  Directly altering the device of an already-placed operation is generally impossible; instead, you need to create new operations on the desired device and manage data transfer between devices. This transfer overhead is a crucial consideration.

The primary methods for achieving runtime device switching involve:

* **Conditional execution:** Using `tf.cond` or `tf.switch_case` to conditionally execute different portions of the graph based on runtime conditions.  Each branch within the conditional can be assigned to a different device.

* **Placeholder tensors and feed dictionaries:**  Defining placeholder tensors without specific device assignments and then feeding data from different devices during execution using a feed dictionary. This allows some degree of runtime flexibility, though it's less efficient for large, repetitive computations.

* **`tf.distribute.Strategy`:**  For more complex scenarios involving distributed training across multiple GPUs or CPUs, this is the preferred approach. It abstracts away many of the complexities of device placement and data transfer.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Conditional Execution with `tf.cond`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_op(x, device):
    with tf.device(device):
        return tf.math.square(x)

x = tf.constant(10.0)
condition = tf.constant(True) # Change this to switch devices

result = tf.cond(condition, lambda: my_op(x, '/GPU:0'), lambda: my_op(x, '/CPU:0'))

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(result))
```

* **Commentary:** This example showcases `tf.cond` to conditionally execute `my_op` on either the GPU or CPU. The `condition` variable determines the device.  The limitations are clear: only a single operation is conditionally placed, and the entire function runs on a single device per execution.

**Example 2: Placeholder Tensors and Feed Dictionaries**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32)
y = tf.math.square(x)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # Execute on CPU
    cpu_result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: 10.0})
    print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}")

    # Transfer data to GPU (assuming available) and execute
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        gpu_result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: 20.0})
        print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}")
```

* **Commentary:** This demonstrates the use of placeholders. The operation `y` itself isn't explicitly assigned to a device.  Data is fed into the graph from either CPU or GPU memory, allowing for runtime device selection. Note the explicit device placement within the `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` block.  Data transfer is implicit here, affecting performance.


**Example 3: Utilizing `tf.distribute.Strategy` (Simplified)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # For multiple GPUs

with strategy.scope():
    x = tf.Variable(10.0) # Variable is replicated across devices
    y = tf.math.square(x)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    print(strategy.run(lambda: y))
```

* **Commentary:**  This illustrates a simplified use of `tf.distribute.Strategy`.  It handles device placement and data synchronization automatically, ideally across multiple GPUs. While not strictly runtime switching in the sense of changing device mid-computation on a single operation, it effectively distributes the computation across available devices.  This is the most robust and scalable solution for multi-device computation.  Note that the complexity increases significantly when managing heterogeneous device configurations or complex model architectures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's device placement and distributed training capabilities, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering device management, distributed training strategies, and performance optimization.  Several tutorials and example code snippets are available within the documentation and broader TensorFlow community resources.  Additionally, specialized texts on deep learning frameworks and distributed computing would provide valuable supplemental information.  Focusing on in-depth understanding of graph construction and execution is also key.  Finally, experience with profiling tools to analyze performance bottlenecks, particularly data transfer overhead, is invaluable when working with multiple devices.
