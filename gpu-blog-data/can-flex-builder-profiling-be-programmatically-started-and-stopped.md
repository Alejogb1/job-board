No, Flex Builder's built-in profiling mechanism, specifically the one accessible through the GUI, cannot be directly controlled programmatically from within an ActionScript or Flex application. My experience, built over years of developing rich internet applications with Flex, repeatedly reveals this limitation. While we might wish to initiate profiling runs based on user actions or application states, the architecture of the Flex environment doesn't expose the necessary APIs for such manipulation. Instead, the Flex Builder profiler is an external tool interacting with the compiled SWF through a debugging connection, not a component that can be influenced by the application itself. This understanding is crucial, as any attempt to integrate such functionality would require a deep dive into the Adobe Flash Player internals, which are largely undocumented and outside the scope of regular development.

The Flex Builder profiler works by instrumenting the compiled SWF file with additional code at compile time when the "Profile Application" option is enabled during a debug launch. This instrumentation injects hooks throughout the application that capture performance data, like execution times of methods, memory allocation, and garbage collection events. The debugger then receives this data over the debugging socket connection and visualizes it within the Flex Builder IDE. Essentially, the profiling mechanism is entirely separate from the application logic. Consequently, the application itself has no awareness of whether profiling is actively engaged or not. It is effectively blind to the debug profiling infrastructure.

While the integrated profiler is not programmatically controllable, developers can implement custom profiling strategies using ActionScript. This involves manually recording timestamps, tracking function calls, and monitoring memory usage. This custom instrumentation provides insight into application behavior during runtime; however, it is not a substitute for the deep system level information provided by the Flex Builder Profiler. The custom approach can identify performance bottlenecks within the application logic itself but is limited in the type of detailed data provided by the system level introspection.

My first approach would typically revolve around measuring the execution time of specific critical blocks of code. This can be implemented using the `getTimer()` function. This method provides the number of milliseconds elapsed since the player started. By capturing the time at the start and end of code block, we can easily measure its execution duration. Here is an illustrative example:

```actionscript
package
{
    import flash.utils.getTimer;

    public class TimerProfiler
    {
        public function TimerProfiler()
        {
        }

        public static function measureFunction(target:Function, ...args):Number
        {
            var start:Number = getTimer();
            target.apply(null, args);
            var end:Number = getTimer();
            return end - start;
        }

        public static function exampleFunction():void
        {
            for(var i:int = 0; i < 100000; i++)
            {
            	//Simulating some work
                Math.sqrt(i);
            }
        }

        public static function test():void
        {
            var executionTime:Number = measureFunction(exampleFunction);
            trace("exampleFunction execution time: " + executionTime + "ms");
        }

    }
}
```

This `TimerProfiler` class encapsulates the timer-based profiling. The `measureFunction()` accepts a function and any arguments and returns the execution time in milliseconds. The `exampleFunction()` simulates a workload. The `test()` function simply calls the other methods. The result, when the class is utilized, will trace the execution time for the function. This technique is useful for isolating specific problem areas within your application’s code and measuring their performance. Note however, the overhead from the `getTimer()` calls and `apply()` can affect measurements, especially for very short functions and the granularity of the timer is also limited. Therefore, the results are less accurate for functions which execute in sub-millisecond times.

A second method I've often employed involves more detailed memory tracking. Instead of focusing on execution time, this technique monitors the allocated memory. By storing initial memory statistics and then evaluating them after an action, it’s possible to identify memory leaks or inefficient practices that cause increased consumption. The `flash.system.System` class has static properties for garbage collection and memory, which include total memory available, memory used, and a method for calling garbage collection explicitly. This code block demonstrates how to use these tools:

```actionscript
package
{
    import flash.system.System;

    public class MemoryProfiler
    {
        public function MemoryProfiler()
        {
        }

        public static function getMemoryUsage():String
        {
            var currentMemoryUsed:Number = System.totalMemory;
            return "Current memory usage: " + currentMemoryUsed + " bytes";
        }

        public static function trackMemoryUsage(action:Function, ...args):String
        {
            var initialMemory:Number = System.totalMemory;
            action.apply(null, args);
            var memoryUsedAfterAction:Number = System.totalMemory - initialMemory;
            return "Memory usage after action: " + memoryUsedAfterAction + " bytes";
        }

        public static function allocateMemory():void
        {
            var largeArray:Array = [];
            for (var i:int = 0; i < 10000; i++)
            {
                largeArray.push(new Object());
            }
        }


        public static function test():void
        {
             trace(getMemoryUsage());
             trace(trackMemoryUsage(allocateMemory));
             trace(getMemoryUsage());
             System.gc(); //Explicitly call garbage collector
             trace(getMemoryUsage()); // Memory usage after garbage collection
        }
    }
}
```

The `MemoryProfiler` provides methods for reporting overall memory usage and for capturing the change in memory usage after a particular action.  The `allocateMemory()` function simulates allocating memory. The `test()` method utilizes all methods. The class traces the memory usage before and after calling the memory allocation function. It then triggers the garbage collector and reports memory usage a final time.  This detailed information can be invaluable in situations where memory consumption is causing performance degradations. Keep in mind, similar to timer based profiling, garbage collection calls also add overhead and the frequency of their calls should be controlled to avoid performance degradation if used indiscriminately.

Finally, logging function entry and exit can provide an overview of the application call stack and flow. Though it does not provide timing data, it shows which function is called when. It also helps in understanding complex call chains and can be useful in diagnosing performance issues caused by poorly organized function calls. While not profiling, this instrumentation can still highlight areas where performance could be improved. This example demonstrates how to implement such logging:

```actionscript
package
{
   public class FunctionLogger
    {
         public static function logFunctionEntry(functionName:String):void
         {
                trace("Entering Function: " + functionName);
         }

         public static function logFunctionExit(functionName:String):void
         {
                trace("Exiting Function: " + functionName);
         }

        public static function exampleFunction1(param:String):void
         {
                logFunctionEntry("exampleFunction1");
                exampleFunction2(param);
                logFunctionExit("exampleFunction1");
         }


       public static function exampleFunction2(param:String):void
         {
                logFunctionEntry("exampleFunction2");
                trace("Parameter: " + param);
                logFunctionExit("exampleFunction2");
         }


         public static function test():void
         {
             exampleFunction1("test");
         }

    }
}
```

The `FunctionLogger` contains methods for tracing function entry and exit. `exampleFunction1` calls `exampleFunction2`. Each method includes entry and exit logs. The `test()` method calls `exampleFunction1`. When executed, the trace will illustrate the call order of the function calls.  This approach can be beneficial in visually identifying areas where the program flow is not optimal.

While these custom approaches can offer significant insight, they do not replace the detailed system-level information offered by a dedicated profiler. For further learning, I recommend exploring resources detailing the principles of performance analysis, such as books on algorithm design, data structure choices, and advanced ActionScript practices, as well as detailed documents on memory management for Flash Player. Further exploration into application debugging best practices also can provide a deeper understanding of the available tools and techniques. Also consider articles on efficient coding and software design patterns, which can lead to the creation of more performant applications, thereby mitigating some issues that would require profiling. There are also blogs, articles, and conference talks available online discussing advanced ActionScript performance techniques. While Flex Builder’s profiler is inaccessible programmatically, a combination of solid programming practices, and the strategic use of manual instrumentation can provide the performance insight needed to build optimized applications.
