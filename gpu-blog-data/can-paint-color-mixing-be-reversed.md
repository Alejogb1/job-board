The reversibility of paint color mixing is fundamentally constrained by the chemical properties of the pigments involved.  Unlike simple additive mixing of light, subtractive mixing with paints operates through absorption and scattering of light, resulting in a non-linear and often irreversible process. While mathematically, one might attempt to calculate the original components based on the resultant color, practical limitations stemming from pigment interactions and the inherent complexities of color perception render complete reversal improbable. My experience in developing spectral analysis tools for the art restoration field has deeply reinforced this understanding.

**1. Explanation: The Non-Linearity of Subtractive Color Mixing**

The core challenge lies in the subtractive nature of paint mixing.  When we mix paints, each pigment selectively absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while reflecting others. The resulting color we perceive is the composite of the reflected wavelengths. This is significantly different from additive mixing (like with light), where adding wavelengths produces a wider spectrum of light.  For example, mixing cyan and magenta paints doesn't result in a pure white like mixing cyan and magenta *light*. Instead, we get a blue-purple hue due to the overlap of their respective absorption spectra.  This overlap creates a non-linear relationship between the input (pigment quantities) and the output (resulting color).

Furthermore, pigments exhibit complex interactions.  Some pigments can chemically react with others, causing unpredictable color shifts.  This is particularly true with organic pigments, which are more susceptible to chemical degradation and alteration over time.  The phenomenon of flocculation, where pigment particles clump together, also affects the final color, introducing further non-linearity.  These unpredictable factors, often dependent on the specific brand and quality of paints, severely hinder any attempt at precise color reversal.

Color perception itself adds another layer of complexity.  The human eye doesn't perceive color linearly.  The same color can appear different under varying lighting conditions.  Moreover, individual perceptions of color can vary, adding further subjectivity.  Therefore, even if one were to mathematically model the mixing process, translating the resulting numerical representation back to the original pigment quantities would be fraught with inaccuracies, especially when attempting to match individual pigment types.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating the Challenges**

The following examples demonstrate the difficulties of attempting a reverse-engineering approach to color mixing.  These examples use simplified models, acknowledging the real-world complexity discussed above.

**Example 1: Simplified Additive Mixing (for comparison)**

```python
def additive_mix(red, green, blue):
  """Simplified additive color mixing (for illustrative purposes only)."""
  return (red, green, blue)

# Reverse operation is trivial
red, green, blue = additive_mix(100, 50, 200)  # Example values
print(f"Original values: Red: {red}, Green: {green}, Blue: {blue}")

```
This additive example demonstrates a linear relationship, easily reversible. Paint mixing is fundamentally different.


**Example 2:  Simplified Subtractive Mixing Model**

```python
def subtractive_mix(cyan, magenta, yellow, black):
  """Simplified subtractive color mixing (highly simplified model)."""
  # This model ignores pigment interactions and non-linear effects.
  red = 255 - cyan
  green = 255 - magenta
  blue = 255 - yellow
  #Adding black is merely subtracting from RGB, no interaction
  red -= black
  green -= black
  blue -= black

  return (red, green, blue)

# Attempting to reverse-engineer is inherently difficult due to loss of information
red, green, blue = subtractive_mix(100, 50, 200, 50) #Example values
#The reverse-engineering step would not reliably get the correct cyan, magenta, yellow, and black values.

```

This highly simplified model demonstrates that even in an idealized scenario, obtaining the original pigment quantities from the final RGB values is a computationally challenging inverse problem.


**Example 3:  Incorporating a simple interaction effect**

```python
def subtractive_mix_interaction(cyan, magenta, yellow, black, interaction_factor = 0.1):
  """Subtractive mixing with a simple interaction term to simulate pigment interaction."""
  red = 255 - cyan - interaction_factor * (magenta + yellow)
  green = 255 - magenta - interaction_factor * (cyan + yellow)
  blue = 255 - yellow - interaction_factor * (cyan + magenta)
  red -= black
  green -= black
  blue -= black
  return (red, green, blue)

red, green, blue = subtractive_mix_interaction(100, 50, 200, 50)

```
This more sophisticated model, while still extremely simplified, begins to illustrate the difficulties in accounting for inter-pigment interactions when performing a reverse operation.  The interaction factor represents a compounding effect, making the inverse problem increasingly complex.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of color science and pigment interactions, I strongly recommend consulting established textbooks on colorimetry, physical optics, and material science.  Specifically, focusing on spectral reflectance curves and their application in color reproduction will be beneficial.  Exploring the literature on digital color management and image processing can also shed light on the mathematical challenges of color transformation and the limitations of its reversibility. Finally, works detailing the scientific principles behind art restoration will provide practical insights into the real-world complexities of pigment analysis and color reconstruction.
