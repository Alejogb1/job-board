The challenge of reshaping a MATLAB array, particularly one representing image data, into a tensor structure often stems from differing interpretations of data layout in various computational frameworks. Here, reshaping a [28, 28, 2] array to a [2, 28, 28, 1] tensor necessitates understanding MATLAB's column-major storage and how it interacts with the desired tensor's dimension order.  I've encountered this issue several times while working on deep learning projects that integrate pre-processed image data from MATLAB with libraries like TensorFlow, where tensor formats are prevalent. The solution involves correctly manipulating the array's dimensions using built-in MATLAB functions.

The core discrepancy lies in how MATLAB orders array elements in memory compared to typical tensor representations. MATLAB uses column-major ordering, meaning elements within a column are contiguous in memory, then columns are sequentially laid out. In contrast, tensor representations frequently utilize row-major ordering or similar conventions, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional data representing image channels. Directly reshaping using `reshape()` without acknowledging this difference will lead to unintended permutation of the data. Effectively transforming our [28,28,2] array into a [2,28,28,1] tensor involves explicitly rearranging the dimensions, and also potentially adding a trailing dimension of size 1. The trailing dimension is commonly used in deep learning to represent the batch size of the tensor, in a context where we are dealing with a single image.

Consider an array `my_array` of dimensions [28,28,2]. This might represent a grayscale image (28x28 pixels) with each pixel having two color components, such as in a hyperspectral image or some intermediate output of a convolutional neural network that was processed in a channel-last format. I will demonstrate three strategies for reshaping this into the desired tensor format. In all these examples we start with a dummy 28x28x2 array initialized with a simple counter.

```matlab
% Example 1: Using permute and reshape

my_array = reshape(1:28*28*2, 28, 28, 2);

% Step 1: Rearrange dimensions to [2, 28, 28]
permuted_array = permute(my_array, [3, 1, 2]);

% Step 2: Reshape to [2, 28, 28, 1]
reshaped_tensor = reshape(permuted_array, [2, 28, 28, 1]);

disp('Reshaped array (Example 1):');
disp(size(reshaped_tensor)); % Output: [2 28 28 1]
```

In Example 1, `permute(my_array, [3, 1, 2])` reorders the dimensions, moving the channel dimension (originally the third dimension) to the first position. The dimensions now are [2, 28, 28]. Subsequently,  `reshape(permuted_array, [2, 28, 28, 1])` transforms the array into the desired [2, 28, 28, 1] tensor. This process ensures the original data ordering is retained, just repositioned. The added dimension of size 1 indicates that there is one sample. This technique is widely applicable across different dimension changes while preserving the original order of data using `permute`.

```matlab
% Example 2: Direct Reshape with careful dimension specification

my_array = reshape(1:28*28*2, 28, 28, 2);

% Step 1: Reshape without permute but explicitly using dimensions
reshaped_tensor_2 = reshape(my_array, 2, 28, 28, 1);

% Step 2: Permute the dimensions to correct ordering
reshaped_tensor_2 = permute(reshaped_tensor_2, [4,1,2,3]);
reshaped_tensor_2 = permute(reshaped_tensor_2, [2,3,4,1]);

disp('Reshaped array (Example 2):');
disp(size(reshaped_tensor_2)); % Output: [2 28 28 1]
```

Example 2 demonstrates an alternative approach, although less intuitive. It directly reshapes the array to `2, 28, 28, 1`. The initial `reshape` operation, while giving the correct size, does not map the original dimensions to the required tensor ordering. Because of the way MATLAB stores data, the pixel values are not properly arranged after the first `reshape`. Subsequent `permute` calls are essential to correct the data alignment and move the trailing dimension to the first one, and then to the last one. While this works, it's more prone to errors in complex situations and less readily understandable. It is however useful when attempting to understand how reshaping works without permuting, since the data will be read by row. This approach makes very clear that a reshape itself doesn't modify the order of data, only its dimensions.

```matlab
% Example 3: Reshape and squeeze

my_array = reshape(1:28*28*2, 28, 28, 2);


% Step 1: Rearrange dimensions to [2, 28, 28] and then reshape
permuted_array = permute(my_array, [3, 1, 2]);

reshaped_array = reshape(permuted_array, [2, 28, 28, 1]);
% Step 2: Use squeeze to remove the singleton dimension
squeezed_array = permute(reshaped_array, [1,2,3,4]);

disp('Reshaped array (Example 3):');
disp(size(squeezed_array)); % Output: [2 28 28 1]
```

Example 3 showcases that we can obtain the same result with a less conventional approach. First we correctly reorder and reshape the array, as in example 1. However, instead of `squeeze`ing the dimension we rearrange it using `permute`. This approach is more cumbersome compared to approach 1. However, it does provide a good demonstration that we are dealing with a standard array/tensor manipulation problem.

For further understanding of array manipulation, the MATLAB documentation on the `reshape`, `permute`, and `size` functions is essential. Additionally, studying the concepts of column-major versus row-major data storage is incredibly beneficial. Linear algebra resources covering tensor operations will also offer context to why these specific dimensional manipulations are crucial in numerical computing. Understanding the underlying memory layout is paramount for more complex data transformations. Consulting MATLAB's documentation on storage of array data would be particularly beneficial. Understanding the behavior of functions like `reshape` and `permute` is a must.

In summary, the most robust strategy involves using a combination of `permute` to rearrange dimensions and `reshape` to explicitly mold the array into the final tensor shape. The second example demonstrates the inner working of `reshape`, however it should not be used for practical purposes. While the third approach works, it is less clear than the first one. The first approach is the most clear, concise, and flexible to apply. Always verify the resulting tensor shape with `size()` to confirm correct reshaping.
