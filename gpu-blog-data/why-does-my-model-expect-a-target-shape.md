The discrepancy between your model's expected target shape of (1,) and the received shape of (100,) almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the output layer of your model and the structure of your training data's target variable.  This is a common issue I've encountered numerous times during my work on large-scale machine learning projects involving time series forecasting and anomaly detection.  The root cause lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of how the model interprets the input and output dimensions, specifically concerning the batch size and the number of prediction targets per data point.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Your model is designed to predict a single value (shape (1,)) for each input data point. This is explicitly defined by the output layer's configuration.  However, your training data is providing it with 100 values for each data point.  This implies your target variable, which should ideally represent the single value your model aims to predict, is actually structured as a vector of 100 elements.  There are several potential origins for this:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:**  The most frequent cause is an error during data preparation.  You might be inadvertently feeding the model an entire sequence of values as the target when it’s only designed to predict a single, summarizing value from that sequence (e.g., the final value, the mean, or a specific quantile).  This often happens when working with time-series data, where the model might be trained to predict a single future point but receives a window of future points as the target instead.

* **Unintended Data Reshaping:**  Review your data loading and preprocessing steps meticulously.  There might be an unintended reshaping operation that transforms your single-target variable into a vector. This is common if you're using libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow/Keras, where subtle errors in array manipulations can easily lead to dimension inconsistencies.

* **Conflicting Data Sources:** Ensure consistency between your training data and the way you structured your validation/test sets. Discrepancies in the target variable's shape across different datasets will consistently produce this error.

* **Output Layer Misconfiguration:** While less likely given the error message, there’s a possibility your model’s output layer is incorrectly configured.  However, given the error explicitly states a shape mismatch, the issue predominantly lies with your input data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Here are three scenarios illustrating potential causes and their solutions.  These examples utilize TensorFlow/Keras for demonstration, though the concepts are applicable to other frameworks like PyTorch.


**Example 1: Incorrect Data Preprocessing for Time Series Forecasting**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrectly shaped target data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10, 1) # 100 samples, 10 time steps, 1 feature
y_train_incorrect = np.random.rand(100, 10) # 100 samples, 10 target values (INCORRECT)

# Correctly shaped target data
y_train_correct = np.random.rand(100, 1) # 100 samples, 1 target value (CORRECT)

# Model definition (simplified for clarity)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(10, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Output layer predicting a single value
])

# Attempting to train with incorrectly shaped data will raise an error
# model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
# model.fit(X_train, y_train_incorrect, epochs=10)

# Training with correctly shaped data
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train_correct, epochs=10)
```

In this example, `y_train_incorrect` incorrectly provides ten target values per sample. The `y_train_correct` shows the correct shape.  The crucial fix is to ensure your preprocessing accurately extracts the single target value your model anticipates.  For instance, if your model predicts the value at the end of the sequence, you should extract the last element of each sequence before training.


**Example 2: Unintended Reshaping with NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Correctly shaped target data
y_train_original = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Unintended reshaping using NumPy's reshape function
y_train_reshaped = y_train_original.reshape(100,10) #incorrect reshape

# Model definition (same as before)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# Attempting to train with reshaped data will raise an error
# model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
# model.fit(X_train, y_train_reshaped, epochs=10)

# Training with correctly shaped data
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train_original, epochs=10)
```

Here, an unintentional `reshape` operation transforms the target into a shape incompatible with the model. Double-check every NumPy operation during your data transformation pipeline to prevent unintended reshaping.


**Example 3: Inconsistent Data Shapes Across Datasets**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Correctly shaped training data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Incorrectly shaped validation data
X_val = np.random.rand(50, 10)
y_val = np.random.rand(50, 100) #Incorrect shape for validation set

# Model definition (same as before)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Training will fail due to shape mismatch in validation data
# model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
# model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Correct validation data
y_val_correct = np.random.rand(50, 1) #Correct Shape for validation set

# Successful training with correct validation data
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val_correct))
```


This emphasizes the necessity of maintaining consistent data shapes across all datasets used during training and validation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of neural network architectures and data preprocessing techniques, consult a comprehensive machine learning textbook focusing on practical implementation.  A solid understanding of linear algebra and probability theory is also crucial for diagnosing and preventing these issues.  Review the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) thoroughly to understand the intricacies of data handling and model building.  Finally, mastering debugging techniques and utilizing print statements strategically during data preprocessing is invaluable.
