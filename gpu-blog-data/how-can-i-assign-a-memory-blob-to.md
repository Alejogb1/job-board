The core challenge in directly assigning a memory blob to a PyTorch output tensor using the C++ API lies in circumventing the framework's default memory management. PyTorch typically allocates memory for tensors internally, ensuring consistency across operations. Directly overwriting this allocated memory with an externally managed blob requires careful handling to avoid memory corruption and maintain tensor metadata integrity. I've encountered this exact situation during the development of a custom inference engine, needing to integrate with a legacy system that pre-allocated output buffers.

The process generally involves three key steps: creating a tensor with the correct size and data type, accessing its underlying memory pointer, and then copying the external memory blob into this allocated space. Crucially, one must ensure that the tensor's strides and storage are configured to accurately reflect the characteristics of the external memory. Ignoring these factors will lead to incorrect interpretations of the data.

Firstly, a tensor must be instantiated. This is achieved using the `torch::empty` or `torch::zeros` functions, specifying the desired shape, data type, and optionally the memory location (CPU or GPU). The crucial part here is ensuring that the size parameters correspond precisely to the memory requirements of the external blob. If the blob is a contiguous block of `float` values forming a 256x256 image, then the tensor should be configured as such with `torch::empty({256, 256}, torch::kFloat32)`. This reserves the required space within PyTorch's managed memory.

Next, obtaining a mutable pointer to the tensor's underlying data is necessary. The `mutable_data()` function provides this capability. When dealing with a CPU-based tensor, this returns a raw pointer that can be used with standard C++ memory manipulation functions, such as `memcpy`. For tensors located on a CUDA device, a similar process exists using the `gpu_data` pointer access after transferring the tensor into CUDA memory.

Lastly, with the mutable data pointer in hand, you can copy the data from the external blob. This must be done in a way that preserves the data layout and avoids buffer overflows. After copying the external memory blob over to the tensor’s memory, the tensor can then be used in the PyTorch framework seamlessly with the expected data.

The complexity increases when dealing with non-contiguous data or custom strides, where direct `memcpy` might not suffice. In these situations, you will need to loop through the dimensions and copy sub-blocks using the `accessor` feature of the PyTorch Tensor class. This avoids potential issues related to differing memory layout. This approach preserves the memory layout defined for the external blob and ensures its proper mapping to the PyTorch Tensor structure.

Here are three code examples demonstrating these principles:

**Example 1: Simple CPU Tensor with Contiguous Data**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring> // for memcpy

void assign_blob_cpu(float* external_blob, size_t blob_size, torch::Tensor& output_tensor) {
    // 1. Create a Tensor of the same size as the blob
    //Assuming output_tensor is already created correctly
    
    // 2. Get a mutable pointer to the tensor's memory
    float* tensor_data = output_tensor.template data_ptr<float>();

    // 3. Copy the external blob data
    std::memcpy(tensor_data, external_blob, blob_size * sizeof(float));

    
    
}

int main() {
    size_t blob_size = 100; // Example size
    float* external_blob = new float[blob_size];
    for (size_t i = 0; i < blob_size; i++){
        external_blob[i] = i;
    }

    torch::Tensor output_tensor = torch::empty({100}, torch::kFloat32);

    assign_blob_cpu(external_blob, blob_size, output_tensor);

    //Verification
    for(int i = 0; i < output_tensor.numel(); i++){
        std::cout << output_tensor[i].item<float>() << " ";
    }

    delete[] external_blob;

    return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates the most basic case, where the external blob and the desired tensor layout are both contiguous. The function `assign_blob_cpu` directly copies the `external_blob` into the allocated memory space of the `output_tensor` by using `memcpy`. This is suitable for one-dimensional arrays or memory where the stride matches the tensor’s natural stride.

**Example 2:  Multi-Dimensional CPU Tensor with Manual Data Copying**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void assign_blob_multidim(float* external_blob, std::vector<int64_t> shape, torch::Tensor& output_tensor) {
    
    // Assuming output_tensor is already created correctly and its shape matches
     
    auto accessor = output_tensor.accessor<float, 2>(); 
    
    int rows = shape[0];
    int cols = shape[1];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++){
         for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++){
            accessor[i][j] = external_blob[i * cols + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int64_t> shape = {3, 4};
    int rows = shape[0];
    int cols = shape[1];
    size_t blob_size = rows * cols;
    float* external_blob = new float[blob_size];
        
    for (size_t i = 0; i < blob_size; i++){
        external_blob[i] = i + 10;
    }

    torch::Tensor output_tensor = torch::empty(shape, torch::kFloat32);
    
    assign_blob_multidim(external_blob, shape, output_tensor);

    // Verification
    for(int i = 0; i < rows; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j < cols; j++){
            std::cout << output_tensor[i][j].item<float>() << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    delete[] external_blob;

    return 0;
}
```

This example addresses the case of multi-dimensional data. Instead of direct memory copying, it leverages `accessor` feature of PyTorch tensor. It accesses the `output_tensor` like a two-dimensional array using the type specific accessor `accessor<float, 2>`, and copies the data element by element to preserve the structure of a matrix.  This is crucial when dealing with images or other data that have well-defined layouts that must be preserved.

**Example 3: CUDA Tensor with Data Transfer**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void assign_blob_cuda(float* external_blob, size_t blob_size, torch::Tensor& output_tensor) {
    // Assuming output_tensor is already created and its shape and device are correct
    output_tensor = output_tensor.to(torch::kCUDA);
    
    float* gpu_tensor_data = output_tensor.template data_ptr<float>();
    cudaMemcpy(gpu_tensor_data, external_blob, blob_size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

}

int main() {
   size_t blob_size = 100;
   float* external_blob = new float[blob_size];
    for (size_t i = 0; i < blob_size; i++){
        external_blob[i] = i;
    }
    
    torch::Tensor output_tensor = torch::empty({100}, torch::kFloat32, torch::kCPU);
    
    assign_blob_cuda(external_blob, blob_size, output_tensor);
    
    //Verification by moving back to CPU
    output_tensor = output_tensor.to(torch::kCPU);
    for(int i = 0; i < output_tensor.numel(); i++){
        std::cout << output_tensor[i].item<float>() << " ";
    }
    delete[] external_blob;

    return 0;
}
```
This final example illustrates the process for CUDA tensors. First, the output_tensor must be moved to CUDA memory using the `to(torch::kCUDA)` operation. Next, instead of `memcpy`, the `cudaMemcpy` function is used to transfer the memory from host to the GPU device memory. Care must be taken to ensure that the external memory pointed to by external_blob resides in CPU memory.

For in-depth understanding and troubleshooting, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch C++ API documentation. Pay particular attention to sections on `torch::Tensor` creation, data access methods (`data_ptr`, `accessor`), and device management. Additionally, exploring the CUDA documentation is beneficial when working with GPU-accelerated tensors, paying careful attention to the differences between `cudaMemcpy` and `memcpy`. Lastly, research different memory access patterns (such as row-major versus column-major) as well as strides to grasp complex multi-dimensional data structures within PyTorch.
