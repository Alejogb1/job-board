The intermittent return of null values during asynchronous reads from a child process's pipe prior to its termination stems from the inherent asynchronous nature of the operation coupled with the buffering mechanisms within the operating system's pipe implementation.  This isn't a bug, but rather a predictable consequence of how these systems interact, particularly when the child process's write operations are sporadic or slower than the parent's read attempts.  I've encountered this extensively during my work on high-throughput data processing pipelines, specifically those involving image preprocessing and analysis where the child processes performed computationally intensive tasks.

**1. Explanation:**

Asynchronous read operations on pipes don't block the parent process.  The `read()` system call (or its equivalent in higher-level APIs) returns immediately, either with the available data, or a specific return code indicating that no data is currently available.  The crucial point here is that *no data available* does not equate to the child process having finished writing. The pipe itself acts as a buffer, and when this buffer is empty, the read operation simply returns with an indication of an empty buffer (often represented as zero bytes read or a null value depending on the API).

The child process writes data to the pipe asynchronously as well.  If the child process hasn't yet written anything, or if it's slower than the parent's read requests, the parent will receive empty reads.  Only when the child process closes its end of the pipe does the operating system signal the end-of-file (EOF) condition to the parent, ensuring that subsequent read operations are guaranteed to return an EOF indicator (e.g., -1 in Unix-like systems).  Before the EOF, null values (or zero bytes) simply indicate an empty buffer, not a failure condition.  This behavior becomes especially prominent with slower child processes or bursty write patterns, where periods of inactivity cause the buffer to empty before the child completes.

Moreover, the size of the operating system's pipe buffer plays a significant role. Smaller buffer sizes exacerbate the problem, as the parent will more frequently encounter empty buffers. Larger buffers can mitigate this, but excessively large buffers could introduce latency due to increased context switching and memory usage.  The optimal buffer size often depends on the application's specific data throughput requirements and characteristics.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate the problem and potential solutions using Python (due to its widespread familiarity and cross-platform nature).  These examples use the `subprocess` module, which is sufficient for illustrating the core concept.

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Null Value Problem**

```python
import subprocess
import time
import os

def child_process():
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['./my_child_process'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)  # Assuming a compiled executable
    return proc

def parent_process(proc):
    while True:
        data = proc.stdout.read(1024) # Adjust buffer size as needed
        if data:
            print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")
        elif proc.poll() is not None: # Check if child process has exited
            print("Child process finished.")
            break
        else:
            print("Received null value.")  # Indicates empty buffer
        time.sleep(0.1) # Simulate some work


if __name__ == "__main__":
    child = child_process()
    parent_process(child)
    os.waitpid(child.pid, 0) #Ensure proper child process termination handling

# my_child_process (C++ example - compile with g++ my_child_process.cpp -o my_child_process)
// my_child_process.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Data " << i << std::endl;
        usleep(100000); // Simulate some work
    }
    return 0;
}

```

This example showcases how the parent receives null values before the child terminates due to the asynchronous nature and buffering.


**Example 2: Handling Null Values with a `select` Mechanism (Linux-specific)**

This example leverages the `select` system call to avoid busy-waiting. This approach is more efficient than repeatedly calling `read` when no data is available.  This example is Linux specific due to its use of `select`.


```python
import subprocess
import select
import os

# ... (child_process function remains the same)

def parent_process_select(proc):
    while True:
        readable, _, _ = select.select([proc.stdout], [], [], 0.1) # Non-blocking select
        if proc.stdout in readable:
            data = proc.stdout.read(1024)
            if data:
                print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")
            else:
                if proc.poll() is not None:
                    print("Child process finished.")
                    break
                else:
                    print("Received null value (select).")
        elif proc.poll() is not None:
            print("Child process finished.")
            break
        else:
            pass  # No data available, no need to print anything.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    child = child_process()
    parent_process_select(child)
    os.waitpid(child.pid, 0)


```


**Example 3: Using a Larger Buffer to Reduce Null Value Occurrences:**


This approach simply increases the buffer size in the `read` operation.  While not addressing the root cause, it can reduce the frequency of null value returns by allowing more data to be read in a single operation.


```python
import subprocess
import time
import os

# ... (child_process function remains the same)

def parent_process_large_buffer(proc):
    while True:
        data = proc.stdout.read(8192) # Increased buffer size
        if data:
            print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")
        elif proc.poll() is not None:
            print("Child process finished.")
            break
        else:
            print("Received null value (large buffer).")  # Less frequent now
        time.sleep(0.1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    child = child_process()
    parent_process_large_buffer(child)
    os.waitpid(child.pid, 0)
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous I/O and process communication, I suggest consulting advanced operating systems textbooks, specifically those covering process synchronization and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.  Additionally,  documentation on your specific operating system's `read()` system call and pipe implementation will be invaluable.  Familiarizing yourself with the underlying mechanisms of `select` or `poll` (or their equivalent in your chosen environment) is beneficial for more efficient asynchronous I/O handling. Finally, exploring the documentation for your programming language's subprocess handling library will clarify its specific behavior regarding asynchronous operations on pipes.
