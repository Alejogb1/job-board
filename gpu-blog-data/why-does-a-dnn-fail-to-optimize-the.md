In my experience building and deploying deep learning models for image processing, I’ve encountered situations where even with perfectly clean, noiseless input data, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) can fail to optimize the loss function, plateauing at a suboptimal performance level. This isn't due to inherent data imperfections, but rather to a confluence of factors relating to the network's architecture, the optimization process itself, and the characteristics of the loss landscape.

The primary reason a DNN can fail to optimize with noiseless data stems from the fact that optimization in neural networks is fundamentally a non-convex problem. This means that the loss function, when visualized, doesn’t form a nice bowl shape with a single, easily reachable minimum. Instead, the landscape is characterized by a plethora of local minima, saddle points, and flat regions, where the gradient approaches zero. Consequently, optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can get stuck in these suboptimal regions, even when the input data is flawless.

Specifically, the high dimensionality of the weight space and the non-linear activation functions used in DNNs create highly complex loss landscapes. While noiseless data eliminates one source of randomness, it doesn't alter the fundamental challenge of navigating this landscape. The algorithm still relies on the gradient to guide it towards the minimum, and if it encounters a region with minimal or zero gradient, progress can cease. This is often a result of the initial weight randomization or the choice of learning rate, trapping the model in a sub-optimal solution.

Furthermore, vanishing gradients represent another significant challenge. In deep networks, especially those employing sigmoid or tanh activation functions, the gradient can become increasingly small as it's backpropagated through multiple layers. This significantly slows down or halts weight updates in the lower layers, effectively preventing these layers from learning anything meaningful, regardless of input data quality. While ReLU activation functions mitigate this to some extent, they can introduce dead units and contribute to other suboptimal behaviors. In these cases, the model doesn’t actually *fail* in the traditional sense, it gets stuck in a location where gradients are no longer significant, leading to no further updates.

Another potential issue can be insufficient capacity within the neural network. If the architecture of the network is too small to adequately capture the complexity of the relationships within the data, the network will struggle to learn a fitting solution even if provided with the most pristine input. This results in high bias rather than high variance and prevents proper convergence, irrespective of the noiseless nature of input. Conversely, an over-parameterized network may be able to achieve a low training loss, but generalize poorly, indicating overfitting and not necessarily an optimization failure.

Finally, the specific choice of optimization algorithm and its hyperparameters – such as learning rate, momentum, or weight decay – plays a decisive role. An unsuitable learning rate, for example, may either lead to oscillations around the minimum or cause the model to converge too slowly or get stuck prematurely. Suboptimal momentum and weight decay could equally impede the process. The choice of the optimizer must be meticulously tuned for specific network architecture and dataset at hand; no single parameter set works universally well.

To illustrate these points, I will present a few examples of common issues encountered with noiseless input and potential solutions, demonstrated through code in Python using a Keras and TensorFlow framework:

**Example 1: Simple Network with Vanishing Gradients**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD
import numpy as np

# Generate noiseless sample data
X_train = np.linspace(0, 1, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y_train = 2 * X_train + 1 # Linear function

#Model with sigmoid activation
model_sig = Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(1,)),
    Dense(8, activation='sigmoid'),
    Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

#Model with ReLU activation
model_relu = Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

# Stochastic gradient descent
optimizer = SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

# Compile both models
model_sig.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model_relu.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

#Training
history_sig = model_sig.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2000, verbose=0)
history_relu = model_relu.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2000, verbose=0)

#Evaluate
loss_sig = history_sig.history['loss'][-1]
loss_relu = history_relu.history['loss'][-1]

print(f'Sigmoid loss:{loss_sig:.4f}')
print(f'ReLU loss: {loss_relu:.4f}')
```
In this example, we construct a simple linear regression problem with perfect noiseless data. We then use two different networks, one employing `sigmoid` activation functions and the other `relu` for the hidden layers. We train both with the same optimizer and identical hyperparameters.  The sigmoid network struggles to fit the linear function, primarily due to the vanishing gradient problem. The ReLU network fares better, demonstrating the impact activation function selection has on optimization. Even in the face of noiseless input, the sigmoid network’s gradients diminished to a point where no substantial further learning took place.

**Example 2: Network Stuck in a Local Minimum**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Generate noiseless sample data - slightly more complex
np.random.seed(42)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_train = np.sin(X_train) * 5 + 2 # Non-linear

model_1 = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='tanh', input_shape=(1,)),
    Dense(1)
])

model_2 = Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='tanh', input_shape=(1,)),
    Dense(1)
])

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate = 0.01)

model_1.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model_2.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')


history_1 = model_1.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2000, verbose=0)
history_2 = model_2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2000, verbose=0)

loss_1 = history_1.history['loss'][-1]
loss_2 = history_2.history['loss'][-1]

print(f'Model 1 loss: {loss_1:.4f}')
print(f'Model 2 loss: {loss_2:.4f}')

```
Here, I use a more complex non-linear target function. I've trained two networks, one with less capacity than the other. The smaller model, `model_1`, with fewer hidden units, often stagnates in a local minimum, reaching a higher loss value than `model_2` which has increased capacity. This demonstrates that the network capacity plays a role; too small a network may be unable to learn a representation that leads to optimal results. The noiseless nature of data does not alleviate the possibility of the optimization process getting trapped in suboptimal parameter settings.

**Example 3: Learning Rate Impact**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Generate noiseless sample data
X_train = np.linspace(-1, 1, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y_train = X_train**2

model_lr_1 = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    Dense(1)
])
model_lr_2 = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    Dense(1)
])

optimizer_lr_1 = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
optimizer_lr_2 = Adam(learning_rate=0.1)

model_lr_1.compile(optimizer=optimizer_lr_1, loss='mse')
model_lr_2.compile(optimizer=optimizer_lr_2, loss='mse')

history_lr_1 = model_lr_1.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2000, verbose=0)
history_lr_2 = model_lr_2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2000, verbose=0)

loss_lr_1 = history_lr_1.history['loss'][-1]
loss_lr_2 = history_lr_2.history['loss'][-1]

print(f'Learning rate 0.001 loss: {loss_lr_1:.4f}')
print(f'Learning rate 0.1 loss: {loss_lr_2:.4f}')

```
In the last example, I demonstrate the effect of the learning rate. Two identical networks are trained, one with a smaller learning rate and the other with a larger learning rate. While a smaller learning rate can lead to slow convergence, as seen with model `model_lr_1`, a larger learning rate, `model_lr_2` might result in oscillations or even divergence, leading to a suboptimal or outright poor result despite ideal, noiseless data. The optimization algorithms must be tuned to account for the landscape’s intricacies and choosing an inappropriate learning rate can lead to such suboptimal results.

To further investigate and improve model performance when facing this sort of optimization challenges, several resources are available. In terms of mathematical understanding, I recommend research on non-convex optimization methods, focusing on gradient-based methods and their convergence properties. For network architecture choices, studying different activation functions and their respective influence on gradient propagation is paramount. Exploration of various regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, and batch normalization can enhance the optimization process. Lastly, researching different optimization algorithms such as Adam, RMSprop, or AdaGrad and the effect hyperparameter tuning has on them is highly valuable.

In summary, the failure of a DNN to optimize its loss, even with noiseless data, stems from the inherent complexities of non-convex optimization, such as local minima, saddle points, and vanishing gradients. These factors, coupled with network architecture, optimization algorithm choice, and its associated hyperparameters, collectively dictate the optimization success or failure, regardless of input data purity.
