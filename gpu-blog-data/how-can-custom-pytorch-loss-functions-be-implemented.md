The crucial consideration when implementing custom PyTorch loss functions with external calculations is maintaining differentiability for gradient-based optimization.  While PyTorch's automatic differentiation (autograd) system handles the majority of computations seamlessly, operations performed outside its tracking mechanism disrupt this process, potentially leading to incorrect gradients and training instability. My experience optimizing complex generative models underscored this fact; attempts to incorporate pre-computed statistics outside the graph resulted in vanishing gradients and non-convergent training.  Thus, careful integration strategies are paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's autograd system relies on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sequence of operations.  Each tensor involved in a computation within this graph retains a history, allowing the system to automatically compute gradients during backpropagation.  However, if a calculation uses tensors that are detached from this graph – for instance, via `.detach()` – the subsequent gradient calculations for those tensors become unavailable.  This implies that any loss function component reliant on detached tensors will not contribute to the overall model parameter updates.

Implementing external calculations necessitates a strategy that either avoids detaching tensors entirely, or leverages techniques to re-integrate the results back into the computational graph in a differentiable way.  This often involves careful manipulation of tensor operations and possibly employing custom autograd functions for complete control.  The choice depends on the nature of the external calculation.  If it's a simple, non-differentiable operation like a data lookup, the `torch.no_grad()` context manager might suffice; for more complex, potentially differentiable operations, a custom autograd function is necessary.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `torch.no_grad()` for Non-Differentiable External Operations:**

Consider a scenario where we want to incorporate pre-computed class weights into a cross-entropy loss.  These weights might be derived from a separate data analysis process, and the weighting itself isn't part of the model's learning process.  In this case, `torch.no_grad()` is appropriate.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

class WeightedCrossEntropyLoss(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weights):
        super(WeightedCrossEntropyLoss, self).__init__()
        self.weights = torch.tensor(weights, dtype=torch.float32) # Weights are pre-computed

    def forward(self, inputs, targets):
        with torch.no_grad():
            weighted_targets = self.weights[targets] # Weights are accessed outside the graph
        loss = F.cross_entropy(inputs, targets, weight=weighted_targets) # But integrated into the loss
        return loss

# Example usage
weights = [0.1, 0.9, 0.5] # Example class weights
criterion = WeightedCrossEntropyLoss(weights)
inputs = torch.randn(10, 3)
targets = torch.randint(0, 3, (10,))
loss = criterion(inputs, targets)
loss.backward() # Gradients will be correctly computed for inputs
```

In this example, the `weights` tensor and the indexing operation (`self.weights[targets]`) are explicitly excluded from the computational graph.  However, the resulting `weighted_targets` are then used within the standard `F.cross_entropy` function, which is differentiable and correctly contributes to the gradient calculation.


**Example 2:  Custom Autograd Function for Differentiable External Calculations:**

Suppose the external calculation involves a differentiable function, such as a numerical integration or a complex transformation.  A custom autograd function provides precise control.

```python
import torch

class MyCustomFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input) # Save input for backward pass
        # Perform external differentiable calculation here, e.g., numerical integration
        output = input.sin() * 2  #Example differentiable function
        return output

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        # Calculate gradients using chain rule
        grad_input = grad_output * (input.cos() * 2)
        return grad_input

# Usage
my_func = MyCustomFunction.apply
x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = my_func(x)
y.sum().backward() # Gradients backpropagated correctly.
```

This example defines a custom autograd function `MyCustomFunction`.  The `forward` method performs the external calculation and saves necessary tensors.  The `backward` method computes the gradients, employing the chain rule.  This ensures that the gradients are correctly backpropagated through the external calculation.


**Example 3:  Handling Non-Differentiable Components with Proxies:**

When dealing with strictly non-differentiable external operations that are crucial to the loss function, a strategy is to use a differentiable proxy.

```python
import torch

class ProxyLoss(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.l1_loss = torch.nn.L1Loss() # Smooth approximation for non-differentiable parts

    def forward(self, input, target):
      # Example non-differentiable function (e.g. discrete lookup)
      external_result = self.non_differentiable_func(input)
      
      # Proxy loss uses a differentiable alternative
      loss = self.l1_loss(input, target) + 0.5 * torch.abs(input - external_result) #penalty to encourage similarity

      return loss

    def non_differentiable_func(self, x):
      #Replace with actual non-differentiable function
      return torch.round(x)

#usage
proxy_loss = ProxyLoss()
inputs = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.randn(10)
loss = proxy_loss(inputs, targets)
loss.backward() #Gradients propagated, though approximate
```

Here, a differentiable loss function, such as L1 loss, serves as a proxy. The approximation of the non-differentiable part is penalized within the loss function to steer the model towards a desirable behaviour, while still permitting backpropagation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation on `torch.autograd` and custom autograd functions.  A thorough understanding of automatic differentiation principles.  Books on optimization and gradient-based learning methods provide relevant background.


In conclusion, integrating calculations outside PyTorch's computational graph requires meticulous consideration of differentiability. Using `torch.no_grad()` for non-differentiable operations is straightforward.  However, differentiable external computations necessitate custom autograd functions for correct gradient propagation. When non-differentiable elements are unavoidable, employing differentiable proxies can offer a viable pathway towards backpropagation, albeit with an approximation. Remember that carefully selecting the appropriate strategy significantly impacts the model's training process and overall performance.
