Calculating gradients across two distinct PyTorch models necessitates a nuanced understanding of computational graphs and automatic differentiation.  My experience optimizing large-scale multi-model systems for natural language processing has highlighted the crucial role of proper graph construction in achieving this.  The core principle is that PyTorch's automatic differentiation system relies on tracing operations within a single computational graph.  Therefore, managing the interaction between separate models requires strategically combining their operations within a shared, differentiable graph. This isn't simply a matter of concatenating outputs; it demands a clear understanding of the dependencies between model outputs and the ultimate loss function.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The most straightforward approach involves defining a single, overarching function that encompasses the computations of both models and the subsequent loss calculation. This function acts as the root of the computational graph, allowing PyTorch's `autograd` engine to traverse the entire network, including both models, and compute gradients with respect to all learnable parameters within both. This process relies on PyTorch's ability to track operations and build a graph dynamically.  If model A's output influences model B's input, this dependency must be explicitly represented within the overarching function. Similarly, if a loss function depends on outputs from both models, the loss calculation itself must reside within this function.

Critically,  simply calling `.backward()` on the loss tensor alone is insufficient. PyTorch's gradient calculation operates on the entire computational graph starting from the loss tensor. If the graph isn't properly constructed to include both models, the gradients for one or both will be incorrect, potentially resulting in zero gradients or unexpected behavior during training.  Furthermore, the choice of optimization algorithm needs consideration. While AdamW is generally robust, other optimizers might require specific handling depending on the complexity of the multi-model architecture.

Incorrect gradient calculation in this scenario often manifests as stagnant or erratic training progress, indicating a disconnect in the computational graph.  Through countless hours debugging multi-model training pipelines, I've learned to meticulously examine the graph structure using visualization tools and carefully trace the data flow to identify any points of discontinuity.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple concatenation and shared loss:**

This example demonstrates two simple linear models whose outputs are concatenated before being fed into a final linear layer for loss calculation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define models
model_A = nn.Linear(10, 5)
model_B = nn.Linear(7, 5)
model_C = nn.Linear(10, 1) #Combines outputs of model A & B

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(list(model_A.parameters()) + list(model_B.parameters()) + list(model_C.parameters()), lr=0.001)

# Forward pass
inputs_A = torch.randn(1, 10)
inputs_B = torch.randn(1, 7)
output_A = model_A(inputs_A)
output_B = model_B(inputs_B)
combined_output = torch.cat((output_A, output_B), dim=1)
output_C = model_C(combined_output)
loss = criterion(output_C, torch.randn(1, 1)) # Target needs to be defined


# Backward pass and optimization
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

**Commentary:**  This illustrates a straightforward approach where outputs are concatenated, forming a single input for a final layer calculating the loss. The optimizer is explicitly defined to include parameters from all three models, ensuring all gradients are calculated and updated correctly.  The clear structure of the forward pass facilitates accurate gradient calculation.


**Example 2: Model B conditioned on Model A's output:**

This example shows a scenario where model B's input depends on model A's output.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define models
model_A = nn.Linear(10, 5)
model_B = nn.Linear(10, 1) #Takes the output of model A and additional features as input.

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(list(model_A.parameters()) + list(model_B.parameters()), lr=0.001)

# Forward pass
inputs_A = torch.randn(1, 10)
inputs_B_additional = torch.randn(1,5) #Additional features
output_A = model_A(inputs_A)
combined_input_B = torch.cat((output_A, inputs_B_additional), dim=1)
output_B = model_B(combined_input_B)
loss = criterion(output_B, torch.randn(1,1))


# Backward pass and optimization
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

```

**Commentary:** Model B's input now explicitly depends on Model A's output.  The concatenation ensures the dependency is correctly represented in the computational graph, allowing for the accurate calculation of gradients for both models. The combined input to Model B is crucial for the backpropagation to correctly attribute gradients.


**Example 3:  Separate Losses and Weighted Aggregation:**

This example shows how to handle separate loss functions for each model and combine them using weights.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define models
model_A = nn.Linear(10, 5)
model_B = nn.Linear(7, 3)

# Define loss functions and optimizers
criterion_A = nn.MSELoss()
criterion_B = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(list(model_A.parameters()) + list(model_B.parameters()), lr=0.001)

# Forward pass
inputs_A = torch.randn(1, 10)
inputs_B = torch.randn(1, 7)
output_A = model_A(inputs_A)
output_B = model_B(inputs_B)
loss_A = criterion_A(output_A, torch.randn(1,5))
loss_B = criterion_B(output_B, torch.tensor([1])) # Target needs to be defined


# Weighted loss and optimization
lambda_A = 0.7
lambda_B = 0.3
loss = lambda_A * loss_A + lambda_B * loss_B

optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

```

**Commentary:** This example showcases the flexibility of PyTorch by handling separate loss functions for each model.  The weighted aggregation of losses within a single `loss` tensor ensures the gradients are correctly calculated and backpropagated through both models, based on the defined weights. This approach is crucial when dealing with models that serve different, but ultimately related, objectives.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, especially the sections on `autograd` and `nn.Module`, provides invaluable information.  A thorough understanding of computational graphs and automatic differentiation is paramount.  Exploring resources on optimization algorithms and their implications for multi-model training would be beneficial.  Finally, I strongly recommend studying examples of complex neural network architectures, observing how they manage the interplay between different components, to gain further practical insights.  Careful examination of the forward pass implementation is essential for understanding the flow of information and the subsequent gradient calculation.
