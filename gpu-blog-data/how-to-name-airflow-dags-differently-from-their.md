The core disconnect between an Airflow DAG's file name and its programmatic identifier arises from the TaskFlow API’s reliance on function names as default DAG identifiers. This behavior, while convenient for simple cases, creates difficulties when managing multiple DAGs from a single Python file, or when adhering to specific naming conventions distinct from Python's callable constraints. I've personally encountered this limitation when building a large data pipeline with dozens of interrelated DAGs, where clean file structure became paramount and simple function names proved insufficient. This issue necessitates a clear method to decouple the Python function's name from the resulting DAG's identifier within the Airflow environment.

The TaskFlow API, introduced in Airflow 2.0, favors a concise method of defining DAGs through Python functions decorated with `@dag`. The `@dag` decorator, by default, uses the decorated function's name as the `dag_id`. This behavior is practical for single-DAG files or small projects. However, when we introduce multiple DAGs within a single Python file or need descriptive, non-Pythonic DAG IDs, this default pattern becomes problematic. The need for an explicit way to name the DAGs then arises. Fortunately, the `@dag` decorator allows us to specify the `dag_id` explicitly, thus overcoming the limitation. By passing the desired DAG identifier as an argument to the `@dag` decorator, we can control the displayed and utilized DAG ID independent of the decorated function’s name.

Let's examine this with concrete examples.

**Example 1: Default Naming with TaskFlow API**

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag
from datetime import datetime

@dag(start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1))
def my_default_dag():
    print("This DAG uses the function name as DAG ID")

my_default_dag()
```
Here, the DAG will have an ID of `my_default_dag`. While straightforward, this relies directly on the function name, preventing a separation of code structure from the DAG's displayed identity within Airflow. This becomes especially cumbersome when using naming standards that may be incongruent with Python function naming conventions (for instance, using snake_case for Python functions but kebab-case for DAG identifiers).

**Example 2: Explicitly Defining the DAG ID**

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag
from datetime import datetime

@dag(dag_id="my-explicit-dag-id", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1))
def dag_function_name():
    print("This DAG has a different name from its function name")

dag_function_name()
```
In this instance, the DAG will be identified as `my-explicit-dag-id` within the Airflow UI, regardless of the function name `dag_function_name`. This decouples the programmatic structure from the presented name in the orchestration layer. The `dag_id` parameter allows us to adopt project specific naming conventions without being constrained by Python function naming restrictions. This explicit separation enhances clarity when inspecting logs and dashboards. This is especially useful in complex scenarios where dozens of DAGs might be defined within a single file and a naming convention facilitates easier identification.

**Example 3: Multiple DAGs within One File, Distinct IDs**

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag
from datetime import datetime

@dag(dag_id="etl-pipeline", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1))
def etl_dag_function():
    print("This is the ETL pipeline DAG")

@dag(dag_id="report-generation", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1))
def report_dag_function():
    print("This is the report generation DAG")


etl_dag_function()
report_dag_function()

```
Here, two distinct DAGs, `etl-pipeline` and `report-generation`, are declared within a single Python file. The function names, `etl_dag_function` and `report_dag_function`, are merely used for defining the DAG's structure and the order of execution, not for the identification within Airflow.  The clear separation through `dag_id` creates a more organised, and readable view in the Airflow environment. This scenario replicates a common development practice where logical grouping of DAGs facilitates management and maintainability.

Furthermore, the `dag_id` parameter supports templating using Jinja, offering even more flexible control over the naming convention by introducing dynamic elements, such as the date, host, or specific environment variables. While not showcased in the provided examples, templating can significantly enhance usability by including more contextual information within the `dag_id`.

When managing a significant number of DAGs, adopting descriptive and consistent naming strategies for DAGs is paramount. Without proper organization, troubleshooting can become a significant time sink. Having control over how the DAG is identified independent of the function’s name assists in building scalable and maintainable infrastructure. Choosing between a function name as a DAG ID and a custom ID should depend on the project size, complexity, and the desired level of structure. In general, a custom ID is preferred once the number of DAGs grows beyond a few simple instances.

In my experience, explicitly setting the `dag_id` proved vital when migrating from a single monolithic file to a more modular approach, where logically grouped DAGs were defined within a common module. The decoupling prevented disruptive renaming operations and enabled a far smoother transition between the old and the new systems. Also, it enhanced collaboration across the team, because the purpose of each DAG became immediately clear from its id, without needing to inspect the code itself.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deepening your knowledge, begin with the official Apache Airflow documentation; the section on DAG definition and the TaskFlow API is crucial.  Additionally, explore open-source project examples available on platforms like GitHub, focusing on those that demonstrate well-structured and organized DAG implementations. The community contributions often provide valuable real-world context and best practices. Several tutorials on Airflow TaskFlow API are available across blogs and educational websites. Exploring these might yield examples of complex use-cases. Lastly, engaging in online forums and discussion groups dedicated to Apache Airflow will expose you to the challenges and solutions adopted by experienced users.
