The core issue lies in the fundamental difference between how tensors are conceptualized and stored in memory versus the interpretation of shape changes in TensorFlow and similar libraries. When we attempt to reshape a rank-1 tensor (a vector) with 20 elements into a higher-rank tensor, the reshaping operation fundamentally relies on the total number of elements remaining constant. If the proposed new shape does not result in a number of elements that is a direct multiple of the initial element count of the slice used, the library correctly identifies this as an invalid operation. I've encountered this frequently when processing image data, where pre-processing often involves flattening portions of image tensors and then needing to reshape them before further processing. This seemingly straightforward operation can, as you observed, lead to this "multiple of 20" error.

The problem arises because a tensor's memory allocation is contiguous. Reshaping isn’t a reordering of the existing memory layout, but rather a reinterpretation of that contiguous block as a different structure. A rank-1 tensor of 20 elements, let's call it 'X', occupies a block of memory capable of holding 20 scalar values. When you take a slice of this tensor, say `X[some_start:some_end]` , you are creating a *view* into this contiguous block, without copying the underlying data. This means that a slice does not inherit its shape constraints from the original tensor, but has its own number of elements. Therefore, the reshaping operation looks to that *slice*, and its element count, when doing shape validation.

If you slice `X[5:15]` for example, you now have a rank-1 tensor (view) with 10 elements. If we then attempt to reshape this tensor into something with more than 10 or less than 10 elements, the operation is correctly deemed invalid. Any reshaping operation *must* maintain the total element count, based on the slice in question, and the target shape must lead to the same product of dimensions. You can only reshape the 10-element slice into a valid shape like (2, 5), (5,2), or (1,10). If the product of the target shape’s dimensions is not equal to the original slice count, you will see this error. If one attempts to reshape it to (4, 4) or (3, 3), one will encounter the error because they do not provide a total element count equal to the original slice.

Let's solidify this with concrete code examples using TensorFlow, which is a common library to encounter this with.

**Example 1: A Valid Reshape Operation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a rank-1 tensor with 20 elements.
x = tf.range(20)

# Take a slice
sliced_x = x[5:15]  #sliced_x contains elements 5 through 14 - total of 10

# Reshape the slice into a valid 2x5 tensor.
reshaped_x = tf.reshape(sliced_x, [2, 5])

# Print the reshaped tensor and shape, this will succeed
print("Reshaped tensor:", reshaped_x)
print("Shape of reshaped tensor:", reshaped_x.shape)
```

In this example, the slice `sliced_x` contains 10 elements. The `tf.reshape(sliced_x, [2, 5])` operation is valid because the resulting shape (2, 5) has 10 elements, matching the slice. Note that the operation does not look at the original tensor's 20 elements. The product of the reshaped tensor's dimensions matches the slice’s number of elements. This illustrates the principle of preserving the total number of elements. The output will show `[[ 5  6  7  8  9] [10 11 12 13 14]]` and the shape `(2, 5)`.

**Example 2: An Invalid Reshape Operation Resulting in the Error**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a rank-1 tensor with 20 elements.
x = tf.range(20)

# Take a slice
sliced_x = x[5:15] #sliced_x contains elements 5 through 14 - total of 10

# Attempt to reshape the slice into a 3x3 tensor (9 elements).
try:
  reshaped_x = tf.reshape(sliced_x, [3, 3])
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print("Error occurred:", e)

# Attempt to reshape into a 4x4 tensor (16 elements)
try:
   reshaped_x = tf.reshape(sliced_x, [4,4])
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print("Error occurred:", e)
```

Here, the slice `sliced_x` again has 10 elements. Attempting to reshape this slice into a 3x3 tensor (9 elements) or 4x4 tensor (16 elements) results in the `InvalidArgumentError`. The error message explicitly states that the total number of elements in the target shape must be a multiple of 10 (because the slice we took contained 10 elements). The dimensions 3x3=9 or 4x4=16 are not multiples of 10, thus the error.

**Example 3: Dynamically Determining Slice Size and Reshaping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a rank-1 tensor with 20 elements
x = tf.range(20)

# dynamically calculate the size of the slice at runtime.
start_index = 2
end_index = 13
slice_size = end_index - start_index

# Take the slice, the slice is dynamically sized, 11 elements
sliced_x = x[start_index:end_index]


# Reshape dynamically with the known slice size into a 1 x (size of the slice) matrix
reshaped_x = tf.reshape(sliced_x, [1, slice_size])

print("Reshaped Tensor:", reshaped_x)
print("Shape of reshaped tensor:", reshaped_x.shape)


# Reshape dynamically with the known slice size into a (size of the slice) x 1 matrix
reshaped_x = tf.reshape(sliced_x, [slice_size, 1])

print("Reshaped Tensor:", reshaped_x)
print("Shape of reshaped tensor:", reshaped_x.shape)


# reshape to 11x1 matrix
reshaped_x = tf.reshape(sliced_x, [11, 1])

print("Reshaped Tensor:", reshaped_x)
print("Shape of reshaped tensor:", reshaped_x.shape)
```

This example demonstrates how to dynamically calculate the size of your slice, which is especially useful when the slice boundaries are programmatically determined. Knowing the size of the slice enables you to reshape it into compatible shapes. The output will show `[[ 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12]]` with shape `(1, 11)` and `[[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]]` with the shape `(11, 1)`. Notice how the slice was programmatically calculated at 11 elements and the reshape operations respected that element count.

In practical applications, this error frequently appears during data pre-processing pipelines. For instance, when dealing with image data, if you flatten a region of pixels and then need to reshape it back into a specific image format, an error may occur if you don't meticulously track your dimensions, or if the slice size is dynamically determined.

To avoid this common error, always be aware of the number of elements in the tensor, and more specifically, the slice of a tensor you're working with. When reshaping, you must ensure that the total number of elements remains the same. If the size of a slice is variable, calculating it explicitly as shown in Example 3 prior to reshaping provides a robust way to prevent this error.

For deeper understanding, I recommend exploring the documentation for tensor manipulation in TensorFlow. The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on reshaping and slicing, provide detailed explanations and examples. Books and online tutorials focused on applied deep learning will also discuss this in various contexts. For conceptual background, material on linear algebra and tensor representation can be helpful. The key is to remember that reshaping is a reinterpretation of memory, and element counts must be preserved when forming different views.
