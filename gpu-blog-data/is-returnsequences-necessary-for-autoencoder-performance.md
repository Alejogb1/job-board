The impact of `ReturnSequences` on autoencoder performance is nuanced and heavily dependent on the specific application and architecture.  My experience working on anomaly detection in time-series data for high-frequency trading systems revealed that its necessity isn't universal; rather, it's contingent on whether the task requires preserving the temporal dependencies within the input sequence.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Autoencoders, in their simplest form, learn a compressed representation (latent space) of input data.  Standard autoencoders typically operate on fixed-length vectors. However, when dealing with sequential data, such as time-series, text, or audio, the input is a sequence of vectors.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs and GRUs, are commonly used as encoders and decoders in these scenarios because of their capacity to handle variable-length sequences and capture temporal relationships.  The `ReturnSequences` parameter (or its equivalent, depending on the specific library â€“ Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch) in RNN layers dictates whether the entire sequence of hidden states is returned or only the final hidden state.

If `ReturnSequences=False`, the RNN outputs only the hidden state corresponding to the final time step.  This is suitable for tasks where the ultimate goal is to produce a single vector representing the entire sequence, like classifying the entire sequence or predicting a single future value.  Conversely, if `ReturnSequences=True`, the RNN outputs a sequence of hidden states, one for each time step. This is crucial when the task requires maintaining the temporal structure of the input. For instance, in sequence-to-sequence tasks, or when reconstructing the input sequence element by element, the entire temporal information is necessary for the decoder to faithfully reproduce the input.

In autoencoders for sequential data, setting `ReturnSequences=True` in both the encoder and decoder ensures that the temporal dependencies within the input sequence are preserved during the encoding and decoding processes. This allows the autoencoder to learn a more nuanced representation of the sequential data, potentially leading to improved performance, particularly in tasks requiring precise reconstruction of the temporal dynamics.  However, forcing `ReturnSequences=True` when unnecessary can lead to increased computational complexity without a commensurate gain in performance.  The optimal setting depends entirely on the nature of the task and the data itself.  For instance, in simple anomaly detection where only a single anomaly score is required for the entire sequence, it is often redundant.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Autoencoder (No `ReturnSequences`)**

This example uses a densely connected layer for a non-sequential input, demonstrating a scenario where `ReturnSequences` is irrelevant.


```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Input shape (assuming fixed-length vector input)
input_dim = 10

# Encoder
input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
encoded = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer)  # Compressed representation

# Decoder
decoded = Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)

# Autoencoder model
autoencoder = Model(input_layer, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data (replace with your own)
x_train = np.random.rand(100, input_dim)
autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=50)
```


**Example 2:  Sequential Autoencoder with `ReturnSequences=True`**

This example uses LSTMs and demonstrates a scenario where preserving temporal information is crucial for reconstruction.


```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, RepeatVector, TimeDistributed, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Input shape (assuming sequences of length 20 with 3 features)
timesteps = 20
input_dim = 3

# Encoder
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim), return_sequences=True)) #return_sequences=True to pass sequences to the next layer.
model.add(LSTM(5, activation='relu', return_sequences=False)) # Reducing dimensionality at the end of the encoder.

# Decoder
model.add(RepeatVector(timesteps)) #Repeat the last hidden state to match the input sequence length.
model.add(LSTM(10, activation='relu', return_sequences=True))
model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data (replace with your own time-series data)
x_train = np.random.rand(100, timesteps, input_dim)
model.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=50)
```

**Example 3: Sequential Autoencoder with `ReturnSequences=False` (for a different task)**

This example showcases a situation where only the final state is needed, making `ReturnSequences=False` appropriate.  This might be used for sequence classification where the final hidden state represents the entire sequence.


```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Input shape (assuming sequences of length 20 with 3 features)
timesteps = 20
input_dim = 3

# Encoder
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim), return_sequences=False))

# Decoder (only reconstructing a single vector, not the sequence)
model.add(Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data (replace with your own time-series data)
x_train = np.random.rand(100, timesteps, input_dim)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, input_dim) # Target is a single vector
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50)
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of RNNs and their applications in sequence modeling, I would recommend consulting standard textbooks on deep learning, specifically those covering recurrent neural networks and sequence-to-sequence models.  Furthermore, research papers focusing on autoencoders for time-series analysis would provide valuable insights into best practices and architectural choices.  Finally, examining the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch) will clarify the specific implementation details of the `ReturnSequences` parameter and other relevant hyperparameters.  Careful experimentation and analysis of results on your specific dataset are crucial to determine the optimal settings for your autoencoder.
