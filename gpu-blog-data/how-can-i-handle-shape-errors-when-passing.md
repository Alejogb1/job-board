The core issue with passing tokenized full-text to a Keras Embedding layer stems from the inherent variability in sequence lengths.  The Embedding layer expects a fixed-length input; a ragged tensor, which is what you obtain from tokenizing text of varying lengths, will result in a `ValueError`.  My experience building document classification models frequently encountered this problem, primarily when working with datasets lacking uniform text lengths.  Successfully addressing this involves preprocessing techniques tailored to managing sequence length inconsistencies.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The Keras Embedding layer functions by mapping each integer token (representing a word) to a dense vector embedding.  These vectors are pre-trained or learned during the model's training process. The layer accepts a tensor of shape `(samples, sequence_length)`, where `samples` represents the number of text samples and `sequence_length` the length of each tokenized text sequence.  When dealing with full-text, the `sequence_length` is not uniform across all samples. This mismatch generates a shape error during layer execution because the layer cannot handle ragged arrays.

To resolve this, we must standardize the sequence length.  This can be achieved through two main strategies: padding and truncation.

* **Padding:**  Adds extra tokens (typically represented as a special token, like 0) to shorter sequences until they reach the maximum sequence length observed in the dataset.
* **Truncation:**  Removes tokens from longer sequences until they match the defined maximum length.

The choice between padding and truncation often depends on the nature of the data and the modeling task.  Padding might be preferred when the information at the beginning of a sequence is more important, whereas truncation might be better suited when a fixed length constraint is necessary, and the importance of information is considered uniform throughout the sequence.  Additionally, the choice of pre-padding or post-padding can have an influence on model performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples utilize TensorFlow/Keras and demonstrate handling shape errors using padding and truncation.  I've incorporated error handling to demonstrate robust code practices developed from years of dealing with these issues in production systems.

**Example 1: Padding using `pad_sequences`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sample tokenized text data (replace with your actual data)
tokenized_texts = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]

# Determine maximum sequence length
max_length = max(len(text) for text in tokenized_texts)

# Pad sequences
padded_texts = pad_sequences(tokenized_texts, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')

#Error Handling - Check if padding was successful
try:
    embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=11, output_dim=100) # Assuming vocabulary size is 11
    embedded_texts = embedding_layer(padded_texts)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error during embedding: {e}")
    print("Check your padding and vocabulary size.")

print(padded_texts)
```

This example utilizes `pad_sequences` to add padding to the end (`padding='post'`) of each sequence.  Remember to adjust `input_dim` in the `Embedding` layer to encompass the entire vocabulary, including the padding token.  The `try-except` block provides error handling.


**Example 2: Truncation using `pad_sequences`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

tokenized_texts = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]
max_length = 4

truncated_texts = pad_sequences(tokenized_texts, maxlen=max_length, truncating='pre')

try:
    embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=13, output_dim=100)
    embedded_texts = embedding_layer(truncated_texts)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error during embedding: {e}")
    print("Check your truncation and vocabulary size.")

print(truncated_texts)
```

Here, `pad_sequences` truncates sequences longer than `max_length`, removing tokens from the beginning (`truncating='pre'`).  Again, careful attention must be paid to vocabulary size and error handling is included.


**Example 3:  Custom Padding Function (for more control)**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

tokenized_texts = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
max_length = 5
padding_token = 0

def custom_pad(sequences, maxlen, padding_token):
    padded_sequences = []
    for seq in sequences:
        if len(seq) > maxlen:
            seq = seq[:maxlen]
        else:
            seq += [padding_token] * (maxlen - len(seq))
        padded_sequences.append(seq)
    return np.array(padded_sequences)

padded_texts = custom_pad(tokenized_texts, max_length, padding_token)

try:
    embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=11, output_dim=100)
    embedded_texts = embedding_layer(padded_texts)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error during embedding: {e}")
    print("Check your custom padding function and vocabulary size.")

print(padded_texts)
```

This example demonstrates a custom padding function offering more granular control.  This approach allows for flexibility beyond what `pad_sequences` provides, especially beneficial in scenarios requiring specific padding strategies or handling of edge cases.  Robust error handling remains crucial.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of Keras Embedding layers, consult the official Keras documentation.  Exploring texts on natural language processing (NLP) preprocessing techniques will provide valuable insights into tokenization, padding, and truncation.  Furthermore, examining advanced NLP libraries, such as those commonly used for NLP task pre-processing can broaden your understanding.  Studying examples of text classification models built using Keras will offer practical demonstrations of how these techniques are applied in real-world scenarios.  Thorough understanding of NumPy array manipulation is crucial for effective data preprocessing.
