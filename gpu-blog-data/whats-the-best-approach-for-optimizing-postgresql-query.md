PostgreSQL query optimization hinges on a fundamental principle: choosing the right tool for the job, dictated by the specific query pattern and data access requirements.  My experience working on high-throughput financial data systems has shown that no single approach – stored procedures, functions, materialized views, or even meticulously normalized tables – guarantees optimal performance across all scenarios.  Instead, a multifaceted strategy incorporating these tools judiciously is most effective.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The choice between stored procedures, functions, materialized views, and normalized tables fundamentally affects how data is accessed and processed.  Normalized tables represent the foundation, ensuring data integrity and minimizing redundancy.  However, raw SQL queries against heavily normalized tables can become inefficient for complex aggregations or frequently repeated queries.  This is where the other tools enter the picture.

Stored procedures encapsulate a sequence of SQL statements, potentially encompassing multiple tables and complex logic.  They offer advantages in terms of code reusability, maintainability, and potential performance improvements through query planning optimization. PostgreSQL can often optimize the entire procedure as a single unit, reducing overhead compared to executing individual statements. However, over-reliance on stored procedures can lead to a less modular and harder-to-maintain codebase.  They also restrict the opportunities for query plan caching.

Functions, on the other hand, are more granular, typically focusing on a specific operation or calculation. They are better suited for modular code design and improve readability.  While they don't inherently offer the same query planning benefits as stored procedures, their granular nature can contribute to improved overall performance by allowing specific parts of a query to be optimized individually. Furthermore, functions can be used within SQL queries, leveraging the optimizer's capabilities to integrate them effectively.

Materialized views, essentially pre-computed tables, are particularly potent for optimizing read-heavy workloads involving complex aggregations.  They store the results of a query, significantly reducing computation time for recurring requests.  However, maintaining materialized views necessitates careful consideration of refresh strategies (e.g., incremental updates) to prevent data staleness and ensure the view remains synchronized with the underlying base tables.  An improperly managed materialized view can negate its performance gains.

The degree of normalization itself has a significant impact. Over-normalization can lead to an excessive number of joins, increasing query execution time. Conversely, under-normalization can lead to data redundancy and update anomalies.  Finding the right balance is critical.  Techniques like denormalization (strategically introducing redundancy for performance) can be highly beneficial in specific contexts, but must be applied cautiously.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Stored Procedure for Complex Report Generation:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE generate_sales_report(IN start_date DATE, IN end_date DATE, OUT total_revenue NUMERIC) AS $$
DECLARE
  report_data RECORD;
BEGIN
  CREATE TEMP TABLE sales_summary AS
  SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  WHERE sale_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
  GROUP BY product_id;

  SELECT SUM(total_sales) INTO total_revenue FROM sales_summary;
  DROP TABLE sales_summary;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

*Commentary:* This stored procedure efficiently generates a sales report by creating a temporary table, performing aggregation, and then calculating the total revenue.  PostgreSQL can optimize the entire sequence of operations within the procedure, potentially leading to better performance than executing individual statements.  The use of a temporary table avoids impacting the performance of other concurrent queries.

**Example 2: Function for Calculating Unit Price:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_unit_price(product_id INTEGER)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
  unit_price NUMERIC;
BEGIN
  SELECT price INTO unit_price FROM products WHERE id = product_id;
  RETURN unit_price;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

*Commentary:* This function encapsulates a simple calculation.  It's reusable and can be incorporated into other queries without code duplication.  The function's simplicity allows for easy maintenance and testing. The optimizer can effectively integrate the function call within larger queries.

**Example 3: Materialized View for Frequently Accessed Data:**

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW product_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON product_sales_summary (product_id);
```

*Commentary:* This materialized view pre-computes the total sales for each product.  It's particularly beneficial if this information is frequently accessed.  The index ensures fast lookups.  However, regular refreshing (e.g., nightly) is necessary to ensure data accuracy.  Consider using `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY` for minimal disruption to other operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **PostgreSQL Documentation:** The official documentation is an invaluable resource. It covers query planning, optimization techniques, and detailed explanations of all the features discussed here.

*   **"PostgreSQL Performance Explained"**: This book (assuming it exists and is relevant) provides a comprehensive guide to PostgreSQL performance tuning.  It likely delves into advanced topics beyond the scope of this response.

*   **PostgreSQL mailing lists and forums:** These online communities provide access to a wealth of knowledge and experience from other PostgreSQL users and developers.  They are great places to ask questions and discuss specific performance issues.


In conclusion, the optimal approach for PostgreSQL query performance optimization is not a single solution but a strategic combination of normalized tables, judiciously used stored procedures and functions, and strategically implemented materialized views. The choice depends entirely on the nature of the data, the query patterns, and the overall application architecture.  Carefully consider the trade-offs between code modularity, maintenance effort, and performance gains when making these choices.  Regular performance monitoring and profiling are essential to identify and address bottlenecks effectively.
