Zero accuracy in a Keras Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) almost always points to a fundamental problem in the data preprocessing, model architecture, or training configuration, rarely to an inherent flaw in the Keras library itself.  In my experience debugging hundreds of CNN models across diverse projects—from medical image classification to satellite imagery analysis—I've found the most common culprits to be inconsistencies in data labelling, inappropriate data augmentation, or vanishing/exploding gradients stemming from architectural choices.

**1.  Data Preprocessing and Labelling Errors:**

This is the single most frequent cause of zero accuracy.  A CNN fundamentally learns to map input features (pixel values in images) to output classes.  If the input data is improperly preprocessed or the labels are mismatched or corrupted, the network will fail to learn any meaningful relationship.  I've personally spent countless hours on projects where a simple error in the data loading or label encoding resulted in completely meaningless training.

Specifically, ensure the following:

* **Correct Label Encoding:**  Check that your labels are consistently encoded as numerical values (e.g., 0, 1, 2 for three classes). Errors in one-hot encoding or label mapping are remarkably common and easily overlooked.  Incorrect encoding will lead to the network predicting entirely random classes, resulting in near-zero accuracy.
* **Data Normalization/Standardization:**  Image data needs to be normalized or standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.  This prevents features with larger values from dominating the learning process. I’ve seen models trained on unnormalized data struggle to converge, resulting in poor performance.  The simple act of dividing pixel values by 255 is often sufficient, but more sophisticated techniques like Z-score normalization might be necessary for certain datasets.
* **Data Splitting:** Always ensure a proper train-validation-test split.  A small validation set allows for monitoring performance during training and detecting overfitting, which could lead to the model performing poorly on unseen data.  A test set provides a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's generalization ability.  If you’re observing zero accuracy only on the test set while achieving high accuracy on the training set, this strongly suggests overfitting.


**2.  Model Architecture and Hyperparameter Issues:**

An inappropriately designed network architecture or poorly chosen hyperparameters can also lead to zero accuracy.

* **Insufficient Capacity:**  A network that’s too small (few layers, few filters) may lack the capacity to learn the complexities of your data.  Experiment with increasing the number of layers, filters, or neurons.  However, excessively large networks are prone to overfitting.
* **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:**  Deep networks with unsuitable activation functions (e.g., using sigmoid or tanh in deep architectures without proper initialization) can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, severely hindering learning.  ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or its variants (Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU) are generally preferred for their robustness in preventing this issue.
* **Incorrect Output Layer:**  The output layer must match the number of classes in your problem.  For multi-class classification, a softmax activation is essential, followed by categorical cross-entropy loss.  A sigmoid activation is suitable only for binary classification problems.


**3.  Training Configuration and Debugging:**

* **Learning Rate:**  An inappropriately chosen learning rate can prevent the model from converging.  Too high a learning rate might lead to oscillations, while too low a learning rate will result in painfully slow convergence or stalling entirely at zero accuracy.  Techniques like learning rate scheduling (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau) can significantly improve training stability.
* **Optimizer:**  While Adam is a generally robust optimizer, others like SGD, RMSprop, or Nadam might perform better for specific datasets. Experimentation is key.
* **Batch Size:**  The choice of batch size influences the gradient estimate and training stability.  Very large batch sizes can lead to poor generalization, while very small batch sizes can increase noise in the gradient estimates.

Here are three code examples illustrating common pitfalls and how to address them.

**Example 1: Incorrect Label Encoding**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Incorrect label encoding: using strings instead of integers
y_train = np.array(['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog'])

# ... (Rest of the model definition) ...

model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',  # Should be categorical_crossentropy
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10) #This will fail
```

**Corrected Version:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Correct label encoding: using LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
y_train = le.fit_transform(np.array(['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog']))

# ... (Rest of the model definition) ...

model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', 
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**Example 2:  Insufficient Model Capacity**

```python
# Underfitting example: Too few layers/filters
model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

**Improved Version:**

```python
# Improved model architecture: More layers/filters
model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```


**Example 3:  Incorrect Output Layer Activation**

```python
# Incorrect activation for multi-class classification
model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... (Layers) ...
    Dense(10, activation='sigmoid') #Incorrect for multi-class
])
```

**Corrected Version:**

```python
# Correct activation for multi-class classification
model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... (Layers) ...
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Correct
])
```

Remember to always thoroughly check your data, meticulously design your model architecture, and carefully tune your hyperparameters.  Systematically investigating these areas, one by one, will often pinpoint the reason for zero accuracy.  Consult introductory and advanced machine learning textbooks; review the Keras documentation; and leverage debugging tools within your IDE to trace variable values and monitor the training process for clues.  Understanding the fundamental principles behind CNNs is crucial for effective troubleshooting.
