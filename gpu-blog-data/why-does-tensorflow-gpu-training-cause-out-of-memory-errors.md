The root cause of TensorFlow GPU out-of-memory (OOM) errors, even with identical code across systems, frequently stems from disparities in the underlying GPU driver, CUDA toolkit versions, and how TensorFlow manages GPU memory allocation. Even though the code appears the same, subtle incompatibilities or variances in resource management can cause a new system, often with a more powerful GPU, to fail while an older one succeeds.

First, it is vital to understand how TensorFlow interacts with the GPU. TensorFlow relies on CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration. CUDA provides the low-level API for GPU communication, while cuDNN offers highly optimized routines for deep neural networks. Different versions of these libraries can lead to inconsistencies in memory handling and available resource detection. Newer GPUs are commonly supported with newer versions of CUDA and cuDNN; mismatching these with a TensorFlow installation or the incorrect runtime libraries can trigger OOM errors.

In my experience, specifically debugging similar situations involving TensorFlow on different machine configurations, I’ve often observed that the TensorFlow installation itself has an implicit dependency on a specific CUDA version, even if CUDA is installed on the system. If the installed CUDA toolkit version is newer than what was used when TensorFlow was compiled or installed, issues can arise due to API changes. TensorFlow might try to dynamically allocate memory based on outdated information and cause OOM errors because it cannot find or use the newer APIs effectively. Furthermore, even if the CUDA and TensorFlow versions are compatible, an incorrect cuDNN install can also induce problems.

Another critical aspect is TensorFlow's memory allocation mechanism. By default, TensorFlow uses a strategy that attempts to allocate all available GPU memory at the start of the session, even if only a fraction is required. This upfront allocation can be problematic, especially on newer, higher-memory GPUs where the overhead of allocating the entire GPU's memory can trigger OOM errors, even if the model is small. Conversely, older GPUs with lower memory might not experience the issue simply because less memory needs to be allocated upfront. TensorFlow offers alternatives, like "allow growth" and "memory fraction" options, to control memory allocation dynamically. These options prevent the allocation of all memory at the beginning, but must be implemented within the code to be effective.

Finally, it’s worthwhile noting that operating system configurations can also play a contributing factor. Differences in process management, driver configurations and system updates between two machines may indirectly impact memory management with a library like TensorFlow.

Now, let's illustrate with some code examples.

**Example 1: Demonstrating Default Memory Allocation**

The following code snippet shows the default memory allocation behavior of TensorFlow, which can easily lead to OOM errors. I've seen this issue a number of times when moving an application to a new machine and it highlights the risk of default behavior.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Without any configuration, TensorFlow will try to allocate most of GPU memory.
# This will potentially fail on a machine with high GPU memory.

# Define a simple model (for illustrative purposes)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])


# Generate a simple set of inputs and labels
x = tf.random.normal((1000, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((1000, 2))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model (may cause OOM error if memory allocation isn't correctly handled)
try:
    model.fit(x,y, epochs=1)
except tf.errors.ResourceExhaustedError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow memory error: {e}")

print("Model training complete, or failed.")

```

In this snippet, TensorFlow will, by default, attempt to acquire a considerable portion of the available GPU memory when creating the model. On machines with limited GPU memory, the system will typically succeed. However, on a machine with a large GPU memory footprint this allocation may cause errors even with a small model due to an attempt to allocate the majority of the GPU memory without any specific memory constraints. This is because the default memory allocation behavior is not optimized for newer, larger capacity GPU’s and causes resource exhaustion.

**Example 2: Utilizing the `allow_growth` Configuration**

This example demonstrates how to enable the `allow_growth` option. This option instructs TensorFlow to allocate only as much memory as needed, avoiding aggressive upfront allocations. I've frequently relied on this configuration to mitigate OOM errors encountered after transitioning to new hardware.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Configure the GPU options to allow growth.
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)


# Define a simple model (for illustrative purposes)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])


# Generate a simple set of inputs and labels
x = tf.random.normal((1000, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((1000, 2))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model (should now allocate memory more efficiently)
try:
    model.fit(x,y, epochs=1)
except tf.errors.ResourceExhaustedError as e:
     print(f"TensorFlow memory error: {e}")

print("Model training complete, or failed.")
```

The change here lies in the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` function applied to each physical GPU. By setting the `memory_growth` parameter to `True`, TensorFlow will no longer attempt to take up all of the memory upon initialization. This approach will dynamically allocate GPU memory, using it only as needed, mitigating the risk of OOM errors.

**Example 3: Setting a `memory_fraction` Configuration**

Alternatively, you can specify a fraction of total memory to allocate using the `memory_fraction` option. I've used this when precise memory control was necessary, especially when sharing resources with other processes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf


# Define memory fraction, will allocate 80%
memory_fraction = 0.8
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')


if gpus:
  try:
    tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(
        gpus[0],
        [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit = int(memory_fraction * 1024 * 1024 * 1024))]
    )
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)



# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])


# Generate a simple set of inputs and labels
x = tf.random.normal((1000, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((1000, 2))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model
try:
    model.fit(x,y, epochs=1)
except tf.errors.ResourceExhaustedError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow memory error: {e}")


print("Model training complete, or failed.")

```

This third method allows us to constrain memory allocation even further by a specified fraction of total memory, demonstrated by the `memory_fraction` variable. We set the memory limit to a fraction of available GPU memory, ensuring that TensorFlow cannot exhaust the full memory capacity on the system. This is helpful when a system has multiple tasks running on the same GPU.

In summary, the key reason a new system might exhibit OOM errors while an older one doesn't with the same TensorFlow code involves a complex interaction between the GPU driver version, CUDA, cuDNN versions, and TensorFlow's GPU memory management behavior. The default allocation of all available GPU memory is problematic, and can cause the issue to appear on larger capacity machines while the same code runs correctly on older, smaller GPU machines.

To resolve such issues, focus on verifying the compatibility between the TensorFlow version, CUDA, and cuDNN versions. Further adjust TensorFlow's memory allocation strategy by either utilizing the “allow growth” option or setting a memory fraction as demonstrated in the code examples. Finally, consider the system operating system configurations, driver configurations and system updates, as these may indirectly influence GPU memory management and available resources.
