The "<" token error encountered within `model.json` and `metadata.json` files typically stems from improperly escaped characters within string values, specifically when those strings attempt to represent HTML or XML-like structures.  In my experience troubleshooting model deployment issues over the past five years, this problem is frequently overlooked because the error message itself is quite generic.  The underlying issue lies not within the JSON structure itself, but rather in the content of the string fields.  JSON's strict adherence to its specification means it interprets the "<" character literally, leading to parsing failure when it's encountered unexpectedly within a string.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based data format that relies on key-value pairs and structured nesting.  The "<" character holds no special significance within the basic JSON syntax. However, problems arise when the data being serialized into the JSON file includes literal "<" characters intended for use within other markup languages like HTML or XML.  JSON parsers interpret such occurrences as the beginning of an HTML or XML tag, causing a parsing error because the JSON structure has been violated.  The parser anticipates a properly structured JSON object or array, not a piece of HTML.  This is further complicated when nested structures are involved, potentially masking the actual source of the error deep within the JSON hierarchy.  It's crucial to remember that JSON is a data-interchange format and should not be confused with a markup language.

The `model.json` and `metadata.json` files, commonly used in machine learning model deployment pipelines, frequently store metadata about the model, its training process, and potentially configuration details.  These metadata fields often contain string values that might inadvertently include "<" characters (or similar characters like ">", "&", etc.)  if they have been constructed using user-supplied data or data imported from other sources without proper sanitization or escaping.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how improperly formatted strings cause the "<" error and how to resolve it using proper JSON escaping.


**Example 1: Incorrectly formatted `model.json`**

```json
{
  "model_name": "MyModel",
  "description": "<p>This is a description of my model.</p>",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

This `model.json` will produce the "<" token error. The `<p>` tag within the "description" field is not valid JSON.

**Corrected Version:**

```json
{
  "model_name": "MyModel",
  "description": "&lt;p&gt;This is a description of my model.&lt;/p&gt;",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

Here, HTML tags are correctly escaped using their corresponding HTML entities: `&lt;` for "<" and `&gt;` for ">".  This ensures the JSON parser interprets the characters as literal string components rather than HTML tags.  This approach is generally preferred for maintaining semantic meaning if the string ultimately intends to represent HTML.


**Example 2: Incorrectly formatted `metadata.json` with nested structures**

```json
{
  "experiment_details": {
    "notes": "Experiment run on <date> with parameters <params>"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "accuracy": 0.95
  }
}
```

Again, the "<" characters in the "notes" field will lead to a parsing error.  The error might not immediately pinpoint the "notes" field if the JSON parser only reports the first occurrence of an invalid character.

**Corrected Version:**

```json
{
  "experiment_details": {
    "notes": "Experiment run on &lt;date&gt; with parameters &lt;params&gt;"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "accuracy": 0.95
  }
}
```

The same principle of HTML entity encoding is applied.  This illustrates that the error can occur within nested structures, complicating error diagnostics.

**Example 3:  Illustrating JSON string escaping with other characters:**

```json
{
  "author": "John \"Doe\"",
  "contact": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

While not directly a "<" error, this example highlights the need for general string escaping within JSON.  The double quote within the "author" field needs escaping to prevent termination of the string.


**Corrected Version:**

```json
{
  "author": "John \\\"Doe\\\"",
  "contact": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

Here, backslashes escape the double quotes, allowing them to be correctly interpreted as part of the string.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Consult the official JSON specification. Thoroughly understanding JSON syntax is paramount in avoiding this and other common JSON-related errors.
*   Familiarize yourself with HTML and XML entity encoding.  Knowing how to properly escape special characters will prevent parsing issues when strings contain HTML- or XML-like content.
*   Utilize a JSON validator.  These tools can quickly identify parsing errors and pinpoint the problematic sections of your JSON files, assisting in debugging.


In conclusion, the "<" token error in `model.json` and `metadata.json` files indicates a problem with string escaping within the JSON data, often stemming from improperly handled HTML or XML content.  Employing proper escaping techniques, understanding JSON syntax, and leveraging validation tools are crucial in preventing and resolving this frequently encountered error.  Careful attention to data sanitization during the creation of these JSON files is equally critical in preventing this issue from arising in the first place.
