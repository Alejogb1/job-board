The issue with `mean[:, None, None]` leading to crashes in PyTorch Jupyter notebooks often stems from a mismatch between the expected dimensionality of the tensor and the operations performed subsequently, particularly when dealing with broadcasting or operations that implicitly rely on specific tensor shapes.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects involving complex neural network architectures and data processing pipelines, this error typically manifests when the resulting tensor from this slicing operation is then used in a context which assumes a different shape.  It's rarely the slicing itself that's the direct cause of the crash, but rather an incompatibility downstream.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The expression `mean[:, None, None]` adds two new singleton dimensions (axes) to the `mean` tensor.  `None` in NumPy (and thus PyTorch) is syntactic sugar for `np.newaxis`, effectively inserting a new axis of size 1 at the specified position.  Consider a tensor `mean` with shape (N,).  After applying `[:, None, None]`, its shape becomes (N, 1, 1).  This is perfectly valid, but problems arise when this reshaped tensor interacts with other tensors in operations that implicitly or explicitly depend on the shapes aligning.

The crash doesn't originate from the slicing operation itself, but from subsequent operations that are incompatible with the (N, 1, 1) shape.  These operations might include:

* **Matrix multiplications:** If you attempt a matrix multiplication with a tensor expecting a (N, M) shape, a (N, 1, 1) tensor will be incompatible, leading to a `RuntimeError`  in PyTorch. The dimensions must be appropriately aligned for broadcasting or explicit reshaping must be performed.

* **Broadcasting errors:**  PyTorch's broadcasting rules, while flexible, have limitations.  If you try to broadcast a (N, 1, 1) tensor with another tensor of a shape that cannot be implicitly expanded to match the (N, 1, 1) shape in all dimensions, a `RuntimeError` can occur, often related to incompatible shape dimensions.

* **Tensor operations with explicit shape requirements:** Certain PyTorch functions might explicitly require a tensor to have a particular number of dimensions. For instance, some loss functions or layers in neural networks might be designed for specific input shapes, failing when presented with a tensor possessing an unexpected number of dimensions.

* **Incorrect indexing:** Subsequent indexing operations after the `[:, None, None]` manipulation might inadvertently try to access non-existent dimensions or incorrectly interpret the added singleton dimensions, leading to index out-of-bounds errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication Failure**

```python
import torch

# Assume 'mean' is calculated elsewhere and has shape (10,)
mean = torch.randn(10)

# Adding singleton dimensions
reshaped_mean = mean[:, None, None]  # Shape: (10, 1, 1)

# Another tensor
other_tensor = torch.randn(10, 5)

# This will CRASH because of incompatible shapes for matrix multiplication.
try:
    result = torch.matmul(reshaped_mean, other_tensor)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"RuntimeError: {e}")
    print("Solution: Reshape 'reshaped_mean' to (10, 1) or use broadcasting carefully")


#Corrected Version Using Broadcasting
result = reshaped_mean * other_tensor #Broadcasting works here
print(result.shape)
```

This demonstrates a scenario where a straightforward matrix multiplication attempt fails due to the incompatible shapes.  The `RuntimeError` clearly points to this problem.


**Example 2: Broadcasting Issue**

```python
import torch

mean = torch.randn(5, 10)
reshaped_mean = mean[:, None, None] # shape (5,1,1)
another_tensor = torch.randn(5, 1, 10)

#This will work due to broadcasting rules
result = reshaped_mean + another_tensor
print(result.shape)

another_tensor_2 = torch.randn(5,10)
# This will CRASH because broadcasting cannot align (5,1,1) with (5,10) along the second dimension
try:
  result = reshaped_mean + another_tensor_2
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"RuntimeError: {e}")
  print("Solution: Adjust shapes for compatibility or use explicit reshaping.")
```

This illustrates a crash caused by a failed attempt to broadcast a (5, 1, 1) tensor with a (5, 10) tensor. The PyTorch broadcasting rules cannot implicitly align these dimensions.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Indexing**

```python
import torch

mean = torch.randn(3, 4, 5)
reshaped_mean = mean[:, None, None]  # Shape: (3, 1, 1, 4, 5)

# Attempting to access a dimension that doesn't exist after reshaping
try:
    incorrect_access = reshaped_mean[:, 0, 0, 0, 0]
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"IndexError: {e}")
    print("Solution: Carefully check indexing after adding singleton dimensions.")

# Correct Indexing
correct_access = reshaped_mean[:, 0, 0]
print(correct_access.shape)
```

This example highlights a scenario where the added singleton dimensions might lead to incorrect indexing, resulting in an `IndexError`. Understanding the new shape is crucial for avoiding such errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, focusing on tensor operations, broadcasting semantics, and error handling.  Additionally, review resources covering NumPy array manipulation, as many concepts are directly transferable.  Finally, working through tutorials that focus on building and debugging complex neural networks will provide invaluable practical experience in handling these types of dimensionality-related issues.  Pay close attention to the shape of your tensors at each step of your computations.  Using debugging tools and print statements to examine the shape of intermediate tensors can be invaluable in pinpointing the source of these kinds of errors.  Careful attention to detail, understanding broadcasting behavior, and rigorous testing are essential.
