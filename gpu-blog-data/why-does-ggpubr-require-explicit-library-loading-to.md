The `mean_se` function, provided by the `ggpubr` R package, operates within a specific design paradigm that necessitates its explicit loading. Unlike base R functions or those included in packages that automatically register their functionality during installation, functions like `mean_se` rely on a dynamic namespace system. This system aims to reduce the potential for conflicts between packages, but it also requires the user to indicate explicitly when they wish to access non-exported or package-specific functions. My experience working on several data visualization projects has frequently brought this characteristic to the forefront.

Specifically, the issue arises from the manner in which `ggpubr` exposes its functions and internal tools. The package is not designed to automatically make all of its functions globally available upon loading the package with a standard `library(ggpubr)` call. Instead, many internal functions and utility functions, including `mean_se`, are intentionally not exported. This means they are not directly accessible using unqualified names from the global R environment even after you have loaded the `ggpubr` package into your current session.

The intention behind this practice is to maintain a cleaner, less cluttered global environment. If every function within every package were directly available upon loading, namespace collisions would be extremely prevalent. For instance, multiple packages may have functions that perform related but distinct operations, and the unqualified call to one could inadvertently invoke another, leading to unpredictable behavior.

Furthermore, the `ggpubr` package leverages the `ggplot2` plotting system extensively and frequently performs data manipulation internally before passing data to plotting functions. The `mean_se` function is often used in this context, providing pre-calculated summary statistics for error bars and similar visual components of plots. It's a function that’s typically integrated into a `ggplot2` aesthetic mapping rather than as a general-purpose statistical calculation tool.

To use `mean_se`, one must explicitly load it by calling `ggpubr::mean_se` or assigning it to a variable or a new function after loading using code such as `my_mean_se <- ggpubr::mean_se`. This explicit specification allows R's namespace management to correctly resolve the intended function within the context of the user’s current R session. This method is crucial in avoiding conflicts and ensuring that `mean_se` operates as intended within the `ggpubr` framework.

Below are several code examples that illustrate this behavior and demonstrate the explicit loading approach.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Usage (Without Explicit Loading)**

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a sample dataframe
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  value = rnorm(20, mean = c(5, 10), sd = 2)
)

# Attempt to use mean_se directly
ggplot(data, aes(x=group, y=value)) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar")
```
This code snippet will produce an error indicating that `mean_se` is not found. The R interpreter attempts to locate a function named `mean_se` within the global environment, but because it is not exported from `ggpubr` it does not exist outside of `ggpubr`'s namespace. This illustrates the necessity for explicit specification.

**Code Example 2: Correct Usage (Explicit Loading)**

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a sample dataframe
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  value = rnorm(20, mean = c(5, 10), sd = 2)
)

# Use ggpubr::mean_se to access the function directly
ggplot(data, aes(x=group, y=value)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = ggpubr::mean_se, geom = "errorbar")
```
This modified code uses the namespace operator (`::`) to explicitly call the `mean_se` function from the `ggpubr` package. R's namespace management can correctly find and utilize the intended function which correctly calculates the mean and standard error used for error bars within the ggplot visualization.

**Code Example 3: Alternate Correct Usage (Function Assignment)**

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a sample dataframe
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  value = rnorm(20, mean = c(5, 10), sd = 2)
)

# Assign ggpubr::mean_se to a new variable
my_mean_se <- ggpubr::mean_se

# Use the new variable
ggplot(data, aes(x=group, y=value)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = my_mean_se, geom = "errorbar")
```
Here, I am demonstrating how to assign the function from a specific namespace into the global environment. While it is not best practice to pollute your workspace, this does demonstrate that the function was not available in the global environment until this assignment. The function `my_mean_se` now refers to the original `ggpubr::mean_se` function and operates equivalently.

In summary, `ggpubr`'s decision to require explicit loading for functions like `mean_se` reflects a broader strategy for package design in R. This strategy prioritizes namespace management and reduces the risk of conflicts. Although it may require additional syntax, it is a fundamental practice for maintaining code clarity and ensuring that package functions are used as intended within the R environment. It also contributes to a more modular and robust programming ecosystem.

For further resources to understand package development and namespace management in R, I would recommend consulting the following. First, Hadley Wickham's "Advanced R" provides a detailed explanation of R's object-oriented and namespace systems, particularly the chapter on environments. Second, the official R documentation for packages is beneficial for understanding how packages are structured. Finally, several online tutorials from reputable universities and data science organizations offer practical guidance on R programming concepts, often with examples relating to package handling. These sources provide a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms and best practices when working with R packages.
