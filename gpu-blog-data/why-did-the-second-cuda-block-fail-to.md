The failure of a second CUDA block to launch often stems from insufficient resources, particularly concerning memory allocation and thread scheduling limitations.  In my experience debugging kernel launches across diverse GPU architectures, this issue rarely points to a fundamental flaw within the kernel code itself, but rather a misconfiguration of the launch parameters or an oversight in resource management.  Proper understanding of CUDA's memory hierarchy, grid and block dimensions, and error handling is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA's execution model relies on organizing threads into blocks, and blocks into a grid.  Each block executes on a single multiprocessor (SM) within the GPU.  The launch of a kernel is dictated by the `<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>` specification.  Failure of a subsequent block launch doesn't necessarily imply a problem with the kernel code; instead, consider these possibilities:

* **Insufficient GPU Memory:**  The most common cause is insufficient global memory available on the GPU.  If the first block's execution successfully allocates a significant portion of the GPU's memory, subsequent blocks might not have enough space to allocate their required data. This is especially relevant when dealing with large datasets or kernels with substantial memory footprint.  Insufficient shared memory within a block can also lead to launch failures, but this typically manifests as errors within the first block.

* **Resource Contention:** While less frequent, resource contention can lead to unpredictable behavior.  If several kernels are competing for the same SMs concurrently, one or more kernel launches can fail.  This is particularly noticeable when dealing with high-bandwidth memory operations, where data transfer latencies can delay subsequent block launches.  Careful timing analysis and profiling can highlight this.

* **Incorrect Grid and Block Dimensions:**  Improperly defined `gridDim` and `blockDim` can result in unexpected behavior.  For instance, if the specified number of blocks exceeds the GPU's capacity (limited by the number of SMs), some blocks will fail to launch.  Similarly, if `blockDim` exceeds the maximum block size supported by the specific GPU architecture, a launch failure will occur.  This often leads to a silent failure; an apparent success but with incorrect results.

* **Driver Issues or Hardware Limitations:**  Although less common, driver bugs or hardware malfunction can contribute to kernel launch failures.  Checking for driver updates and verifying GPU health through appropriate tools are crucial steps in troubleshooting.

* **Error Handling:**  The absence of proper error handling is a critical oversight.  Checking for CUDA errors after each kernel launch is vital for identifying the root cause of failure.  Ignoring error codes can lead to misleading conclusions.  CUDA provides functions like `cudaGetLastError()` to facilitate this process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Insufficient Global Memory**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int* data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB of data
  int* h_data;
  int* d_data;

  h_data = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize data (omitted for brevity)

  // First launch successful (assuming enough memory)
  myKernel<<<1024, 1024>>>(d_data, size);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Wait for the kernel to complete

  //Check for Errors (Crucial!)
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
  if(err != cudaSuccess){
    std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }


  // Second launch might fail due to insufficient memory
  myKernel<<<1024, 1024>>>(d_data, size);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  //Check for Errors (Crucial!)
  err = cudaGetLastError();
  if(err != cudaSuccess){
    std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // ...rest of the code...

  cudaFree(d_data);
  free(h_data);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how allocating a large dataset and launching multiple kernels might lead to memory exhaustion, resulting in the second launch failing. The crucial addition here is explicit error checking after each `cudaLaunch` to pinpoint the failing step.


**Example 2: Incorrect Block Dimensions**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int* data, int size) {
  // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024 * 1024;
  int* h_data;
  int* d_data;

  // ... allocate and initialize data ...

  // First launch with correct dimensions
  dim3 blockDim(256, 1, 1);
  dim3 gridDim((size + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x, 1, 1); // Correct calculation
  myKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_data, size);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError(); // error check
  if(err != cudaSuccess){
      std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
      return 1;
  }

  // Second launch with excessively large block dimensions
  blockDim.x = 1024 * 1024; // Excessively large, exceeding maximum block size
  gridDim = dim3(1, 1, 1); //Doesn't matter now because the block size is wrong
  myKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_data, size);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    err = cudaGetLastError(); // error check
  if(err != cudaSuccess){
      std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
      return 1;
  }

  // ... rest of the code ...
}
```

This example highlights the consequences of using overly large block dimensions.  Attempting to launch a kernel with a block size exceeding the GPU's capabilities will result in a launch failure.  The specific maximum block size is architecture-dependent.


**Example 3: Basic Error Handling**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int* data, int size) {
  // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
    // ... data allocation and initialization omitted ...

    // Kernel launch with error checking
    dim3 blockDim(256,1,1);
    dim3 gridDim((size + blockDim.x -1)/blockDim.x, 1, 1);

    cudaError_t err = cudaSuccess; //initialize error code

    err = cudaLaunchKernel((void*)myKernel, gridDim, blockDim, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess){
        std::cerr << "CUDA kernel launch failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    //Second kernel launch with error checking
    err = cudaLaunchKernel((void*)myKernel, gridDim, blockDim, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (err != cudaSuccess){
        std::cerr << "CUDA kernel launch failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ... rest of the code ...
}
```

This example demonstrates a robust approach by explicitly checking the return value of `cudaLaunchKernel`.  This allows for precise identification of the launch failure and avoids overlooking potential errors.  Remember that error checking should be integral to any CUDA application.
