The core issue with nested `std::scoped_lock` instances lies in their inability to directly manage recursive mutex acquisition.  In my experience troubleshooting multithreaded applications, this limitation often leads to deadlocks if not carefully considered.  `std::scoped_lock` guarantees exclusive access to multiple mutexes simultaneously, but it does not inherently support a mutex being locked multiple times by the same thread.  Attempts to recursively acquire a mutex protected by a `std::scoped_lock` will result in indefinite blocking.  This behavior stems from the fundamental design of standard mutexes, not a shortcoming of `std::scoped_lock` itself.

To clarify, let's define the problem:  a nested lock scenario occurs when a function protected by a `std::scoped_lock` calls another function, also protected by a `std::scoped_lock`, and either of these locks involves a common mutex. The problem isn't solely the nesting; it's the attempt to reacquire the same mutex within the nested scope.

**1.  Explanation of the Limitation:**

`std::scoped_lock` operates by acquiring all provided mutexes in the order specified within its constructor. This acquisition is performed atomically; either all mutexes are locked, or none are.  Upon leaving the scope of the `std::scoped_lock`, the mutexes are automatically unlocked in reverse order of acquisition. This RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) approach is elegant and error-preventative in standard multithreaded scenarios, but it directly conflicts with recursive mutex acquisition.

Standard mutexes, unlike recursive mutexes, do not track the number of times a thread has acquired them.  A recursive mutex, upon a subsequent attempt to lock by the same thread, will simply increment an internal counter instead of blocking.  A standard mutex, however, will block the thread indefinitely if it attempts to acquire the lock a second time while already holding it. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent subtle deadlocks that could arise from incorrect assumptions about mutex ownership.

Because `std::scoped_lock` uses standard mutexes by default, it cannot handle nested locking scenarios where a mutex might be reacquired within the same thread's execution. Attempting this will result in the thread blocking indefinitely, waiting for itself to release the mutex.  This situation manifests as a deadlock, often difficult to diagnose without careful debugging and analysis of thread execution.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Deadlock Scenario**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

std::mutex mtx1, mtx2;

void function1() {
  std::scoped_lock lock1({mtx1, mtx2}); //Acquires mtx1, then mtx2
  std::cout << "Function 1 acquired locks.\n";
  function2(); //Attempting to acquire mtx1 again within function2 will deadlock
  std::cout << "Function 1 released locks.\n";
}

void function2() {
  std::scoped_lock lock2({mtx2, mtx1}); //Acquires mtx2, then attempts mtx1 (deadlock)
  std::cout << "Function 2 acquired locks.\n";
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100)); //To illustrate the deadlock
  std::cout << "Function 2 released locks.\n";
}

int main() {
  std::thread t1(function1);
  t1.join();
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a classic deadlock.  `function1` acquires `mtx1` and `mtx2`. `function2` is called, attempting to acquire `mtx2` (already held by `function1`) then `mtx1` (also held by `function1`).  This creates a circular dependency, resulting in a deadlock; neither function can proceed.  The `sleep` is included to allow the deadlock to become apparent, as without it, the program might appear to function briefly.


**Example 2:  Avoiding Deadlock with Different Mutex Order**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

std::mutex mtx1, mtx2;

void function1() {
  std::scoped_lock lock1({mtx1, mtx2});
  std::cout << "Function 1 acquired locks.\n";
  function2();
  std::cout << "Function 1 released locks.\n";
}

void function2() {
  std::scoped_lock lock2({mtx1, mtx2}); //Order is crucial here to avoid deadlock.
  std::cout << "Function 2 acquired locks.\n";
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
  std::cout << "Function 2 released locks.\n";
}

int main() {
  std::thread t1(function1);
  t1.join();
  return 0;
}

```

This example, subtly different from the first, avoids the deadlock. Note the order of mutexes passed to `std::scoped_lock` in `function2`. By acquiring `mtx1` before `mtx2` it mirrors the locking order in `function1`. Thus, there is no circular dependency and the code will execute without deadlocking.


**Example 3: Using `std::recursive_mutex`**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

std::recursive_mutex mtx;

void function1() {
  std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lock(mtx);
  std::cout << "Function 1 acquired lock.\n";
  function2();
  std::cout << "Function 1 released lock.\n";
}

void function2() {
  std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lock(mtx);
  std::cout << "Function 2 acquired lock.\n";
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
  std::cout << "Function 2 released lock.\n";
}

int main() {
  std::thread t1(function1);
  t1.join();
  return 0;
}

```

This example uses `std::recursive_mutex`, allowing recursive locking. This solves the nested locking problem by enabling a thread to acquire the same mutex multiple times without blocking. Note that `std::scoped_lock` is not directly used here because its atomic acquisition of multiple mutexes is incompatible with the recursive nature of `std::recursive_mutex`.  A `std::lock_guard` is sufficient as we're only dealing with a single mutex per function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of mutexes and thread synchronization, I would recommend consulting the C++ Standard Library documentation, a comprehensive C++ textbook covering concurrency, and  advanced guides on multithreading and parallel programming.  These resources will provide a thorough grounding in the intricacies of thread safety and help prevent common pitfalls encountered in multithreaded application development.  Careful attention to mutex usage is critical for robust and deadlock-free software.
