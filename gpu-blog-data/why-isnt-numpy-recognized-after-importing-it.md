The observation that NumPy isn't recognized after import commonly stems from how the import statement is structured and the scope of the resulting name. I've seen this issue arise countless times in development environments, often leading to confusion, particularly among those new to Python and its package management system. The core issue revolves around the namespace where NumPy's objects are made available. Let me elaborate.

A standard `import numpy` statement introduces a new namespace under the name `numpy`. This means the functions, classes, and constants within the NumPy package become accessible *only* when referenced through this namespace prefix. For example, to use the `array` function, one would need to call `numpy.array()`. Simply attempting to call `array()` directly will result in a `NameError`, as the interpreter doesn’t find an object with that name in the immediate scope.

Another cause, and less commonly encountered during the initial stages of coding, involves virtual environments. Incorrect environment activation or a missing package installation can lead to a situation where NumPy is seemingly not present or where a different version than expected is being used. This can even involve clashes or interference from an incorrectly configured system path. A robust practice is to always ensure the intended environment is activated and use a package manager to explicitly manage dependencies.

I recall once spending a good hour debugging an application only to discover that a test script had inadvertently been executed from outside its virtual environment. This misstep caused a seemingly inexplicable `ModuleNotFoundError` for NumPy. This episode cemented the necessity of always checking the Python interpreter's environment path.

The second major point revolves around the different ways we import libraries. It's not just about having NumPy available. Specifically, the difference between `import numpy` and `from numpy import *` (or `from numpy import array`) is crucial to understand. `import numpy` makes the namespace available, forcing us to explicitly refer to each of NumPy's objects using `numpy.`. On the other hand, `from numpy import *` tries to directly import all objects from NumPy’s namespace directly into the current scope. Whilst this might appear simpler at first, the use of `from numpy import *` is heavily discouraged due to potential namespace pollution. Name collisions and difficulty tracing code become a major headache in larger codebases, making it challenging to reason about the origin of an object.

Let’s consider this through the following code examples.

**Example 1: Correct Import with Namespace**

```python
import numpy

my_array = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])
print(my_array)

random_number = numpy.random.rand()
print(random_number)
```
Here, we import the entire NumPy package and then access functions and modules via the `numpy.` prefix. This is the recommended way to import packages. It prevents name clashes and makes it transparent from where each object originates. The call to `numpy.array` creates a NumPy array, and `numpy.random.rand()` generates a random number. The output would correctly print the array and a random floating-point value.

**Example 2: Incorrect Direct Usage**

```python
import numpy

my_array = array([1, 2, 3]) # Incorrect - array is not defined in local namespace
print(my_array)
```

This code throws a `NameError`. The interpreter cannot find `array` in the current namespace, because the `array` function lives in the namespace defined by the `numpy` import. To use `array`, the code must reference `numpy.array`.  This specific case demonstrates the most common issue I’ve seen when new users struggle with imports.

**Example 3: Selective Import with from..import**

```python
from numpy import array, random

my_array = array([1, 2, 3])
print(my_array)

random_number = random.rand()
print(random_number)
```

This example demonstrates the use of `from numpy import array, random`. In this case, the `array` and `random` objects are imported directly into the current namespace without requiring the `numpy.` prefix. However, the `random` here is the `random` module from numpy, and the calls should be `random.rand()`. I've seen experienced developers write `random()` thinking they're calling a random number generator, highlighting how imports directly into the current namespace can be a source of confusing bugs. Although more concise in some instances, it is prone to confusion and should be used cautiously.

While debugging, especially when working with different versions of Python or packages, it is very useful to print out paths that the interpreter searches in when locating packages. This can be achieved using the built-in `sys` library and accessing `sys.path`. I typically do this using:

```python
import sys

print(sys.path)
```

This allows me to debug more complex scenarios involving path configuration problems.

Another frequent pitfall I've encountered involves accidentally overriding imported names. For instance, if the user defines a variable also named `array` before importing NumPy, then calling `array()` after importing NumPy will refer to the previously-defined variable, creating subtle and unexpected behaviours. This again highlights the value of avoiding blanket imports and being explicit about namespace usage.

In summary, the primary cause of NumPy not being recognized after import lies in not understanding the scoping behaviour of Python’s import statements. Specifically, using a bare object name from NumPy (like `array`) without prefixing it with the imported namespace (like `numpy.array`) will throw an error because this object is not present in the current scope.  Incorrect environment setups and masking import names can also be potential problems, but the initial issue is understanding the implications of Python namespaces.

For further investigation, I suggest looking into Python's official documentation on modules, packages, and import statements. There are many great guides on virtual environment management which are important to read, including how to create, activate, and configure them for each project. Furthermore, documentation for the relevant Python package manager, typically `pip` or `conda`, provides further guidance on dependency management. A strong knowledge of the Python module system and package management is vital for working with libraries such as NumPy effectively. Finally, if an IDE is in use, it is worth spending time understanding its debugging tools, as these can be invaluable in diagnosing path and import issues quickly.
