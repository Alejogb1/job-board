The Keras `MeanSquaredError` loss function, by default, calculates a scalar average of the squared errors across all data points in a batch, not the per-data-point losses directly. This behavior is often suitable for training where a single aggregate loss value guides optimization, but situations arise where access to the individual loss components is crucial. I've encountered this frequently in scenarios involving outlier detection, per-example importance weighting, and detailed error analysis during model debugging. Extracting these per-sample losses requires leveraging the underlying tensor operations and avoiding the default aggregation.

The standard `MeanSquaredError` class in Keras, when invoked with model predictions and true labels, internally computes the squared error per output dimension and then averages these errors across all samples and output dimensions. Specifically, if we denote predictions as \( \hat{y} \) and true labels as \( y \), the squared error for a single data point \( i \) at output dimension \( j \) is given by \( (\hat{y}_{ij} - y_{ij})^2 \). Keras subsequently averages this value across all \( i \) and \( j \) to produce the scalar loss. To retain the per-sample loss, we need to prevent this averaging across the batch dimension, which is typically the first axis of the tensor.

The key modification lies in circumventing Keras' default reduction operation. Instead of allowing Keras to perform the average, we must compute the squared error as a tensor and handle any subsequent reductions ourselves. This requires a slight redefinition of the loss function's behavior when called within the model context. This can be achieved in a couple of ways, often involving functional API layers or custom loss classes.

Consider a simple regression task. Suppose we have a model that predicts a single continuous variable, where predictions and labels are both 2D tensors where the first dimension is the batch size and the second dimension is always 1. This means each data point has a single predicted output, and a single ground-truth output. Keras `MeanSquaredError` would compute the squared difference between these output values, sum them across the batch, and divide the result by the batch size. To obtain the losses without aggregation over the batch, we should avoid this averaging, retaining the summed squared difference for each example.

Here’s an illustrative code example using Keras functional API, which is often useful when such fine-grained control is required:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def per_sample_mse(y_true, y_pred):
    """Computes Mean Squared Error without averaging across the batch dimension."""
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1) # Sum the square error of each output dimension

# Define a simple regression model using Keras Functional API
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,))
x = layers.Dense(1)(inputs)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

# Generate some sample data
X = tf.random.normal((10, 1))
y = tf.random.normal((10, 1))

# Calculate the per sample MSE
per_sample_losses = per_sample_mse(y, model(X))
print("Per Sample MSE:", per_sample_losses.numpy())
```

In this first example, `per_sample_mse` function directly computes the squared difference, then aggregates these across output dimensions using `tf.reduce_sum`. Crucially, no reduction is performed across the batch dimension, which is the first dimension. The resulting tensor contains a loss value for each sample in the batch. This method is flexible because it can be easily integrated into any model architecture by simply calling the model with inputs and passing the result into the loss function.

The second example illustrates how to implement a custom loss class, deriving from `keras.losses.Loss` to provide a reusable component. This approach has the advantage of integrating directly into model compilation, making it suitable when a custom loss is intended as a key part of the training process.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class PerSampleMeanSquaredError(keras.losses.Loss):
    """Computes Mean Squared Error without averaging across the batch dimension using a custom class."""
    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1)

# Define a simple regression model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,))
x = layers.Dense(1)(inputs)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)


# Generate some sample data
X = tf.random.normal((10, 1))
y = tf.random.normal((10, 1))


# Calculate the per sample MSE
loss_fn = PerSampleMeanSquaredError()
per_sample_losses = loss_fn(y, model(X))
print("Per Sample MSE using a custom class:", per_sample_losses.numpy())


#Example with compilation
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=PerSampleMeanSquaredError())
# Generate dummy training data
X_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 2) #fit with the defined custom loss function
```

The custom loss class, `PerSampleMeanSquaredError`, encapsulates the identical calculation logic as the functional example.  The key distinction is the usage: when the loss is used to calculate values directly, it behaves identically, but when included in `model.compile`, the loss is internally called using the model outputs in the training loop. The `call` method provides the tensor operation to calculate per-example losses, without any reduction across the batch dimension. This approach can be particularly useful for integrating per-sample loss into other callbacks and metrics.

Lastly, a slight variation of the custom loss class involves broadcasting to avoid potential errors related to different tensor shapes. This broadcasting ensures that element-wise differences between predictions and targets are performed correctly, particularly in situations where there might be dimension mismatches or when dealing with multi-output models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers


class PerSampleMeanSquaredErrorBroadcast(keras.losses.Loss):
    """Computes Mean Squared Error without averaging across the batch dimension using broadcast."""
    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        squared_diff = tf.square(y_pred - y_true)
        return tf.reduce_sum(squared_diff, axis=tf.range(1, tf.rank(squared_diff))) # Sum the square error across all dimensions beyond batch


# Define a simple regression model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,))
x = layers.Dense(1)(inputs)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

# Generate some sample data
X = tf.random.normal((10, 1))
y = tf.random.normal((10, 1))

# Calculate per sample mse using broadcast
loss_fn = PerSampleMeanSquaredErrorBroadcast()
per_sample_losses = loss_fn(y, model(X))
print("Per sample MSE using custom broadcast class: ", per_sample_losses.numpy())
```

The `PerSampleMeanSquaredErrorBroadcast` loss class uses a more robust way to compute sum of the squared error per sample. The use of `tf.range(1, tf.rank(squared_diff))` dynamically calculates the axis for summation, ensuring it correctly reduces across all dimensions of the squared difference tensor except for the batch dimension. This approach is less susceptible to dimension-related errors and is especially useful when dealing with varying data shapes, particularly in multidimensional output scenarios. This more general approach also works in the prior single output examples.

In summary, calculating per-data-point MSE requires explicitly preventing the averaging operation present in the standard Keras `MeanSquaredError` class. I would advise against modifying the core Keras loss function, and instead suggest crafting custom functions and classes. The provided examples demonstrate how to achieve this using functional API calls, custom loss classes, and broadcasted summation over output dimensions. The selection between the approaches depends on the specific context.  For most applications, directly defining a custom `per_sample_mse` function suffices; however, for more integrated training workflows, a custom loss class is preferable. For cases with output that has multiple dimensions, broadcast methods are advisable. It is important to note that access to individual loss values after training is usually done by calling the `per_sample_mse` directly on batches, which should be done without altering the data loading or optimization loops. The per-sample losses can then be used for tasks including detailed error analysis, adaptive sampling, or in sophisticated cost functions.

For learning more about custom loss functions in Keras, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation section on defining custom layers and losses. The guides in the Keras documentation on Functional APIs will help make sense of the first approach. The deep learning with python text by Chollet and the Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow by Géron also offer a rich description of custom losses.
