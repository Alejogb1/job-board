Recurrent Neural Networks, particularly those employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, are uniquely suited to handle sequential data.  Their inherent architecture, with its feedback connections, allows them to maintain a hidden state representing information from previous time steps, a crucial feature for effectively processing sequences of numbers.  My experience implementing these networks in financial time series prediction highlighted this capability; accurately forecasting market trends necessitated the LSTM's ability to capture long-range dependencies in numerical data.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental mechanism lies in the LSTM cell's internal gates. Unlike simpler RNNs prone to vanishing or exploding gradients, LSTMs mitigate this issue through a sophisticated gating mechanism.  This mechanism involves three primary gates: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. Each gate is a sigmoid function, outputting a value between 0 and 1, controlling the flow of information.

The forget gate decides what information to discard from the cell state.  A value close to 0 indicates the complete removal of information, while a value near 1 suggests retention.  The input gate determines which new information to add to the cell state.  This new information is generated by a tanh activation function, scaling the values to a range between -1 and 1, before being element-wise multiplied with the input gate's output.  The output gate then decides what part of the cell state to output as the hidden state, which is subsequently used to influence the processing of the next element in the sequence.

The cell state, acting as a conveyor belt of information, traverses the LSTM network, selectively adding and removing information at each time step.  This allows the network to remember important information over extended sequences, addressing the limitations of standard RNNs. For numerical sequences, this means the network can establish relationships between numbers separated by considerable temporal distances, such as identifying trends or patterns in financial data or detecting anomalies in sensor readings.  The final output of the LSTM network, typically a function of the final hidden state, can be a prediction, a classification, or some other representation depending on the task's objective.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate LSTM implementations in Python using Keras, a high-level API for TensorFlow/Theano. These examples represent simplified scenarios; real-world applications typically demand more sophisticated architectures and hyperparameter tuning.  My experience involved extensive experimentation with different optimizers, layer configurations, and regularization techniques to achieve optimal performance.


**Example 1: Simple Sequence Prediction**

This example predicts the next number in a sequence.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5, 8], [2, 3, 5, 8, 13]])
data = data.reshape(1, 5, 1)

# Build the model
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(5, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(data, np.array([[13]]), epochs=100)

# Predict the next number
prediction = model.predict(np.array([[[8], [13], [0], [0], [0]]]))
print(f"Prediction: {prediction[0][0]}")
```

This code demonstrates a basic LSTM setup for sequence prediction. The input shape (5,1) specifies five time steps with one feature each (a single number).  The `Dense` layer with one neuron outputs a single prediction. The `mse` loss function suits regression tasks.  Note the use of zero-padding to maintain consistent input length during prediction.

**Example 2: Multi-variate Time Series Forecasting**

This expands upon the previous example by processing multiple features concurrently.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: multiple features influencing a target variable
data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 3) # 100 samples, 10 timesteps, 3 features
targets = np.random.rand(100, 1) # 100 samples, 1 target variable

# Build the model
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 3)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(data, targets, epochs=100)

# Predict on new data
new_data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 3)
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

This example showcases a more realistic scenario with multiple features (3) representing different aspects of the sequence. The input shape reflects this, and the model learns relationships between these features over time.

**Example 3: Sequence Classification**

This example classifies a numerical sequence.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Sample data: sequences classified into two categories
data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 1) #100 samples, 10 timesteps, 1 feature
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100) # 100 binary labels
labels = to_categorical(labels, num_classes=2) #One-hot encode

#Build the model
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,1)))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax')) #Softmax for multi-class classification
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#Train the model
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=100)

#Predict on new data
new_data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 1)
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
print(f"Prediction probabilities: {prediction}")
```

Here, the task is classification, so a softmax activation function and categorical cross-entropy loss are used. The output represents the probability of each class.  The `to_categorical` function converts the integer labels into one-hot encoded vectors, suitable for categorical cross-entropy.
