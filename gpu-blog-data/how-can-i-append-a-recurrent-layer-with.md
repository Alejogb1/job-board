Appending a recurrent layer with a differing hidden size to a pre-existing PyTorch LSTM model requires careful consideration of input and output dimensions.  Directly concatenating layers with mismatched hidden sizes is not possible; a linear transformation is necessary to bridge the dimensional gap.  My experience working on sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing heavily informs this approach.  I've encountered this challenge frequently when adapting pre-trained models or experimenting with architectural variations.

**1.  Explanation of the Append Process:**

The core issue lies in the LSTM's internal state. Each LSTM layer outputs a hidden state of a specific size, determined by the `hidden_size` parameter during its instantiation.  Subsequent layers expect the input to match this hidden state's dimensionality.  When appending a layer with a different `hidden_size`, the output of the preceding layer must be transformed to align with the new layer's input requirements. This transformation is optimally achieved using a fully connected (linear) layer.

The process involves three steps:

* **Extraction of the LSTM's Output:**  The final hidden state (or output sequence) of the existing LSTM needs to be accessed. This state represents the learned features from the initial layers.

* **Linear Transformation:** A linear layer is then applied to the LSTM's output. This layer's input size is the hidden size of the existing LSTM, and its output size is the desired hidden size of the new layer. The linear layer performs a matrix multiplication and bias addition, projecting the data into the correct dimensional space.

* **Integration of the New LSTM Layer:** The output of the linear transformation serves as input to the newly added LSTM layer. This layer then processes the transformed data, learning further temporal dependencies within the sequence.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Appending a smaller hidden size layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Existing LSTM layer (assume it's part of a larger model)
lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, batch_first=True)

# New LSTM layer with smaller hidden size
lstm2 = nn.LSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size=10, batch_first=True) # input_size reflects the output of the linear layer below.

# Linear transformation layer
linear = nn.Linear(20, 10) # maps from lstm1's hidden size to lstm2's input size

# Forward pass
input_seq = torch.randn(32, 50, 10) # batch_size, seq_len, input_size

output, (hn, cn) = lstm1(input_seq)

# Apply linear transformation
transformed_output = linear(output)

# Pass transformed output to the new LSTM layer
output2, (hn2, cn2) = lstm2(transformed_output)

# output2 now contains the output of the appended layer.
```

This example demonstrates appending a layer with a smaller hidden size. The linear layer down-projects the 20-dimensional hidden state to a 10-dimensional representation suitable for `lstm2`. Note the `input_size` of `lstm2` is set to 10 to match the output of the linear layer. The `batch_first=True` argument is crucial for consistent handling of batch dimensions.


**Example 2: Appending a larger hidden size layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, batch_first=True)
lstm2 = nn.LSTM(input_size=40, hidden_size=40, batch_first=True)
linear = nn.Linear(20, 40) # Up-projection

input_seq = torch.randn(32, 50, 10)

output, (hn, cn) = lstm1(input_seq)
transformed_output = linear(output)
output2, (hn2, cn2) = lstm2(transformed_output)
```

Here, we append a layer with a larger hidden size (40). The linear layer now up-projects the 20-dimensional output of `lstm1` to 40 dimensions.  This allows the second LSTM to capture more complex features.


**Example 3:  Integrating within a custom model class:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ExtendedLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size1, hidden_size2):
        super(ExtendedLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size1, batch_first=True)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size1, hidden_size2)
        self.lstm2 = nn.LSTM(hidden_size2, hidden_size2, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        output, (hn, cn) = self.lstm1(x)
        transformed_output = self.linear(output)
        output2, (hn2, cn2) = self.lstm2(transformed_output)
        return output2

#Instantiation
model = ExtendedLSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size1=20, hidden_size2=30)
input_seq = torch.randn(32, 50, 10)
output = model(input_seq)
```

This example shows how to incorporate this functionality into a custom model.  This approach enhances code organization and reusability.  The `__init__` method defines the layers, and the `forward` method implements the sequential application of the LSTM layers and the linear transformation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of LSTMs and PyTorch, I strongly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra, particularly matrix multiplication, is crucial.  Furthermore, studying advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on recurrent neural networks is highly beneficial.  Exploring research papers on sequence-to-sequence models will provide valuable insights into architectural variations and advanced techniques.  Finally,  working through several example projects involving LSTMs will solidify your understanding and build practical skills.
