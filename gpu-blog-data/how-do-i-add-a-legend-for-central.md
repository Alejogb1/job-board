The `ggpubr` package, while convenient for generating publication-ready plots, lacks built-in functionality for directly adding legends to annotations like those depicting central tendency (e.g., mean, median). This limitation stems from the way annotations are handled within the `ggpubr` framework: they are typically added as geoms or using `annotate()`, which don't inherently participate in the legend generation process.  Over the years, I’ve encountered this issue numerous times during data visualization projects, requiring the development of workarounds.  The solution involves leveraging the underlying `ggplot2` functionality and careful manipulation of data structures.

My approach centers on creating a separate data frame specifically for legend entries, then using this dataframe to add the legend elements to the plot. This strategy provides flexibility and avoids the complications of trying to extract legend information directly from the annotation elements added by `ggpubr`.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The core principle is to generate separate `ggplot2` elements for the annotations, and to treat these elements as distinct layers within the plot, each contributing to the legend.  Instead of relying solely on `ggpubr`’s annotation features, we explicitly create geom objects (e.g., `geom_point`, `geom_hline`) representing the central tendency statistics, and assign each a specific aesthetic (like `shape` or `linetype`) that will appear in the legend.  A new data frame is created, mirroring the visual components of the annotations and matching their aesthetics to the assigned labels for the legend.

This separate data frame is then passed to the plot as an additional layer using the same `ggplot2` syntax.  Because these new layers are defined within the standard `ggplot2` framework, the legend automatically includes them, presenting a comprehensive view of the annotations and their corresponding statistical measures.  This avoids the need for intricate manipulations of `ggpubr`'s internal functions, ensuring compatibility and maintainability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate this with three examples, progressively increasing in complexity:

**Example 1:  Simple Mean Annotation with Legend**

```R
# Sample data
data <- data.frame(Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10)),
                   Value = c(rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 2)))

# Calculate means
means <- aggregate(Value ~ Group, data, mean)

# Create data frame for legend entries
legend_data <- data.frame(Group = means$Group,
                          Value = means$Value,
                          shape = 16) # shape for point in legend


# Generate the plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(data = means, aes(x = Group, y = Value, shape = Group), size = 4) +
  geom_point(data = legend_data, aes(x = Group, y = Value, shape = Group), size = 4) + # Added layer for legend
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(16,16)) + # Define shape manually to avoid potential issues
  labs(shape = "Group Mean") + # Label for the legend
  ggtitle("Boxplot with Mean Annotation and Legend")
```

This example shows a basic implementation. We calculate the means, create a `legend_data` frame mirroring the mean points, and add these as a layer to the `ggplot2` plot, ensuring the legend correctly displays the group means. The `scale_shape_manual` function explicitly defines the shape, preventing potential conflicts or unintended legend entries.

**Example 2: Mean and Median Annotations with Different Shapes**

```R
# Sample data (same as above)

# Calculate means and medians
means <- aggregate(Value ~ Group, data, mean)
medians <- aggregate(Value ~ Group, data, median)

# Create data frame for legend entries
legend_data <- data.frame(Group = c(means$Group, medians$Group),
                          Value = c(means$Value, medians$Value),
                          Annotation = factor(rep(c("Mean", "Median"), each = 2)),
                          shape = c(rep(16,2), rep(17,2)) ) # Different shapes for mean and median


# Generate the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(data = means, aes(x = Group, y = Value, shape = "Mean"), size = 4) +
  geom_point(data = medians, aes(x = Group, y = Value, shape = "Median"), size = 4) +
  geom_point(data = legend_data, aes(x = Group, y = Value, shape = Annotation), size = 4) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Mean" = 16, "Median" = 17), name = "Central Tendency", labels = c("Mean", "Median")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot with Mean and Median Annotations and Legend")
```

This expands on the first example by including medians. Different shapes are used to distinguish the mean and median in both the plot and the legend using `scale_shape_manual`.  The legend is explicitly labelled.

**Example 3:  Multiple Groups and Error Bars**

```R
# Sample data with more groups
data <- data.frame(Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
                   Value = c(rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 3)))

# Calculate means and standard errors
means_se <- aggregate(Value ~ Group, data, function(x) c(mean = mean(x), se = sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))))
means_se <- data.frame(means_se[1], means_se[2][,1], means_se[2][,2])
colnames(means_se) <- c("Group", "mean", "se")

# Create data frame for legend entries
legend_data <- data.frame(Group = means_se$Group,
                          Value = means_se$mean,
                          shape = 16)


# Generate plot with error bars
ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(data = means_se, aes(x = Group, y = mean, shape = Group), size = 4) +
  geom_errorbar(data = means_se, aes(x = Group, ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se), width = 0.2) +
  geom_point(data = legend_data, aes(x = Group, y = mean, shape = Group), size = 4) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = rep(16,3)) +
  labs(shape = "Group Mean") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot with Error Bars, Means, and Legend")
```

This example demonstrates handling multiple groups and incorporating error bars.  The standard error is calculated, and error bars are added using `geom_errorbar`. The legend remains straightforward, displaying the group means.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The `ggplot2` documentation provides comprehensive details on customizing plots and legends.  A thorough understanding of data manipulation using `dplyr` is crucial for efficiently preparing data for plotting.  Familiarity with R's base statistics functions for calculating central tendency measures is also essential.  Consulting a dedicated book on data visualization with R will offer a broader perspective on effective visual communication.  Finally, exploring online tutorials and forums focused specifically on `ggplot2` can help resolve specific challenges encountered during plot creation.
