VBScript, despite its age and limitations, sometimes remains necessary in legacy environments, where its performance, specifically in file I/O operations like writing, can become a bottleneck. I've personally encountered this while migrating large, data-processing routines dependent on legacy Active Server Page applications which relied heavily on VBScript for file manipulation. Optimizing file writing in VBScript hinges on understanding how the language interacts with the underlying Windows file system and the methods used to write data. Crucially, buffering and object reuse are the two most effective strategies to reduce write times.

The fundamental performance bottleneck in VBScript file writing often stems from opening and closing the file for every small write operation. Each interaction with the file system incurs overhead, including disk access, file handle acquisition, and handle release. When writing a large amount of data, these individual operations accumulate into significant delays. Furthermore, VBScript's default behavior can involve converting data to strings before writing, introducing another layer of processing that can be costly if not properly managed.

To mitigate these issues, I recommend employing a buffered write strategy. Instead of writing single lines or small chunks of data individually, accumulate the data into a temporary buffer and write it to disk in larger blocks. This considerably reduces the number of costly file system interactions. By opening the file only once, and closing it only after all data has been written, one significantly reduces overhead. It is important to remember to flush the buffer at the end of the operation to ensure all data is written to disk.

Additionally, the creation and destruction of file system objects adds overhead. The `Scripting.FileSystemObject` (FSO) can be used to access the underlying file system and write to files. However creating an FSO object every time you need to write is not efficient. Reusing the same instance of the object across multiple writes helps to reduce the creation and destruction overhead.

Below are three examples illustrating progressively more efficient file write approaches:

**Example 1: Inefficient Write (Line-by-Line)**

This example demonstrates the inefficient method of writing line-by-line, which should be avoided. Each call to `WriteLine` incurs the previously described overhead.

```vbscript
Dim objFSO, objFile, i
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set objFile = objFSO.CreateTextFile("inefficient_write.txt", True)

For i = 1 To 1000
    objFile.WriteLine "Line " & i
Next

objFile.Close
Set objFile = Nothing
Set objFSO = Nothing
```
*Commentary:* This is the simplest approach, but least performant. The loop continuously opens, writes to, and closes the file for each line.  The overhead of repeatedly interacting with the file system and creating a new `TextStream` object for each line will quickly degrade performance. The object references are also disposed of after the entire operation has concluded, which means the overhead of object creation and destruction is only incurred once at the beginning and end of the script.

**Example 2: Buffered Write (String Accumulation)**

This example illustrates a more performant technique using a string buffer. Data is accumulated in the buffer and then written to the file at once.

```vbscript
Dim objFSO, objFile, i, strBuffer
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set objFile = objFSO.CreateTextFile("buffered_write.txt", True)
strBuffer = ""

For i = 1 To 1000
    strBuffer = strBuffer & "Line " & i & vbCrLf
Next

objFile.Write strBuffer
objFile.Close
Set objFile = Nothing
Set objFSO = Nothing
```
*Commentary:* Here, we accumulate the lines in the `strBuffer` variable, and the file is only written to once. This significantly reduces the number of file system interactions. The `vbCrLf` constant ensures a proper line ending for text files. This technique drastically reduces the write times compared to Example 1 by minimizing file access overhead, and while the buffer is created within the loop, the overhead of such string concatenation is low compared to file system access. Again, object reference disposal is deferred until the end of the operation, which reduces unneeded overhead.

**Example 3: Optimized Buffered Write with Reused Object**

This is the most efficient approach, building upon Example 2 by reusing the `FileSystemObject` and `TextStream` objects.

```vbscript
Dim objFSO, objFile, i, strBuffer
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

Set objFile = objFSO.CreateTextFile("optimized_write.txt", True)
strBuffer = ""

For i = 1 To 1000
    strBuffer = strBuffer & "Line " & i & vbCrLf
Next

objFile.Write strBuffer
objFile.Close

Set objFile = Nothing
Set objFSO = Nothing
```
*Commentary:* While seemingly identical to Example 2, this code, when considered as part of a larger script that may need to write to multiple files or at multiple points in the scripts execution will benefit from holding on to the FSO object. In this single use case, there's no performance advantage. However, in a more complex script, the `objFSO` object could be maintained globally, thus avoiding the cost of `CreateObject` calls during subsequent file operations. Similarly the file object itself can be held onto if additional writes will be done. This helps to emphasize that the same instance of the `FileSystemObject` is leveraged, removing redundant object creation and destruction cycles. It's worth noting that if the file needs to be appended to in later parts of a script, the `ForAppending` option in `OpenTextFile` is more efficient than creating a new file stream object every time.

When optimizing VBScript file writing, these best practices should be prioritized. Accumulating data into buffers and minimizing file system interactions by avoiding repetitive open/close operations are essential strategies. In situations where VBScript is employed in legacy systems for substantial file operations, understanding the overhead associated with file handling and object usage is vital. I have personally seen these optimizations reduce total file write times by orders of magnitude, which has been critical in ensuring that legacy data processing pipelines could cope with current needs.

Further, consideration should also be given to the type of file access. If the file needs to be created then `CreateTextFile` should be used. If the file exists and should be appended to `OpenTextFile` with the `ForAppending` constant will be more efficient than reading the file, appending to the data and then writing it to disk. Similarly, if the file exists and needs to be overwritten, the `ForWriting` constant will be appropriate.

For further study in this area, I recommend exploring resources that delve into Windows Scripting Host (WSH) and VBScript specific performance considerations. Microsoft's official documentation for the WSH is an important resource. Also, publications centered around system administration and scripting often provide details on file system interactions and efficiency. While specific books may be outdated, a focus on the principles of system calls, buffering, and resource management will be broadly applicable to improving script performance. Additionally, examining large open source VBScript projects will provide valuable insights into how these concepts can be implemented in practice. Focusing on these types of references will provide a practical understanding of these concepts as applied in other contexts and further illuminate the best methods for file I/O optimization.
