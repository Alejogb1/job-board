Reshaping PyTorch tensors fundamentally involves rearranging the tensor's elements without altering their underlying data.  This is distinct from operations that modify the tensor's values.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the critical role of efficient tensor reshaping in optimizing memory usage and computational speed. Incorrect reshaping can lead to performance bottlenecks and unexpected errors, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.  Therefore, understanding the mechanics of tensor reshaping is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch offers several methods for reshaping tensors, primarily through the `reshape()`, `view()`, `flatten()`, and `squeeze()`/`unsqueeze()` functions.  The choice depends on the desired outcome and the constraints of the operation.  A crucial understanding lies in the distinction between `reshape()` and `view()`.  `view()` attempts to return a new tensor sharing the same underlying data as the original.  This is memory-efficient but can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.  `reshape()`, on the other hand, always creates a copy, guaranteeing independence from the original tensor, making it safer but less memory-efficient for very large tensors.

The `reshape()` function takes a tuple specifying the new shape as input.  It's imperative that the product of the elements in the new shape tuple equals the product of the elements in the original tensor's shape.  Otherwise, a `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating a shape mismatch.

`flatten()` simplifies the reshaping process by collapsing all dimensions into a single dimension.  This is particularly useful for feeding data into certain layers of neural networks which expect a 1D input.  The `flatten()` function can specify the dimension along which flattening begins, offering flexibility.

`squeeze()` and `unsqueeze()` manage singleton dimensions, often introduced by broadcasting operations or during specific layers in deep learning models.  `squeeze()` removes singleton dimensions (dimensions of size 1), while `unsqueeze()` adds them at a specified position. These functions are primarily used for aligning tensor shapes for compatibility with other operations or layers.

Understanding the data type and the order of elements (row-major or column-major order, which PyTorch uses row-major by default) is crucial for predicting the outcome of reshaping.  Incorrect handling of this can result in unexpected permutations of the data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `reshape()`**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor
tensor = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)

# Reshape to 6x2
reshaped_tensor = tensor.reshape(6, 2)
print("\nReshaped tensor (6x2):\n", reshaped_tensor)

# Attempting an invalid reshape
try:
    invalid_reshape = tensor.reshape(2, 7) # This will cause a RuntimeError
    print("\nInvalid reshaped tensor:\n", invalid_reshape)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"\nError: {e}")

# Demonstrating that reshape creates a copy. Changes to reshaped_tensor don't affect original tensor
reshaped_tensor[0,0] = 999
print("\nOriginal tensor after modification to reshaped tensor:\n", tensor)
print("\nReshaped tensor after modification:\n", reshaped_tensor)
```

This example demonstrates the basic usage of `reshape()`, highlighting both successful and unsuccessful reshaping attempts and the independent nature of the new tensor created by `reshape()`.


**Example 2: Using `view()` and potential pitfalls**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)

# View as a 6x2 tensor
viewed_tensor = tensor.view(6, 2)
print("\nViewed tensor (6x2):\n", viewed_tensor)

#Modifying viewed tensor impacts the original.
viewed_tensor[0,0] = -1

print("\nOriginal tensor after modification to viewed tensor:\n", tensor)
print("\nViewed tensor after modification:\n", viewed_tensor)

# Demonstrating a situation where view fails.  It requires contiguous memory.
tensor_noncontiguous = tensor[:, :2].clone()  # non-contiguous sub-tensor
try:
  non_contiguous_view = tensor_noncontiguous.view(6,1)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"\nError: {e}")

#The following works as it creates a contiguous copy first.
contiguous_view = tensor_noncontiguous.contiguous().view(6,1)
print("\nContiguous view:\n", contiguous_view)


```

This example showcases `view()`, its memory efficiency, and its potential to cause issues if the underlying data isn't contiguous in memory.  The non-contiguous example and resolution through `contiguous()` are crucial elements to address.



**Example 3: Using `flatten()`, `squeeze()`, and `unsqueeze()`**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)

# Flatten the tensor
flattened_tensor = tensor.flatten()
print("\nFlattened tensor:\n", flattened_tensor)

# Flatten starting from a specific dimension
flattened_from_dim1 = tensor.flatten(start_dim=1)
print("\nFlattened from dimension 1:\n", flattened_from_dim1)


# Add a singleton dimension
unsqueezed_tensor = flattened_tensor.unsqueeze(1)
print("\nUnsqueezed tensor:\n", unsqueezed_tensor)

# Remove a singleton dimension
squeezed_tensor = unsqueezed_tensor.squeeze(1)
print("\nSqueezed tensor:\n", squeezed_tensor)

# Attempting to squeeze a non-singleton dimension will raise an error

try:
    invalid_squeeze = unsqueezed_tensor.squeeze(0)
    print("\nInvalid squeezed tensor:\n", invalid_squeeze)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"\nError: {e}")
```

This example illustrates the combined use of `flatten()`, `squeeze()`, and `unsqueeze()`, emphasizing their roles in manipulating tensor dimensions, particularly in handling singleton dimensions common in deep learning workflows.  Error handling is also demonstrated for invalid operations.
