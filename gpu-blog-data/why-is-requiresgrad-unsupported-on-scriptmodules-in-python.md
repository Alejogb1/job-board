The fundamental reason `requires_grad` is unsupported on `torch.jit.ScriptModule` instances lies in the inherent design difference between eager execution, where PyTorch primarily operates, and the graph-based, optimized execution environment of TorchScript. I've wrestled with this limitation extensively while deploying deep learning models in production environments, and the inability to dynamically change the gradient tracking state of parameters within a scripted model requires a solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

In the eager execution mode, which we typically use during model development and experimentation, `requires_grad` acts as a runtime switch, toggling the computation of gradients for a given parameter within the computation graph. PyTorch builds this graph dynamically, tracing operations as they are executed, which allows for easy modification of this graph, including the activation or deactivation of gradient tracking for specific tensors. This is invaluable when freezing layers during transfer learning or carefully crafting custom backward passes, allowing meticulous control over backpropagation.

TorchScript, however, is a compiler that takes a model defined using PyTorch's Python API and transforms it into an intermediate representation (IR). This IR, often referred to as the TorchScript graph, is static. This graph is then optimized for deployment, often involving techniques like operator fusion, memory layout optimization, and other speed-enhancing transformations. Once this compilation process is complete, this static graph does not have the runtime flexibility necessary to track dynamically changing `requires_grad` states. Attempting to alter `requires_grad` on a parameter of a `ScriptModule` would mean requiring changes to this compiled graph on-the-fly which contradicts the very core principles of TorchScript optimization.

Think of it this way: in eager mode, the graph is like a flowchart that can be changed on the fly, adapting to our whims with each execution. TorchScript, on the other hand, hardcodes the equivalent of this flowchart into a fixed electronic circuit, where parameters behave according to its design. The ability to activate and deactivate gradient tracking on parts of this circuit would require a much more complex design and make optimization significantly harder or even impossible.

To illustrate, consider a simple linear layer. In eager PyTorch, you can easily modify `requires_grad` of its weights:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Eager execution example
model = SimpleLinear(10, 5)
print("Initial requires_grad of weights:", model.linear.weight.requires_grad) # Output: True

model.linear.weight.requires_grad = False
print("After changing requires_grad:", model.linear.weight.requires_grad) # Output: False

# Backpropagation will NOT affect these weights
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
inputs = torch.randn(1, 10)
outputs = model(inputs)
loss = outputs.mean()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```
In the above example, I can freely alter `requires_grad`, effectively excluding the `linear.weight` from gradient computation during backpropagation. The runtime nature of eager execution allows such changes to be immediately observed in the next forward and backward passes.

However, the following demonstrates the inability to do the same within a `ScriptModule`.
```python
# TorchScript example - Demonstrating the error
script_model = torch.jit.script(model)
print("Initial requires_grad of weights in script:", script_model.linear.weight.requires_grad)  # Output: True

try:
    script_model.linear.weight.requires_grad = False # Will raise an error
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
In the script example, while I can observe `requires_grad` as `True` initially when the model is scripted, attempts to change this value will throw an exception. This is because the `ScriptModule`'s internal structure is locked after compilation and the attributes are not mutable.
Furthermore, even if we try to change `requires_grad` prior to scripting and expect that setting to persist, we will observe that `requires_grad` can't be set at all.

```python
# Incorrect assumptions
model = SimpleLinear(10,5)
model.linear.weight.requires_grad = False # This will not effect the script module
script_model = torch.jit.script(model)

print("Requires_grad in ScriptModule: ", script_model.linear.weight.requires_grad) # Output True
```

This reinforces the fact that `requires_grad` modification is simply not part of the static graph generated by TorchScript. It's not about whether it’s initially set to `True` or `False` in the eager model prior to scripting, but rather that this mutable state of the eager execution graph has no equivalent representation in the final compiled form of the TorchScript module.

The practical implications of this are significant when deploying models that need to operate with varying parameter update rules. Common use cases include freezing pre-trained layers, training GANs where one network might be frozen while the other is trained, or applying techniques like gradient clipping or dynamic weight decay specific to certain portions of a model.  Since `requires_grad` is unavailable, these more complex training strategies need to be handled differently when using a scripted model. You cannot use eager mode's method of modifying parameters on-the-fly in TorchScript, rather these strategies must be embedded into the model architecture or handled by an external mechanism.

Instead of relying on mutable `requires_grad`, approaches for deploying such scenarios using scripted models often require a different approach. You can make conditional branches in your model, based on training hyperparameters, or create distinct ScriptModules for the cases when different parameter updates are needed, switching between them as needed. Alternatively, one can have separate optimization loops for the different networks involved in the GAN example.

To further explore these approaches and develop a deeper understanding of how to effectively deploy TorchScript models, I recommend focusing on resources related to TorchScript best practices, such as those found in PyTorch’s official documentation. Additionally, studying examples of complex TorchScript deployments, such as those used in industrial applications, can provide a solid foundation.  Also, looking through the PyTorch source code pertaining to TorchScript compilation and the execution graph will be very helpful. Lastly, discussions and tutorials related to common design patterns when using TorchScript can provide a practical guide on deploying your models. It is important to emphasize that the core limitation is that gradient tracking needs to be determined during model compilation rather than during execution in a scripted model environment. This makes the deployment of the model efficient but requires extra attention to implement more complex training techniques.
