TensorFlow's model serving mechanism hinges on the `SavedModel` format, which encapsulates the graph definition, weights, and associated metadata.  Understanding how to export, predict, and leverage the `DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY` is crucial for deploying TensorFlow models effectively.  My experience building and deploying high-throughput recommendation systems heavily utilized these functionalities, leading to numerous optimizations and troubleshooting exercises.

**1. Exporting a TensorFlow Model:**

The cornerstone of TensorFlow serving is the `tf.saved_model.save` function.  This function doesn't directly deal with prediction; instead, it serializes the model's computational graph and associated variables into a directory. This directory, structured according to the `SavedModel` protocol buffer specification, becomes the artifact deployed for serving. The key is defining the `signatures` argument within `tf.saved_model.save`. This argument allows specification of input and output tensors, shaping how the model is called during inference.  A crucial aspect is correctly mapping the model's internal tensors to externally accessible inputs and outputs.  Incorrect mapping leads to runtime errors during prediction, a common issue I've encountered in production environments.

The `signatures` argument takes a dictionary where keys represent signature names, and values are `tf.function` objects specifying the input and output tensors. The `DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY` is a special key, and if specified, it defines the default signature used by TensorFlow Serving's clients when they don't explicitly specify a signature name.  Failing to define this can necessitate explicit signature specification during every prediction request, making integration less seamless.

**2. Predicting Outputs:**

Prediction involves loading the saved model and executing the designated signature. TensorFlow provides `tf.saved_model.load` for loading a `SavedModel`.  Once loaded, the model is represented as a `tf.saved_model.load` object which exposes the signatures.  Accessing predictions involves calling the loaded signature as a function, passing in the appropriately formatted input data.  Data type consistency between training and prediction is critical; mismatches frequently caused prediction failures in my projects.  Error handling becomes essential during this phase, especially concerning input validation and exception management for invalid inputs or model mismatches.

**3. Specifying `DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`:**

Specifying `DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY` simplifies the prediction process.  When omitted, the client must explicitly refer to a particular signature name in its prediction requests. By defining this key, you create a default signature accessible without explicit name specification.  This greatly simplifies client-side code and improves maintainability. In my experience, this was crucial for large-scale deployments where consistency and ease of use were paramount.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Regression Model Export:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple regression model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample training data
x_train = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y_train = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Train the model (simplified for demonstration)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# Define the signature
@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32, name='input')])
def predict_fn(input_tensor):
  return model(input_tensor)

# Save the model
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'regression_model', signatures={'serving_default': predict_fn})
```

This example shows a basic regression model's export, defining a signature named `serving_default` which will act as the default signature.

**Example 2: Multi-Input Model with Custom Signature:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model with multiple inputs
class MultiInputModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MultiInputModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
    self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x1, x2 = inputs
    x = tf.concat([x1, x2], axis=1)
    x = self.dense1(x)
    return self.dense2(x)

model = MultiInputModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data (simplified)
x1_train = tf.random.normal((100, 32))
x2_train = tf.random.normal((100, 16))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100,1))
model.fit([x1_train,x2_train], y_train, epochs=10)

@tf.function(input_signature=[
    tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 32], dtype=tf.float32, name='input1'),
    tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 16], dtype=tf.float32, name='input2')
])
def multi_input_predict(input1,input2):
    return model([input1,input2])

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'multi_input_model', signatures={'serving_default':multi_input_predict})
```
This demonstrates exporting a model with multiple inputs, requiring a more complex signature definition.  Note the clear naming convention for inputs.

**Example 3:  Image Classification Model and Prediction:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a pre-trained image classification model (replace with your own)
model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 224, 224, 3], dtype=tf.float32, name='image')])
def classify_image(image):
    return model(image)

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'image_classifier', signatures={'serving_default': classify_image})


#Prediction
loaded = tf.saved_model.load('image_classifier')
infer = loaded.signatures['serving_default']
# Sample image data (replace with actual image preprocessing)
sample_image = np.random.rand(1,224,224,3).astype(np.float32)
result = infer(image=tf.constant(sample_image))
print(result['output_1']) # Access the output tensor
```

This example showcases an image classification model, highlighting the prediction process using a loaded model.  Note the necessity for proper image preprocessing before feeding data to the model for accurate results.  Incorrect preprocessing is a common source of prediction errors.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel.
*   TensorFlow Serving documentation.
*   A comprehensive guide to TensorFlow model deployment.
*   Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on model serving and optimization.
*   Publications on large-scale model deployment strategies.


These resources, coupled with practical experience, will provide a solid foundation for mastering TensorFlow model export, prediction, and effective utilization of the `DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`.  Remember rigorous testing and validation are crucial in production settings to mitigate potential issues stemming from inconsistencies in data handling or model interpretation.
