The key distinction when comparing word frequencies across texts using `tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer` lies in understanding how the tokenizer's internal vocabulary and frequency counts are managed and influenced by the texts it encounters. This class acts as a stateful object, learning its vocabulary incrementally as it processes each new input text. Consequently, direct comparison requires a deliberate approach to isolate the individual text's influence on the frequency distribution rather than relying on a cumulative global count. My experience building several NLP pipelines has shown that naive application of the tokenizer across multiple texts leads to skewed results.

Hereâ€™s the core of the matter: When you fit the tokenizer on multiple texts sequentially (`fit_on_texts`), it combines all the texts into a single, unified vocabulary. The resulting `word_counts` and `word_index` reflect the aggregate frequencies and unique terms across *all* seen documents, rather than providing individual document-level information. This means that a word appearing frequently in the first text, but rarely in subsequent texts, will have its combined frequency reported rather than a specific count for text 1. To accurately compare individual document frequencies, you must apply the tokenizer to each document in isolation after the initial fitting.

To illustrate, consider three textual documents: a news article about sports, a scientific abstract, and a fictional story. We aim to analyze how the word 'the' differs between these different textual contexts.

**Example 1: Naive Tokenization and Frequency Counting (Incorrect Approach)**

This example shows the typical error when directly fitting a tokenizer on multiple text inputs:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

texts = [
    "The soccer team won the championship after a hard fought game.",
    "The study found a significant correlation between X and Y.",
    "The dragon flew above the mountains in the vast sky."
]

tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)

print("Word Counts (Combined):", tokenizer.word_counts)
print("Word Index:", tokenizer.word_index)

print("Frequency of 'the' (Combined):", tokenizer.word_counts.get('the', 0))
```

In this example, the tokenizer is fitted to all three texts simultaneously. The `word_counts` dictionary displays a global frequency for every word, not individual counts for each text. The combined count for 'the' is calculated across all documents. This does not enable us to understand how the word's frequency differs across text types. We cannot derive specific text characteristics from this aggregated count.

**Example 2: Isolated Tokenization and Frequency Counting (Correct Approach)**

This example addresses the problem of the combined count and shows the correct process to isolate frequencies:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

texts = [
    "The soccer team won the championship after a hard fought game.",
    "The study found a significant correlation between X and Y.",
    "The dragon flew above the mountains in the vast sky."
]

tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts) #Fit tokenizer on all texts first to create the word index

for i, text in enumerate(texts):
    temp_tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(num_words=len(tokenizer.word_index)+1)
    temp_tokenizer.word_index = tokenizer.word_index #Use the same word index
    temp_tokenizer.fit_on_texts([text])

    print(f"Text {i+1} word counts: ", temp_tokenizer.word_counts)
    print(f"Frequency of 'the' in Text {i+1}:", temp_tokenizer.word_counts.get('the', 0))

```

Here, the tokenizer's word index is built from *all* documents using the fit_on_texts method, ensuring all words in our overall corpus are accounted for. Subsequently, a *new* tokenizer is created for each individual document, inheriting the established `word_index`. It is crucial to construct a new tokenizer for each document. Then, a temporary tokenizer is constructed, taking in only a single document as text. Then, we access the word count for each individual text document. Thus, we gain a clearer picture of how the word 'the' is used in each specific document. This method provides a per-document frequency that can be compared across different text types.

**Example 3: Sequence Transformation and Frequency Counting**

This extends the previous example by incorporating the `texts_to_sequences` function to numerically encode each text. This provides numerical representation, not just word counts:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

texts = [
    "The soccer team won the championship after a hard fought game.",
    "The study found a significant correlation between X and Y.",
    "The dragon flew above the mountains in the vast sky."
]

tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)

for i, text in enumerate(texts):
    temp_tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(num_words=len(tokenizer.word_index)+1)
    temp_tokenizer.word_index = tokenizer.word_index
    temp_tokenizer.fit_on_texts([text])

    sequences = temp_tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])
    print(f"Text {i+1} Sequences:", sequences)
    print(f"Text {i+1} word counts: ", temp_tokenizer.word_counts)
    print(f"Frequency of 'the' in Text {i+1}:", temp_tokenizer.word_counts.get('the', 0))
```

This shows that after creating the unique word index based on the entirety of the corpus, the `texts_to_sequences` method can produce integer-encoded representations of each sentence. Each numerical value corresponds to a tokenized word. This method transforms the text to a numeric representation whilst still retaining individual text information.

**Key takeaways:**

*   **Stateful Nature:** The `Tokenizer` object retains information about texts it has seen and its internal vocabulary is modified by these texts.
*   **Isolated Analysis:** Individual document analysis necessitates constructing a new tokenizer per document. The core word index is established from all the texts, and then that vocabulary is passed to each temporary tokenizer.
*   **`texts_to_sequences` method:** Provides integer encoded representation of the text.

**Resource Recommendations (no links provided)**:

*   **TensorFlow Documentation:** The official TensorFlow documentation for the `tf.keras.preprocessing.text` module provides detailed explanations of the tokenizer's functionality and usage.
*   **Books on Natural Language Processing:** Textbooks on NLP covering tokenization techniques will offer a more comprehensive understanding of the concepts involved.
*   **Online Courses on Deep Learning:** Courses specializing in deep learning with Python often include sections on text preprocessing, including the application of `tf.keras` tools. These courses offer practical examples and demonstrations.
*   **Advanced Examples:** Consider researching implementations of methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). These will often use the `Tokenizer` class and provide additional insights.

Using the `tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer` class effectively requires an understanding of its underlying state management. Direct comparison of word frequencies across different texts demands the creation of isolated tokenizers for each text, ensuring the accurate analysis of distinct textual features. Failure to do so will lead to an incorrect aggregate count for all the words found across all documents. The correct method allows for distinct per-document frequency analysis. Employing the `texts_to_sequences` method gives a numeric representation of each text. It is crucial to consult official documentation and educational resources to build a complete understanding of these techniques for NLP pipelines.
