The unexpected output shape of (sequence_length, 1) from a TensorFlow model trained on a `tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array` dataset often arises from a mismatch between the model's output layer and the expected data structure for time series prediction tasks. Specifically, this shape suggests that the model is generating predictions for each time step individually, rather than producing a single, aggregated prediction for the entire sequence. This is a common point of confusion, particularly when users intend to perform a sequence-to-one prediction (e.g., classifying a time series) but inadvertently configure their models for sequence-to-sequence prediction with a single output feature.

My initial foray into time series forecasting involved a similar hurdle. I was working on a system to predict machine failure based on sensor data. Using `timeseries_dataset_from_array` seemed ideal for preparing the time series data. However, after training, I was stumped to find each input sequence yielded a sequence of outputs, each with shape (1,) instead of the single binary prediction I expected. This prompted a deeper investigation into the default behavior of recurrent layers and output layer design.

The fundamental reason for the (sequence_length, 1) output shape lies in how recurrent layers like LSTM and GRU, often used in time series analysis, handle sequential data. By default, these layers return the output at *each* time step of the input sequence, creating a sequence of outputs that mirrors the sequence of inputs. When this output is fed into a `Dense` layer with a single output neuron, it results in a (sequence_length, 1) output shape. The crux of the issue is that, by default, recurrent layers are set to return sequences and not to the last element of that sequence, which is needed to create a single output, and this sequence-per-sequence output is not commonly wanted. Furthermore, the final Dense layer’s single neuron also influences this shape, as it provides only a single output feature at each timestep. To obtain a single output for the entire time series, a pooling or last time step selection process has to be applied to the output from the recurrent layer.

Consider the following example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample time series data
data = np.random.rand(100, 1)
sequence_length = 10
batch_size = 32

# Create the TimeSeriesDataset
dataset = tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array(
    data,
    targets=None,
    sequence_length=sequence_length,
    sequence_stride=1,
    batch_size=batch_size
)

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, input_shape=(sequence_length, 1), return_sequences=True), # return_sequences is default
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Perform a single prediction on one batch
for batch in dataset.take(1):
    predictions = model(batch)
    print(f"Prediction shape: {predictions.shape}")
```

In this example, the output prediction shape will be `(32, 10, 1)`, which represents a batch of 32 sequences of length 10 with each time step having a single feature. The `return_sequences=True` parameter in `LSTM`, by default, is what causes the output to be a sequence. The `Dense(1)` layer then applies a single neuron to each output element from the previous layer, resulting in a (sequence_length, 1) shape for each sample in the batch.

To achieve a single output per sequence, we need to modify the model architecture to process the sequence output from the recurrent layer into a single vector. This can be accomplished in a few ways, such as applying global pooling or specifically taking the last output from the recurrent layer:

```python
# Corrected model with Global Average Pooling
model_pooling = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, input_shape=(sequence_length, 1), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Perform a single prediction on one batch
for batch in dataset.take(1):
    predictions = model_pooling(batch)
    print(f"Prediction shape with pooling: {predictions.shape}")
```

Here, we have added a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer after the LSTM layer. This layer takes the average of the output vectors from the LSTM layer across the sequence dimension, converting the sequence output into a single vector before being passed to the final `Dense` layer. The output shape is now `(32, 1)`, meaning we have a single prediction for each time series in our batch.

Alternatively, for those who only need the last output from the sequence, you can set the `return_sequences` parameter to `False` when using an LSTM or GRU layer, or if using `return_sequences=True` you can take the final output using a Lambda layer:

```python
# Corrected model returning last element
model_last = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, input_shape=(sequence_length, 1), return_sequences=False), # Set return_sequences to False
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# Perform a single prediction on one batch
for batch in dataset.take(1):
    predictions = model_last(batch)
    print(f"Prediction shape with last element only: {predictions.shape}")


# Example with Lambda layer
model_last_lambda = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, input_shape=(sequence_length, 1), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:, -1, :]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# Perform a single prediction on one batch
for batch in dataset.take(1):
    predictions = model_last_lambda(batch)
    print(f"Prediction shape with last element selection using Lambda: {predictions.shape}")
```

By setting `return_sequences=False` in the second model, the LSTM layer now returns only the output of the last time step, resulting in the same final output shape of `(32, 1)`. In the third model, the `Lambda` layer selects only the last element, resulting in the same output shape. This avoids the need to perform averaging or pooling. Choosing between these methods depends on the specific task. For sequence classification or regression that focuses on the complete context of a time series, pooling may be appropriate. For tasks where the last element is considered to encapsulate the series’ essence, setting `return_sequences=False` or selecting the last element will prove suitable.

Beyond architectural adjustments, data preprocessing and a solid understanding of the use case are key. A clear understanding of whether the task requires one prediction per sequence or multiple predictions is the first step in properly modeling the problem. Additionally, input data scaling may be needed to prevent issues during training, and it is also critical to carefully consider the choice of sequence length and stride, which influences what the model learns.

For individuals seeking further in-depth knowledge on this subject, I recommend reviewing several key resources. Firstly, explore the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on recurrent layers (LSTM, GRU) and the TimeSeries API. Second, consult textbooks focusing on time series analysis and machine learning with deep learning. Thirdly, academic papers focused on sequence modeling using recurrent neural networks often contain key theoretical and practical information. These combined resources are invaluable for a more profound grasp of this often intricate, but rewarding field.
