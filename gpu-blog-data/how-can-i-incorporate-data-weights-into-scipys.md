SciPy's `nnls` function, while efficient for solving non-negative least squares problems, lacks direct support for data weighting.  This limitation stems from its underlying algorithm, which implicitly assumes equal weighting of all data points.  However, in many real-world scenarios, data points possess varying degrees of reliability or significance, necessitating the incorporation of weights.  My experience in spectroscopic data analysis highlighted this limitation repeatedly, prompting me to develop workarounds.  The solution involves a slight reformulation of the problem, leveraging the inherent properties of weighted least squares.

**1. Explanation: Transforming the Problem**

The standard non-negative least squares (NNLS) problem aims to find a non-negative vector `x` that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual:  `||Ax - b||²`, where `A` is the data matrix and `b` is the observation vector.  To incorporate weights, we transform this into a weighted least squares problem.  Instead of minimizing the unweighted residual, we minimize the weighted residual: `||W(Ax - b)||²`, where `W` is a diagonal matrix with weights `wᵢ` along its diagonal.  These weights, `wᵢ`, represent the relative importance or confidence associated with each data point `bᵢ`.  A higher weight implies greater confidence in the accuracy of the corresponding data point.

This transformation effectively scales the residual of each data point according to its weight.  Points with higher weights contribute more strongly to the minimization process, influencing the solution proportionally to their assigned confidence.  The weighted least squares problem can then be solved using standard techniques, adaptable to the NNLS constraint.  One approach involves pre-multiplying the data matrix and observation vector by the square root of the weight matrix.  This simplifies the problem to a standard NNLS form solvable by SciPy's `nnls` function.

Let's define `W¹ᐟ²` as the diagonal matrix with the square roots of the weights on its diagonal.  Then the modified problem becomes: `||W¹ᐟ²(Ax - b)||²`, which is equivalent to finding `x` that minimizes  `||(W¹ᐟ²A)x - (W¹ᐟ²b)||²`.  This new problem is a standard NNLS problem with a modified data matrix `W¹ᐟ²A` and a modified observation vector `W¹ᐟ²b`.  SciPy's `nnls` function can be directly applied to this reformulated problem, thereby incorporating the desired data weights.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Here are three code examples demonstrating different scenarios and nuances involved in implementing this approach.  I have leveraged NumPy alongside SciPy for efficient matrix operations.


**Example 1: Basic Weight Incorporation**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import nnls

# Data
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
b = np.array([7, 8, 9])

# Weights (e.g., reflecting measurement uncertainties)
weights = np.array([1, 2, 0.5])

# Weighted Least Squares transformation
W_sqrt = np.diag(np.sqrt(weights))
A_weighted = W_sqrt @ A
b_weighted = W_sqrt @ b

# NNLS solution
x, rnorm = nnls(A_weighted, b_weighted)

print("Solution x:", x)
print("Residual norm:", rnorm)
```

This example showcases the fundamental transformation.  The weights are directly applied through the `W_sqrt` matrix, altering the input to `nnls`.  The residual norm (`rnorm`) will reflect the minimization of the *weighted* residual.

**Example 2: Handling Zero Weights**

Zero weights indicate complete disregard for a data point. This situation requires careful handling to avoid numerical issues.  Simply including zero weights in the weight vector may still lead to computational overhead.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import nnls

# Data
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
b = np.array([7, 8, 9])

# Weights with a zero weight
weights = np.array([1, 0, 0.5])

#Filter out data points with zero weights
indices = np.where(weights > 0)[0]
A_filtered = A[indices]
b_filtered = b[indices]
weights_filtered = weights[indices]

# Weighted Least Squares transformation for filtered data
W_sqrt = np.diag(np.sqrt(weights_filtered))
A_weighted = W_sqrt @ A_filtered
b_weighted = W_sqrt @ b_filtered

# NNLS solution
x, rnorm = nnls(A_weighted, b_weighted)

print("Solution x:", x)
print("Residual norm:", rnorm)

```

This example demonstrates a more robust approach: filtering out data points with zero weights *before* the transformation. This prevents unnecessary computations and potential numerical instability related to zero weight entries in the weight matrix.


**Example 3:  Weighting from a Covariance Matrix**

In more sophisticated applications, weights might derive from a covariance matrix representing the uncertainties in the observations.  This matrix is not diagonal; however,  we can utilize its Cholesky decomposition to achieve a similar effect.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import nnls
from scipy.linalg import cholesky

# Data
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
b = np.array([7, 8, 9])

# Covariance matrix (representing uncertainties)
covariance_matrix = np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 2], [0, 0]])  # Example; ensure positive definite
covariance_matrix = covariance_matrix + covariance_matrix.T - np.diag(np.diag(covariance_matrix)) #Ensure symmetry

#Cholesky Decomposition
try:
    L = cholesky(covariance_matrix, lower=True) #Only works for positive definite matrices
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("Covariance matrix is not positive definite.  Adjust the matrix or use a different approach.")
    exit()

#Weight matrix inverse proportional to covariance matrix
W_sqrt = np.linalg.inv(L)

# Weighted Least Squares transformation
A_weighted = W_sqrt @ A
b_weighted = W_sqrt @ b

# NNLS solution
x, rnorm = nnls(A_weighted, b_weighted)

print("Solution x:", x)
print("Residual norm:", rnorm)
```

This advanced example highlights the adaptability of the approach.  Using the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix effectively incorporates the correlated uncertainties between data points. It's crucial to ensure the covariance matrix is positive-definite to allow for the Cholesky decomposition.  Failure to do so will lead to an error.  Alternative methods like using a pseudo-inverse would be necessary to handle non-positive definite covariance matrices.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

Numerical Recipes in C (3rd Edition) offers detailed explanations of weighted least squares and Cholesky decomposition.  Furthermore, texts on linear algebra and numerical optimization provide the necessary mathematical background for a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.  Lastly, consult the SciPy documentation for in-depth information on the `nnls` function and related functionalities.
