The core issue lies in TensorFlow 1.x's automatic differentiation mechanism and how it handles conditional execution within the computational graph.  Empty loss branches, arising from conditional logic where a loss tensor might be absent depending on the data, can lead to gradients inappropriately flowing through the "empty" branch, causing numerical instability or unexpected behavior during training.  This isn't a bug, but a consequence of the way the graph is constructed and optimized.  In my experience optimizing large-scale sequence-to-sequence models, I've encountered this repeatedly, particularly when dealing with variable-length sequences and masking.  The solution necessitates careful control over the gradient flow using TensorFlow's conditional operations and gradient control mechanisms.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.gradients` function computes gradients by tracing back through the computational graph.  If an operation – such as a conditional loss computation – produces a `None` or an empty tensor in a specific execution path, the gradient calculation still attempts to propagate through that path.  This often manifests as `None` values being propagated, potentially leading to `TypeError` exceptions downstream or, less obviously, subtly incorrect gradient updates. The problem isn't necessarily in the absence of a loss; the problem is in the *presence* of a *placeholder* for a loss in the graph structure that the gradient calculation traverses.


The solution requires ensuring that gradients do *not* flow through paths that yield no loss contribution.  This can be achieved using `tf.cond`, `tf.where`, or `tf.stop_gradient`.  The choice depends on the specific structure of the conditional loss computation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Using `tf.cond` for Conditional Loss Computation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_loss(inputs, condition):
    # inputs: A tensor representing the model's output
    # condition: A boolean tensor indicating whether the loss should be calculated

    def loss_fn(inputs):
        # Actual loss calculation.  Replace with your specific loss function.
        return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(inputs))

    def no_loss():
        return tf.constant(0.0)

    loss = tf.cond(condition, lambda: loss_fn(inputs), no_loss)
    return loss


# Example Usage:
inputs = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
condition = tf.constant(True)  # Change this to False to test the "no loss" branch

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    loss_value = sess.run(conditional_loss(inputs, condition))
    print(f"Loss: {loss_value}")  # Output will be the calculated loss or 0

    # Crucially, gradients will only be computed for the loss function if condition is True.
    # Demonstrating gradient calculation is beyond the scope of this simple example but would
    # involve using tf.gradients to compute the gradients relative to model parameters.
```

This example uses `tf.cond` to conditionally execute the loss function. If `condition` is `False`, `no_loss` returns a scalar zero, preventing gradients from propagating from an empty branch.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.where` for Element-wise Conditional Loss:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def elementwise_conditional_loss(predictions, targets, mask):
    # predictions, targets: Tensors of same shape
    # mask: Boolean tensor indicating valid elements

    loss = tf.where(mask, tf.square(predictions - targets), tf.zeros_like(predictions))
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)  # Average only over valid elements

    return loss


# Example Usage
predictions = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
targets = tf.constant([1.5, 1.8, 3.2, 4.5])
mask = tf.constant([True, True, False, True])  # 3rd element is masked

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    loss_value = sess.run(elementwise_conditional_loss(predictions, targets, mask))
    print(f"Loss: {loss_value}") # The loss will only consider unmasked elements

```

This example uses `tf.where` for element-wise conditional loss computation. The `mask` controls which elements contribute to the final loss; masked elements contribute zero to the loss and hence, do not influence gradient calculations.  This is very useful in sequence modeling tasks involving variable-length sequences.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.stop_gradient` to Explicitly Block Gradients:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def loss_with_gradient_stop(inputs, condition):
  # inputs: A tensor
  # condition: A boolean tensor

  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(inputs))
  loss = tf.cond(condition, lambda: loss, lambda: tf.constant(0.0)) # Conditional loss
  loss = tf.stop_gradient(loss) #Stops gradient flow, but loss is still computed

  return loss


#Example Usage:
inputs = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
condition = tf.constant(True)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    loss_value = sess.run(loss_with_gradient_stop(inputs, condition))
    print(f"Loss: {loss_value}")

    #Gradients will be zero regardless of the condition; the actual loss is computed for logging/evaluation purposes.
```

Here, `tf.stop_gradient` completely prevents gradient flow through the `loss` tensor irrespective of the conditional logic.  This is useful when you want to include a term in the loss calculation for evaluation purposes but want to prevent it from influencing the training process.  For instance, this is commonly used with regularization terms that may not need backpropagation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow 1.x documentation, particularly sections on automatic differentiation and graph construction, are essential.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning that delves into the intricacies of automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization would be highly beneficial.  Furthermore, reviewing advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on sequence modeling and custom loss functions is recommended.  Understanding the nuances of computational graphs in TensorFlow 1.x is crucial for effectively managing gradient flow in complex scenarios.
