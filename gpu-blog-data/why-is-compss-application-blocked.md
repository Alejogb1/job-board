In my experience optimizing distributed computations, a blocked COMPSs application often points to a fundamental disconnect between task dependencies and resource availability, especially when dealing with shared storage. Let's examine common causes and mitigation strategies.

First, a COMPSs application, which stands for Communication and Computation Service, uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent tasks and their dependencies. These dependencies, specified through annotations or an API, enforce the order of execution. When a task is "blocked," it signifies that the necessary conditions for its start, as defined by these dependencies, are not yet satisfied. Most frequently, this involves waiting for preceding tasks to complete, particularly when data dependencies exist.

At the heart of the issue lies COMPSs' runtime system which manages the distribution and execution of tasks. This runtime relies on the metadata it has about the DAG and the available resources, which include computing units (CPUs, GPUs) and storage. The system performs scheduling based on this information. A block usually occurs because either required input data is not present or the computation resources are all occupied.

When dealing with I/O, I've seen situations where a task depends on data that is still being created by a previous task or that resides on a shared filesystem experiencing bottlenecks. For example, a task might be configured to load a massive dataset from disk, but a preceding data generation task is not complete, leading to an indefinite wait. It is crucial to verify that data movement to and from storage and between nodes does not create a choke point.

The interaction between tasks also needs close examination. If, say, an application uses an inefficient communication pattern, a bottleneck will emerge. The runtime system attempts to parallelize execution, but if, due to dependencies, tasks serially write to a shared file, the application could easily appear blocked. This isn't a COMPSs issue itself, rather an implementation flaw that the scheduler cannot fix.

A less frequent, but still relevant cause, involves incorrect task annotations or API usage. Incorrect `@task` annotations may obscure true dependencies or fail to correctly specify input/output parameters. If an input to a task is incorrectly specified as "INOUT" instead of "IN", the runtime may unnecessarily hold onto the data, preventing other tasks from using that location. In other words, it's very crucial to thoroughly validate your annotations.

Further, incorrect resource configurations can result in blocked applications. For example, if resource constraints (memory, cores, etc.) are incorrectly configured in the COMPSs resource description file, tasks may not be assigned to nodes with sufficient capacity, and subsequently fail to start.

Letâ€™s explore some examples to solidify these points:

**Example 1: Simple Data Dependency Block**

```python
from pycompss.api.task import task
from pycompss.api.parameter import *

@task(returns=1)
def generate_data(size: int) -> list:
    data = [i for i in range(size)]
    return data

@task(data=IN)
def process_data(data: list) -> int:
    return len(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    size_val = 10000
    data_generated = generate_data(size_val)
    result = process_data(data_generated)
    print(f"Processed data of size: {result}")
```

In this code, `process_data` is explicitly dependent on `generate_data`. The COMPSs runtime ensures `generate_data` completes first, meaning it will wait if `generate_data` does not return in a timely manner. If `generate_data` was computationally heavy and took a long time, `process_data` would appear "blocked," though technically it is simply waiting for its dependency to complete. The solution would be to ensure that the `generate_data` task is performing efficiently, or if a large size is passed, you may consider splitting this into multiple smaller tasks.

**Example 2: Shared Filesystem Bottleneck**

```python
from pycompss.api.task import task
from pycompss.api.parameter import *
import os
import time

DATA_DIR = "data"

@task(returns=1)
def create_file(file_path: str, size_mb: int) -> None:
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
         f.seek(size_mb*1024*1024-1)
         f.write(b"\0")

@task(file_path=IN)
def process_file(file_path: str) -> int:
    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        data = f.read()
    return len(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_files = 5
    file_size_mb = 10
    file_paths = [f"{DATA_DIR}/file_{i}.dat" for i in range(num_files)]
    results = []
    for fp in file_paths:
        create_file(fp, file_size_mb)
        results.append(process_file(fp))

    for r in results:
      print(f"Processed: {r}")

```

Here, we create multiple files and process them sequentially within a loop, despite both tasks being marked with `@task`. The bottleneck here is in that we write all the data to the same shared filesystem and the runtime only picks one at a time due to the dependency of each pair of calls to `create_file` and `process_file` inside the loop. This code can appear blocked if the disk is slow or a very large size is passed. It also would appear blocked if other external processes are currently utilizing the disk heavily. Potential solutions would be to reduce the file size, implement a more efficient disk, move to a faster storage system, or consider a different approach to create/process such a high number of files. Further, if `process_file` was reading data from a database, there could also be a bottleneck there.

**Example 3: Incorrect INOUT Parameter**

```python
from pycompss.api.task import task
from pycompss.api.parameter import *
import time

@task(data=INOUT)
def modify_data(data: list) -> list:
    data.append(5)
    time.sleep(5)
    return data

@task(data=IN)
def use_data(data: list) -> int:
    return len(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_data = [1,2,3]
    modified_data = modify_data(initial_data)
    result = use_data(modified_data)
    print(f"Result after processing: {result}")

```

In this instance, we have a potential problem with how `modify_data` is specified, by marking the input data parameter with `INOUT`. This means that the runtime will handle data as if it needs to be transferred back to the original location where it was passed. Further, if another task is trying to use the same data parameter with `IN` before `modify_data` finishes, it will be blocked waiting for it. The correct annotation here should be `IN` since `modify_data` does not depend on original data. The runtime will then be able to execute tasks more freely without unnecessary waits.

Diagnosing blocked COMPSs applications often involves a systematic approach. I'd recommend using COMPSs' built-in monitoring tools, which can expose the task execution graph and highlight tasks that are currently waiting or taking an unreasonable amount of time. Additionally, reviewing log files for COMPSs runtime and worker nodes can offer insights into resource usage and potential errors.

For further learning and debugging complex cases, reviewing the official COMPSs documentation is imperative. Specifically, the sections on task dependencies, parameter annotations, resource configuration and performance tuning can be invaluable. Additionally, exploring research papers and academic publications that focus on COMPSs can bring a deeper understanding of how the runtime system operates, and how performance can be optimized. I also find case studies focusing on similar application types useful as references for best practices. Consulting the COMPSs community forums could also provide insight into past debugging experiences by other developers. Remember, addressing blocked applications often requires an iterative process of identifying bottlenecks, modifying code, and fine-tuning configurations.
