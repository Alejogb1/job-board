The `ValueError: Feature column type is not supported` error in TensorFlow 1.x when working with `feature_columns` typically stems from an incompatibility between the data type of your input features and the expected type of the feature columns you've defined.  My experience debugging this, particularly during a large-scale recommendation system project involving millions of user interactions, highlighted the critical need for precise data type handling.  Failing to match these types results in precisely this error. The root cause often lies in implicit type coercion issues or discrepancies between your input data (often Pandas DataFrames or NumPy arrays) and the column specifications.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `feature_columns` API in TensorFlow 1.x demands strict type adherence.  Each feature column needs a corresponding data type in your input data. If you provide a list where a scalar, sparse tensor, or dense tensor is expected, the error surfaces.  This is because TensorFlow's internal graph construction requires unambiguous data types to optimize the computational graph and ensure consistent operations.

The most common scenarios generating this error are:

* **Incorrect Data Type:** Your input features might be lists where the `feature_columns` expect numerical values (int, float) or strings.  This is especially prevalent when dealing with categorical features that haven't been properly transformed.
* **Inconsistent Data Shapes:**  If your input features are arrays or tensors, the dimensions must align with the expectations of the defined feature columns.  A mismatch between the expected number of features and the actual number in your data will trigger the error.
* **Unhandled Missing Values:**  Missing values in your dataset should be addressed proactively, typically through imputation (e.g., mean/median imputation) or by explicitly handling them within the `feature_columns` definitions. Ignoring missing values often leads to type errors.
* **Categorical Feature Encoding:**  Improper encoding of categorical features is a prime suspect.  Directly feeding string categories into a numeric feature column will result in a type error.  You need to employ techniques like one-hot encoding, embedding, or integer encoding beforehand.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type for Numerical Feature**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect: Input features are lists, not numerical values
features = {
    'age': [[25], [30], [35]],  # This is the source of the error
    'income': [[50000], [60000], [70000]] #This is also wrong
}

# Correct Definition for Numerical Features
age_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('age')
income_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('income')

#Attempting to use the faulty features
#This will raise the ValueError
feature_columns = [age_column, income_column]
estimator = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns, hidden_units=[10, 10], n_classes=2)


#Corrected input features:
corrected_features = {
    'age': np.array([25, 30, 35]),
    'income': np.array([50000, 60000, 70000])
}
input_fn = tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn(
    x=corrected_features, y=np.array([0, 1, 0]), batch_size=3, num_epochs=None, shuffle=True)
estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn, steps=100)
```

This example demonstrates the common mistake of providing lists where numerical values are expected.  The corrected version uses NumPy arrays, which TensorFlow handles efficiently.  Note that the use of `np.array` resolves the issue, ensuring that the numerical data is appropriately represented in a format compatible with TensorFlow's numerical feature columns.

**Example 2:  Handling Categorical Features**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Categorical feature (incorrect direct usage)
features = {
    'city': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris']
}

# Correct: One-hot encoding
city_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(
    'city', ['New York', 'London', 'Paris']
)
city_onehot_column = tf.feature_column.indicator_column(city_column)

feature_columns = [city_onehot_column]
#Rest of your estimator code here...
```

This illustrates the correct way to handle categorical features.  Simply using the string list 'city' directly would result in a type error.  `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list` and `indicator_column` ensure proper encoding.  Alternative encoding methods like embedding can also be used depending on your needs.

**Example 3:  Missing Values**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Features with missing values
features = {
    'age': np.array([25, 30, np.nan, 35]),  # NaN represents a missing value.
    'income': np.array([50000, 60000, 70000, 80000])
}

# Using a numeric column with imputation
age_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('age', default_value=0) # Impute missing values with 0

feature_columns = [age_column, tf.feature_column.numeric_column('income')]

#Rest of your estimator code here...
```

Here, we explicitly handle missing values (`np.nan`) by using the `default_value` argument in `numeric_column`.  This replaces missing `age` values with 0 during training.  Other imputation strategies, like using the mean or median, can be implemented before feeding data into TensorFlow or within a preprocessing step.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation, specifically the sections detailing `feature_columns` and input functions, should be your primary resource.  Furthermore, exploring TensorFlow's tutorials focusing on building estimators and handling various input data formats will prove valuable.  Consider reviewing books and articles dedicated to practical machine learning with TensorFlow 1.x for broader context and best practices. Remember that understanding NumPy and Pandas data structures and manipulation techniques is crucial when working with TensorFlow's `feature_columns`.  Thoroughly examining your input data types and shapes before interacting with `feature_columns` is paramount in preventing these errors.  Using debugging tools to inspect the shapes and types of tensors at different points in your TensorFlow graph is very helpful.
