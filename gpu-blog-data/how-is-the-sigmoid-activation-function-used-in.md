The sigmoid activation function, while exhibiting limitations in modern deep learning architectures, remains relevant in specific contexts within Keras, particularly in binary classification problems and output layers requiring probabilities.  My experience optimizing recommendation systems for a large e-commerce platform highlighted its continued utility in these niche scenarios.  Its primary advantage stems from its inherent probabilistic interpretation, mapping any input to a value between 0 and 1, interpretable as a probability. However, it's crucial to understand its drawbacks before applying it indiscriminately.

**1. Explanation:**

The sigmoid function, mathematically represented as  σ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)),  transforms an input value (x) into a probability between 0 and 1.  In Keras, this function is readily accessible through the `keras.activations.sigmoid` module.  Its application within a neural network layer involves transforming the weighted sum of inputs from the preceding layer into a probability.  Consider a single neuron receiving inputs x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ with corresponding weights w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ and a bias term b. The neuron's output before activation is z = w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b. The sigmoid function then maps this value z to a probability:  σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z)).

The choice of sigmoid as an activation function is dictated by the desired output. For binary classification, where the output represents the probability of belonging to a specific class (e.g., spam/not spam, click/no click), the sigmoid function is a natural fit.  Its output directly represents the probability of the positive class.  However, its use in hidden layers has diminished due to two primary reasons: the vanishing gradient problem and the non-zero-centered output.

The vanishing gradient problem arises from the sigmoid's derivative, which approaches zero as the input's magnitude increases.  During backpropagation, this can hinder the effective updating of weights in earlier layers, slowing down or preventing the network from learning effectively.  The non-zero-centered output contributes to slower convergence during training because it introduces a bias in the gradient updates.

Despite these limitations, I've found sigmoid activation remains valuable in the output layer for binary classification tasks, especially when interpretability is critical.  The direct probability output offers an easily understood measure of confidence in the prediction, aiding in model explainability.  This is particularly important in domains requiring transparent decision-making.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Binary Classification with Sigmoid Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Sigmoid for binary classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Assuming 'X_train', 'y_train', 'X_test', 'y_test' are your data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This example demonstrates a simple binary classification model.  Note the use of 'relu' (Rectified Linear Unit) activation in the hidden layers, a more common and generally preferred choice for hidden layers due to its avoidance of the vanishing gradient problem, and the 'sigmoid' activation in the output layer to produce a probability score.  The `binary_crossentropy` loss function is appropriate for binary classification problems.

**Example 2: Custom Sigmoid Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MySigmoidLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MySigmoidLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.activations.sigmoid(inputs)


model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    MySigmoidLayer(), # Custom sigmoid layer
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

#Rest of the code remains similar to Example 1, excluding the activation in the last layer.
```

This showcases how to create a custom layer using the sigmoid activation. This approach allows for more granular control and integration into more complex architectures.  It's particularly useful when you need to incorporate the sigmoid function within a larger, more sophisticated layer structure.

**Example 3:  Sigmoid in a Multi-output Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='binary_output')(hidden_layer), #Binary classification output
    keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax', name='multiclass_output')(hidden_layer) #Multi-class classification output
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss={'binary_output': 'binary_crossentropy', 'multiclass_output': 'categorical_crossentropy'},
              loss_weights={'binary_output': 0.5, 'multiclass_output': 0.5},
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#This example requires defining 'input_layer' and 'hidden_layer'
```

This example illustrates a multi-output model where one output uses sigmoid activation for binary classification, demonstrating its selective application within a larger architecture.  The loss function is defined separately for each output layer, reflecting their different natures (binary vs. multi-class).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet;  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  The Keras documentation.  These resources provide comprehensive explanations of neural networks, activation functions, and practical Keras implementations.  Furthermore, reviewing research papers focusing on activation function comparisons will deepen your understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses.  Understanding gradient descent and backpropagation is crucial to fully appreciate the implications of the vanishing gradient problem in the context of sigmoid activation.
