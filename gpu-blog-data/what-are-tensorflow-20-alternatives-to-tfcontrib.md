The removal of `tf.contrib` in TensorFlow 2.0 necessitates a shift in how many developers, including myself, structure their projects. I recall porting a large image processing pipeline from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.0 and the adjustments required were significant, particularly around formerly `contrib`-housed modules. The primary driver for this change was that `tf.contrib` had become a repository for experimental and rapidly evolving code, often lacking proper maintenance, API stability, and consistent testing. Consequently, TensorFlow 2.0 opted to promote stable, well-supported functionalities, either directly within `tf` or through dedicated packages. Here's how I've approached the common replacements.

Firstly, many of the numerical and mathematical utilities previously found within `tf.contrib.distributions` have migrated to the `tensorflow_probability` package. This separation makes sense because `tensorflow_probability` is explicitly designed for statistical modeling and probabilistic programming. Instead of importing distributions via a `contrib` path, they are now accessed through `tfp.distributions`, and related functionality, like bijectors or random variables, are accessed through the corresponding `tfp` submodules. The move also resulted in more robust implementations and consistency with statistical theory.

Secondly, functions related to layers and neural network building blocks, formerly under `tf.contrib.layers` or `tf.contrib.slim`, have largely been absorbed into the core `tf.keras` and `tf.nn` modules. This integration significantly streamlines the development of neural networks. For instance, a fully connected layer, which might have been constructed using `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected`, is now constructed using `tf.keras.layers.Dense`.  Furthermore, more advanced layer types, regularization methods, and optimizers have become integrated into `tf.keras.layers` and `tf.keras.optimizers`, which further simplifies code reuse and learning. The `tf.nn` module handles lower-level functionalities, such as activation functions and convolutions. This modularity, in my experience, results in cleaner code that is easier to debug and maintain.

Thirdly, several text processing and sequence modeling utilities from `tf.contrib.rnn` and `tf.contrib.seq2seq` have also been transitioned to core TensorFlow modules or specialized libraries. Specifically, recurrent neural networks and their related components are now predominantly found in `tf.keras.layers`.  This includes layers like `tf.keras.layers.LSTM`, `tf.keras.layers.GRU`, and embedding layers. Furthermore, the functionality related to sequence to sequence learning, originally under `tf.contrib.seq2seq`, can be replicated through a careful combination of `tf.keras.layers`, and custom `tf.function` based training loops. While `tf.contrib.seq2seq` was a convenience, its flexibility was limited; moving to explicit layer combinations and custom logic provides significantly more power over implementation details. This often includes the option to use various forms of attention mechanisms, which previously might have been restricted or required workarounds under `tf.contrib`.

Here are three code examples, illustrating these changes with accompanying commentary.

**Example 1: Distribution Sampling**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (using tf.contrib)
# import tensorflow as tf
# from tensorflow.contrib.distributions import Normal

# dist = Normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0)
# samples = dist.sample(10)


# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

dist = tfd.Normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0)
samples = dist.sample(10)


print(samples) #output: Tensor of 10 sampled normal distributions
```

**Commentary:**  This example shows the fundamental switch of distribution handling from `tf.contrib.distributions` to `tensorflow_probability`. The core concept of defining a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation remains; however, the syntax requires importing the distribution class from the `tfp.distributions` namespace. The `tfp` structure provides a more formalized and comprehensive framework for handling a range of statistical distributions and their operations. This structure also provides a more granular method for importing specific distributions as shown by the use of `tfd = tfp.distributions` for easier referencing.

**Example 2: Constructing a Fully Connected Layer**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (using tf.contrib)
# import tensorflow as tf

# input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
# output = tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(inputs=input_tensor, num_outputs=5)

# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5)
output = dense_layer(input_tensor)

print(output) #output: Tensor of shape (1,5)
```

**Commentary:** This snippet illustrates the replacement of `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected` with `tf.keras.layers.Dense`. In TensorFlow 2.0, neural network layer instantiation is streamlined via `tf.keras.layers`, with layers becoming objects to invoke on input tensors. The `units` parameter substitutes the `num_outputs` from the earlier `contrib` version. The switch results in code that reads more declaratively, by having a `Dense` object acting like a callable that outputs the transformation.

**Example 3: Utilizing an LSTM Layer**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (using tf.contrib)
# import tensorflow as tf

# input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 10))
# cell = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell(num_units=128)
# output, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, input_tensor, dtype=tf.float32)


# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 10))
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=True)
output = lstm_layer(input_tensor)
print(output) #output: Tensor of shape (1,10,128)
```

**Commentary:** This showcases how to transition from using `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell` and `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` to `tf.keras.layers.LSTM`.  The `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` class provides a streamlined interface for building recurrent layers. Note that I've added  `return_sequences=True` in this 2.x example to emulate the return of all time steps as it was done with `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`. Without this, the output would only return the result of the last time step of the RNN. In practice, one needs to consider the `stateful` property of the layer as well, dependent on the use case.

To facilitate this migration, I have found the following resources invaluable:

*   **TensorFlow API Documentation:** The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary source of truth for all modules and their functionalities, including those replacing `tf.contrib`. Thoroughly understanding the provided documentation for `tf.keras`, `tf.nn`, and `tensorflow_probability` will solve many migration problems.
*   **TensorFlow Tutorials and Guides:** The official TensorFlow website includes various tutorials and guides on specific tasks (such as image recognition or natural language processing). These tutorials often demonstrate how to construct pipelines using the modern, non-`contrib` components.
*   **Stack Overflow:** While not an official resource, Stack Overflow remains a crucial support for debugging and finding best practices as TensorFlow 2.0 continues to evolve. I myself frequently search for specific use cases as they apply to my projects.

In summary, the shift away from `tf.contrib` in TensorFlow 2.0, while initially disruptive, has improved the stability and consistency of the framework. While adjustments are required, the move towards integrating key functionalities into `tf.keras`, `tf.nn`, and using dedicated packages like `tensorflow_probability`, provides a more sustainable and flexible platform for building complex machine learning models. Using these revised mechanisms, along with diligent consultation of official documentation and active participation in the community, will significantly streamline the development process within TensorFlow 2.0 and beyond.
