TensorFlow Probability (TFP) provides a robust framework for defining and manipulating probability distributions. A particularly powerful feature is the `TransformedDistribution`, which allows us to construct new distributions by applying invertible transformations to existing ones. When dealing with a multivariate normal distribution, employing transformations can enable us to model data exhibiting non-Gaussian characteristics or to incorporate specific constraints on the parameters. I've found this technique indispensable when modeling complex financial data, where directly using a Gaussian often fails to capture the underlying dependencies and non-linear patterns.

The core principle behind `TransformedDistribution` is the change of variables formula in probability theory. If we have a random variable *X* with probability density function *p(x)* and apply an invertible transformation *g* to it to obtain *Y = g(X)*, the probability density function of *Y*, denoted *q(y)*, is given by:

*q(y) = p(g⁻¹(y)) |det(Jg⁻¹(y))|*,

where *g⁻¹* is the inverse of the transformation *g*, and *Jg⁻¹* is the Jacobian matrix of the inverse transformation. This is crucial for correctly calculating the probability density of the transformed distribution. TensorFlow Probability handles the computation of the Jacobian and the inverse transform automatically, significantly simplifying the process. We only need to provide the base distribution, which, in our case, will be a multivariate normal, and the transformation.

Let's explore some concrete examples. I will assume you are familiar with the basic syntax of TensorFlow and TFP.

**Example 1: Scaling and Translation**

The simplest transformation one can perform on a multivariate normal distribution is scaling and translation. This effectively adjusts the mean and covariance of the distribution while maintaining its Gaussian shape. Suppose we have a two-dimensional multivariate normal distribution and want to scale each component by a different factor and then translate it. This is common when normalizing or denormalizing data in statistical models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions
tfb = tfp.bijectors

# Define the base multivariate normal distribution
base_mean = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0], dtype=tf.float32)
base_cov = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance(
    loc=base_mean, covariance_matrix=base_cov
)


# Define the scale and shift transformation
scale = tf.constant([2.0, 0.5], dtype=tf.float32)
shift = tf.constant([1.0, -1.0], dtype=tf.float32)
bijector = tfb.Chain([tfb.Shift(shift), tfb.Scale(scale)])


# Create the transformed distribution
transformed_dist = tfd.TransformedDistribution(
    distribution=base_dist, bijector=bijector
)

# Sample from the transformed distribution
samples = transformed_dist.sample(100)

# Evaluate the log probability of a sample
log_prob = transformed_dist.log_prob(samples[0])


print("Samples shape:", samples.shape)
print("Log probability:", log_prob)
```

In this code, I first defined a standard two-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with a mean of `[0.0, 0.0]` and an identity covariance matrix. I then defined the scale and shift parameters and employed `tfb.Scale` and `tfb.Shift` bijectors. Crucially, these are chained using `tfb.Chain` to apply the scale transformation *first* and the shift *second*, this is important because the order of bijectors matters. Finally, I created the `TransformedDistribution` and sampled from it. The output will demonstrate samples that are rescaled and translated according to our specified parameters.

**Example 2: Modeling Skewness using a Sigmoid Transformation**

While simple scaling and translation maintain the Gaussian shape, we can introduce non-Gaussianity using more sophisticated transformations. A common situation in real-world data is the presence of skew. A sigmoid-based transformation can effectively achieve this. Let's assume we want to skew the first dimension of our multivariate normal distribution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions
tfb = tfp.bijectors


# Define the base multivariate normal distribution
base_mean = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0], dtype=tf.float32)
base_cov = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance(
    loc=base_mean, covariance_matrix=base_cov
)

# Define the sigmoid transformation for the first dimension
def sigmoid_transform(x):
    x_transformed_dim0 = tf.sigmoid(x[..., 0])
    x_transformed_dim1 = x[..., 1]

    return tf.stack([x_transformed_dim0, x_transformed_dim1], axis=-1)

def sigmoid_inverse_transform(y):
  y_transformed_dim0 = tf.math.log(y[..., 0] / (1- y[..., 0]))
  y_transformed_dim1 = y[...,1]
  return tf.stack([y_transformed_dim0, y_transformed_dim1], axis=-1)

class SigmoidBijector(tfb.Bijector):

  def __init__(self, validate_args=False, name="SigmoidBijector"):
    super(SigmoidBijector, self).__init__(
        validate_args=validate_args,
        forward_min_event_ndims=1,
        name=name
    )
  
  def _forward(self, x):
        return sigmoid_transform(x)

  def _inverse(self, y):
        return sigmoid_inverse_transform(y)

  def _forward_log_det_jacobian(self, x):
      # Jacobian matrix for sigmoid transform
      jacobian_diag = tf.stack(
          [tf.sigmoid(x[..., 0]) * (1 - tf.sigmoid(x[..., 0])),
          tf.ones_like(x[..., 1])],
          axis=-1
          )
      return tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.log(tf.abs(jacobian_diag)), axis=-1)


bijector = SigmoidBijector()


# Create the transformed distribution
transformed_dist = tfd.TransformedDistribution(
    distribution=base_dist, bijector=bijector
)

# Sample from the transformed distribution
samples = transformed_dist.sample(100)

# Evaluate the log probability of a sample
log_prob = transformed_dist.log_prob(samples[0])


print("Samples shape:", samples.shape)
print("Log probability:", log_prob)
```

In this more advanced example, I defined a custom `SigmoidBijector`. In order to use the custom bijector, I needed to provide the forward, inverse, and the `_forward_log_det_jacobian` functions. The critical part is the log determinant of the Jacobian of the inverse transformation to ensure that the probability density is computed correctly.  I applied a sigmoid transformation to the first dimension, leaving the second dimension unchanged. The resulting distribution will exhibit a skew in its first dimension, demonstrably departing from a standard Gaussian behavior. I used the inverse of the sigmoid in the inverse transformation.  Note that while the sigmoid is bound between 0 and 1, the range of the first component of the generated data may not always be. This results from the fact that the multivariate normal is unbounded and only the forward function maps the values in between 0 and 1.

**Example 3: Modeling Correlation Structure with a Rotation**

Finally, let’s consider a transformation that affects the covariance structure, specifically a rotation. Rotating a multivariate normal alters its correlation without changing its shape. This is a key step in many signal processing or computer vision applications where rotating a sample is a key operation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import numpy as np

tfd = tfp.distributions
tfb = tfp.bijectors


# Define the base multivariate normal distribution
base_mean = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0], dtype=tf.float32)
base_cov = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance(
    loc=base_mean, covariance_matrix=base_cov
)

# Define the rotation transformation
angle = np.pi/4
rotation_matrix = tf.constant([[tf.cos(angle), -tf.sin(angle)],
                              [tf.sin(angle), tf.cos(angle)]], dtype=tf.float32)

bijector = tfb.ScaleMatvecLinearOperator(
  scale=tf.linalg.LinearOperatorFullMatrix(rotation_matrix)
)


# Create the transformed distribution
transformed_dist = tfd.TransformedDistribution(
    distribution=base_dist, bijector=bijector
)

# Sample from the transformed distribution
samples = transformed_dist.sample(100)


# Evaluate the log probability of a sample
log_prob = transformed_dist.log_prob(samples[0])

print("Samples shape:", samples.shape)
print("Log probability:", log_prob)
```

Here, I defined a rotation matrix using a specified angle. I then utilized the `tfb.ScaleMatvecLinearOperator` bijector, which can be used to scale a distribution using a linear operator represented by a matrix. When applied to the initial multivariate normal, this results in a transformed distribution where the principal axes are rotated according to the angle. Notice that only the linear operator is passed and the Jacobian is computed by the `ScaleMatvecLinearOperator` bijector. The resulting samples show a clear correlation structure between their dimensions, something absent in the base distribution.

These examples demonstrate the flexibility of `TransformedDistribution`. While I have shown simple transformations, the bijector library in TensorFlow Probability offers numerous options for constructing complex transforms. Moreover, you can create custom bijectors to cater to specific modeling needs, as illustrated with the `SigmoidBijector`.

For further exploration of this topic, I suggest consulting the TensorFlow Probability documentation. The API reference provides detailed explanations and usage examples of both `TransformedDistribution` and the various bijectors available. Additionally, the TFP tutorials offer practical insights and walk-throughs of various probabilistic modeling techniques. I would also recommend looking at research papers in probabilistic machine learning which often use transformed distributions to model complex problems. Specifically, learning about normalizing flows will expand the context.
