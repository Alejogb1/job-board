A crucial optimization when working with large datasets involves pre-sorting data for efficient search and retrieval. I encountered this specific need repeatedly while developing a real-time analytics engine, where incoming data was often delivered as unordered pairs within a NumPy array. The task consistently demanded constructing a sorted list from these pairs, necessitating careful consideration of both efficiency and correctness.

The challenge arises from the nature of an n×2 NumPy array; each row represents a pair of values, and the overall sorting objective usually focuses on the first element of each pair while maintaining the association with the second element. Direct application of NumPy's sort functions, while possible, might not preserve the desired relationship between elements. Therefore, a method that simultaneously sorts the primary value and maintains the association with its corresponding value is necessary.

The core approach involves leveraging NumPy's indexing capabilities coupled with its `argsort()` function. `argsort()` returns the indices that would sort an array. In our case, we would sort based on the first column of the n×2 array. These sorted indices can then be used to reorder the original array effectively creating the equivalent of a sorted list of pairs without using a traditional list data structure. The sorted array is not technically a `list` in the python sense, but functionally behaves as a sorted list.

Let’s examine this process using practical code examples:

**Example 1: Basic Sorting**

```python
import numpy as np

def sort_array_pairs_basic(data_array):
    """
    Sorts an n x 2 NumPy array based on the first column
    and returns the reordered array.
    """
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(data_array[:, 0])
    sorted_array = data_array[sorted_indices]
    return sorted_array

# Example Usage
data = np.array([[3, 'c'], [1, 'a'], [2, 'b'], [1, 'd']])
sorted_data = sort_array_pairs_basic(data)
print(sorted_data)
```

In the `sort_array_pairs_basic` function, `np.argsort(data_array[:, 0])` identifies the indices that would place the first column of `data_array` in ascending order. Subsequently, `data_array[sorted_indices]` applies these indices to reorder the entire array. As a result, the rows of the original array are reordered based on the sorted order of the first column while preserving their second column values. This creates an array equivalent to a sorted list of pairs.

**Example 2: Handling Ties with Lexicographical Sorting**

In a more complex scenario, you might need to sort based on the first column and then, within the same value in the first column, sort based on the values in the second column. This is what we call lexicographical sorting.

```python
import numpy as np

def sort_array_pairs_lexicographic(data_array):
    """
    Sorts an n x 2 NumPy array based on the first column
    and, for tied values, then sorts based on the second column
    lexicographically.
    """
    dtype = data_array.dtype
    if data_array.dtype.kind == 'U':
        dtype = 'U50' # Ensure it can handle enough chars.
    
    if data_array.dtype.kind in 'if': # Numeric
        sorted_indices = np.lexsort((data_array[:, 1], data_array[:, 0]))
    else: # String or other objects
        sorted_indices = np.lexsort((data_array[:, 1].astype(dtype), data_array[:, 0]))
    sorted_array = data_array[sorted_indices]
    return sorted_array

# Example Usage
data = np.array([[1, 'c'], [2, 'b'], [1, 'a'], [2, 'a'], [3, 'd']])
sorted_data = sort_array_pairs_lexicographic(data)
print(sorted_data)

data_numeric = np.array([[3, 5], [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 4], [3, 1]])
sorted_data_numeric = sort_array_pairs_lexicographic(data_numeric)
print(sorted_data_numeric)
```

Here, `np.lexsort((data_array[:, 1], data_array[:, 0]))` performs a lexicographical sort based on first the second column then the first. To properly handle different datatypes, especially strings, we apply the `astype()` method to the second column if it is not numeric. The rest of the logic remains the same, and the returned array represents the sorted list of pairs. The `dtype` variable is important in that it will promote if required, so that unicode is treated correctly. Numeric data is not promoted. This implementation is more robust and accounts for more real-world use cases.

**Example 3: Sorting by Custom Comparator**

Finally, scenarios can arise where a custom sorting logic is required which is not strictly lexicographical or numeric. For such cases, a custom sorting function can be used along with a method for applying it to create the indices for reordering.

```python
import numpy as np
import functools

def custom_comparator(row1, row2):
  """
  Custom comparator that sorts based on numerical values
  of second elements after converting them to int.
  """
  if int(row1[0]) < int(row2[0]):
    return -1
  if int(row1[0]) > int(row2[0]):
    return 1
  if int(row1[1]) < int(row2[1]):
      return -1
  if int(row1[1]) > int(row2[1]):
      return 1
  return 0


def sort_array_pairs_custom(data_array):
    """
    Sorts an n x 2 NumPy array using custom comparator, returning sorted array.
    """
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(data_array.shape[0]),
                           key=functools.cmp_to_key(lambda i, j: custom_comparator(data_array[i], data_array[j])))
    sorted_array = data_array[sorted_indices]
    return sorted_array


# Example Usage
data = np.array([['1', '3'], ['2', '1'], ['1', '2'], ['3', '1']])
sorted_data = sort_array_pairs_custom(data)
print(sorted_data)
```

In this example, the `custom_comparator` function defines the precise logic for comparing two rows. `sorted` along with `functools.cmp_to_key` applies this comparator to generate sorted indices. Although verbose, this approach provides ultimate flexibility when specific ordering rules are needed. The output, like the other examples is an array representation of a sorted list of pairs. The `custom_comparator` uses strings but converts them to integers before comparison, showcasing the flexibility available.

These three code examples cover a range of typical sorting use cases from basic sorting on the first element, to more complex sorting scenarios. The examples demonstrate the appropriate use of `argsort` and `lexsort`, and how to leverage a custom comparator. In all cases, the output is a sorted array which functionally acts like a sorted list of pairs.

For further exploration and understanding of NumPy's array manipulation capabilities, I would recommend focusing on these topics:
1. The in-depth documentation for NumPy's array indexing and slicing features.
2. The use of `np.argsort()` and `np.lexsort()`.
3. The different sorting algorithms available within NumPy and their respective performance characteristics.
4. Advanced indexing using boolean arrays.
5. Techniques for vectorization, as these can provide performance improvements, especially with very large datasets.
6. Custom comparisons and how to apply them.

By investigating these resources, one can develop a more thorough understanding of the intricacies involved in processing and manipulating data using NumPy, ensuring a robust and efficient approach when populating sorted data structures from n×2 arrays.
