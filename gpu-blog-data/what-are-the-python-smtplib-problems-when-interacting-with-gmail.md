Gmail's security policies, specifically those concerning "less secure apps" and OAuth 2.0, are the primary source of difficulties encountered when using Python's `smtplib` library for sending email. I've personally spent countless hours debugging email scripts that suddenly ceased functioning due to these changes, underscoring the importance of understanding these nuances. Older code relying on simple username and password authentication frequently breaks down as Gmail increasingly mandates more robust security measures.

The fundamental issue lies in the fact that `smtplib` facilitates sending emails through a specified SMTP server, using a protocol where, historically, direct user credentials were often sufficient. Gmail, like other major email providers, has gradually moved away from allowing this simple authentication method due to security vulnerabilities. Using your Google account password directly within your script is now highly discouraged, often failing outright. Gmail either blocks the connection attempt or requires explicit permission configured at the account level.

The initial problem manifests when a script attempts to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com` on port 587 for TLS) using only the user's email address and password. If the "less secure apps" setting is disabled, which is the default and highly recommended configuration, authentication will fail. Even when "less secure apps" was available, it presented a substantial security risk, leaving credentials vulnerable if the script was ever compromised. Google provides two mechanisms to address this, and proper implementation is crucial for successful `smtplib` use.

First, if you still wish to use username and password authentication, Gmail allows for the generation of an "App Password". This is a 16-character password specifically for use with applications that don't support modern authentication. It’s a better solution than enabling "less secure apps," as it confines the vulnerability to the password dedicated to that specific application. However, I emphasize the "app password" is still less secure than an OAuth flow.

Second, and more securely, is OAuth 2.0. This method utilizes a token-based system rather than a static username and password. The token is granted through a multi-step authorization process with Google, preventing you from storing your main password in plain text or in the application code. You request specific authorization scopes via Google's APIs; in our case this is typically the `https://mail.google.com/` scope. The API grants this scope with a token, which you use to authenticate with `smtplib` via a different process rather than via standard username/password credentials. This is definitely more involved but significantly more secure.

Now let's discuss how these complexities translate into practical scenarios, presenting code examples that illustrate the core challenges and their solutions.

**Example 1: Incorrect Authentication - Plain Password**

The following example demonstrates the straightforward, but often failing method of authenticating with a plain password using `smtplib`. I’ve encountered countless scripts exhibiting this pattern.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email_plain_password(sender_email, sender_password, receiver_email, subject, message):
    try:
        # Gmail's SMTP Server with TLS
        smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
        port = 587

        # Create an email message
        email = MIMEMultipart()
        email['From'] = sender_email
        email['To'] = receiver_email
        email['Subject'] = subject
        email.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

        # Connect to the SMTP Server and Authenticate
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password) # This is the problem here!

        # Send the Email
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, email.as_string())

        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example Usage (this will likely fail!)
# send_email_plain_password("your_email@gmail.com", "your_password", "receiver_email@example.com", "Test Email", "This is a test email.")
```

This example is designed to highlight the problem; attempting to run the `send_email_plain_password` function with your actual Gmail credentials will almost certainly result in an `SMTPAuthenticationError` or similar. This emphasizes that providing only your Gmail login password is simply not enough in the current security landscape. The line `server.login(sender_email, sender_password)` is where the failure occurs, because direct user password authentication is deprecated.

**Example 2: Correct Authentication - App Password**

Here's an example demonstrating the use of an "App Password."  I've found this to be a good, short-term fix for legacy systems but it still requires enabling app-specific password functionality in the Google Account settings.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email_app_password(sender_email, app_password, receiver_email, subject, message):
    try:
        # Gmail's SMTP Server with TLS
        smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
        port = 587

        # Create an email message
        email = MIMEMultipart()
        email['From'] = sender_email
        email['To'] = receiver_email
        email['Subject'] = subject
        email.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

        # Connect to the SMTP Server and Authenticate
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, app_password) # Authentication with app password

        # Send the Email
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, email.as_string())

        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully using app password!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example Usage (after creating an app password)
# send_email_app_password("your_email@gmail.com", "your_app_password", "receiver_email@example.com", "Test Email", "This is a test email.")
```

This example is nearly identical to the first, the key difference lies in the fact that the function expects and uses an "app password", not a regular Google Account password. You would create this password under your Google Account's security settings. While this works, it does require an additional manual configuration step. It’s more secure than plain passwords, but it is still less secure than proper OAuth.

**Example 3: More Secure Authentication - OAuth 2.0**

The third example shows the basic structure of using OAuth 2.0 for a much more secure authentication process. This code won't function standalone, as it needs the token generation via Google's OAuth APIs to function, but it demonstrates the required `smtplib` setup. This token is obtained from the Google API using your project's credentials and the email scope.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email_oauth2(sender_email, access_token, receiver_email, subject, message):
    try:
        # Gmail's SMTP Server with TLS
        smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
        port = 587

        # Create an email message
        email = MIMEMultipart()
        email['From'] = sender_email
        email['To'] = receiver_email
        email['Subject'] = subject
        email.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

        # Connect to the SMTP Server and Authenticate
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port)
        server.starttls()

        # Construct the authentication string
        auth_string = f"user={sender_email}\x01auth=Bearer {access_token}\x01\x01"
        server.ehlo(sender_email)  # Required before AUTH
        server.docmd('AUTH', 'XOAUTH2 ' + auth_string) # This step uses the access token
       
        # Send the Email
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, email.as_string())

        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully using OAuth2!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example Usage (access_token must be obtained separately!)
# access_token = 'this_is_a_token_from_google' # Example - this is dummy
# send_email_oauth2("your_email@gmail.com", access_token, "receiver_email@example.com", "Test Email", "This is a test email.")
```

Note the `server.docmd('AUTH', 'XOAUTH2 ' + auth_string)` line. This is not a simple login with username and password; it requires building a specific authentication string that includes the OAuth token. You would first obtain this `access_token` via the Google APIs using a client ID and client secret that you set up in your Google Project.  This ensures no raw passwords are exchanged, and tokens can be revoked if compromised. This method significantly improves the security when using `smtplib`.

For further guidance, I recommend consulting the following resources: the official Google Cloud documentation about how to set up Oauth 2.0, as well as official Python library documentation for any libraries dealing with Google’s API’s. StackOverflow also houses numerous Q&A detailing various scenarios involving `smtplib` and authentication issues, making it a valuable resource for diagnosing specific errors you might encounter. Always consult official documentation for the correct way to handle the various APIs used.
