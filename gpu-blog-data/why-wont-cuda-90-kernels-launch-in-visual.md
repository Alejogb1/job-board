CUDA 9.0 compatibility with Visual Studio 2013 is inherently problematic due to compiler and platform support limitations, stemming primarily from the significant advancements in the CUDA architecture and the accompanying toolkit that occurred between CUDA 8.0 and 9.0. My experience debugging similar issues, specifically while porting a simulation application that used heavy GPU computations from a legacy system, highlighted several key incompatibilities.

The fundamental issue is that Visual Studio 2013's toolchain is not designed to interact effectively with the newer CUDA 9.0’s host compiler requirements and PTX generation. CUDA toolkits are tightly coupled with specific versions of the host compiler provided by the operating system. Specifically, CUDA 9.0 explicitly requires support for C++11 features, which, while present in Visual Studio 2013, are not as fully implemented as needed for the CUDA 9.0's code generation, especially with regards to the device code. Further, the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) intermediate code generated by newer CUDA compilers sometimes contains instruction sets or features that the CUDA driver from an older Visual Studio toolchain, and its associated runtime, is unable to correctly interpret and manage, resulting in failures during kernel launch. This often manifests as runtime errors, or a complete failure to launch any kernels, as observed during my attempted project migration. It’s crucial to understand that CUDA is a highly complex ecosystem, and its compatibility matrix mandates specific compiler and OS dependencies.

The mismatch occurs at several critical points. First, the CUDA compiler, `nvcc`, internally depends on certain compiler features and library implementations from the host compiler (e.g., the Visual Studio toolchain). The code generation pathways used by `nvcc` for CUDA 9.0’s specific features are likely to use C++11 language components which are not fully supported by the 2013 compiler, leading to compilation errors or, worse, producing executables that will fail at runtime without an explanation on why the kernel launch failed. Second, the NVIDIA driver, responsible for loading and executing the CUDA kernels, might not be completely compatible with the specific PTX generated by the CUDA 9.0 toolkit when used with the older Visual Studio environment; this incompatibility can lead to subtle errors which are quite hard to track down. Finally, the Visual Studio integration components for CUDA, such as the custom build rules and debugging support, are also likely incompatible, leading to configuration and project setup issues which mask underlying kernel launch failures. This is because Visual Studio extensions are built for very specific toolkit versions, and a mismatch can silently impact the behavior of the application during execution.

Let's consider a simplified case to illustrate this. Imagine a very basic kernel:

```cpp
// kernel.cu
#include <cuda.h>
__global__ void addArrays(float *a, float *b, float *c, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  int size = 256;
  size_t byteSize = size * sizeof(float);
  float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  h_a = (float*)malloc(byteSize);
  h_b = (float*)malloc(byteSize);
  h_c = (float*)malloc(byteSize);

  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i){
      h_a[i] = (float)i;
      h_b[i] = (float)i*2;
  }


  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, byteSize);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, byteSize);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, byteSize);


  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, byteSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, byteSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  addArrays<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, byteSize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  for (int i=0; i < size; i++){
      std::cout << h_c[i] << std::endl;
  }


  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  free(h_a);
  free(h_b);
  free(h_c);
  return 0;
}
```
In this scenario, compiling the `kernel.cu` and linking with `main.cpp` will likely fail to produce a working application because even though the code itself is syntactically correct, the CUDA 9.0 compiler and driver are not designed to work with the Visual Studio 2013 compiler and it's accompanying runtime environment. Compilation errors are one possible symptom, whereas the more common issue is that the kernel launch will simply fail.

Now consider an example where we attempt to use shared memory within the kernel, which introduces a more subtle point of failure:

```cpp
// kernel.cu
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void sharedMemoryExample(float *input, float *output, int size) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[256];
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (i < size) {
      sharedData[threadIdx.x] = input[i];
      __syncthreads();
      output[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x];
  }
}
```
While this kernel appears to be basic and the code itself is valid, CUDA 9.0 makes use of newer PTX intrinsics when generating code for the use of shared memory. If the driver and runtime environment are incompatible, the resulting binary may not execute as expected. A failure might occur during kernel execution with no immediately obvious cause from the code. The incompatibility is often hidden deep within the driver and runtime components making debugging significantly difficult.

Finally, let’s look at a slightly more complex case, incorporating template usage, which makes use of more advanced C++ features:

```cpp
// kernel.cu
#include <cuda.h>

template <typename T>
__global__ void templatedAdd(T *a, T *b, T *c, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  // ... (same device memory allocation as the first example)
  int size = 256;
  size_t byteSize = size * sizeof(float);
  float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  h_a = (float*)malloc(byteSize);
  h_b = (float*)malloc(byteSize);
  h_c = (float*)malloc(byteSize);

  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i){
      h_a[i] = (float)i;
      h_b[i] = (float)i*2;
  }

  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, byteSize);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, byteSize);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, byteSize);


  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, byteSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, byteSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  templatedAdd<float><<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, byteSize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  for (int i=0; i < size; i++){
      std::cout << h_c[i] << std::endl;
  }

  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  free(h_a);
  free(h_b);
  free(h_c);
  return 0;
}
```
The use of templates can expose C++ language features that may not have robust support in Visual Studio 2013's compiler when attempting to compile code for the CUDA device. Even though the compiler can handle templates, the subtle interactions between the host compiler and the CUDA toolchain when template code is involved often lead to runtime issues that are incredibly difficult to isolate. My personal experience with templated kernels, in particular, has revealed that this is a common scenario.

To resolve the kernel launch issues, a direct upgrade of the Visual Studio environment is essential. Specifically, I would advise using a more recent version of Visual Studio, ideally from 2017 or later along with its corresponding CUDA toolkit. Moreover, verify that the installed NVIDIA drivers are compatible with the chosen CUDA version. Consulting the release notes from NVIDIA concerning the specific CUDA version is a very critical step. I’d recommend researching the CUDA programming guides and documentation available from NVIDIA to thoroughly understand the required setup for each specific CUDA version. Also, pay careful attention to the compatibility matrix provided in their documentation. Finally, consider reviewing community forums and user guides specifically focused on CUDA development to understand common pitfalls and how to avoid them. I would emphasize that compatibility issues between Visual Studio versions and the CUDA toolkit is a very common cause of failure, and upgrading both to the correct versions has been the most successful solution I've encountered.
