Within deep learning, training multiple Keras models concurrently on a single GPU presents a significant challenge due to the inherent sequential nature of standard training loops. The default behavior of TensorFlow, the backend for Keras, locks a single GPU process to a single model, effectively preventing parallel execution at the model level. Overcoming this requires a careful orchestration of TensorFlow’s computational graph and an understanding of its resource management. My experience in developing large-scale computer vision systems, where rapid model experimentation was crucial, often pushed me to the limits of this problem. I found that while direct parallelism at the model level is not feasible, exploiting TensorFlow's capabilities for asynchronous computation and careful memory management allows for effective pseudo-parallel training using a single GPU resource.

The core strategy involves creating a system where each model training process, although technically running in sequence, has its computational graph built and prepared in advance. This allows for efficient pre-fetching of data and parallel execution of different sections of the graph as soon as they are ready. The key here isn't true parallelism on the same GPU *at the same time*, rather it is a clever interleaving of model training steps such that utilization of the GPU remains high, minimizing idle time that would occur when training multiple models serially. Essentially, the goal is to overlap the I/O, data preprocessing, and gradient calculation operations between different models as much as possible to achieve a speedup in overall throughput. This is achievable by using `tf.data.Dataset` for data pipelines and multiple model instances, each associated with its unique dataset iterator, to manage the model's computation graph and memory efficiently.

The typical sequential model fitting process, one after the other, would introduce significant latency. For example, while one model’s training is processing the forward pass, the GPU might not be fully utilized as data is fetched for the next model. This latency compounds with the number of models, making the overall training time excessive. The proposed method achieves greater efficiency by creating training tasks for multiple models that do not wait on the completion of each full training loop, but rather perform small batches of computation for all of the models before moving on to the next step.

To illustrate, let's consider three hypothetical models: `model_a`, `model_b`, and `model_c`. Each requires different training data. This will simulate a common scenario during research or when comparing different model architectures.

**Code Example 1: Data Preparation**

First, datasets must be created and prepared to allow for pre-fetching using `tf.data.Dataset`. This is crucial for asynchronous processing, allowing subsequent computations to proceed without waiting for data to become available from disk. Note that these functions are a placeholder and would need to be fully defined based on the type of data being handled (e.g. image loading, text processing).

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_dataset_a():
    # Simulated data loading and preprocessing
    data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 32))
    labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(1000,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
    dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE) # Prefetching is key
    return dataset

def create_dataset_b():
    # Simulated data loading and preprocessing
    data = tf.random.normal(shape=(800, 64))
    labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(800,), minval=0, maxval=5, dtype=tf.int32)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
    dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    return dataset

def create_dataset_c():
    # Simulated data loading and preprocessing
    data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1200, 16))
    labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(1200,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
    dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    return dataset


dataset_a = create_dataset_a()
dataset_b = create_dataset_b()
dataset_c = create_dataset_c()

dataset_iterators = {
    'a': iter(dataset_a),
    'b': iter(dataset_b),
    'c': iter(dataset_c)
}
```
Here, I use simulated data and demonstrate the importance of using `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)`. This configures the data loading to operate asynchronously, allowing the GPU to proceed with computation even when data is being loaded.

**Code Example 2: Model Definition**

Next, we define the Keras models. Each model is a basic example here for simplicity, but they could be arbitrarily complex. Each model must have its own dedicated instance.

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

def create_model_a():
    return keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(32,)),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

def create_model_b():
    return keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(64,)),
        layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
    ])

def create_model_c():
    return keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(16,)),
        layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
    ])

model_a = create_model_a()
model_b = create_model_b()
model_c = create_model_c()

optimizers = {
    'a': keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
    'b': keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0005),
    'c': keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.002)
}

losses = {
    'a': keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
    'b': keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
    'c': keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
}
```
This establishes the unique models, loss functions, and optimizers. It's imperative that each model has its own set of these components, as well as a unique optimizer. These instances are then associated with our data iterators to create the training setup.

**Code Example 3: Asynchronous Training Loop**

Finally, the core of this solution is the custom training loop. It iterates through all models in small batches, avoiding a sequential approach to model fitting. This function provides a highly efficient use of GPU resources by interleaving the forward and backward passes of each model.

```python

@tf.function
def train_step(model, data, labels, optimizer, loss_fn):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(data)
      loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

num_epochs = 5
num_batches = 20

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}")
    for batch in range(num_batches):
        for model_name in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
            try:
                data, labels = next(dataset_iterators[model_name])
                loss = train_step(
                    model=globals()[f"model_{model_name}"],
                    data=data,
                    labels=labels,
                    optimizer=optimizers[model_name],
                    loss_fn=losses[model_name]
                )

                print(f"  Batch {batch + 1}/{num_batches} - Model {model_name}: Loss {loss:.4f}")
            except StopIteration:
                # Reset iterator if dataset is exhausted within the epochs
                dataset_iterators[model_name] = iter(globals()[f"create_dataset_{model_name}"]())
                data, labels = next(dataset_iterators[model_name])
                loss = train_step(
                    model=globals()[f"model_{model_name}"],
                    data=data,
                    labels=labels,
                    optimizer=optimizers[model_name],
                    loss_fn=losses[model_name]
                )
                print(f"  Batch {batch + 1}/{num_batches} - Model {model_name}: Loss {loss:.4f}")
```

This loop demonstrates the core concept of interleaving training steps. It iterates through each model’s data, performs a small training step using `train_step`, and advances to the next model, ensuring efficient GPU usage. The `train_step` function performs a single forward/backward pass and has been decorated with `@tf.function`, significantly accelerating the performance. Each step is processed through a `try/except` block to handle the case where datasets are exhausted within the main training loop, resetting iterators for each model if necessary. This loop structure allows asynchronous data preprocessing to occur concurrently with the GPU computation, thus maximizing the utilization of resources.

For resources beyond the TensorFlow documentation, which is essential for understanding these operations, several books and websites provide in-depth explanations of TensorFlow concepts. I would recommend consulting a few specific areas. Explore works related to TensorFlow's performance optimization, particularly those focused on `tf.data` and custom training loops. Texts covering advanced GPU computing would enhance understanding of how to improve single GPU utilization beyond basic model training. Additionally, resources focused on the software engineering aspect of deep learning could help in properly structuring and managing more complex training setups. These combined resources would solidify the understanding of how to perform pseudo-parallel model training on a single GPU, and how to further refine this approach for specific computational tasks.
