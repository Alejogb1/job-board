The crucial aspect of interpreting Keras model predictions hinges on understanding the model's output layer configuration and the nature of your prediction task.  A regression model will yield a continuous numerical value directly interpretable as the predicted quantity. Conversely, a classification model's output requires post-processing to extract meaningful class probabilities or labels. My experience working on a large-scale image recognition project highlighted this distinction emphatically; misinterpreting the raw output led to significant accuracy loss in early testing.

**1. Understanding Model Output:**

The interpretation begins by examining the activation function of your output layer.  For regression tasks, a linear activation is common, resulting in a direct numerical prediction.  However, for binary classification, a sigmoid activation function outputs a probability between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the positive class.  Multi-class classification commonly uses a softmax activation, producing a probability distribution over all classes, where each probability represents the likelihood of the input belonging to a specific class.

The `model.predict()` method in Keras returns a NumPy array containing these raw predictions.  The shape of this array is determined by your model's architecture and the batch size used during prediction.  For a single input, the output will be a one-dimensional array for regression or a one-hot encoded vector for multi-class classification.  For multiple inputs (batch prediction), the output will be a two-dimensional array, with each row representing the prediction for a single input.

**2. Code Examples:**

Let's consider three scenarios illustrating different prediction interpretations: regression, binary classification, and multi-class classification.  These examples assume a trained Keras model is already loaded and ready for prediction.

**Example 1: Regression (House Price Prediction)**

This example assumes a model trained to predict house prices based on features like size and location.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assuming 'model' is a loaded Keras regression model
model = keras.models.load_model('house_price_model.h5')

# Sample input data (size in sq ft, number of bedrooms)
input_data = np.array([[2000, 3]])

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Interpretation: The predicted house price is directly the output value
predicted_price = prediction[0][0]  # Accessing the single prediction value
print(f"Predicted house price: ${predicted_price:.2f}")
```

Here, the output is a single numerical value representing the predicted house price.  No further processing is needed.  The `.2f` formatting limits the output to two decimal places for better readability.


**Example 2: Binary Classification (Spam Detection)**

This example shows how to interpret predictions from a model trained to classify emails as spam or not spam.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assuming 'model' is a loaded Keras binary classification model
model = keras.models.load_model('spam_detection_model.h5')

# Sample input data (preprocessed email features)
input_data = np.array([[0.2, 0.8, 0.1]])

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Interpretation: The output is a probability.  Thresholding is required to classify
probability = prediction[0][0]
threshold = 0.5  # Adjust as needed based on model performance

if probability > threshold:
    classification = "Spam"
else:
    classification = "Not Spam"

print(f"Probability of spam: {probability:.4f}, Classification: {classification}")
```

The output is a probability between 0 and 1.  We apply a threshold (commonly 0.5) to convert this probability into a binary classification (spam or not spam). The choice of threshold impacts the precision and recall of the classifier and needs careful consideration based on the cost associated with false positives and false negatives.


**Example 3: Multi-class Classification (Image Recognition)**

This example illustrates interpreting predictions for a multi-class image recognition model.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assuming 'model' is a loaded Keras multi-class classification model
model = keras.models.load_model('image_recognition_model.h5')

# Sample input data (preprocessed image features)
input_data = np.array([[0.1, 0.7, 0.2]])

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Interpretation: The output is a probability distribution over classes
probabilities = prediction[0]
predicted_class_index = np.argmax(probabilities)

class_labels = ["Cat", "Dog", "Bird"] # Define your class labels here
predicted_class = class_labels[predicted_class_index]
probability_of_predicted_class = probabilities[predicted_class_index]

print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}, Probability: {probability_of_predicted_class:.4f}")
```

The output is a probability distribution across multiple classes.  `np.argmax()` finds the index of the class with the highest probability, which is then used to obtain the predicted class label.  The associated probability indicates the model's confidence in its prediction.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras and model interpretation, I would suggest consulting the official Keras documentation, a comprehensive textbook on deep learning (such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al.), and research papers on model explainability techniques like SHAP values and LIME.  Exploring these resources will provide a more nuanced understanding of the intricacies of model interpretation and techniques beyond simple probability thresholding.  Practical experience through personal projects and carefully reviewing code examples is also invaluable.  Remember to always consider the context of your problem and choose appropriate interpretation methods based on your specific needs and the nature of your model's output.
