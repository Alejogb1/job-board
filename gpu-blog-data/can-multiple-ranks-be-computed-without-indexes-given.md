Yes, multiple ranks can indeed be computed without relying on explicit indexes when dealing with different partitions but the same sort order, leveraging window functions in SQL. In my experience managing large-scale analytical databases, I've routinely encountered scenarios requiring per-partition ranking while maintaining a consistent ordering criterion across all partitions. Indexing can become performance bottlenecks in such massive datasets, making window functions, which operate on sets of rows related to the current row, an attractive alternative.

The core principle behind this technique lies in the ability of window functions to define a "window" or frame of rows based on `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses. Crucially, the `ORDER BY` clause within the window function determines the sequence in which rows are processed *within* each partition, effectively assigning a rank based on that ordering. While a standard `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, or `NTILE()` window function generates a rank, the `PARTITION BY` clause ensures these ranks are computed independently for each distinct partition value. Therefore, the same overall sort criteria apply across all partitions due to the singular `ORDER BY` specification, but the ranks are localized to each group.

This approach avoids explicit pre-calculated indexes because it computes the ranks on the fly during the query execution. It is important to note that the performance of this approach relies heavily on the query optimizerâ€™s ability to handle the window functions efficiently. Typically, the optimizer will use sorting and grouping techniques to accomplish this task, rather than creating and utilizing an index. The absence of a static index provides an advantage in data warehousing and analytical environments where frequent data loads make index maintenance burdensome. Moreover, this approach allows for more flexible ranking based on runtime filtering criteria.

Here are some practical examples demonstrating this concept:

**Example 1: Ranking Sales within Each Region**

Imagine a table `sales_data` containing information about sales transactions, including `region`, `customer_id`, and `sale_amount`. Our objective is to rank customers by `sale_amount` within each `region`.

```sql
SELECT
    region,
    customer_id,
    sale_amount,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) AS sales_rank
FROM
    sales_data;
```

In this query, `PARTITION BY region` divides the data into logical segments, one for each unique region. `ORDER BY sale_amount DESC` establishes that within every region, the highest sales amount receives rank 1. The `RANK()` function handles tie scenarios, assigning the same rank to rows sharing the same `sale_amount` within the partition, while skipping the subsequent rank number appropriately. For instance, if two customers in 'North' have the same highest `sale_amount`, both will receive rank 1, and the next customer with a lower sale will get rank 3. This example highlights the generation of ranks without needing an explicit pre-indexed structure.

**Example 2: Dense Ranking of Products within Each Category**

Consider a product table `product_inventory` with columns like `category`, `product_name`, and `price`. We wish to compute a dense ranking of products by `price` within each `category`, meaning that if multiple products share the same price, the next ranking is consecutive without any skipped numbers.

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    product_name,
    price,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS product_rank
FROM
    product_inventory;
```
Here, `DENSE_RANK()` ensures that no rank numbers are skipped even when there are ties. If multiple products in the 'Electronics' category share the highest price, they would each get rank 1, and the next cheapest product will be rank 2. Like the first example, the rank is calculated on the fly within each category, avoiding any explicit index on the data. The `PARTITION BY` clause ensures localized ranking while the overall ordering criterion is uniformly applied via `ORDER BY price DESC`.

**Example 3: Segmenting Employees into Quartiles by Salary within Each Department**

Assume an `employee_data` table with `department`, `employee_id`, and `salary`. Our goal is to divide employees into quartiles based on their salary within each department.

```sql
SELECT
    department,
    employee_id,
    salary,
    NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_quartile
FROM
    employee_data;
```

The `NTILE(4)` function divides the rows within each department into four groups of approximately equal size, based on the `salary` in descending order. Employees in each department are thus assigned a quartile number from 1 to 4. The key here is the `PARTITION BY` clause which creates separate quartiles for each department. This avoids any reliance on indexed rank information, performing all needed operations within the single query and only once at query run-time.

These examples illustrate that multiple ranks with different partitions can be efficiently computed using window functions, completely bypassing the need for explicit indexes. The consistency is maintained across partitions since the `ORDER BY` applies identically across the multiple segments. The use of specific window functions like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, or `NTILE()` depends on the exact ranking requirement, but the underlying principle of partition and order-based computation without indexing stays the same.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen understanding of this topic, I recommend consulting the documentation for your specific database system, focusing on the following areas:

*   **SQL Window Functions**: Explore the documentation relating to window functions like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `NTILE()`. Understanding the different behaviors of these functions is critical for correct implementation. The documentation should offer details on syntax, semantics and performance implications.
*   **Query Optimization**: Review resources describing query optimization techniques for window functions within your specific database environment. This often reveals best practices for structuring SQL queries, especially when working with very large datasets, to maximize their efficiency.
*   **Performance Tuning**: Seek documentation that covers optimizing query performance, as window functions can sometimes incur a computational cost when working with very large sets of data. Techniques like proper partitioning of the data at table level, understanding how the query optimizer is executing the query can be vital for scalability.
*   **SQL Standards Documents**: Examining the standards documents pertaining to SQL is a crucial source of reliable knowledge regarding its general behavior, even though vendor-specific dialects may differ. This will offer a broader understanding on how the behavior of standard SQL is intended to be.

By exploring these resources, one can gain a much more in-depth understanding of using window functions and other advanced SQL techniques to handle scenarios that require complex ranking operations without the performance overhead or inflexibility of pre-built indexes.
