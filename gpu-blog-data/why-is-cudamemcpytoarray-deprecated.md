The deprecation of `cudaMemcpyToArray` stems from its inherent limitations and the architectural advancements in CUDA over the years.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, particularly those involving large-scale image processing and scientific simulations, highlighted the inflexibility of this function compared to the more versatile and performant alternatives introduced in subsequent CUDA releases.  It wasn't simply a matter of updating a legacy function; the underlying memory management paradigm shifted, favoring a more unified and efficient approach.  The primary reason for its deprecation is its inability to efficiently handle the nuanced memory management demands of modern GPU architectures and programming styles.

Specifically, `cudaMemcpyToArray` suffered from several key drawbacks.  Firstly, it imposed a rigid structure on the memory transfer.  The source and destination had to be explicitly defined as an array, typically necessitating a pointer to an array and its associated dimensions. This contrasts sharply with the flexibility offered by later functions which operate on more generic memory regions, accommodating a wider range of data structures and memory layouts.  This inflexibility severely hampered performance optimization, especially when dealing with non-contiguous data or irregularly shaped arrays.  Secondly, error handling in `cudaMemcpyToArray` was less robust than in newer functions.  While error codes were returned, the lack of more detailed diagnostic information often made debugging challenging.  This contributed significantly to increased development time and decreased code reliability, especially in complex parallel algorithms. Finally, its use restricted the ability to leverage advanced CUDA features such as unified virtual addressing (UVA), which significantly simplifies memory management across CPU and GPU.

The preferred replacements for `cudaMemcpyToArray` are primarily `cudaMemcpy` and, in certain scenarios, `cudaMemcpyAsync`.  These functions offer substantially improved flexibility, error handling, and performance.  They allow for more versatile memory transfers between CPU and GPU, as well as between different GPU memory spaces, such as global, shared, and constant memory.  Let's illustrate this with some code examples.

**Example 1: Simple Memory Transfer using `cudaMemcpy`**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int *h_a, *d_a;
  int n = 1024;
  size_t size = n * sizeof(int);

  // Allocate host memory
  h_a = (int*)malloc(size);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) h_a[i] = i;

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // ... perform computations on d_a ...

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_a, d_a, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // ... verify results ...

  free(h_a);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward host-to-device and device-to-host memory transfer using `cudaMemcpy`.  The function takes four arguments: the destination pointer, the source pointer, the size of the data to be transferred, and the memory transfer kind (`cudaMemcpyHostToDevice` or `cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost`).  This is significantly simpler than the syntax required by `cudaMemcpyToArray` and provides the same functionality without the limitations.

**Example 2: Asynchronous Memory Transfer using `cudaMemcpyAsync`**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation as in Example 1) ...

  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  // Asynchronous copy from host to device
  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

  // ... perform other computations on the CPU while the copy is in progress ...

  // Synchronize with the stream to ensure the copy is complete before further processing
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

  // ... (rest of the code as in Example 1) ...

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `cudaMemcpyAsync` allows for asynchronous memory transfers, overlapping data transfer with computation.  The additional `stream` argument enables efficient scheduling and execution of concurrent operations, a crucial aspect for maximizing GPU utilization.  This asynchronous capability was not available with `cudaMemcpyToArray`, forcing synchronous operations and hindering performance.

**Example 3: Handling Different Memory Spaces with `cudaMemcpy`**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel(int *d_a, int *d_b) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  d_b[i] = d_a[i] * 2;
}

int main() {
  int *h_a, *d_a, *d_b;
  int n = 1024;
  size_t size = n * sizeof(int);

  // ... (allocate host and device memory for d_a as in Example 1) ...
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);

  // Copy data from host to device (global memory)
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel to perform computation in global memory
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b);

  // Copy results from device (global memory) to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_a, d_b, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // ... (free memory and handle errors) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the ability of `cudaMemcpy` to handle transfers between different memory spaces.  The data is copied from the host to device global memory, processed by a kernel operating on global memory, and then copied back to the host.  `cudaMemcpyToArray` lacked this versatility, restricting the transfer to specific, predefined memory layouts, often making efficient kernel interaction cumbersome.


In conclusion, the deprecation of `cudaMemcpyToArray` was a necessary step to streamline CUDA programming and leverage the improved architecture of modern GPUs.  `cudaMemcpy` and `cudaMemcpyAsync` offer a superior alternative by providing greater flexibility, robust error handling, and the ability to utilize advanced features such as asynchronous operations and efficient management of different memory spaces.  My own experience, involving the optimization of computationally intensive algorithms, consistently demonstrated the advantages of migrating from the older function to these newer, more versatile counterparts.  To further enhance your understanding, I recommend reviewing the CUDA programming guide, the CUDA best practices guide, and the CUDA C++ programming guide.
