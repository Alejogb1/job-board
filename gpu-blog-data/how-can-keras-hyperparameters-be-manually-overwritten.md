The core challenge in manually overriding Keras hyperparameters lies in understanding the interplay between the model's configuration during compilation and the layer-specific parameters defined within the model architecture.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for medical image analysis highlighted the necessity for granular control beyond the typical `compile()` method arguments.  Simple adjustments often proved insufficient when dealing with complex architectures or specialized training requirements.  Effective overriding necessitates a deeper engagement with the underlying TensorFlow or Theano backend, depending on your Keras installation.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, at its heart, provides a high-level API, abstracting away many lower-level details. While the `compile()` method allows for setting hyperparameters like optimizer, loss function, and metrics, it doesn't provide direct access to modifying hyperparameters embedded within individual layers.  For instance, you cannot directly alter the learning rate of a specific layer's weight updates using `compile()`. Manual overriding requires accessing and manipulating the layer's attributes directly. This is generally done after the model is built but before training commences.  It's critical to note that improperly modifying these attributes can lead to unexpected behavior or model instability, so careful consideration and validation are essential.

The most common approach involves iterating through the model's layers, identifying the target layer based on its name or index, and then modifying the relevant attributes within that layer. This involves leveraging Keras's layer-specific attributes and understanding the backend's weight update mechanisms.  For instance, adjusting the learning rate often necessitates modifying the optimizer's parameter associated with that layer (if using a layer-wise optimizer), or indirectly impacting the update through weight regularization.  Remember, changes to hyperparameters applied after the training has started can have unpredictable outcomes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Modifying the learning rate of a specific layer**

This example assumes a model where a specific layer's learning rate needs adjustment.  It leverages the optimizer's ability to assign weights if needed (e.g. in AdamW).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.AdamW(learning_rate=0.001) # Global LR

# Compile the model first for optimizer instantiation
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Access layers and modify optimizer parameters
layer_to_modify = model.layers[0]  # First dense layer. Adjust index as necessary
try:  # Attempt to access layer specific weights from the optimizer
    layer_params = optimizer.get_weights()[0]
    # Scale down learning rate for the first layer
    optimizer.set_weights([layer_params * 0.1, optimizer.get_weights()[1]])  
except: # Catch the error if optimizer doesn't support per layer weights.
    print("Warning: This optimizer does not directly support layer-specific learning rates.")


model.summary()
```


**Example 2: Adding L1 regularization to a specific layer**

This demonstrates modifying the regularization strength for a particular layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


# Access layers and modify regularization parameters
layer_to_modify = model.layers[0]
layer_to_modify.kernel_regularizer = keras.regularizers.l1(0.01)  # Add L1 regularization


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()

```

**Example 3: Changing the activation function of a specific layer**

This illustrates changing the activation function of a layer. Although not strictly a hyperparameter in the same sense as learning rate or regularization, it's a layer-specific attribute modifiable in a similar way.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Access and modify the activation function
layer_to_modify = model.layers[0]
layer_to_modify.activation = keras.activations.sigmoid

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation itself offers invaluable insights.  Supplement this with a thorough understanding of the underlying TensorFlow or Theano backend, depending on your Keras setup.  A strong grasp of  the optimizer's workings and its relationship to layer weights is crucial for successful hyperparameter manipulation.  Consult textbooks and research papers on deep learning optimization techniques for a deeper theoretical foundation.  Exploring relevant source code for various Keras optimizers can offer valuable practical insights.  Finally, rigorous testing and validation are paramount to ensure the modified model behaves as expected.  Always track your changes meticulously.



In conclusion, directly overriding Keras hyperparameters requires a more advanced understanding than simply using the `compile()` method. It necessitates familiarity with the model's architecture, layer attributes, and the underlying deep learning framework.  The examples provided illustrate several common use cases, but the specific approach will be highly dependent on your chosen model and desired modifications.  Always proceed cautiously, validate your changes thoroughly, and maintain detailed records of your modifications. My own experiences have reinforced the importance of this methodical approach in building robust and reliable deep learning models.
