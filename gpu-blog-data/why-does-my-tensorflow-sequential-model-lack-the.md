The absence of a `Dense` layer in a TensorFlow `Sequential` model almost invariably stems from an error in model definition, not a runtime issue.  My experience debugging numerous neural networks, particularly in production environments dealing with high-dimensional data, has consistently shown this to be the root cause.  The `Sequential` model's structure is explicit; a missing layer is a direct consequence of omitted code, a typographical error, or an incorrect layer instantiation.  Let's dissect the possible causes and their resolutions.

**1.  Incorrect Layer Specification:** The most frequent cause is a simple mistake in how the `Dense` layer is defined within the `Sequential` model's construction.  The `Dense` layer requires at least one parameter: the number of units (neurons).  Omitting this, using an invalid data type, or providing a non-positive integer will result in an effectively missing layer.  Furthermore, inconsistent naming conventions or accidental commenting-out of the layer definition are also common pitfalls.  Ensuring correct syntax and attentive code review are crucial.


**2.  Accidental Overwriting or Deletion:** During model development, particularly when experimenting with different architectures, it's easy to accidentally overwrite or delete a previously defined `Dense` layer. This often occurs when using version control systems without proper commit messaging or when refactoring code without meticulous attention to detail.  I've seen numerous instances where a seemingly innocuous change in one part of the code unintentionally nullified a `Dense` layer further down the architecture.

**3.  Incorrect Import Statements:** While less common, an error in import statements might lead to the model seemingly lacking a `Dense` layer. If the `tensorflow.keras.layers` module isn't properly imported, the `Dense` class won't be available, leading to a runtime error or, if the code compiles without error, a functionally incomplete model.  This often manifests as an `AttributeError` during model compilation.

**4.  Hidden Errors within Custom Layers:** If you're using custom layers in conjunction with `Dense` layers, a bug within the custom layer might prevent the `Dense` layer from functioning correctly or being included in the model's architecture.  This necessitates careful inspection of the custom layer's logic, especially the `call` method and the way it handles input and output tensors. Thorough unit testing of custom layers before integrating them into larger models is essential.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Missing `units` Parameter**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Missing units parameter
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(), # ERROR: units parameter is missing
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
])

# Correct: Specifying the number of units
model_correct = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10), # Correct: Specifies 10 units
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
])
```

This example illustrates the critical role of the `units` parameter within the `Dense` layer.  Forgetting this parameter will result in a runtime error during model compilation.  The corrected version explicitly specifies 10 units (neurons) in the `Dense` layer.  This is a common mistake stemming from oversight or a failure to adhere to the layer's API.

**Example 2:  Accidental Commenting Out**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Dense layer accidentally commented out
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    # tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),  # Commented out!
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
])

# Correct: uncommenting the Dense layer restores functionality.
model_correct = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
])
```

This demonstrates how seemingly insignificant actions, such as commenting out a line of code, can drastically affect the model architecture.  A quick review of the code is sufficient to identify and resolve such errors.  The habit of regular code cleanups to remove commented-out sections helps prevent this issue.

**Example 3: Incorrect Import**

```python
# Incorrect: Missing import statement
#model = tf.keras.Sequential([
#    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
#    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
#    tf.keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
#])

# Correct: Import the layers module
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers #explicit import

model_correct = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(10),
    layers.Activation('softmax')
])
```

This example highlights the importance of correct import statements.  The omission of the `tensorflow.keras.layers` import will prevent the `Dense` layer from being recognized, leading to a `NameError`.  The explicit import of the `layers` module ensures that the `Dense` layer is correctly recognized.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  Explore the Keras API documentation focusing specifically on the `Sequential` model and the `Dense` layer.  Consult introductory materials on neural network architectures to develop a strong foundational understanding.  Consider utilizing a debugging tool specifically designed for TensorFlow to identify potential issues within your model's architecture and runtime behavior.  Finally, engage with the TensorFlow community forums for assistance when encountering unexpected issues; many similar challenges have been documented and resolved.
