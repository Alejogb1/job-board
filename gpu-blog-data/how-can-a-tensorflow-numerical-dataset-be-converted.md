TensorFlow’s `tf.data.Dataset` API primarily handles numerical data efficiently, but many downstream machine learning tasks, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP), require text. Bridging this gap requires transforming numerical representations, which often encode IDs corresponding to words or sub-word units, back into textual sequences. The conversion process involves leveraging a vocabulary lookup, typically managed using a mapping between numerical IDs and corresponding string tokens. Having worked extensively on recommendation systems that bridge categorical data and natural language inputs, I have encountered this problem frequently.

The core issue lies in the fundamental difference between the data types TensorFlow prefers – tensors of integers or floats – and the textual data which is composed of strings. Therefore, we cannot directly pass numerical data representing word IDs to processes requiring string-based operations. The fundamental step for transforming numeric datasets representing text is to utilize a vocabulary mapping. This mapping, usually a dictionary or a lookup table implemented using TensorFlow operations, allows us to translate each integer ID back into its associated string token. Once transformed, the resulting textual data can be used as input for tasks such as text classification, generation, or language modeling.

A crucial part of the process is defining the mapping itself. Ideally, the mapping should reflect the unique tokens within the data itself. In practice, this implies a process of building the vocabulary from source text. This can involve steps like tokenization (splitting the text into individual units), removing stop words, and frequency-based pruning of very rare words. However, the question deals with converting existing numerical representations, therefore, we can assume that such a mapping already exists or is readily available. The mapping, either as a Python dictionary or TensorFlow lookup table, plays the role of the 'decoder' which is the core focus of our conversion strategy.

Let’s delve into some practical examples utilizing TensorFlow. Imagine our numerical dataset consists of sequences of integers, each representing a word from a predefined vocabulary. Let’s also assume our vocabulary is already prepared, stored as either a Python dictionary or a TensorFlow lookup table.

**Example 1: Python Dictionary Lookup**

Here, we assume the vocabulary is a simple Python dictionary where keys are integer IDs, and values are string tokens.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a tf.data.Dataset of integer sequences
data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 1], [2, 6, 7]])

# Assume 'vocab' is a dictionary representing our mapping
vocab = {
    1: "the",
    2: "quick",
    3: "brown",
    4: "fox",
    5: "jumps",
    6: "over",
    7: "lazy"
}

def lookup_fn(ids):
    return [vocab.get(int(i), '<unk>') for i in ids] # Use <unk> for missing IDs

def convert_to_text(dataset):
    return dataset.map(lambda ids: tf.py_function(func=lookup_fn, inp=[ids], Tout=tf.string))

text_dataset = convert_to_text(data)

for text_sequence in text_dataset:
    print(text_sequence.numpy().tolist())

# Output:
# [b'the', b'quick', b'brown']
# [b'fox', b'jumps', b'the']
# [b'quick', b'over', b'lazy']

```

In this first example, I use `tf.py_function` to apply the Python dictionary lookup. This function wraps our standard Python function `lookup_fn`, and executes it within a TensorFlow graph. While flexible, it might introduce performance bottlenecks compared to native TensorFlow operations, especially with larger datasets. The `<unk>` token is crucial; it is a placeholder for any integer not present within the vocabulary, ensuring our program doesn’t crash upon unseen IDs.

**Example 2: TensorFlow Lookup Table**

Here, instead of a Python dictionary, we use a TensorFlow `lookup.StaticHashTable`. This approach offers potential performance improvements by leveraging the TensorFlow graph’s optimization capabilities.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a tf.data.Dataset of integer sequences
data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 1], [2, 6, 7]])

# Assume 'vocab' is a dictionary representing our mapping
vocab = {
    1: "the",
    2: "quick",
    3: "brown",
    4: "fox",
    5: "jumps",
    6: "over",
    7: "lazy"
}


# Create a TensorFlow lookup table
keys_tensor = tf.constant(list(vocab.keys()), dtype=tf.int64)
values_tensor = tf.constant(list(vocab.values()), dtype=tf.string)
table = tf.lookup.StaticHashTable(
    tf.lookup.KeyValueTensorInitializer(keys_tensor, values_tensor),
    default_value = tf.constant("<unk>", dtype=tf.string)
)

def lookup_fn_tf(ids):
  return table.lookup(tf.cast(ids,dtype=tf.int64))

def convert_to_text_tf(dataset):
  return dataset.map(lookup_fn_tf)

text_dataset_tf = convert_to_text_tf(data)

for text_sequence in text_dataset_tf:
    print(text_sequence.numpy().tolist())

# Output:
# [b'the', b'quick', b'brown']
# [b'fox', b'jumps', b'the']
# [b'quick', b'over', b'lazy']

```

In this second example, the function `lookup_fn_tf` now directly uses the TensorFlow `table.lookup` operation, avoiding the use of `tf.py_function` which significantly enhances performance. The `default_value` argument in the table initialization takes the place of `<unk>` which is critical when missing values. I also explicitly convert `ids` from `tf.int32` to `tf.int64` to match the type of table keys. This approach is generally preferred when scalability and performance are a priority, as it allows TensorFlow to fully optimize the operation.

**Example 3: String Lookup from Vocab File**

Sometimes, the vocabulary is stored in a file, often as a `.txt` file with each line holding a single token. In this case, we can leverage the `tf.lookup.TextFileInitializer` to load the vocabulary into a lookup table. This is very common when dealing with external pretrained models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Create a dummy vocab file for the example
vocab_file = "vocab.txt"
with open(vocab_file, "w") as f:
    f.write("the\n")
    f.write("quick\n")
    f.write("brown\n")
    f.write("fox\n")
    f.write("jumps\n")
    f.write("over\n")
    f.write("lazy\n")
    f.write("<unk>\n")

# Assume 'data' is a tf.data.Dataset of integer sequences
data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 1], [2, 6, 7], [8, 2, 9]]) # Add some unknowns

# Load vocab from file. We assume <unk> is always the last element.
initializer = tf.lookup.TextFileInitializer(
    vocab_file,
    key_dtype=tf.int64,
    key_index=0,
    value_dtype=tf.string,
    value_index=0,
    delimiter='\n' # Ensure we parse line by line
)

table = tf.lookup.StaticHashTable(initializer, default_value=tf.constant("<unk>", dtype=tf.string))


def lookup_fn_file(ids):
  return table.lookup(tf.cast(ids,dtype=tf.int64))

def convert_to_text_file(dataset):
  return dataset.map(lookup_fn_file)

text_dataset_file = convert_to_text_file(data)

for text_sequence in text_dataset_file:
    print(text_sequence.numpy().tolist())

# Output:
# [b'quick', b'brown', b'fox']
# [b'jumps', b'over', b'quick']
# [b'brown', b'lazy', b'<unk>']
# [b'<unk>', b'quick', b'<unk>']

# Remove temporary vocab file
os.remove(vocab_file)

```

In this final example, we use a vocabulary stored in a text file `vocab.txt`. The `TextFileInitializer` reads the vocabulary from the file and constructs the lookup table. This approach is incredibly useful when using vocabularies produced by external tokenizers or when working with large, established vocabulary lists. This approach also shows how easily unknown tokens are handled, represented by our '<unk>' string.

When working with real-world data, one often needs to deal with padding. The examples above do not incorporate padding and may not handle sequences of varying lengths effectively. Additional consideration for padding and potentially, masking, would be required to use these techniques with sequences of unequal length when used in a machine learning pipeline. However, handling the actual conversion of IDs to text, these examples give a solid foundation and cover common use cases I have encountered.

For further study and better practices when using TensorFlow, the official TensorFlow documentation is essential. I recommend exploring the sections related to `tf.data`, `tf.lookup`, and specifically the `tf.lookup.StaticHashTable`, as well as `tf.py_function`. It's beneficial to delve into the differences between eager execution and graph execution within TensorFlow when working with these utilities. Also, any textbook or course related to NLP typically covers the topic of tokenization, which is the precursor to creating the numerical datasets described in the examples. Understanding different tokenization strategies, such as WordPiece or byte-pair encoding, will give a better understanding of how numerical representations of text are actually created. Finally, resources discussing computational graph optimization in TensorFlow, especially with respect to lookup operations, would be beneficial.
