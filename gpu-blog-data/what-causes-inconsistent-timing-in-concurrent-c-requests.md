Inconsistent timing in concurrent C# requests stems primarily from contention for shared resources, whether those are system-level resources like I/O or memory, or application-level resources like locks, semaphores, or data structures accessed by multiple threads.  My experience optimizing high-throughput trading applications has repeatedly highlighted this as the single largest source of performance variability.  Ignoring these subtleties leads to unpredictable latency and throughput degradation, especially under load.

Let's break down the contributing factors and mitigation strategies.  The key is understanding that true parallelism, where multiple threads execute simultaneously, is often an illusion in a single-core or multi-core environment with limited resources.  The operating system's scheduler plays a crucial role, interleaving thread execution to manage resources efficiently. This interleaving, while generally beneficial, introduces non-determinism.

**1.  Resource Contention:**  This is the most frequent culprit.  Consider a scenario where multiple threads concurrently access a shared database.  If the database is the bottleneck, requests will experience widely varying latencies depending on contention levels.  A high volume of simultaneous requests will increase the waiting time for each, leading to unpredictable delays.  Similarly, contention on critical sections protected by locks can lead to significant performance degradation.  A thread acquiring a lock might have to wait for an extended period if another thread holds the lock. This waiting time is not fixed and depends entirely on the timing of other threads.

**2.  Garbage Collection (GC):**  The .NET runtime's garbage collector (GC) is a crucial component, but its operation can introduce pauses.  Major GC cycles can temporarily suspend all or parts of the application, impacting the execution of concurrent requests.  The duration of these pauses is not predictable, as it depends on memory allocation patterns and the heap size.  This unpredictability manifests as inconsistent timing in concurrent requests.  Long-running requests are particularly vulnerable because they are more likely to be interrupted by a GC cycle.

**3.  Thread Pool Limitations:**  The .NET ThreadPool, while convenient, is not infinitely scalable.  If a large number of requests arrive concurrently, they may have to queue up, waiting for available threads in the pool.  The time spent waiting can fluctuate dramatically based on the existing load and the ThreadPool's configuration.  An inadequately sized thread pool can lead to a backlog of requests and hence inconsistent response times.

**4.  I/O Bound Operations:**  Requests involving external resources (databases, network calls, file systems) are naturally subject to variable latencies.  Network latency, disk seek times, and database query performance fluctuate. These external factors introduce inconsistencies into the overall request processing time that are outside the direct control of the application.

**5.  Context Switching Overhead:**  The operating system's scheduler frequently switches between threads.  This context switching incurs overhead, adding a small but cumulative delay to the execution of concurrent requests.  While generally small, this overhead can become significant under high contention scenarios, contributing to inconsistent timing.

Now, let's illustrate these issues with code examples:

**Example 1: Contention on a Shared Resource**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class SharedResourceContention
{
    private static int _sharedCounter = 0;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(() => IncrementCounter()));
        }
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Final counter value: {_sharedCounter}"); //Unpredictable final value due to race conditions
    }

    private static void IncrementCounter()
    {
        lock (_lock) //mitigates race conditions, but introduces potential blocking
        {
            _sharedCounter++;
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates contention on `_sharedCounter`. Without the lock, race conditions would lead to inconsistent results. The lock mitigates the race condition but introduces blocking, leading to inconsistent timing if multiple threads frequently contend for the lock.

**Example 2:  Impact of Garbage Collection**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class GCImpact
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(LongRunningTask));
        }
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    }

    private static void LongRunningTask()
    {
        // Simulate a long-running task that allocates significant memory
        byte[] largeArray = new byte[1024 * 1024 * 10]; // 10MB array
        Thread.Sleep(1000); // Simulate some work
    }
}
```

This code creates multiple long-running tasks that allocate considerable memory.  The execution time of these tasks will be significantly affected by GC cycles, resulting in inconsistent completion times.  The unpredictability of GC pauses introduces variability.

**Example 3:  ThreadPool Limitations**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ThreadPoolLimitations
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) //increase number of tasks to overload ThreadPool
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(() => { Thread.Sleep(100); }));
        }
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    }
}
```

This example initiates a large number of tasks. If the ThreadPool size is not adequately configured, tasks will queue up, resulting in unpredictable delays.  Timing inconsistencies arise from the queuing and scheduling of tasks within the ThreadPool.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of concurrent programming in C#, I recommend exploring the official Microsoft documentation on threading, the ThreadPool, and the garbage collector.  Furthermore, a strong grasp of operating system concepts relating to process and thread scheduling is crucial.  Finally, profiling tools specifically designed for .NET applications are invaluable for diagnosing performance bottlenecks and identifying contention points.  Careful analysis of these profiles often reveals the root cause of inconsistent timing in concurrent requests.
