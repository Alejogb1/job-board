An LSTM model consistently predicting the same class, often the majority class in the training data, suggests a breakdown in its learning process, indicating an inability to adequately capture the nuances in the input sequences and effectively discriminate between different classes. This issue commonly stems from a convergence toward local minima in the loss function, an overemphasis on the most prominent class during optimization, or inadequate model complexity relative to the underlying data characteristics.

My experience developing time series prediction models for sensor data has frequently encountered this exact scenario. In one particular project focusing on equipment failure prediction, initial LSTM implementations consistently predicted 'no failure,' despite clear indications in the data of impending system malfunctions. The reasons for such behavior, as I came to understand them, are multifactorial and require a systematic approach to identification and correction.

Firstly, a lack of sufficient model complexity can lead to underfitting. If the model's recurrent connections are too few or the hidden layers are too small, the LSTM will struggle to learn the complex relationships between input sequences and output classes. The network effectively becomes too simplistic to distinguish nuanced patterns, thus converging to the simplest prediction: the majority class. This often manifests as a rapidly decreasing training loss during initial epochs, which then plateaus at a relatively high error level, without any corresponding improvement in validation performance. It signifies that the model's capacity isn't sufficient to capture the data's information.

Secondly, the training process itself can be problematic. Highly imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outweighs others, can lead to the network focusing heavily on the dominant class. The optimization algorithm, striving to minimize overall loss, prioritizes learning the patterns associated with the abundant class, potentially overlooking the complexities that distinguish minority classes. Even with techniques like class weighting during training, an inappropriate learning rate or insufficient training data can contribute to this issue. The loss function may be minimizing by simply learning to always predict the majority case.

Thirdly, vanishing or exploding gradients, especially with deep or long-sequence LSTMs, can hinder proper learning. The gradient signal, used to update the network's weights, can diminish as it propagates back through the unrolled network, resulting in minimal weight adjustments and a slowdown in learning. This often manifests as an inability for the model to progress beyond its initial state. Likewise, exploding gradients can destabilize the training process. Both these phenomena can contribute to a model that is unable to leave its initial bias toward the prevalent class.

Let's consider a series of illustrative code examples (in Python using Keras/Tensorflow) and discuss potential fixes:

**Code Example 1: Basic LSTM with Insufficient Complexity**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Activation
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate Dummy Data (Highly Imbalanced)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 20, 5)  # 1000 sequences, 20 timesteps, 5 features
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000, p=[0.8, 0.2]) # 80% class 0, 20% class 1
y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)  # One-hot encode labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Basic LSTM Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(10, input_shape=(20, 5)))  # Small hidden layer size
model.add(Dense(2))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1, verbose=0)

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This initial example represents a very basic LSTM model with a small hidden state size. With imbalanced classes in the dummy dataset, this small network converges to predicting class 0 for most inputs, leading to an accuracy likely only mirroring the prevalence of the majority class in test data. The output accuracy, while it might appear superficially acceptable, does not reflect true learning of class distinctions.

**Code Example 2: Addressing Imbalance and Increasing Model Complexity**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Activation, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.utils import class_weight

# Generate Dummy Data (Highly Imbalanced)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 20, 5)  # 1000 sequences, 20 timesteps, 5 features
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000, p=[0.8, 0.2])  # 80% class 0, 20% class 1
y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)  # One-hot encode labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Calculate Class Weights
class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(np.argmax(y_train, axis=1)), y=np.argmax(y_train, axis=1))
class_weights_dict = dict(enumerate(class_weights))

# Modified LSTM Model with Class Weights and Increased Complexity
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(20, 5), return_sequences=True)) # Larger LSTM layers
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(32))
model.add(Dense(2))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1, verbose=0, class_weight=class_weights_dict)

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Here, I've increased the LSTM hidden unit counts, introduced multiple recurrent layers, and included a dropout layer to improve generalization and mitigate overfitting. Crucially, I’ve incorporated class weights to balance the loss function, forcing the network to pay more attention to the minority class during training. This often leads to a noticeable improvement in the prediction of the less common class, and a more reliable accuracy value.

**Code Example 3: Monitoring and Adjusting Learning Rate**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Activation, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.utils import class_weight
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau

# Generate Dummy Data (Highly Imbalanced)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 20, 5)  # 1000 sequences, 20 timesteps, 5 features
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000, p=[0.8, 0.2])  # 80% class 0, 20% class 1
y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)  # One-hot encode labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Calculate Class Weights
class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(np.argmax(y_train, axis=1)), y=np.argmax(y_train, axis=1))
class_weights_dict = dict(enumerate(class_weights))

# Modified LSTM Model with Dynamic Learning Rate
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(20, 5), return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(32))
model.add(Dense(2))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])

# Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2, patience=3, min_lr=0.00001)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1, verbose=0, class_weight=class_weights_dict, callbacks=[reduce_lr])

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This third example adds a learning rate scheduler via the `ReduceLROnPlateau` callback. This dynamically adjusts the learning rate when validation loss plateaus, allowing the network to escape local minima and potentially continue learning. It’s crucial to observe the training and validation curves for signs of stagnation, and adjust the scheduler parameters accordingly.

In conclusion, resolving an LSTM consistently predicting the same class requires a careful investigation of several factors. One must consider: model complexity (hidden layer sizes, number of layers), training data distribution (class imbalance), optimization parameters (learning rate), and even potential vanishing or exploding gradient issues. A systematic, iterative process involving modifying model architecture, incorporating class weighting, and adjusting training strategies (e.g., through learning rate schedulers), is necessary to build a model with a functional discriminative capability.

For further study, I would suggest consulting literature focusing on recurrent neural networks, especially on gradient propagation, and publications addressing imbalanced classification problems. Textbooks and online courses dedicated to deep learning using Keras/Tensorflow offer foundational concepts and practical code examples, while specialized papers on handling time series data would provide invaluable insights in refining your LSTM-based models.
