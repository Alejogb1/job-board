The unchanging prediction from your CNN+LSTM model likely stems from a vanishing or exploding gradient problem, compounded by insufficient data augmentation or an overly simplistic model architecture.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on time-series anomaly detection, specifically with sensor data exhibiting subtle temporal dependencies. The core issue is the inability of the backpropagation algorithm to effectively update the weights of earlier layers, especially in deep architectures like CNN+LSTMs. This leads to ineffective learning, resulting in stagnant predictions.

**1. Explanation:**

The CNN+LSTM architecture is designed to leverage the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). CNNs excel at extracting spatial features from input data, while LSTMs are adept at capturing long-range temporal dependencies.  In the context of your problem, the CNN likely processes individual time steps (or windows of time steps) to extract relevant features, which are then fed sequentially into the LSTM to model the temporal dynamics.

If the predictions remain unchanged, several factors could be at play.  Firstly, the vanishing gradient problem is a classic culprit.  During backpropagation, the gradients used to update the weights of the network can become increasingly small as they propagate through many layers.  This is particularly problematic in recurrent networks like LSTMs, and is exacerbated when combined with a CNN. The result is that the earlier layers of the network receive negligible updates, effectively freezing their weights.  This renders the network incapable of learning intricate patterns from the input data.  Conversely, an exploding gradient problem involves exponentially growing gradients, leading to numerical instability and similarly ineffective weight updates.

Secondly, inadequate data augmentation can significantly impact performance.  Time-series data often exhibits subtle variations and noise.  Without sufficient augmentation techniques, the model may overfit to the training data, leading to poor generalization and unchanging predictions on unseen data.  Common augmentation techniques for time-series include random shifting, scaling, and adding noise, but the specific approach depends heavily on the nature of your data.

Thirdly, the model architecture itself may be too simplistic for the complexity of the task.  The number of layers, the number of filters in the CNN, and the number of LSTM units significantly impact the model's capacity. If the model lacks the capacity to capture the underlying patterns in your data, it will naturally fail to learn effectively, resulting in unchanged predictions.  Hyperparameter tuning (number of layers, units, filters, etc.) is crucial.  Furthermore, the choice of activation functions and the optimization algorithm are equally critical factors.

Finally, regularization techniques are crucial.  Without proper regularization (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization), the model may easily overfit to the training data, producing unchanging and inaccurate predictions on unseen data.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples are illustrative; the specific implementation will depend on your chosen framework (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.).  I will present examples using Keras, as I found it to be the most straightforward for this type of architecture in my past projects.

**Example 1:  A Basic CNN+LSTM Model (Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
model.add(LSTM(128, activation='tanh'))
model.add(Dense(1)) # Assuming a single output value

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

*Commentary:* This is a basic architecture.  The input shape needs to be adjusted based on your data (`timesteps`, `features`).  The `mse` loss function is suitable for regression tasks.  Experiment with different optimizers (e.g., RMSprop, SGD with momentum).  The number of filters (64) and LSTM units (128) are arbitrary; these require careful tuning.


**Example 2: Incorporating Dropout for Regularization (Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, LSTM, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
model.add(Dropout(0.2)) #Adding Dropout for regularization
model.add(LSTM(128, activation='tanh', return_sequences=True)) #return_sequences=True if adding more LSTM layers
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(64, activation='tanh'))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

*Commentary:* This example includes dropout layers to help prevent overfitting. The `return_sequences=True` is crucial if you are stacking LSTM layers. Experiment with different dropout rates (e.g., 0.1, 0.3).


**Example 3: Data Augmentation (Conceptual):**

```python
import numpy as np

def augment_timeseries(data, noise_level=0.01, shift_max=2):
    augmented_data = []
    for sample in data:
        noisy_sample = sample + np.random.normal(0, noise_level, sample.shape)
        shifted_sample = np.roll(noisy_sample, np.random.randint(-shift_max, shift_max+1), axis=0)
        augmented_data.append(shifted_sample)
    return np.array(augmented_data)

#Example usage:
X_train_augmented = augment_timeseries(X_train)
```

*Commentary:*  This demonstrates a simple augmentation technique involving adding Gaussian noise and randomly shifting the time series.  More sophisticated techniques (e.g., using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for time series generation) exist and may be necessary depending on data characteristics.  Apply these augmentation techniques carefully to avoid introducing artifacts that might harm model performance.  Always validate augmented data against original data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet
*   "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron
*   Research papers on time series analysis and recurrent neural networks.  Pay close attention to papers focusing on gradient issues in RNNs.  Focus on papers discussing LSTM variants designed to address vanishing gradients.
*   Consider exploring the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework extensively.  The official tutorials and examples are invaluable resources.


By meticulously examining your data, architecture, and training process, while employing appropriate data augmentation and regularization techniques, you should be able to address the issue of unchanging predictions. Remember to systematically analyze the effects of each modification you make, ensuring each step improves your model's performance.  Remember to track and log every hyperparameter choice and result.  This diligent approach is key to debugging deep learning models effectively.
