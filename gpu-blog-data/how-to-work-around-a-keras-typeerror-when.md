A common stumbling block when working with custom recurrent layers in Keras arises from inconsistencies in expected input shapes when interfacing with the underlying TensorFlow backend. Specifically, the `TypeError` often linked to `tf.keras.backend.rnn_1` typically indicates that the state tensors provided during the execution of a recurrent layer's cell function do not match the expected signature, particularly when using custom state management. From my experience debugging models involving complex sequence processing, this is often encountered when attempting to manipulate hidden states directly, especially when they are meant to be sequences themselves.

The root of this `TypeError` lies in the fundamental mechanics of Keras' `RNN` layer and its interaction with TensorFlow's internal loop unrolling machinery. When you define an `RNN` layer, Keras internally uses a function like `tf.keras.backend.rnn` to iterate over the timesteps of your input sequence. This function expects a specific function signature for its `cell`, which must accept an input tensor of shape `(batch_size, input_features)` for the current timestep, and a state tensor, which can be a single tensor or a list of tensors, representing the hidden state(s) of the RNN. Crucially, these state tensors must match the return values of the `cell` for the previous timestep, and these return values are usually generated during the call to `cell` at the first step. The `TypeError` arises when the initial state provided or the states generated by the cell function do not have the shape, type, or nesting expected by `tf.keras.backend.rnn`.

I've found that several reasons contribute to this mismatch. Most frequently, it's due to manual manipulation of state tensors within a custom recurrent cell without a corresponding update to the `get_initial_state` function which should define them correctly, or due to incorrect state initialization that does not match the state shape returned by `call()`. Another common pitfall is when a custom recurrent cell returns a different number of state tensors than what was provided initially or when the types of tensors are mismatched. For instance, if you expect a list of two tensors and the cell only returns one, or if the cell expects `float32` and it gets `float64`.

To effectively resolve this, meticulous attention to the shapes and datatypes of both the input tensors and the state tensors is necessary. Additionally, defining clear initial states through `get_initial_state` and ensuring these match the output of your call method is critical. The `call` method's output has the expected structure in most instances, but in cases of manual state manipulation, careful attention is required to keep the type and dimension of states and outputs consistent.

Here are three illustrative examples based on common situations I've encountered, each demonstrating a specific cause and its solution:

**Example 1: Mismatched State Initialization**

This example shows a scenario where the initial state dimensions don't match the returned state dimensions in the cell, resulting in a `TypeError`. The cell attempts to use states which have an additional dimension, which was not present in the initial states.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class IncorrectStateRNNCell(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state = states[0]
        output = self.dense(tf.concat([inputs, prev_state], axis=-1))
        # Incorrect: adding an extra dimension
        new_state = tf.expand_dims(output, axis=-1)
        return output, [new_state]


    def get_initial_state(self, inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None):
        #Incorrect: No extra dimension here.
        return [tf.zeros((batch_size, self.units), dtype=dtype)]


units = 32
cell = IncorrectStateRNNCell(units=units)

rnn = layers.RNN(cell, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 16))

try:
    outputs, final_state = rnn(inputs)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Caught TypeError: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** In this example, the `get_initial_state` method generates an initial state tensor of shape `(batch_size, units)`, whereas the `call` method expands the output to `(batch_size, units, 1)` and then returns the state. This dimensional mismatch causes the `TypeError` during backpropagation since the backend `rnn` method cannot reconcile the differing shapes, due to the inconsistency.

The resolution is to ensure that `get_initial_state` returns a state of the exact shape that the cell also returns for its states, i.e. `(batch_size, self.units, 1)`.

**Example 2: Corrected State Initialization**

This example addresses the issue from Example 1 by ensuring that the initial state and the state returned by the cell have matching shapes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class CorrectedStateRNNCell(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state = states[0]
        output = self.dense(tf.concat([inputs, prev_state], axis=-1))
        #Correct: returning a state of the same shape as the init state.
        new_state = tf.expand_dims(output, axis=-1)
        return output, [new_state]

    def get_initial_state(self, inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None):
        #Correct: Adding the extra dimension, like the call method.
        return [tf.zeros((batch_size, self.units, 1), dtype=dtype)]


units = 32
cell = CorrectedStateRNNCell(units=units)

rnn = layers.RNN(cell, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 16))

outputs, final_state = rnn(inputs) # no error.
print(f"Outputs shape: {outputs.shape}")
print(f"Final state shape: {[s.shape for s in final_state]}")
```

**Commentary:** Here, the `get_initial_state` function is modified to include the expansion of the output to the same shape. This ensures that the state returned by `get_initial_state` has the shape `(batch_size, units, 1)`, matching the shape of the state produced by the cell's `call` function. Therefore, the `RNN` layer is able to perform the unrolling operations as expected.

**Example 3: Type Mismatch in Returned States**

This example demonstrates that it is not just the dimensions which must match, but also the types of the tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class TypeMismatchRNNCell(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state = states[0]
        output = self.dense(tf.concat([inputs, prev_state], axis=-1))
        #Incorrect: converting output to integer dtype
        new_state = tf.cast(tf.expand_dims(output, axis=-1), tf.int32)

        return output, [new_state]

    def get_initial_state(self, inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None):
        return [tf.zeros((batch_size, self.units, 1), dtype=dtype)]


units = 32
cell = TypeMismatchRNNCell(units=units)

rnn = layers.RNN(cell, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 16))
try:
    outputs, final_state = rnn(inputs)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Caught TypeError: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** In this final example, the `call` function modifies the tensor's type before passing it as a state, while the initial state was of the default float type. This causes a type mismatch error, since `tf.keras.backend.rnn` expects that the state generated during the loop will be of the same type as the initialized one. The solution is either to cast the states in the `get_initial_state` to match the `call` output or vice versa.

For further learning and a deeper understanding of how Keras handles recurrent layers and their interaction with the TensorFlow backend, I would recommend studying the Keras API documentation, specifically concerning the `RNN` layer and `keras.backend` modules. Reviewing the TensorFlow source code for `tf.keras.backend.rnn` can be insightful, albeit complex. Experimenting with small, custom recurrent cells and meticulously tracing the tensor shapes and data types during forward propagation provides a practical way to develop an intuition. Finally, studying well-established examples of customized recurrent cells can prove useful in grasping the common patterns and best practices.
