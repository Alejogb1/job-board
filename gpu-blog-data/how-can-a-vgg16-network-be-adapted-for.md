The inherent architecture of VGG16, designed for single image classification, presents a challenge when dealing with multiple input images concurrently. To adapt it effectively, the core adjustment involves modifying the initial convolutional layers to accept concatenated input channels, rather than the typical three RGB channels.

The original VGG16 network expects a single image with dimensions of (224, 224, 3). This implies that the first convolutional layer performs convolution operations across the input tensor, utilizing a filter bank that understands the structure of red, green, and blue color information. When we have multiple images, say *n*, we don't want to treat them independently and feed them into the network one at a time. This is inefficient as it doesn't leverage potential inter-image relationships. Instead, we want to feed all *n* images simultaneously to allow the network to learn spatial features across them. This involves stacking these images along the channel dimension, creating an input with dimensions (224, 224, 3*n).

The critical adjustment occurs at the first layer, requiring us to re-initialize its weights or train it from scratch with the modified input channels. Subsequent layers can often remain unchanged, depending on the nature of the task and the desired level of feature fusion. The first convolutional layer will now be convolving across a significantly larger number of input channels, and these weights have to be adjusted. The network learns in later layers the relationships between features present in this larger initial representation. This is essential because if the input does not match the model, the network will not function.

When implementing this, I’ve found three approaches to be effective depending on the application. The first involves modifying only the initial convolutional layer's weights to accept the increased number of channels. The second involves utilizing a separate embedding network to transform individual images into feature vectors before stacking them. The third uses a Siamese architecture, wherein a single VGG16 (or a variant) is used as the feature extractor for each image before comparing or concatenating outputs.

Here’s an illustration of the first approach using Python and a common deep learning library. The core idea is to modify `conv1_1` in the model architecture to accept more channels, then initialize weights with averaging. This assumes that you're passing in `n` images that all have RGB channels.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models
import copy

def adapt_vgg16_multichannel(num_images):
    """
    Adapts a VGG16 model to accept multiple images as input by modifying the
    first convolutional layer.

    Args:
      num_images: The number of input images.

    Returns:
      Modified VGG16 model.
    """

    vgg16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
    original_first_conv = vgg16.features[0]

    # Calculate the number of channels
    new_in_channels = 3 * num_images

    # Create a new conv layer with the modified input channels
    new_first_conv = nn.Conv2d(new_in_channels, original_first_conv.out_channels,
                               kernel_size=original_first_conv.kernel_size,
                               stride=original_first_conv.stride,
                               padding=original_first_conv.padding)

    # Copy weights from the original first layer (averaged)
    with torch.no_grad():
        original_weights = original_first_conv.weight
        new_weights = original_weights.repeat(1, num_images, 1, 1) / num_images
        new_first_conv.weight = nn.Parameter(new_weights)
        new_first_conv.bias = original_first_conv.bias
    
    # Update the model's first layer
    vgg16.features[0] = new_first_conv
    return vgg16

# Example
num_images = 4
adapted_model = adapt_vgg16_multichannel(num_images)
print(f"Adapted VGG16, input channels: {adapted_model.features[0].in_channels}")

# Test with a tensor matching number of channels
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3*num_images, 224, 224)
output = adapted_model(input_tensor)
print(f"Shape of output of first convolution layer is {output.shape}")

```
In this code snippet, we load a pre-trained VGG16 model, isolate its first convolutional layer, construct a new convolutional layer with adjusted input channels equal to the original 3 multiplied by the desired `num_images`. Crucially, the weights of the new convolutional layer are initialized by averaging the weights of the original conv layer to provide a reasonable initialization. We then replace the first layer in the original model with the modified version. This enables the model to process the concatenated input. The test at the end confirms that the input matches the model and that it outputs a tensor.

The second approach involves pre-processing each input image with an independent embedding network before concatenating the generated feature vectors. In practice, I have used another smaller convolutional network for this, but here I demonstrate with a simplified case where each image is passed through a dense layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class ImageEmbeddingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(224*224*3, embedding_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.flatten(x)
        return self.fc(x)


class MultiImageVGG16(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_images, embedding_dim):
      super().__init__()
      self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
      self.num_images = num_images
      self.image_embedder = ImageEmbeddingNetwork(embedding_dim)
      self.vgg16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
      self.vgg16.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 1000)


    def forward(self, image_batch):

      embedded_features = []
      for image in image_batch.split(1, dim=1):
        image = image.squeeze(1)
        features = self.image_embedder(image)
        embedded_features.append(features)

      # Stack along batch
      embedded_features_tensor = torch.stack(embedded_features, dim=1)
      embedded_features_tensor = embedded_features_tensor.view(-1, self.num_images * self.embedding_dim)

      # Pass through the rest of vgg
      x = self.vgg16.features(torch.zeros(image_batch.shape[0], 3, 224, 224, device = image_batch.device))
      x = self.vgg16.avgpool(x)
      x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
      x = self.vgg16.classifier[:5](x)
      output = self.vgg16.classifier[5](torch.cat((x, embedded_features_tensor), dim = 1))
      return output

# Example
num_images = 4
embedding_dim = 128

model = MultiImageVGG16(num_images, embedding_dim)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, num_images, 3, 224, 224)
output = model(input_tensor)

print(f"Shape of output after passing through network {output.shape}")

```
Here, the `ImageEmbeddingNetwork` module takes individual images and outputs feature vectors of a specified dimension. Then, `MultiImageVGG16` processes each image in the input batch through this embedding network, concatenates the outputs, and subsequently feeds the concatenated feature vector through the latter layers of the pre-trained VGG16. The feature map resulting from the convolutions is flattened and combined with the embedded feature vector from the images. The final classifier is modified to accept the additional input dimension. This approach offers flexibility in controlling the feature fusion method. The dummy zero tensor is used as an input to the convolutional layers of the VGG16 architecture, to generate feature maps. These feature maps are later concatenated with the embeddings.

Finally, a Siamese network involves using a shared VGG16 architecture to independently extract features from each image. The key difference from the previous method is that we are using the VGG16's convolutional layer outputs to make the comparison.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class SiameseVGG16(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.vgg16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
        self.vgg16.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 1000)

    def forward_single(self, x):
      x = self.vgg16.features(x)
      x = self.vgg16.avgpool(x)
      x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
      x = self.vgg16.classifier(x)
      return x

    def forward(self, image_batch):
        
        embedded_features = []
        for image in image_batch.split(1, dim=1):
          image = image.squeeze(1)
          features = self.forward_single(image)
          embedded_features.append(features)
        
        # Stack along batch
        embedded_features_tensor = torch.stack(embedded_features, dim=1)
        return embedded_features_tensor

# Example
model = SiameseVGG16()
num_images = 4
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, num_images, 3, 224, 224)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Shape of output tensor of the siamese VGG16 output: {output.shape}")
```

In the Siamese configuration, a single VGG16 network is used to process each image, and the features are extracted by the `forward_single` function. These features are then stacked along the batch and returned by `forward` function. The output, therefore, is a tensor containing the image features, which can be used for comparison or further processing in downstream tasks. This approach is useful when the goal is to compare the features of the individual images.

These three methods provide different ways to adapt VGG16. The first modifies the initial convolutional layer weights to accommodate the additional input channels. The second introduces an embedding network before the VGG16 features are used. The third leverages a Siamese approach where the images are passed through the same VGG16 model individually. All approaches allow multiple image inputs to be processed through a modified version of the VGG16 model.

For further exploration, resources focusing on transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, and PyTorch documentation would be beneficial. Books on deep learning would provide a more in-depth analysis. Articles on specific architectures such as Siamese networks or image embedding techniques can provide theoretical grounding for specific adaptation strategies.
