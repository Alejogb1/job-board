The discrepancy between samples generated by `np.random.multivariate_normal` and the specified covariance matrix often stems from a misunderstanding of the numerical limitations inherent in floating-point arithmetic and the underlying algorithms used for random number generation.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale Bayesian inference projects highlights the subtle ways these limitations manifest.  The covariance matrix, being a representation of pairwise relationships between variables, can contain very small or very large values, leading to numerical instability during the Cholesky decomposition – a crucial step in the sampling process.  This instability can, in turn, produce samples whose covariance deviates perceptibly from the intended matrix.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`np.random.multivariate_normal` employs a Cholesky decomposition to generate samples efficiently.  The Cholesky decomposition factors a positive semi-definite matrix (like a covariance matrix) into a lower triangular matrix, L, such that  L * L<sup>T</sup> = Σ, where Σ represents the covariance matrix. The algorithm then generates samples from a standard multivariate normal distribution and applies the transformation x = μ + L * z, where μ is the mean vector and z is the vector of standard normal samples.  However, the Cholesky decomposition is numerically sensitive. If the covariance matrix is ill-conditioned (i.e., has a very high condition number), the decomposition can be inaccurate, leading to samples that don't precisely reflect the original covariance structure.  This inaccuracy is particularly pronounced when dealing with matrices possessing a large dynamic range in their eigenvalues, reflecting substantial differences in the scales of variance across dimensions.

Another contributing factor is the inherent randomness of the sampling process itself.  While the *expected* covariance of the generated samples should match the input covariance matrix, a finite number of samples will always exhibit some degree of sampling error.  This error becomes more significant with smaller sample sizes and can be exacerbated by the numerical inaccuracies introduced during the Cholesky decomposition.

Finally, the precision of the floating-point numbers used in the computation plays a role.  Floating-point arithmetic is not exact; rounding errors accumulate during matrix operations and can lead to noticeable deviations, especially when dealing with matrices having elements spanning a wide range of magnitudes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Illustrating the effect of ill-conditioning:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Ill-conditioned covariance matrix
cov = np.array([[1e10, 1], [1, 1]])
mean = np.array([0, 0])

# Generate samples
samples = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=10000)

# Compute sample covariance
sample_cov = np.cov(samples, rowvar=False)

# Compare with original covariance
print("Original Covariance:\n", cov)
print("\nSample Covariance:\n", sample_cov)
print("\nDifference:\n", cov - sample_cov)
```

This example uses a covariance matrix with a very large dynamic range. The resulting sample covariance will likely deviate significantly from the original, highlighting the impact of ill-conditioning on the sampling process.  The difference is particularly noticeable in the off-diagonal elements where the smaller values are disproportionately impacted by numerical errors.


**Example 2: Impact of sample size:**

```python
import numpy as np

cov = np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])
mean = np.array([0, 0])

# Sample sizes to compare
sample_sizes = [100, 1000, 10000]

for size in sample_sizes:
    samples = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=size)
    sample_cov = np.cov(samples, rowvar=False)
    print(f"\nSample size: {size}")
    print("Sample Covariance:\n", sample_cov)
    print("\nDifference:\n", cov - sample_cov)
```

This code demonstrates how the difference between the original and sample covariance decreases as the sample size increases.  With a sufficiently large sample size, the law of large numbers ensures a closer approximation, but the numerical errors from the Cholesky decomposition remain.


**Example 3:  Addressing Ill-Conditioning using Eigenvalue Decomposition:**

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import eig

cov = np.array([[1e10, 1], [1, 1]])
mean = np.array([0, 0])

# Eigenvalue decomposition
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eig(cov)

#Regularize eigenvalues to mitigate numerical issues (a simple approach)
eigenvalues = np.maximum(eigenvalues, 1e-6) # prevent near-zero eigenvalues

#Reconstruct the covariance matrix
regularized_cov = (eigenvectors @ np.diag(eigenvalues) @ eigenvectors.T).real


samples = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, regularized_cov, size=10000)
sample_cov = np.cov(samples, rowvar=False)

print("Original Covariance:\n", cov)
print("\nRegularized Covariance:\n", regularized_cov)
print("\nSample Covariance:\n", sample_cov)
print("\nDifference:\n", regularized_cov - sample_cov)

```

This example employs eigenvalue decomposition to identify and potentially mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning by adjusting near-zero eigenvalues.  While not a perfect solution, it illustrates one technique to improve numerical stability, particularly when dealing with highly correlated or nearly singular covariance matrices. This technique involves reconstructing the covariance matrix after modification of the eigenvalues.  More sophisticated regularization methods exist, but this provides a basic illustration.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Numerical Linear Algebra textbooks focusing on matrix decompositions and their numerical properties.
*  Documentation for the NumPy library, particularly sections detailing the `np.random.multivariate_normal` function and related linear algebra functions.
*  Statistical computing textbooks emphasizing the practical aspects of multivariate analysis and Monte Carlo methods.  These often discuss the limitations of floating-point arithmetic in the context of statistical computation.  Careful examination of the theoretical underpinnings of multivariate normal distribution sampling is also highly recommended.
