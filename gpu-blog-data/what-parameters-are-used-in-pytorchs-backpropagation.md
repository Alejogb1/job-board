Backpropagation in PyTorch, fundamentally, doesn't take explicit parameters in the way a function like `torch.add()` does. Instead, its operation is implicitly controlled through a network of interconnected tensors, gradients, and the computational graph. I've spent a significant amount of time debugging intricate models and optimizing performance, and understanding this subtle architecture is crucial for effective PyTorch usage. The key to understanding backpropagation isn't about *passing parameters to it*, but rather, recognizing the elements that dictate *how* it calculates and propagates gradients. Specifically, backpropagation is governed by the *internal state* of tensors that have been involved in computations within the computational graph, not by direct external parameters.

The core concept revolves around the `requires_grad` flag of a tensor. When a tensor is created with `requires_grad=True`, or this flag is subsequently set to `True` after creation, PyTorch begins tracking operations performed on it. This effectively adds the tensor, and the operations it undergoes, to the computational graph. This graph is a directed acyclic graph that represents the entire sequence of tensor manipulations. Each node in the graph represents an operation and the edges represent the flow of tensors between those operations. Crucially, each tensor involved in a computation where at least one input tensor has `requires_grad=True` also has a `grad` attribute where the gradient is stored after backpropagation.

Backpropagation, initiated by the `loss.backward()` call, calculates the derivative of the loss with respect to each tensor in the computational graph that has `requires_grad=True`. The derivative calculation is done using the chain rule, starting from the loss node and recursively moving backwards through the graph towards the input tensors. These gradients are accumulated in the `grad` attributes of the relevant tensors; thus, there is an *implicit* input to backpropagation, which is the collection of tensors involved in the forward pass with `requires_grad=True`, alongside the established computational graph.

The optimization algorithms, which are invoked *after* backpropagation, utilize these accumulated gradients to update the parameters of the model. The optimizers, such as `torch.optim.Adam` or `torch.optim.SGD`, are indeed functions that do take parameters (for example, learning rate, momentum), but these are not parameters of backpropagation; rather, they operate *on the results* of backpropagation.

Let's examine this with code examples:

**Example 1: A Simple Linear Regression Model**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple linear regression model
class LinearRegression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(LinearRegression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Create dummy data
X = torch.randn(100, 1, requires_grad=True)  # Notice requires_grad=True for the inputs
y = 2 * X + 1 + torch.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression(1, 1)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad() # Clear the gradients of all optimized variables
    loss.backward()      # Perform backpropagation implicitly
    optimizer.step()      # Updates model parameters based on backpropagation results

    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')


print("\nFinal parameters after training:")
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.requires_grad:
       print(f"{name}: {param.data.item():.4f}")

```

In this example, `loss.backward()` initiates the backpropagation process. There are no specific parameters passed directly to `backward()`.  Instead, the gradients are computed with respect to the trainable parameters within the model (the weights and biases in `nn.Linear`) and with respect to the input `X` as it has `requires_grad=True`. The `optimizer.step()` updates the model's internal parameters using the calculated gradients. The key to backpropagation here is that the parameters involved in the forward pass, particularly those with `requires_grad=True`, alongside the model structure define how the gradient computation takes place.

**Example 2: Visualizing the Computation Graph**

```python
import torch

# Create tensors with requires_grad=True
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True)

# Perform computations
z = x * y
w = z + x

# Calculate the gradient
w.backward()

# Inspect the gradients
print(f"Gradient of x: {x.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of y: {y.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of z: {z.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of w: {w.grad}") # Implicit gradient of w itself

# Check if leaf nodes (x,y) have stored gradients
print(f"\nis_leaf for x: {x.is_leaf}")
print(f"is_leaf for y: {y.is_leaf}")
print(f"is_leaf for z: {z.is_leaf}")
print(f"is_leaf for w: {w.is_leaf}")


```

Here, the tensors `x` and `y` have `requires_grad=True`. The subsequent operations construct the computation graph, and `w.backward()` triggers backpropagation. We see that gradients are accumulated in `x.grad`, `y.grad`, `z.grad` and the *implicit gradient* of `w` (which isn't stored as a gradient attribute but in the `grad_fn` of `w` and is used to continue the backpropagation process). `x` and `y` are leaf nodes, meaning they were created by user and not as result of other operation (eg: `z=x*y` is not a leaf node because is created from the multiplication operation). Although z doesn't have `grad` attribute, this value can be used in further gradient computations, as it is part of the internal representation of the computation graph. This example clarifies that the tensors involved, and their `requires_grad` status implicitly control the backpropagation behavior.

**Example 3: Gradient Accumulation**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True)
z = x * y

# First backward pass
z.backward()
print(f"Gradient of x after 1st backward: {x.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of y after 1st backward: {y.grad}")

# Second backward pass
z = x * y  #Recreate the node as z is now detached from computational graph after the first backward.
z.backward()  #Note that in most practical case, backward() is called on the loss.
print(f"Gradient of x after 2nd backward: {x.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of y after 2nd backward: {y.grad}")

# Manually zero the gradient
x.grad.zero_()
y.grad.zero_()

z = x*y
z.backward()

print(f"Gradient of x after 3nd backward: {x.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of y after 3nd backward: {y.grad}")
```

This demonstrates that gradients are accumulated. Each call to `backward()` adds to existing gradients, unless they are explicitly zeroed out using `zero_grad()`. This behavior is crucial in scenarios like mini-batch training, where we accumulate gradients from multiple batches before updating model parameters. This highlights that the internal tensor state directly influences the outcome of the backpropagation process.

In summary, backpropagation in PyTorch doesn't accept explicit parameters. Instead, it operates based on the `requires_grad` attribute of tensors involved in the computational graph and their internal `grad` attributes. The operations tracked to create the computational graph implicitly dictate the backpropagation process. The optimizer takes the gradients calculated via backpropagation along with the model parameters to perform optimization using its own (separate) parameters. Understanding these internal mechanics allows more granular control over training procedures and is foundational to effective PyTorch implementation.

For further study, I suggest exploring resources on:
*   Automatic differentiation
*   Computational graphs and their construction in PyTorch
*   The `torch.autograd` package and the `Function` class for custom operations.
*   Optimization algorithms beyond Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), such as Adam and RMSprop.
*   Best practices for handling memory during training with large models and datasets, specifically gradient accumulation.
