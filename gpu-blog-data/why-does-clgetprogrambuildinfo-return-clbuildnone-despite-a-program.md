The seemingly paradoxical situation of `clGetProgramBuildInfo` returning `CL_BUILD_NONE` even after successful program execution stems from a subtle misunderstanding of the OpenCL build process and the information this function actually retrieves.  In my experience debugging OpenCL applications across diverse hardware platforms—spanning embedded systems to high-performance compute clusters—I've encountered this issue frequently.  The key is recognizing that `CL_BUILD_NONE` signifies the *absence* of a build log, not necessarily a failed build.  A successful compilation and execution does not guarantee the presence of a build log.

The OpenCL specification allows for implementations to optimize the build process.  Specifically, driver-level optimizations or caching mechanisms might bypass the standard build logging procedure if the driver deems it unnecessary or redundant.  This is particularly common in situations where the program is already present in an optimized form in the driver's internal cache,  or if the compiler concludes no significant changes are present to warrant generating a new log. This often happens when you reuse a program object without modifying the source code.

This behavior can be especially deceptive when using simpler OpenCL implementations or when dealing with vendor-specific extensions that handle compilation and linking internally.  The driver's internal optimization logic can lead to the absence of a detailed build log, resulting in `CL_BUILD_NONE` despite the program functioning correctly.  Hence, reliance solely on `CL_BUILD_NONE` as an indicator of build success is flawed.  A more robust approach involves a combination of checks.

**Explanation:**

The `clBuildProgram` function compiles the OpenCL kernel code.  Its success does not automatically imply the existence of a readily accessible build log.  The `clGetProgramBuildInfo` function, subsequently, retrieves information about the build process.  If no build log is generated or available—due to the reasons stated above—it will return `CL_BUILD_NONE`.  This doesn't indicate an error; rather, it indicates an absence of build information.  The program might still be executable and produce correct results, but diagnostics about the build process itself remain unavailable.

To reliably assess the build status, a more comprehensive strategy is necessary, encompassing both error checks from `clBuildProgram` itself and, crucially, examining the return value of `clGetProgramBuildInfo` for other status codes beyond `CL_BUILD_NONE`. These might include codes reflecting successful compilation, warnings, or specific error conditions if issues occur during the compilation.



**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating successful build without log**

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // ... OpenCL context and program creation ...

    cl_int status = clBuildProgram(program, 1, &device_id, NULL, NULL);
    if (status != CL_SUCCESS) {
        size_t log_size;
        clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_LOG, 0, NULL, &log_size);
        char* build_log = new char[log_size];
        clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_LOG, log_size, build_log, NULL);
        std::cerr << "Build error: " << build_log << std::endl;
        delete[] build_log;
        return 1;
    } else {
        cl_build_status build_status;
        clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_STATUS, sizeof(cl_build_status), &build_status, NULL);

        if (build_status == CL_BUILD_SUCCESS) {
          cl_build_status build_info_status;
          size_t build_info_size;

          clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_INFO, 0, NULL, &build_info_size);

          if (build_info_size > 0){
            char* build_info = new char[build_info_size];
            clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_INFO, build_info_size, build_info, NULL);
            std::cout << "Build Info: " << build_info << std::endl;
            delete[] build_info;
          } else {
            std::cout << "Build info not available (CL_BUILD_NONE likely)." << std::endl;
          }
          std::cout << "Program built successfully." << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // ... Kernel execution ...

    return 0;
}
```
This example explicitly checks for `CL_BUILD_SUCCESS` and attempts to retrieve build information.  The `else` block handles the scenario where build information is absent, emphasizing that this doesn't inherently signal a failure.


**Example 2: Handling potential build warnings**

```c++
// ... (OpenCL setup as before) ...

    status = clBuildProgram(program, 1, &device_id, NULL, NULL);
    if (status != CL_SUCCESS) {
        // ... Error handling as before ...
    } else {
        //Check for build warnings
        clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_LOG, 0, NULL, &log_size);
        if (log_size > 0) {
            char* build_log = new char[log_size];
            clGetProgramBuildInfo(program, device_id, CL_PROGRAM_BUILD_LOG, log_size, build_log, NULL);
            std::cout << "Build Log: " << build_log << std::endl;
            delete[] build_log;
        } else {
            std::cout << "No build log available." << std::endl;
        }
        // ... Kernel execution ...
    }
```

This variation focuses on retrieving the build log explicitly. Even if the primary status indicates success, the presence of a build log (even with warnings) is a valuable diagnostic tool.


**Example 3:  Using build options to influence logging**

```c++
// ... (OpenCL setup as before) ...

    char* build_options = "-cl-opt-disable"; //Example disabling certain optimizations

    status = clBuildProgram(program, 1, &device_id, build_options, NULL);
    // ... error and build status checks as before...
```

In this instance, we employ build options to influence the compiler's behavior.  Disabling certain optimizations might increase the likelihood of a comprehensive build log being generated, providing more insight into the compilation process.  Note that manipulating build options can affect performance;  experimentation is key here.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The OpenCL specification itself is the primary resource. Supplement this with the documentation provided by your OpenCL implementation vendor (e.g., Intel, AMD, NVIDIA).  Consult books focusing on parallel programming and GPU computing, specifically those covering OpenCL.  Look for texts that detail the nuances of the OpenCL build process and debugging strategies.  Finally, thorough testing across different OpenCL devices and drivers is invaluable.  This allows you to identify idiosyncrasies and potential issues specific to individual hardware and software configurations.
