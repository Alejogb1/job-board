The core challenge in extracting class probabilities from a TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) lies in understanding the output layer's activation function and the network's architecture.  I've spent considerable time optimizing CNNs for multi-class classification, and consistently found that misinterpreting the final layer's output is a common source of error.  The probabilities aren't directly accessible; they require a post-processing step dependent on the chosen activation function.


**1.  Explanation of Probability Extraction**

TensorFlow CNNs, when designed for multi-class classification problems, typically employ a softmax activation function in their final layer.  The softmax function transforms the raw outputs of the preceding layer into a probability distribution over all classes.  This distribution sums to one, ensuring that each value represents the probability of the input belonging to a specific class.  If, however, a different activation function such as sigmoid or linear is used for the output layer, a different approach is needed.  Let's focus on the softmax case, the most prevalent scenario.

The output of the softmax layer is a tensor where each element represents the probability of the input belonging to a corresponding class.  The index of the element corresponds to the class label.  For example, if the output is `[0.1, 0.7, 0.2]`, this represents a 10% probability for class 0, 70% for class 1, and 20% for class 2.  Accessing these probabilities requires understanding TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions.  Critically, it's crucial to distinguish between the raw logits (pre-softmax outputs) and the probabilities.  Using the logits directly would lead to incorrect interpretation, as they aren't normalized probabilities.

If a different activation function is used in the final layer, the approach to extracting class probabilities changes.  For instance, a sigmoid activation function typically outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for each class independently.  This is suitable for binary classification problems or multi-label classification where multiple classes can be assigned to the same input.  To obtain probabilities in this context, one can simply use the output of the final layer directly, provided it is appropriately scaled.  In cases where the output layer uses a linear activation function, there is no inherent probabilistic interpretation.  Probability estimations often require additional steps like calibration using techniques such as Platt scaling.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Here are three code examples demonstrating probability extraction under different scenarios.  Assume that `model` is a compiled TensorFlow/Keras CNN model.


**Example 1: Softmax Activation (Multi-class Classification)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'model' is a compiled Keras CNN with softmax activation in the output layer
input_data = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]]) # Example input data - replace with your actual input
predictions = model.predict(input_data)

# predictions will be a NumPy array with shape (1, num_classes)
# Each element represents the probability of belonging to the corresponding class

probabilities = predictions[0] # Extract probabilities for the single input example

print(f"Probabilities for each class: {probabilities}")
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {tf.reduce_sum(probabilities)}") # Should be approximately 1
print(f"Most likely class: {tf.argmax(probabilities).numpy()}") # Index of the class with highest probability

```

This example leverages Keras' built-in `predict` method, returning a NumPy array of probabilities directly when using softmax activation.  The code then extracts the probabilities for a single input example, verifies that they sum to approximately one (numerical precision might cause minor deviations), and finds the class with the highest probability.

**Example 2: Sigmoid Activation (Multi-label Classification)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'model' is a compiled Keras CNN with sigmoid activation in the output layer
input_data = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]])  # Example input data
predictions = model.predict(input_data)

# predictions will be a NumPy array with shape (1, num_classes)
# Each element represents the independent probability of belonging to the corresponding class

probabilities = predictions[0]

print(f"Probabilities for each class: {probabilities}")
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {tf.reduce_sum(probabilities)}") # Will not necessarily be 1
# Iterate through probabilities and assign classes based on a threshold, for instance 0.5
for i, prob in enumerate(probabilities):
    if prob > 0.5:
        print(f"Class {i} is likely present.")

```

Here, the sigmoid activation provides independent probabilities for each class.  The sum of probabilities does not necessarily equal 1, and an appropriate threshold must be used to determine which classes are assigned to the input based on their probabilities.

**Example 3: Handling Custom Activation and Logits**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assuming 'model' is a compiled Keras CNN with a custom activation function or no activation in output layer
# Accessing the logits directly from the model requires understanding internal layer naming

# Get logits (pre-activation outputs)  - Modify this based on your model's architecture
logits = model.layers[-1].output  # Assumes logits are output of the last layer

# Apply softmax function to get probabilities
probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits)

# Example usage for a single input
input_data = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(input_data)
    predictions = model(input_data)
    probability_output = tf.nn.softmax(predictions)


probabilities_numpy = probability_output.numpy()[0]

print(f"Probabilities for each class: {probabilities_numpy}")
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {np.sum(probabilities_numpy)}") # Should be approximately 1

```

This example showcases how to handle situations where the model doesn't directly provide probabilities. It involves accessing the logits from the model architecture, applying the softmax function manually, and then extracting and utilizing the probabilities.  Note that accessing the logits directly requires careful consideration of the model's specific architecture; the `model.layers[-1].output` might need adjustments depending on the naming conventions and layer structure within your CNN.  Furthermore, error handling for potential shape mismatches is crucial in production-level code.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation, especially the sections on Keras models and activation functions, is invaluable.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra, particularly matrix operations and probability theory, is also essential for interpreting the outputs correctly.  Familiarity with debugging techniques specific to TensorFlow and NumPy is necessary for troubleshooting potential issues during probability extraction.   Studying examples of well-documented CNN implementations can provide further insight into best practices.  Finally, explore resources on model evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of your predicted probabilities.
