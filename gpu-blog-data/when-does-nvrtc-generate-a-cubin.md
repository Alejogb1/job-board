NVRTC, NVIDIA's CUDA Runtime Compilation library, generates a CUBIN (CUDA Binary) only when explicitly instructed to do so.  It doesn't implicitly produce a CUBIN file; instead, it generates PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) code by default, which is then typically further compiled into a CUBIN by the driver during runtime. This distinction is crucial for understanding NVRTC's workflow and its place within the broader CUDA compilation process.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects for over a decade has highlighted the importance of this nuanced understanding, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic code generation and optimization.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The NVRTC API primarily functions as a compiler, translating CUDA C++ code into intermediate PTX instructions.  PTX is a platform-independent representation of CUDA code, suitable for various GPU architectures. The generation of a CUBIN, on the other hand, is architecture-specific and involves the compilation of PTX into machine code tailored to the particular GPU present in the system.  This step is usually handled transparently by the CUDA driver, leveraging the driver's knowledge of the underlying hardware to perform the optimization.

NVRTC provides a means to influence this process.  Through specific API calls,  developers can directly request the generation of a CUBIN. However, this is often not necessary, and generally not recommended, unless there are compelling reasons such as needing to pre-compile kernels for deployment scenarios where the driver might not be available or for advanced optimization strategies requiring direct control over the final binary.  The default behavior—generating PTX—offers more flexibility and portability.  

The decision to generate a CUBIN should be based on a careful assessment of the trade-offs.  While producing a CUBIN provides performance advantages due to pre-compilation, it reduces portability and requires handling binary files, potentially increasing complexity in deployment. Conversely, using PTX maintains portability but introduces the overhead of just-in-time (JIT) compilation at runtime.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different ways to control CUBIN generation using the NVRTC API.  All examples assume familiarity with the basic NVRTC setup and error handling.  For brevity, detailed error checks are omitted.


**Example 1:  Default PTX Generation**

This example demonstrates the typical NVRTC usage, resulting in PTX generation only.

```c++
#include <nvrtc.h>
// ... other includes and declarations ...

nvrtcProgram prog;
nvrtcCreateProgram(&prog, kernelSource, "kernel.cu", 0, NULL, NULL);

// Compile the program.  Note the absence of any CUBIN-related flags.
nvrtcCompileProgram(prog, 0, NULL);

size_t ptxSize;
nvrtcGetPTXSize(prog, &ptxSize);
char *ptx = (char*)malloc(ptxSize);
nvrtcGetPTX(prog, ptx);

// ... use the PTX code ...

free(ptx);
nvrtcDestroyProgram(&prog);
```

This code snippet showcases the standard compilation process. The `nvrtcCompileProgram` function is called without any flags specifically requesting CUBIN generation, resulting in PTX code being generated.


**Example 2:  Generating CUBIN Using `--ptx` and subsequent compilation**

This approach involves generating PTX first and then explicitly compiling it to a CUBIN using the CUDA driver API.  This offers a degree of control while still benefiting from PTX's portability during development.

```c++
#include <nvrtc.h>
#include <cuda.h>
// ... other includes and declarations ...

nvrtcProgram prog;
nvrtcCreateProgram(&prog, kernelSource, "kernel.cu", 0, NULL, NULL);

// Compile to PTX.
nvrtcCompileProgram(prog, 0, NULL);

size_t ptxSize;
nvrtcGetPTXSize(prog, &ptxSize);
char *ptx = (char*)malloc(ptxSize);
nvrtcGetPTX(prog, ptx);

// Compile PTX to CUBIN using CUDA Driver API.
CUmodule module;
CUresult cuRes = cuModuleLoadDataEx(&module, ptx, 0, 0, 0); //Error handling omitted

// ... use the compiled module ...

cuModuleUnload(module);
free(ptx);
nvrtcDestroyProgram(&prog);
```

Here, we explicitly compile the generated PTX into a CUBIN using the CUDA driver's `cuModuleLoadDataEx` function.  Error handling should be properly implemented in a production environment.


**Example 3:  Direct CUBIN Generation (Advanced)**

This example illustrates a less common scenario where direct CUBIN generation is attempted. Note that this requires careful consideration of target architecture and may not always be successful without specific compiler flags.  This approach generally sacrifices portability.

```c++
#include <nvrtc.h>
// ... other includes and declarations ...

nvrtcProgram prog;
nvrtcCreateProgram(&prog, kernelSource, "kernel.cu", 0, NULL, NULL);

// Compile to CUBIN. This requires appropriate compiler flags depending on the target architecture.
const char* flags[] = {"--gpu-code=sm_75", NULL}; //Example for sm_75 architecture; Adjust accordingly.
nvrtcCompileProgram(prog, sizeof(flags)/sizeof(flags[0]) -1, flags);


size_t cubinSize;
nvrtcGetCUBINSize(prog, &cubinSize);
char *cubin = (char*)malloc(cubinSize);
nvrtcGetCUBIN(prog, cubin);

// ... use the CUBIN data ...

free(cubin);
nvrtcDestroyProgram(&prog);
```

This advanced example directly requests CUBIN generation by using the appropriate compiler flags.  The `--gpu-code` flag is crucial; its argument specifies the target compute capability (e.g., sm_75, sm_80). Incorrect specification can lead to compilation errors. The use of  `nvrtcGetCUBINSize` and `nvrtcGetCUBIN` functions are necessary for retrieving the compiled CUBIN data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections detailing NVRTC and the CUDA driver API, are essential resources.   Furthermore, a solid understanding of CUDA programming concepts, PTX, and compute capabilities is necessary for effective utilization of NVRTC.  Consulting relevant CUDA programming books and online tutorials would be beneficial.  Finally, familiarity with low-level C/C++ programming practices is imperative.
