Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) exhibit performance sensitivities deeply intertwined with the manner in which input data is structured and presented.  My experience optimizing RNNs for various sequence processing tasks, ranging from natural language processing to time-series forecasting, has consistently highlighted the crucial role of tensor format in mitigating computational overhead and enhancing training efficiency.  While there's no single universally optimal format, the choice between padded/packed sequences and time-major/batch-major ordering significantly impacts performance.  The optimal choice is determined by the specific hardware architecture, the size of the dataset, and the RNN implementation details.

**1.  Understanding the Impact of Tensor Format:**

The performance bottleneck in RNN training frequently arises from the need to process variable-length sequences.  Padding, a common approach, introduces zeroes to ensure uniform sequence lengths within a batch.  This leads to wasted computation since the network processes irrelevant padding tokens.  Packed sequences, conversely, represent only the non-padding elements, offering computational efficiency by avoiding unnecessary processing. However, packed sequences necessitate sophisticated handling within the RNN implementation, potentially introducing overhead compared to the simplicity of padded sequences.

The choice between time-major and batch-major ordering affects data access patterns. Time-major ordering (`[time_steps, batch_size, features]`) aligns with the sequential nature of RNN computation, enabling efficient memory access by processing time steps consecutively.  Batch-major ordering (`[batch_size, time_steps, features]`), while potentially advantageous for certain matrix operations in some hardware architectures, can lead to more cache misses due to the scattered access pattern across time steps.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the implementation of padded and packed sequences in Python using TensorFlow/Keras. I've based these on real-world scenarios encountered during my involvement in several large-scale NLP projects.  Note that the specific performance impact will vary based on hardware and library versions.

**Example 1: Padded Sequences (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data: variable-length sequences
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]

# Padding the sequences to the maximum length
maxlen = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=maxlen, padding='post')

# Defining a simple RNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=32), # Example embedding layer
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

# Training the model (omitted for brevity)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_sequences, np.array([0,1,2]), epochs=10) # Example labels

```

This example utilizes `pad_sequences` to create padded sequences. The `padding='post'` argument adds padding tokens at the end of shorter sequences.  Note that the embedding layer handles the padding tokens gracefully.  However, this approach may lead to computational inefficiency for long sequences with significant padding.  I have witnessed noticeable performance degradation in projects dealing with extensive text corpora using this method, especially on resource-constrained hardware.


**Example 2: Packed Sequences (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import sequence

#Sample data, as above
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
lengths = [len(s) for s in sequences]
maxlen = max(lengths)
padded_sequences = sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=maxlen, padding='post')


# Defining a LSTM model with masking to ignore padding
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=32, mask_zero=True), #Crucially, mask_zero=True
  tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False) ,
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

#Training - this utilizes the padded sequence, but the masking handles efficiency
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_sequences, np.array([0, 1, 2]), epochs=10)

```

Here, we use an embedding layer with `mask_zero=True`. This instructs the subsequent LSTM layer to ignore padding tokens (0 in this case).  While seemingly similar to the padded approach, the masking mechanism prevents the RNN from processing padding, resulting in significant performance gains, particularly for datasets with highly variable sequence lengths.  This strategy proved invaluable in projects involving audio transcription where sequence lengths vary substantially.

**Example 3: Time-Major vs. Batch-Major Ordering (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample data: batch-major ordering
batch_major_data = torch.randn(32, 100, 128) # [batch_size, time_steps, features]

# Converting to time-major ordering
time_major_data = batch_major_data.transpose(0, 1) # [time_steps, batch_size, features]

# Defining an LSTM model (can also use GRU, SimpleRNN)
model = nn.LSTM(input_size=128, hidden_size=64, batch_first=False) # batch_first=False for time-major

# Forward pass (time-major)
output, hidden = model(time_major_data)

# Example with batch-major: (requires batch_first=True)
model_batch = nn.LSTM(input_size=128, hidden_size=64, batch_first=True)
output_batch, hidden_batch = model_batch(batch_major_data)


```

This example highlights the difference in data handling for time-major and batch-major formats in PyTorch. The `batch_first` argument in the LSTM layer controls the input format.  My experience suggests that, for most standard RNN architectures, the time-major format (`batch_first=False`) often provides better performance due to improved memory access patterns, especially on CPUs. However,  specialized hardware or highly optimized libraries might favor batch-major ordering due to specific matrix operation optimizations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To gain a deeper understanding, I would suggest consulting advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on sequence modeling,  research papers comparing different RNN implementations and optimizations, and official documentation for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.  Furthermore,  exploring the source code of high-performance RNN libraries can be incredibly insightful.  Finally, carefully analyzing performance profiling results for your specific hardware and dataset is crucial for making an informed decision.
