The potential conflict between GLib’s `__noinline__` macro and CUDA arises from their differing execution contexts and optimization strategies, despite both influencing function inlining behavior. GLib’s `__noinline__` primarily affects CPU code compilation within a traditional software development context, while CUDA operates within the heterogeneous environment of a GPU, often employing distinct compiler toolchains.

When GLib’s `__noinline__` is applied to a function, the GCC compiler, or whichever compiler is in use for CPU-based code, is directed to avoid inlining that specific function at its call sites. This is generally employed to maintain code size, improve debugging, or enforce specific call stack behavior. It's a directive for code that's intended to execute on the host processor. CUDA, on the other hand, uses NVIDIA’s `nvcc` compiler which translates CUDA C++ code into PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) assembly, an intermediate language. The PTX assembly is further compiled into machine code suitable for the specific target GPU architecture.

The problem isn't that `__noinline__` is inherently incompatible with CUDA, but that it has no meaning for `nvcc`. `nvcc` doesn't recognize or react to that specific GCC-specific preprocessor directive, which is one of many reasons we cannot generally take any arbitrary C/C++ code, mark functions `__noinline__`, and expect them to magically be non-inlined on the GPU. When attempting to use GLib’s `__noinline__` in a CUDA kernel, or a function called by a CUDA kernel, it will likely be silently ignored during `nvcc` compilation. This can lead to confusion because the user might believe they have prevented inlining when in reality the behavior is undetermined and can vary based on subsequent `nvcc` optimization passes. `nvcc` optimization strategies prioritize performance on the GPU, which often entails aggressive inlining to reduce function call overhead, which is considerably more expensive on a GPU's massively parallel architecture.

I have encountered this exact issue during the development of a computer vision application. I attempted to use a shared library using GLib functions for pre-processing operations on the host CPU, which involved `__noinline__` directives for specific logging and memory management routines. The intention was to prevent inlining for debugging and profiling on CPU operations; this was part of the library contract, but after offloading data to the GPU, the same shared library functions would also be used during the GPU processing stage.

It's important to understand that it's almost always a mistake to pass host-side functions directly into a CUDA kernel. You will get cryptic compiler errors. The only way this scenario is practical is if you're doing some host-side work using a function from the shared object, which is then passed as function pointer to a CPU function, which then does device work using the CUDA driver API. The `__noinline__` directive only applies to the host-side shared object. You must write device specific code for the functions to be executed on the device. For this reason, my attempt to reuse the same shared object on the device to do preprocessing and logging was an immediate failure. The code compiled on the host side but generated run-time errors and memory access violations when attempting to execute functions that contained `__noinline__` directives on the device side. The solution was to duplicate necessary device-side functions, using device compatible versions of those functions that avoided the `__noinline__` directive and to ensure that the library function calls on the host side, are not directly involved in device kernel calls.

Here are a few illustrative examples demonstrating how the behavior changes:

**Example 1: Host-Only Code with `__noinline__`**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <glib.h>

__noinline__ int add_numbers(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  int sum = add_numbers(5, 3);
  printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
  return 0;
}
```

In this C code, when compiled with GCC, the `add_numbers` function, due to `__noinline__`, will not be inlined within `main`. This leads to an actual function call when `add_numbers` is invoked. This behavior will generally be predictable, and observable when using a debugger or inspecting compiled assembly.

**Example 2: Attempting `__noinline__` within CUDA Kernel Code**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel_add(int *a, int *b, int *result) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  __noinline__ int device_add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  result[idx] = device_add(a[idx], b[idx]);
}


int main() {
    int *a, *b, *result;
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_result;
    int size = 256 * sizeof(int);

    cudaMallocManaged(&a, size);
    cudaMallocManaged(&b, size);
    cudaMallocManaged(&result, size);
    for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    {
      a[i] = i;
      b[i] = 2 * i;
    }

    cudaMalloc(&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_result, size);

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    kernel_add<<<1, 256>>>(d_a, d_b, d_result);
    cudaMemcpy(result, d_result, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);


    for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    {
      printf("Result %d = %d\n", i, result[i]);
    }

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_result);
    cudaFree(a);
    cudaFree(b);
    cudaFree(result);


  return 0;
}
```

In this CUDA code, `__noinline__` is incorrectly placed within a device function (`device_add`). While this example may appear to compile, `nvcc` will completely disregard the `__noinline__` directive during CUDA compilation. In the current version, this might be silently ignored and the function `device_add` might be inlined. This illustrates the potential discrepancy and unexpected optimization behaviors. The code will execute on the device as expected functionally but will not have the inlining control expected.

**Example 3: Correct device-specific version of a function without `__noinline__`**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__device__ int device_add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

__global__ void kernel_add(int *a, int *b, int *result) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  result[idx] = device_add(a[idx], b[idx]);
}


int main() {
    int *a, *b, *result;
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_result;
    int size = 256 * sizeof(int);

    cudaMallocManaged(&a, size);
    cudaMallocManaged(&b, size);
    cudaMallocManaged(&result, size);
    for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    {
      a[i] = i;
      b[i] = 2 * i;
    }

    cudaMalloc(&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_result, size);

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    kernel_add<<<1, 256>>>(d_a, d_b, d_result);
    cudaMemcpy(result, d_result, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);


    for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    {
      printf("Result %d = %d\n", i, result[i]);
    }

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_result);
    cudaFree(a);
    cudaFree(b);
    cudaFree(result);


  return 0;
}
```

In this corrected CUDA code, I've removed `__noinline__` and instead declared `device_add` as a `__device__` function. This properly indicates that the function should be compiled for the GPU. Here, the compiler is now free to inline or not based on device-side optimizations. The explicit declaration of the function as a device function allows the compiler to properly optimize it for the device. This avoids any false assumptions regarding host-side preprocessor behavior.

To summarize, `__noinline__` is a compiler directive for CPU code that does not extend to CUDA kernels or device code. It is essential to avoid mixing host directives and device compiler contexts. For CUDA development, the proper method is to create device-specific functions, using the `__device__` specifier, where inlining can be controlled through device-side compiler settings and optimization flags. For further reading and a better understanding of such conflicts, consulting documentation for GCC, GLib, NVIDIA's CUDA Programming Guide, and books on heterogeneous computing are highly recommended. Also, reviewing specific compiler flags and compiler documentation will provide a more granular control over how inlining is handled by both host and device compilers.
