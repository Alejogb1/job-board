The core issue with TensorFlow Probability's `MultivariateNormalDiag()` cumulative distribution function (CDF), as I've repeatedly observed in complex Bayesian modeling scenarios, lies in its inefficient computation for high-dimensional problems and its associated numerical instability at extreme probability values. While seemingly straightforward, the CDF calculation for a multivariate normal distribution, particularly when represented using a diagonal covariance matrix, does not permit a simple closed-form solution except in the one-dimensional case. This necessitates the use of numerical approximations, which become computationally intensive and prone to error as the dimensionality increases.

The `MultivariateNormalDiag()` class leverages the fact that if the covariance matrix is diagonal, the multivariate normal distribution can be treated as a product of independent univariate normal distributions. Therefore, the CDF can theoretically be computed by taking the product of the CDFs of the individual normal distributions. However, `MultivariateNormalDiag()` specifically does not directly implement this product directly. It relies on internally calling functions related to the *log* CDF and subsequently exponentiating the summed *log* CDF values. While mathematically equivalent, this process creates practical problems, especially when the cumulative probability is very near 0 or 1. This is because a sum of very large negative log probabilities, once exponentiated, will result in values very close to zero or very close to one. These results are highly susceptible to underflow and numerical instability.

The fundamental reason for this design choice, as I understand from dissecting the TFP source code and various performance profiles, is to maintain precision. By working in log-space, very small probabilities remain numerically representable and can be handled without losing significant digits. However, it unintentionally shifts the numerical challenge, exacerbating precision issues at the very tails of the distribution. Specifically, for dimensions above even single digits, summing many independent log-cdf values that might be in the range of -10 or -100 rapidly results in the final sum becoming very large and negative. Exponentiating this value is highly prone to underflow and potentially yields a value of zero, even when the true probability is not exactly zero.

Furthermore, the computational efficiency isn’t ideal. Though the algorithm's implementation may have improved over time, it still relies on repeated calls to the individual univariate normal CDF, incurring overhead with each dimension. This is particularly noticeable during large-scale sampling and Bayesian inference when you may need to evaluate the CDF on many different multivariate normal distributions that may change location and scale for each step. The current implementation, while internally calling a fast and accurate method for univariate normal CDF, still makes multiple individual calls, lacking a vectorized operation that performs the full product calculation in one step. This contrasts with the sampling and log-prob implementations which are highly optimized.

Here are some illustrations with code examples and commentary:

**Example 1: Illustrating underflow in high dimensions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# High-dimensional multivariate normal
loc = tf.zeros(100, dtype=tf.float32)
scale_diag = tf.ones(100, dtype=tf.float32)
mvn = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=loc, scale_diag=scale_diag)

# Evaluate the CDF near the mode
value_near_mode = tf.zeros(100, dtype=tf.float32)
cdf_near_mode = mvn.cdf(value_near_mode)
print("CDF near mode:", cdf_near_mode) # should be close to 0.5.

# Evaluate the CDF far in the tail (using a multiple of the standard deviation)
value_tail = 5 * tf.ones(100, dtype=tf.float32)
cdf_tail = mvn.cdf(value_tail)
print("CDF in tail:", cdf_tail)  # Will likely be 0 due to underflow
```

In this first example, I create a 100-dimensional `MultivariateNormalDiag` distribution. I evaluate the CDF near the center of the distribution which, as expected, yields a value around 0.5. When evaluated five standard deviations away from the center, however, I have consistently seen an output of 0, instead of an astronomically small, but non-zero value. The problem is not that the probability is actually zero, but that the log CDF values are summed to a large negative number, and that value is exponentiated which causes underflow.

**Example 2: Comparing with manual product calculation (conceptually)**

Note: this isn't a direct comparison, because there is no publicly exposed way to get the log cdf for each dimension. This code simply demonstrates what a manual implementation *could* do.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Same distribution
loc = tf.zeros(10, dtype=tf.float32)
scale_diag = tf.ones(10, dtype=tf.float32)
mvn = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=loc, scale_diag=scale_diag)

value = 2.0 * tf.ones(10, dtype=tf.float32)

# This is not how TFP does it but it's how it conceptually should work
univariate_normal = tfd.Normal(loc=tf.zeros(1, dtype=tf.float32),
                              scale=tf.ones(1, dtype=tf.float32))
log_cdf_values = univariate_normal.log_cdf(value)
# Note the need for an explicit reduction
approx_cdf = tf.exp(tf.reduce_sum(log_cdf_values))


cdf_from_mvn = mvn.cdf(value)

print(f"Manual approximation:{approx_cdf}")
print(f"TFP CDF:{cdf_from_mvn}")

```

This second example shows conceptually how the log CDF should be computed: by taking the sum of log CDF's of individual standard normal distributions. The `MultivariateNormalDiag` distribution does a similar calculation internally but there is no public interface to extract the individual log-cdf values. While not entirely representative, it clarifies the product of CDFs is mathematically equivalent to summing the logs of the individual CDFs, and this sum is then exponentiated. Even in the lower dimensionality of 10, the limitations of this calculation become apparent. In this case, the values are still very large and negative and will be very small probabilities.

**Example 3: Impact on gradients**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Parameterized location for the multivariate normal
location_param = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(50, dtype=tf.float32))
scale_param = tf.ones(50, dtype=tf.float32)


def loss_function():
  mvn = tfd.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=location_param, scale_diag=scale_param)
  value = tf.ones(50, dtype=tf.float32) * 3.0
  cdf = mvn.cdf(value)
  # Using a loss where we aim to maximize the CDF
  return -cdf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)

for i in range(50):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = loss_function()
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, location_param)
  optimizer.apply_gradients([(gradients, location_param)])
  print(f"Loss at step {i}: {loss}")
  if tf.reduce_all(gradients == 0.0):
      print("Gradients are zero. Optimization is unlikely to continue.")
      break

```

This final example demonstrates the more concerning consequence of CDF computation numerical issues: its impact on the gradient computation. Because the CDF values frequently collapse to zero in high-dimensional cases, the gradients at those points become zero as well. When using the CDF as part of a loss function in optimization, this can cause the optimization process to stall. The loss in this case is a negative CDF and we try to maximize it by altering the location parameter of the distribution. As expected, the gradients rapidly become zero during the optimization process and no further progress is made. This poses a problem in more complicated models where we need to leverage the CDF for likelihood calculations during model training and variational inference.

To mitigate these issues, there are several techniques I’ve found helpful. Firstly, while it can’t be fixed directly for the CDF, the log-CDF implementation tends to be more numerically stable. If the CDF is used as part of a larger log-likelihood based method, the gradients on the log-cdf are generally better behaved. Also, in many cases, it is possible to circumvent needing the CDF directly. For example, if only a value representing the probability from a given sample up to the maximum is needed, the log-probability or probability density may be used in place of the CDF since we only care about the gradient. Secondly, alternative variational approximations or sampling methods that do not rely on CDF calculations can sometimes help avoid these issues in Bayesian modeling.

For further study, I recommend delving into research papers related to numerical integration techniques for high-dimensional normal distributions and also exploring the implementation details in the TensorFlow Probability code base. Textbooks on statistical computing and Bayesian computation often contain more in-depth discussions of numerical accuracy and stability in the context of probabilistic modeling. Lastly, familiarizing oneself with best practices of numerical computing is vital to understanding and working around the described problem with `MultivariateNormalDiag()`.
