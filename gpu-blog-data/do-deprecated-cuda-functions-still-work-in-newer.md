Deprecated CUDA functions generally continue to function in newer versions, but their continued availability is not guaranteed.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects over the past decade has consistently highlighted the inherent risk in relying on deprecated functionality. While they might work today, future driver updates or CUDA toolkit revisions could remove them entirely, leading to unpredictable application failures.  This behavior is not unique to CUDA; it's a standard practice across numerous software development frameworks.

The primary reason for deprecating functions is to encourage developers to adopt improved, more efficient, or better-designed alternatives.  Deprecated functions often suffer from performance limitations, security vulnerabilities, or represent outdated design patterns.  Maintaining backward compatibility for every deprecated function indefinitely would severely hinder the progress and maintainability of the CUDA toolkit itself.  The CUDA documentation explicitly states that reliance on deprecated functions is unsupported, and therefore, troubleshooting issues arising from their use is unlikely to receive assistance from NVIDIA support.

Understanding the deprecation process is crucial.  A function doesn't simply vanish; the deprecation process typically involves a warning phase.  During this phase, the compiler might issue a warning message indicating that the function is deprecated and suggesting a replacement.  This serves as a grace period, allowing developers time to update their code.  Eventually, the function might be removed entirely, leading to compilation errors.

Let's examine this with code examples illustrating different scenarios.  I'll focus on the `cudaMallocPitch` function, a classic example of a deprecated function in CUDA.  The recommended replacement is the combination of `cudaMalloc3D` or `cudaMallocManaged` depending on the memory allocation strategy.

**Example 1: Using the deprecated `cudaMallocPitch`**

```cuda
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int width = 64;
  int height = 64;
  size_t pitch;
  void *devPtr;

  cudaError_t err = cudaMallocPitch(&devPtr, &pitch, width * sizeof(float), height);

  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMallocPitch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }

  // ...Further CUDA operations...

  cudaFree(devPtr);
  return 0;
}
```

This code uses `cudaMallocPitch` for allocating a 2D array on the GPU.  While it might compile and run on newer CUDA versions, a compiler warning will likely be generated.  This is crucial to note; ignoring compiler warnings related to deprecated functions is a major source of future instability.

**Example 2:  Migrating to `cudaMalloc3D`**

```cuda
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int width = 64;
  int height = 64;
  cudaExtent extent = make_cudaExtent(width * sizeof(float), height, 1);
  cudaPitchedPtr devPtr;

  cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc3D(&devPtr, extent);

  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc3D failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }

  // Accessing the allocated memory:
  float *data = (float*)devPtr.ptr;

  // ...Further CUDA operations, accounting for pitch: devPtr.pitch...

  cudaFree(devPtr.ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the preferred method using `cudaMalloc3D`. It provides more control over memory allocation and aligns better with modern CUDA programming practices. Note the explicit handling of the `pitch` value which is now directly accessible within the `cudaPitchedPtr` structure.  This approach offers improved performance and flexibility compared to `cudaMallocPitch`.


**Example 3: Utilizing `cudaMallocManaged`**

```cuda
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int width = 64;
  int height = 64;
  size_t size = width * height * sizeof(float);
  float *devPtr;

  cudaError_t err = cudaMallocManaged(&devPtr, size);

  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMallocManaged failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }

  // Access from host and device directly
  // ...Further CUDA operations...

  cudaFree(devPtr);
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `cudaMallocManaged` is employed. This allocates memory accessible from both the host and device, simplifying data transfer.  This option is suitable when the data needs frequent transfers between the host and device, eliminating explicit `cudaMemcpy` calls which contribute to overhead. However, it's crucial to consider the potential implications of Unified Memory and its performance characteristics within your specific application.


In summary, while deprecated CUDA functions might still operate in newer versions, their continued functionality is not guaranteed, and reliance on them constitutes a significant risk.  The examples illustrate the migration from the deprecated `cudaMallocPitch` to more robust alternatives.  The best practice is to immediately refactor code to use the recommended replacements whenever a compiler warning regarding a deprecated function appears.  This proactive approach minimizes future maintenance headaches and guarantees code stability and compatibility with future CUDA toolkit updates.

**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  CUDA C++ Programming Guide
2.  CUDA Toolkit Documentation
3.  NVIDIA's official CUDA samples and examples


Remember, proactively updating your code to use the recommended replacements avoids unexpected failures and ensures the long-term stability and maintainability of your CUDA applications. My experience working on large-scale simulations and scientific computing projects reinforced the importance of this principle.  Ignoring deprecation warnings can lead to hours – even days – of debugging later on.  The small effort now saves significant time and resources in the future.
