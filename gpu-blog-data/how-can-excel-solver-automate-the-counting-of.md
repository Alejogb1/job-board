Excel Solver's inherent capabilities don't directly address the automated counting of subproblems within a larger optimization problem.  Solver, at its core, is a numerical optimization engine designed to find optimal solutions to a defined objective function subject to specified constraints. It doesn't possess built-in logic for recursively identifying and enumerating subproblems.  However,  through clever problem formulation and the judicious use of auxiliary cells and functions, one can leverage Solver to indirectly manage and subsequently count the solutions obtained for what might be considered subproblems within a larger optimization framework.  This requires a careful restructuring of the problem into a form Solver can understand. My experience working on large-scale logistics optimization problems has shown this approach to be quite effective.

The key lies in representing each subproblem as a distinct component within the overall Solver model.  This often involves introducing binary decision variables to act as switches, selectively activating or deactivating each subproblem based on the overall optimal solution. The number of times these binary variables assume a value indicating an active subproblem directly provides the desired count.  This requires a thorough understanding of the underlying problem structure and some creative modeling techniques.

Let's illustrate with examples.  Consider a scenario where we are optimizing resource allocation across multiple projects (subproblems). Each project has its own objective function and constraints.  We aim to find the optimal allocation across all projects while simultaneously determining how many projects are ultimately selected in the optimal solution.

**Example 1: Resource Allocation with Project Selection**

Imagine three projects, each requiring a certain amount of resource 'R'. The profit generated by each project is dependent on the amount of resource allocated.

* **Project 1:** Requires 5 units of R, generates profit = 10*min(R,5)
* **Project 2:** Requires 3 units of R, generates profit = 7*min(R,3)
* **Project 3:** Requires 2 units of R, generates profit = 5*min(R,2)

We have a total of 8 units of resource R available.  To use Solver, we introduce binary variables:

* X1, X2, X3:  Binary variables (0 or 1), representing whether a project is selected (1) or not (0).
* R1, R2, R3:  Continuous variables, representing the amount of resource allocated to each project.

Our Excel model would look like this:

| Cell | Description          | Formula                               |
|------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| B1   | Total Resource       | 8                                     |
| B2   | Project 1 Selected  | X1                                    |
| B3   | Project 2 Selected  | X2                                    |
| B4   | Project 3 Selected  | X3                                    |
| C2   | Project 1 Resource  | R1                                    |
| C3   | Project 2 Resource  | R2                                    |
| C4   | Project 3 Resource  | R3                                    |
| D2   | Project 1 Profit    | 10*MIN(C2,5)                          |
| D3   | Project 2 Profit    | 7*MIN(C3,3)                           |
| D4   | Project 3 Profit    | 5*MIN(C4,2)                           |
| B6   | Total Profit        | SUM(D2:D4)                            |
| B7   | Resource Constraint  | SUM(C2:C4) <= B1                      |
| B8   | Project 1 Resource Constraint | IF(B2=0,C2=0,C2<=5)                |
| B9   | Project 2 Resource Constraint | IF(B3=0,C3=0,C3<=3)                |
| B10  | Project 3 Resource Constraint | IF(B4=0,C4=0,C4<=2)                |
| B11  | Number of Projects  | SUM(B2:B4)                            |


Solver would maximize cell B6 (Total Profit) subject to constraints B7-B10. Cell B11 provides the count of selected projects.


**Example 2:  Traveling Salesperson Problem Decomposition**

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) can be decomposed into subproblems using a similar strategy. For instance, we could divide the TSP into smaller clusters of cities and solve each cluster's sub-TSP independently.  The overall problem would involve coordinating these sub-TSPs to find a solution for the entire network of cities. Binary variables could indicate whether a particular sub-TSP route is selected in the final solution. The count of activated sub-TSPs would provide the number of subproblems included in the final optimal tour.  This would be computationally more demanding and require more sophisticated techniques to manage the interaction between the subproblems.


**Example 3:  Production Scheduling with Machine Allocation**

In a production scheduling problem, each machine can be considered a subproblem.  We might have binary variables indicating whether a machine is used and constraints to ensure that each job is assigned to at least one machine.  The number of machines used (sum of binary variables) would provide the count of subproblems solved.

These resources, along with dedicated exploration of Solver's capabilities within Excel, provide the necessary tools to tackle more intricate optimization problems with subproblem management.  The techniques presented are not exclusive to these examples and are adaptable to a variety of scenarios. The crucial element remains the creative representation of the subproblems within the overarching optimization model using binary variables and well-defined constraints to ultimately obtain the desired count. The indirect nature of this approach necessitates careful consideration of the problem structure and meticulous model building. Remember that complex problems may require the use of specialized optimization software beyond Excel Solver for efficient solution.
