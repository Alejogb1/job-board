PyTorch’s `torch.gather` function, despite its powerful capability to select elements from tensors based on indices, does not directly permit assignment of its results back into the original tensor or a different tensor using standard assignment. This constraint arises because `gather` produces a new tensor containing selected values and does not return references to the original memory locations. Thus, we need a different approach to perform an assignment based on `gather` results.

The core issue stems from `gather`’s behavior: it creates a new tensor rather than modifying an existing one. This new tensor copies the elements from the input tensor at the specified indices. Direct assignment, like `target_tensor[indices] = torch.gather(source_tensor, dim, indices)`, fails because `target_tensor[indices]` attempts a modification at locations defined by `indices` within `target_tensor`, while the right-hand side is a tensor with its own memory allocation. This mismatch prevents the assignment.

To successfully assign `gather` results, we must utilize the concept of a "scatter" operation. The `torch.scatter_` (in-place scatter) function allows us to write the values into specific positions of a tensor, effectively achieving the desired assignment based on the `gather` output. We essentially reverse the indexing process of `gather`, applying the fetched values to new locations. This method provides a practical solution, but it necessitates a careful understanding of the relationship between the indexing scheme used for `gather` and the destination indices for `scatter_`.

The `scatter_` method requires the dimension along which to scatter the source tensor's data, a tensor of indices indicating where to place the data, and the source data tensor itself, in addition to the target tensor, where the data are to be written. The key challenge lies in constructing the correct index tensor for the `scatter_` operation. These indices need to align with the structure implied by the original `gather` operation. Let me illustrate this with a practical example.

Consider an initial scenario where we have a 2D `source_tensor` from which we want to `gather` data along dimension 1 based on an `indices` tensor. We then aim to place the result of this gathering into specific locations of a separate `target_tensor`. The first code snippet below demonstrates how to perform the `gather`, and the corresponding `scatter_` operation to assign it elsewhere:

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Simple Gather and Scatter Assignment
source_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
indices = torch.tensor([[0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 0]])  # Index tensor
target_tensor = torch.zeros_like(source_tensor)  # Destination tensor initialized to zeros

# 1. Gather data
gathered_data = torch.gather(source_tensor, dim=1, index=indices)
print("Gathered Data:\n", gathered_data)

# 2. Prepare scatter indices. These indices need to specify *where* the gathered data should be placed within the target_tensor
rows = torch.arange(source_tensor.shape[0]).view(-1, 1).expand_as(indices)
scatter_indices = torch.stack((rows, indices), dim=-1).view(-1, 2)

# 3. Prepare a flattened version of the gathered data to match the flattened indices.
scatter_source = gathered_data.flatten()

# 4. Scatter the data onto the target tensor
target_tensor.view(-1)[scatter_indices[:, 0] * source_tensor.shape[1] + scatter_indices[:,1]] = scatter_source
print("Target Tensor After Scatter:\n", target_tensor)
```

In the code above, we perform the `gather` operation, as initially conceived. The `scatter` operation then applies the gathered data to our zeroed `target_tensor`, but we are using `scatter_` to assign this value. A critical part is the generation of `scatter_indices`. This tensor dictates *where* the values will land, based on the indices used for the `gather`. The flattened index ensures we address our tensor as one continuous chunk of memory when performing the assignment. `scatter_source` is the flattened output of the `gather` operation, which will be applied according to the flattened `scatter_indices`.

The process of building the proper index tensor for the `scatter_` operation is crucial, as even small deviations from its expected structure will lead to incorrect results. In my experience, the easiest method to conceptualize this tensor is by generating row indices (or column indices if scattering along columns) and using the original index tensor to create pairs for the assignment. This approach generalizes well to tensors of higher dimensions, although the index calculation becomes more involved.

The next example expands on this concept using a 3D tensor, showing how the same principle applies to higher dimensions:

```python
import torch

# Example 2: 3D Tensor Gather and Scatter
source_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
indices = torch.tensor([[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 3, 2], [2, 3, 1, 1]], [[1, 0, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 3, 2]]])
target_tensor = torch.zeros_like(source_tensor)

# 1. Gather Data
gathered_data = torch.gather(source_tensor, dim=2, index=indices)
print("Gathered Data:\n", gathered_data)

# 2. Prepare Scatter Indices
b, r, c = source_tensor.shape
batch_indices = torch.arange(b).view(-1, 1, 1).expand_as(indices)
row_indices = torch.arange(r).view(1, -1, 1).expand_as(indices)
scatter_indices = torch.stack((batch_indices, row_indices, indices), dim=-1).view(-1, 3)

# 3. Prepare a flattened version of the gathered data
scatter_source = gathered_data.flatten()


# 4. Scatter Data
target_tensor.view(-1)[scatter_indices[:,0]*source_tensor.shape[1]*source_tensor.shape[2]+scatter_indices[:,1]*source_tensor.shape[2]+scatter_indices[:,2]] = scatter_source
print("Target Tensor After Scatter:\n", target_tensor)
```

This example introduces an extra dimension in the tensor. The method to generate `scatter_indices` remains largely the same, now expanded to include batch indices. The index calculation for the assignment to the flattened target tensor now accounts for all the tensor's dimensions.

It is crucial to avoid potential out-of-bounds access when creating indices. Ensure the maximum value within the `indices` tensor does not exceed the corresponding dimension's size in the `source_tensor`, and that the target tensor has enough space to accept the scattering based on the created index. Finally, it is also worth noting that, while direct assignment is often more intuitive, scatter operations often offer better performance for complex index manipulation, which can be critical for larger datasets.

Finally, in some situations we can make use of `torch.index_put_`. This is a potentially less error prone approach as it handles the index generation step internally, however, it still requires a particular ordering of indexes that could still lead to errors, therefore careful consideration should be given before using it. Let's modify our first example to illustrate this:

```python
import torch

# Example 3: Using index_put_
source_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
indices = torch.tensor([[0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 0]])  # Index tensor
target_tensor = torch.zeros_like(source_tensor)

# 1. Gather data
gathered_data = torch.gather(source_tensor, dim=1, index=indices)
print("Gathered Data:\n", gathered_data)

# 2. Prepare row indices
rows = torch.arange(source_tensor.shape[0]).view(-1, 1).expand_as(indices)

# 3. Scatter the data using torch.index_put_
target_tensor = target_tensor.index_put_((rows, indices), gathered_data)

print("Target Tensor After Scatter using index_put_:\n", target_tensor)
```

The above example shows that it is also possible to use `torch.index_put_`. We can use our rows index tensor with the `indices` tensor from our previous example and assign the result of `gather` to this location within our `target_tensor`. As can be seen, we have avoided the step of manually flattening the tensors and creating an index that describes their position within the flattened tensor. This simplicity could potentially save time when working with complex tensors.

For further study, I suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.gather`, `torch.scatter_`, and `torch.index_put_`. In addition, experimentation with varied tensor shapes and indexing patterns is crucial for mastering these operations. The ability to correctly move information based on tensor indices is critical in many fields, particularly in the manipulation of complex data like images and graphs and a thorough understanding of these operations is important for anyone looking to perform this task in PyTorch.
