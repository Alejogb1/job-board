Completely uninstalling OpenCV, particularly when dealing with multiple installations or intertwined dependencies, requires a methodical approach beyond a simple package manager removal.  My experience working on embedded vision systems, specifically those utilizing Yocto Project builds, highlighted the complexities involved.  A naive `pip uninstall opencv-python` or equivalent often leaves behind lingering configuration files, shared libraries, and potentially even modified system files, leading to conflicts in subsequent installations or unexpected application behavior.

**1.  Understanding the Scope of the Uninstall**

OpenCV's installation footprint varies based on the method employed.  A simple `pip install opencv-python` targets the Python interpreter's environment.  However, other methods – such as building from source, using system package managers (apt, yum, pacman), or installing pre-built binaries – spread the installation across different locations.  Complete removal necessitates identifying all these locations and systematically deleting relevant files and entries.

**2.  A Multi-Stage Uninstall Process**

I've developed a robust, multi-stage process for ensuring a complete uninstall, regardless of the installation method.  This process incorporates both programmatic and manual steps to cover all potential remnants.

**Stage 1: Package Manager Removal**

This is the first step, targeting any OpenCV packages installed through your system's package manager.  The specific commands vary across distributions.  For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), I'd use:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge libopencv-dev libopencv-core* libopencv-highgui* libopencv-imgproc*
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

The `--purge` option is crucial.  It removes configuration files and associated data.  `autoremove` cleans up dependencies no longer needed, and `autoclean` removes downloaded package files.  Analogous commands exist for other package managers like yum (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL) or pacman (Arch Linux).  Failure to use `purge` often leaves remnants, hindering a clean reinstall.


**Stage 2: Python Environment Cleanup**

If you installed OpenCV using `pip`,  the next step involves removing it from the relevant Python environments.  This includes virtual environments.  If using a virtual environment (recommended!), activate it before running the uninstall command:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate  # Replace 'myenv' with your environment name
pip uninstall opencv-python
pip uninstall opencv-contrib-python  # Remove contrib modules if installed
deactivate
```

Failure to deactivate the environment before proceeding may leave the uninstall incomplete, particularly affecting future installations in that specific environment.

**Stage 3: Manual Cleanup (The Critical Step)**

This is where meticulous attention is needed.  OpenCV's installation often leaves behind configuration files, cached data, and possibly compiled libraries in various locations.  These depend on the installation method and your system configuration.  The following manual checks are crucial:

* **Check your `site-packages` directory:**  This directory usually holds installed Python packages. Search for any lingering OpenCV-related files and folders.  They are often located at `python3.X/site-packages` within your Python installation directory.  Removing them manually requires careful scrutiny to avoid accidentally removing files belonging to other libraries.

* **Examine system-wide library directories:**  OpenCV often places shared libraries (`*.so` on Linux, `*.dll` on Windows, `*.dylib` on macOS) in system-wide library directories. Identifying these directories (e.g., `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/lib`) and removing OpenCV-related libraries requires extreme caution.  Incorrect removal can severely damage your system.

* **Look for configuration files:** OpenCV might install configuration files in locations such as `/etc` or within user-specific configuration directories. These need to be manually identified and removed.


**3. Code Examples with Commentary**

These examples illustrate parts of the manual cleanup process within Python scripts.  It is imperative to carefully examine the script's output and only delete files you are absolutely certain are related to OpenCV.  These scripts are examples and might require adaptation depending on your system and specific installation path.

**Example 1: Identifying OpenCV-related files in site-packages**

```python
import os
import re

site_packages_dir = "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages" # Adjust to your path.
opencv_pattern = re.compile(r"opencv")

for root, _, files in os.walk(site_packages_dir):
    for file in files:
        if opencv_pattern.search(file):
            filepath = os.path.join(root, file)
            print(f"Found OpenCV-related file: {filepath}")
            # os.remove(filepath) #Uncomment to remove; proceed with EXTREME CAUTION.
```

This script uses regular expressions to identify OpenCV-related files. The `os.remove()` line is commented out; uncommenting and running it will delete the identified files, so proceed with caution and thoroughly review the output before uncommenting.


**Example 2:  Listing OpenCV shared libraries**

```python
import os
import glob

lib_dirs = ["/usr/local/lib", "/usr/lib"] # Add more as needed.
opencv_libs = []
for lib_dir in lib_dirs:
    opencv_libs.extend(glob.glob(os.path.join(lib_dir, "libopencv*")))

for lib in opencv_libs:
    print(f"Found OpenCV library: {lib}")
    # os.remove(lib) #Uncomment to remove; proceed with EXTREME CAUTION.
```

This script uses `glob` to find files matching the pattern `libopencv*` in common library directories. Again, the `os.remove()` call is commented out for safety.  This exemplifies how to programmatically locate files; manual validation before deletion is crucial.

**Example 3: Checking for OpenCV-related environment variables**

```python
import os

opencv_env_vars = ["OPENCV_DIR", "OPENCV_HOME", "OPENCV_DATA"] # Add more as needed.

for var in opencv_env_vars:
    if var in os.environ:
        print(f"OpenCV-related environment variable found: {var} = {os.environ[var]}")
        # del os.environ[var] # Uncomment to remove; proceed with EXTREME CAUTION.
```


This script checks for OpenCV-related environment variables.  Removing environment variables requires user-specific action, depending on whether the environment is set globally or for the current user.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

Consult your operating system's documentation for details on package management and the locations of system libraries and configuration files.  Familiarize yourself with the command-line tools for your package manager.  Review the OpenCV documentation for information on the structure of its installation.  Examine the output of all commands carefully and verify the files you intend to delete before deleting them.  A thorough understanding of your system's file structure and your distribution's package management system are essential for safe and complete uninstallation.
