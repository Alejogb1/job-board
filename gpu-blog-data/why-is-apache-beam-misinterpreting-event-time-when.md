Apache Beam's interaction with Kinesis streams, particularly in regards to event time processing, often reveals discrepancies stemming from a fundamental mismatch between Kinesis' inherent ordering and Beam's interpretation of event timestamps. Specifically, Kinesis records receive times at the shard level, not actual event times, and these record arrival times are what a standard KinesisIO source presents to a Beam pipeline by default. This distinction is crucial when processing data where temporal order matters, as the timestamp assigned by Kinesis isn't guaranteed to represent the actual moment the event occurred.

I've debugged pipelines encountering precisely this issue, and the core problem is that the default Kinesis source uses the record's arrival time within the Kinesis stream, which becomes the 'event time' for Beam's processing. This presents a problem for windows and other time-based operations, because events aren't always processed in the order of their original occurrence. Consider, for example, a mobile app reporting user actions. If a user experiences a brief network interruption, the actions they take will arrive to Kinesis out of sequence, and processed within Beam as if the delayed action occurred before earlier actions. Such a condition often results in incorrect counts, aggregations and incorrect analysis. In this case, we must extract the event timestamp embedded within the event payload.

The primary solution involves overriding the default event time extraction mechanism. Beam's KinesisIO source offers configurability via a `withTimestampPolicy` method. This method accepts a `TimestampPolicy` object. The core of the fix lies in implementing a custom `TimestampPolicy` that parses the actual event time from the message payload itself. Here’s how one would approach this.

First, a custom class implementing `TimestampPolicy<byte[]>` is necessary. This class would contain the logic to extract the embedded timestamp. We implement the `getTimestamp` method to define the extraction logic from the raw byte array.

```java
import org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kinesis.TimestampPolicy;
import org.joda.time.Instant;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class CustomTimestampPolicy implements TimestampPolicy<byte[]> {

    private final String timestampFieldName;
    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    public CustomTimestampPolicy(String timestampFieldName) {
        this.timestampFieldName = timestampFieldName;
    }


    @Override
    public Instant getTimestamp(byte[] recordBytes) {
      try {
          JsonNode rootNode = objectMapper.readTree(recordBytes);
          long timestampMillis = rootNode.get(timestampFieldName).asLong();
          return new Instant(timestampMillis);
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
         return null;
      }
    }
}
```

In the above code example, I created `CustomTimestampPolicy` that receives a timestamp field name. This implementation utilizes Jackson's ObjectMapper to parse a JSON structure in the Kinesis record. The `getTimestamp()` method attempts to read the timestamp value from that structure assuming it's a long, and returns the timestamp as a Joda `Instant`. It does so while adding a catch for parsing errors, where the record may be corrupt. A `null` is returned in the catch, indicating the record should be dropped.

Next, I illustrate how to incorporate this custom timestamp policy when building the Beam pipeline. Assume we’re building a pipeline to process user actions. We'll need to configure a `KinesisIO` read transformation using our custom timestamp policy.

```java
import org.apache.beam.sdk.Pipeline;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kinesis.KinesisIO;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.options.PipelineOptions;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.options.PipelineOptionsFactory;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.AfterProcessingTime;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.FixedWindows;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.windowing.Window;
import org.joda.time.Duration;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;


public class KinesisPipeline {
    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(KinesisPipeline.class);


    public static void main(String[] args) {
      PipelineOptions options = PipelineOptionsFactory.fromArgs(args).withValidation().create();
      Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(options);

       String streamName = "my-kinesis-stream";
       String region = "us-west-2";
       String timestampFieldName = "eventTime";


        pipeline.apply(KinesisIO.read()
                        .withStreamName(streamName)
                        .withRegion(region)
                        .withTimestampPolicy(new CustomTimestampPolicy(timestampFieldName)))
                .apply(Window.<byte[]>into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))
                        .triggering(AfterProcessingTime.pastFirstElementInPane())
                        .withAllowedLateness(Duration.standardSeconds(30))
                        .discardingFiredPanes())
                .apply("Log Event", org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.MapElements.via(
                        new org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.SimpleFunction<byte[], String>() {
                           @Override
                          public String apply(byte[] record) {
                             return "Record: "+ new String(record);
                            }
                         }
                ))
                .apply("Log output", org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.ParDo.of(
                      new org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.DoFn<String, Void>() {
                           @ProcessElement
                           public void processElement(@Element String record){
                            LOG.info(record);
                            }
                        }
                ));

      pipeline.run().waitUntilFinish();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `KinesisIO.read()` source is configured with `.withTimestampPolicy(new CustomTimestampPolicy("eventTime"))`. The `eventTime` parameter corresponds to the field name in the JSON record holding the event timestamp. The events are then windowed by 1 minute, and output. The allowed lateness is also configured in the windowing definition, handling cases of late events.

Furthermore, depending on the source of your timestamp, you may need to adapt the `CustomTimestampPolicy` to accommodate other formats. For instance, if the timestamp was in a textual ISO 8601 format, parsing it requires a `DateTimeFormatter`. Here’s how the policy would be modified:

```java
import org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kinesis.TimestampPolicy;
import org.joda.time.Instant;
import org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat;
import org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class CustomIsoTimestampPolicy implements TimestampPolicy<byte[]> {

    private final String timestampFieldName;
    private final DateTimeFormatter dateFormatter;
    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    public CustomIsoTimestampPolicy(String timestampFieldName, String dateFormatPattern) {
        this.timestampFieldName = timestampFieldName;
        this.dateFormatter = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(dateFormatPattern).withZoneUTC();
    }


    @Override
    public Instant getTimestamp(byte[] recordBytes) {
        try {
            JsonNode rootNode = objectMapper.readTree(recordBytes);
            String timestampString = rootNode.get(timestampFieldName).asText();
            return dateFormatter.parseDateTime(timestampString).toInstant();
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```
In this variation, `CustomIsoTimestampPolicy` accepts a pattern string as input, which will be used to parse an ISO 8601 formatted date time string. This allows `KinesisIO` to parse and interpret event timestamps originating from source systems that adhere to the ISO 8601 standard.
In this situation, the implementation ensures that the processing time is based upon the correct time, which would allow aggregations and other temporal operations to execute correctly.

In summary, while Kinesis offers robust event ingestion, it's critical to recognize that its intrinsic record arrival time isn't suitable for event time-based processing in Beam. By implementing a custom timestamp policy and utilizing it in the `KinesisIO` configuration, the Beam pipeline can extract actual event timestamps from the payload, enabling accurate windowing and correct temporal aggregations. Ignoring this aspect of `KinesisIO` usage with Beam inevitably leads to inaccurate results.

For further learning, I recommend examining Beam's official documentation on windowing and time processing, which is invaluable when understanding Beam’s mechanics. Additionally, familiarize yourself with Joda-Time, as that’s the library used by Apache Beam, including timestamp management. Understanding Kinesis’s data model and record formats also proves essential for proper parsing and timestamp extraction. For deep dives, research Apache Beam’s advanced windowing features such as late data handling, and triggers which further fine-tunes how data is processed in real time.
