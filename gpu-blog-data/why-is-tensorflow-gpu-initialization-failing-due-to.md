TensorFlow's failure to initialize on a GPU due to CUDA device unavailability stems fundamentally from a mismatch between TensorFlow's expectations and the actual state of the CUDA runtime environment.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale image recognition system and a real-time anomaly detection pipeline, highlights the multifaceted nature of this problem.  It rarely boils down to a single, easily identifiable cause; rather, it often involves a confluence of factors relating to driver versions, CUDA toolkit installation, environmental variables, and conflicting library versions.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, when configured for GPU acceleration, relies on the CUDA toolkit and its associated libraries to interact with NVIDIA GPUs. This interaction involves several steps:

* **Driver Installation:** The NVIDIA driver provides the fundamental interface between the operating system and the GPU hardware.  A correctly installed and functioning driver is paramount.  Failure here leads to all subsequent steps failing.  Incompatibility between the driver version and the CUDA toolkit is a frequent culprit.

* **CUDA Toolkit Installation:** The CUDA toolkit provides the libraries and tools necessary for GPU programming.  TensorFlow leverages these libraries (cuDNN, specifically) to execute computations on the GPU.  An incomplete or improperly installed CUDA toolkit will prevent TensorFlow from recognizing the available GPUs.

* **Environment Variable Configuration:**  Crucially, environment variables such as `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux), and `PATH` must be set correctly to point to the appropriate CUDA libraries and drivers.  Inconsistent or incorrect settings here commonly lead to CUDA device unavailability.

* **Library Conflicts:**  Conflicting versions of CUDA libraries, or conflicts with other GPU-related libraries (e.g., ROCm), can disrupt TensorFlow's initialization process.  This necessitates careful management of library dependencies.

* **GPU Hardware Issues:**  While less frequent, underlying hardware problems with the GPU itself can also manifest as CUDA device unavailability.  This could involve physical damage to the GPU, overheating, or driver-level failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three code examples illustrating different aspects of troubleshooting CUDA device unavailability within TensorFlow.  These examples assume a basic familiarity with Python and TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Checking CUDA Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpus:
        print(f"Num GPUs Available: {len(gpus)}")
        for gpu in gpus:
            print(f"GPU Name: {gpu.name}")
            print(f"GPU Memory: {gpu.memory_limit}")
    else:
        print("No GPUs available.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error checking GPU availability: {e}")

```

This simple snippet checks for the presence of GPUs using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`.  A successful execution will list available GPUs along with their memory capacity.  A `RuntimeError` indicates a fundamental problem within the CUDA runtime environment, potentially related to driver or toolkit installation.


**Example 2: Setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES:**

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0' # Select GPU 0

try:
    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpus:
        # Restrict TensorFlow to only allocate on GPU 0
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
        print(f"TensorFlow is using GPU {gpus[0].name}")

    else:
        print("No GPUs available.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error configuring GPU: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates the use of `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to explicitly specify which GPUs TensorFlow should utilize. Setting it to '0' restricts TensorFlow to only use the first GPU. `tf.config.set_visible_devices` further refines this, and `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` helps manage GPU memory allocation dynamically.


**Example 3: Handling GPU Memory Growth:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)
```

This snippet demonstrates setting `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` to `True`. This allows TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed, preventing out-of-memory errors and improving resource utilization.  It is crucial to handle potential `RuntimeError` exceptions during this process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive troubleshooting, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on GPU support, the CUDA toolkit documentation, and the NVIDIA driver documentation.  Pay close attention to version compatibility matrices and system requirements.  Reviewing logs generated during TensorFlow initialization can provide valuable diagnostic information.  Utilizing a dedicated GPU monitoring tool can also help identify underlying hardware problems.  Finally, searching for specific error messages encountered within relevant online forums is generally effective.
