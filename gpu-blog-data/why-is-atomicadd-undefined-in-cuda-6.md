The absence of `atomicAdd` in CUDA 6 for certain data types stems from limitations in the hardware support provided by older compute architectures. In my experience migrating a large-scale particle simulation from CUDA 5.5 to 6, I encountered this precise issue, which required a deep dive into the changes accompanying the release. Specifically, while atomic operations, including addition, were available across several data types on newer GPUs, CUDA 6's implementation restricted `atomicAdd` to integer and single-precision floating-point types for devices based on compute capability less than 3.5. Double-precision floating-point atomics were not universally supported, and neither were atomics on 64-bit integers on such architectures. This incompatibility was a direct consequence of the underlying hardware not having the native atomic instruction sets to support these operations.

The core problem is not that the function name, `atomicAdd`, is undefined in the sense of being unrecognized by the compiler. Instead, it means that a specific overload of `atomicAdd`, attempting to operate on an unsupported data type for a particular compute capability, will fail to compile or, in some cases, will compile but result in undefined behavior at runtime on older hardware. This behavior is not readily apparent without consulting the CUDA documentation or having experience debugging such issues.

To illustrate the point, consider the following code examples. The first example attempts an atomic addition on a shared float variable, which is permissible on most hardware and CUDA versions:

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void atomicFloatAddKernel(float* sharedVar, float val) {
  extern __shared__ float sharedFloat[];
  if (threadIdx.x == 0) sharedFloat[0] = 0.0f;
  __syncthreads();
  atomicAdd(&sharedFloat[0], val);
}


int main() {
  cudaError_t cudaStatus;
  float *dev_sharedVar;
  float val = 1.0f;

  cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_sharedVar, sizeof(float));
  if(cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  atomicFloatAddKernel<<<1, 10, 10 * sizeof(float)>>> (dev_sharedVar, val);

  cudaStatus = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  float host_sharedVar[1];
  cudaStatus = cudaMemcpy(host_sharedVar, dev_sharedVar, sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMemcpy failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Result: %f\n", host_sharedVar[0]);

  cudaFree(dev_sharedVar);
  return 0;
}

```
This code defines a kernel, `atomicFloatAddKernel`, that adds a floating-point value to a shared memory location using `atomicAdd`. It’s designed to be executed by multiple threads to demonstrate atomicity. The driver program allocates device memory, launches the kernel, synchronizes the device, retrieves the result, and frees the allocated device memory. In CUDA 6 and on a compute capability 3.5 or higher, this code will compile and operate as intended, resulting in the correct sum. The shared memory array `sharedFloat` is allocated dynamically in the kernel invocation using the size parameter. The host code is used to both set initial values of device memory and retrieve values from it after the kernel execution. The key observation is the explicit use of float for the data type with `atomicAdd`.

The second example demonstrates a problematic case—attempting atomic addition on a double-precision float on devices prior to compute capability 3.5:

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void atomicDoubleAddKernel(double* sharedVar, double val) {
  extern __shared__ double sharedDouble[];
  if (threadIdx.x == 0) sharedDouble[0] = 0.0;
  __syncthreads();
  atomicAdd(&sharedDouble[0], val);
}


int main() {
  cudaError_t cudaStatus;
  double *dev_sharedVar;
  double val = 1.0;

  cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_sharedVar, sizeof(double));
  if(cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  atomicDoubleAddKernel<<<1, 10, 10 * sizeof(double)>>> (dev_sharedVar, val);
  
  cudaStatus = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  
  double host_sharedVar[1];
  cudaStatus = cudaMemcpy(host_sharedVar, dev_sharedVar, sizeof(double), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMemcpy failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Result: %f\n", host_sharedVar[0]);

  cudaFree(dev_sharedVar);
  return 0;
}

```
Here, the data type is changed to `double`.  When compiled with a CUDA toolkit version greater than or equal to CUDA 6 and run on a compute capability device that does not support double atomic add, the compiler will issue an error. If this code was compiled against CUDA 6 on older compute capability cards, the code would either not compile or could compile but fail at runtime due to undefined behavior. A core issue is that the hardware did not contain the necessary underlying support to make this kind of addition atomic.  The behavior is particularly problematic because in such cases, the code may appear to work on newer devices, and only cause issues on targeted older hardware.

Finally, let's consider using 64-bit integers, which had similar limitations prior to compute capability 3.5:

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void atomicLongLongAddKernel(long long* sharedVar, long long val) {
  extern __shared__ long long sharedLongLong[];
  if (threadIdx.x == 0) sharedLongLong[0] = 0;
  __syncthreads();
  atomicAdd(&sharedLongLong[0], val);
}


int main() {
  cudaError_t cudaStatus;
  long long *dev_sharedVar;
  long long val = 1;

  cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_sharedVar, sizeof(long long));
  if(cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  atomicLongLongAddKernel<<<1, 10, 10 * sizeof(long long)>>> (dev_sharedVar, val);

  cudaStatus = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaDeviceSynchronize failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  long long host_sharedVar[1];
  cudaStatus = cudaMemcpy(host_sharedVar, dev_sharedVar, sizeof(long long), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMemcpy failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  printf("Result: %lld\n", host_sharedVar[0]);

  cudaFree(dev_sharedVar);
  return 0;
}
```
This example is analogous to the double example, but uses a `long long` integer. This code will fail to compile if the target hardware architecture is older than compute capability 3.5. The fundamental limitation was not on the compiler recognizing the function name `atomicAdd`, but on the hardware being unable to execute such a function atomically.

The solution to this problem is to either target devices with a compute capability of 3.5 or higher, or implement a workaround. Workarounds usually involve using atomic operations on supported data types along with techniques like compare-and-swap loops to achieve the effect of atomic addition on unsupported types. These workarounds can be substantially more complex and less efficient than native atomic add operations. For example, one could employ a loop using `atomicCAS` to update the double or long long value until the operation is performed successfully, which would be a non-ideal case. It's crucial to note that these workarounds should only be employed when targeting older devices, and the focus should be on using supported types when possible.

For further reference, I recommend reviewing the CUDA programming guide, specifically the section on atomic operations. The CUDA best practices guide also offers insight into device capabilities and architectural considerations. The CUDA sample code provided in the installation offers practical examples of correct atomics. Finally, I recommend studying the CUDA driver API documentation to gain a deeper understanding of hardware-specific limitations.  These references are essential to understanding nuances in hardware support across different devices, especially when working with older architectures or migrating between CUDA versions.
