GPU memory unavailability, often reported as "CUDA out of memory" or similar errors, stems from a finite resource pool being depleted, usually due to applications exceeding their allocated share or fundamental limitations of the hardware. This is a common hurdle I've encountered numerous times while developing high-performance computing simulations, particularly when working with large datasets or complex neural network models on resource-constrained systems. It’s not always a straightforward issue and requires careful analysis to pinpoint the specific cause and implement effective mitigation strategies.

The root of the problem lies in the architecture of modern GPUs. They possess dedicated memory (VRAM) which is separate from system RAM. This VRAM is optimized for parallel processing, facilitating the rapid computation of vast datasets. However, this memory, unlike system RAM, is typically significantly smaller and has higher bandwidth. This characteristic makes it prone to being quickly consumed by computationally intensive operations, resulting in 'out of memory' errors. Effectively, when your application attempts to allocate more data than the available VRAM can accommodate, the allocation fails, triggering the error.

Beyond the fundamental limitation of finite memory, several common scenarios contribute to memory unavailability. One significant factor is improper memory management within the application. This includes retaining unnecessary intermediate results, loading unnecessarily large datasets at once, failing to free allocated memory after use, and inefficient data movement between host and device memory. Another cause is the misconfiguration of deep learning frameworks, such as an incorrect batch size selection. A batch size that's too large can lead to memory exhaustion, whereas an overly small batch size can hinder performance. This is not a simple trade-off but often something I've seen requires iterative experimentation. Lastly, other processes, even those running in the background, can also allocate GPU memory, decreasing the resources available to the primary process, sometimes leading to race conditions and seemingly inexplicable memory errors.

Let's consider a few common situations that I’ve frequently observed in practice. The first scenario involves a simulation code that’s processing large volume data.

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp

def process_data_naive(size):
    data_cpu = np.random.rand(size, size) # generate data on CPU
    data_gpu = cp.asarray(data_cpu)    # Copy it to GPU
    result_gpu = cp.matmul(data_gpu, data_gpu) # perform matrix multiplication
    return result_gpu

if __name__ == "__main__":
    size = 10000  # A very large matrix
    result_gpu = process_data_naive(size)
    print(f"Result shape on GPU: {result_gpu.shape}")
```
This rudimentary example uses CuPy, a NumPy-compatible library for GPU programming, to generate and process large matrices. The problem here is that a matrix of size 10000x10000 requires 800MB of memory when stored as a double precision floating point, but this is only considering one matrix. This code would quickly result in an 'out of memory' error on a GPU with limited VRAM. This naive approach of loading all data onto the GPU, without considering the available memory, is frequently a cause of unavailability. The remedy lies in chunking the data, that is, breaking it into small pieces, processing each separately, then combining the results.

Another common cause comes in the form of poorly managed variables in deep learning, especially during the forward and backward pass.
```python
import torch

def train_model(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_samples, batch_size):
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(
      torch.nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
      torch.nn.ReLU(),
      torch.nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    )
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss()
    input_data = torch.randn(num_samples, input_size).cuda()
    target_data = torch.randn(num_samples, output_size).cuda()
    
    for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size): # Iterate through data in batches
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        input_batch = input_data[i:i+batch_size]
        target_batch = target_data[i:i+batch_size]
        output = model(input_batch)
        loss = criterion(output, target_batch)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    return model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_size, hidden_size, output_size = 100, 500, 10
    num_samples = 100000
    batch_size = 20000 # Too large batch size
    model = train_model(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_samples, batch_size)
```
In this deep learning snippet, a large batch size is deliberately set. Though batch processing is intended to mitigate memory issues by splitting a large dataset into smaller chunks, setting a batch size that’s too large still leads to an out of memory error, as the intermediate gradients, model parameters, and inputs take up substantial space. Proper tuning of the batch size, often via hyperparameter optimization, is essential, as the tradeoff between computational throughput and memory usage can be subtle. An improperly selected learning rate can lead to large weights and gradient changes. Sometimes reducing the batch size and updating more frequently can also work, although the learning might become more jittery.

Lastly, it is not always an obvious issue within the code, but one of external resource contention. Consider a code that attempts to allocate all available GPU memory without consideration of other processes:
```python
import torch
import time

def allocate_all_memory():
    try:
      allocation = torch.rand(1000000000, device="cuda") # Attempt to use almost all memory
      print(f"Allocated memory on GPU:{allocation.numel()}")
      time.sleep(600)
      print(f"Releasing GPU memory...")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during allocation: {e}")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    allocate_all_memory()
```
This code tries to allocate a large amount of memory, often more than what is available, by generating a massive tensor and placing it on the GPU. This leads to either a complete exhaustion of GPU memory, or, when managed through exceptions, can still cause memory fragmentation and prevent further allocations. This demonstrates how even a seemingly innocuous allocation operation could block other processes. The mitigation strategy involves either the release of the allocation or a more careful selection of what to place on the GPU.

Several practices can be incorporated to prevent or alleviate GPU memory issues. These typically involve more diligent coding practices. Firstly, it's crucial to monitor GPU memory consumption using tools like `nvidia-smi`. Doing this provides insight into the memory footprint of your applications, allowing you to pinpoint bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. Secondly, minimizing data transfers between the host and GPU is vital, as it's costly and memory intensive. Whenever possible, perform computations entirely on the GPU. Thirdly, careful data handling is essential. Freeing up GPU memory when variables are no longer needed, using data types that consume less memory, and re-using pre-allocated memory can greatly reduce the memory footprint. Furthermore, using data loaders to stream data onto the GPU in batches rather than loading everything at once is essential.

For further learning, I recommend focusing on resources covering:
* **GPU Programming Fundamentals:** Specifically CUDA or OpenCL, as understanding the architecture of GPU processing is critical.
* **Memory Management in GPU Applications:** This includes topics such as memory allocation, deallocation, and memory pooling techniques.
* **Deep Learning Framework Optimization:** Knowledge of memory-efficient techniques, including gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training, is valuable for neural networks.
* **Debugging Tools for GPU Applications:** Familiarity with profilers that enable one to track memory usage and identify bottlenecks in GPU code.
* **CUDA Documentation and Examples:** This is essential for understanding CUDA programming. Similarly, documentation for frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow is valuable.

Ultimately, managing GPU memory effectively is a matter of informed design, diligent resource tracking, and adopting efficient coding strategies. These are not concepts limited to one field, but useful for any computationally intensive workload on a GPU.
