The core challenge in loading weights into a TensorFlow model with a differing input size stems from the inherent shape dependencies in fully connected layers and convolutional layers' weights, and the need to reconcile these with the new model's architecture. I've encountered this specific scenario numerous times while adapting pre-trained models for novel image resolutions and text embedding lengths. A direct weight loading attempt often results in dimension mismatch errors, necessitating careful manipulation of the pre-trained weights.

The fundamental problem lies in how weights are structured. In a fully connected layer, the weight matrix's dimensions are directly tied to the input size and the output size of that particular layer. A change in input size modifies the first dimension of this matrix. Similarly, in convolutional layers, while filter sizes themselves are not input-size-dependent, the number of input channels – reflecting the depth of the preceding layer’s output – must align. If this depth changes due to a different input size at the model's start, a direct weight copy becomes unfeasible. The key strategy is therefore not to force a direct weight transplant, but to selectively transfer weights where compatibility exists and, in other cases, to either initialize new weights or adapt existing ones using strategies like padding or reshaping.

Here's a breakdown of common scenarios and approaches using TensorFlow, along with illustrative code examples:

**Scenario 1: Fully Connected Layers with Differing Input Sizes**

If only the initial input layer changes and the rest of the model architecture is identical, a partial weight transfer might work. Consider this situation where an initial model was trained with an input size of 784, and the new model requires an input size of 1024. We have a pre-trained model with weights that include the `dense_layer_1` using a weight matrix of shape `(784, units)`, where `units` is the number of output neurons in that layer. Our new model will have a different weight matrix of shape `(1024, units)`. Attempting a direct assignment fails because of the mismatch in the first dimension. Instead, the strategy is to copy the intersection of the weights, typically the top-left quadrant of the weights matrix and augment the remaining values with initialized weights. We assume pre-trained weights are in a dictionary:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_partial_dense_weights(model, pretrained_weights, input_size, new_input_size):
    """Loads partial weights for the first dense layer based on input size."""
    
    layer_name = "dense_layer_1"  # name of the first dense layer
    if layer_name not in pretrained_weights:
        raise ValueError(f"Layer '{layer_name}' not found in pretrained weights.")
    
    pretrained_w = pretrained_weights[layer_name]['weights']  
    pretrained_b = pretrained_weights[layer_name]['bias']
    
    new_w = model.get_layer(layer_name).get_weights()[0]
    new_b = model.get_layer(layer_name).get_weights()[1]
    
    if pretrained_w.shape[1] != new_w.shape[1]:
         raise ValueError("Output dimension of the first dense layer does not match the pre-trained model")
    
    if pretrained_w.shape[0] == new_w.shape[0]:
        new_w = pretrained_w
    elif pretrained_w.shape[0] < new_w.shape[0]:
        new_w[:pretrained_w.shape[0], :] = pretrained_w
    else:
        new_w = new_w[:pretrained_w.shape[0],:]
    
    model.get_layer(layer_name).set_weights([new_w, pretrained_b])


# Example usage
# Assuming model and pretrained_weights are defined from the user
input_size = 784
new_input_size = 1024

# Create the test model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(new_input_size,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name="dense_layer_1"),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name="output_layer") 
])

# Create a mock pretrained model for testing
pretrained_model_weights = {
    'dense_layer_1':{'weights': np.random.normal(size=(input_size, 128)), 'bias':np.random.normal(size=(128))}
}

load_partial_dense_weights(model, pretrained_model_weights, input_size, new_input_size)

print("weights loaded successfully!")
```

In this example, `load_partial_dense_weights` handles the selective transfer, taking the compatible portion of the weight matrix and preserving it. The example uses a mock pre-trained weight matrix for demonstration; typically this would be derived from a saved model. If the new input size is *smaller*, it truncates the weight matrix appropriately. If the input is larger, it copies to the common intersection and leaves the remaining values as randomly initialized weights.

**Scenario 2: Convolutional Layers with Differing Input Sizes Due to Changed Input Channels**

Input size changes can alter the number of input channels to the initial convolutional layer. For example, if the original model was trained with color images (3 channels) and the new one is using grayscale (1 channel). The initial convolutional filter weights would be shaped as (filter_height, filter_width, input_channels, output_channels). Consequently, weight matrices with differing numbers of input channels will lead to a similar problem as the previous scenario, in the third dimension this time.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_partial_conv_weights(model, pretrained_weights, input_channels, new_input_channels):
    """Loads partial weights for the first convolutional layer based on input channels."""
    layer_name = "conv_layer_1"
    if layer_name not in pretrained_weights:
        raise ValueError(f"Layer '{layer_name}' not found in pretrained weights.")
        
    pretrained_w = pretrained_weights[layer_name]['weights']  
    pretrained_b = pretrained_weights[layer_name]['bias']
    
    new_w = model.get_layer(layer_name).get_weights()[0]
    new_b = model.get_layer(layer_name).get_weights()[1]
    
    if pretrained_w.shape[3] != new_w.shape[3]:
         raise ValueError("Output channel dimension of the first conv layer does not match the pre-trained model")
         
    if pretrained_w.shape[2] == new_w.shape[2]:
        new_w = pretrained_w
    elif pretrained_w.shape[2] < new_w.shape[2]:
        new_w[:,:,:pretrained_w.shape[2],:] = pretrained_w
    else:
        new_w = new_w[:,:,:pretrained_w.shape[2],:]
    
    model.get_layer(layer_name).set_weights([new_w, pretrained_b])

# Example Usage
input_channels = 3
new_input_channels = 1
filter_shape = (3,3)
num_filters = 32

# Test model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, new_input_channels)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(num_filters, filter_shape, activation='relu', name='conv_layer_1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Create mock pretrained model weights
pretrained_model_weights = {
    'conv_layer_1':{'weights': np.random.normal(size=(filter_shape[0], filter_shape[1], input_channels, num_filters)), 'bias':np.random.normal(size=(num_filters,))}
}

load_partial_conv_weights(model, pretrained_model_weights, input_channels, new_input_channels)

print("Conv weights loaded successfully!")
```
In `load_partial_conv_weights`, I've mirrored the logic of the previous example but focused on the input channel dimension. Again, only the shared channels are copied directly, and weights are reinitialized as required. For example, in converting a RGB (3 channel) image model to a grayscale (1 channel), only one channel's weights are copied, with the new two being reinitialized.

**Scenario 3: Reshaping Convolutional Weights**

When the number of input channels for a convolutional layer changes radically, instead of just padding or truncating, one can choose to average or reshape the weights. While such strategies may not always preserve all of the learned information, they can provide a good starting point for transfer learning. For instance, in a grayscale to RGB transfer, I would average the grayscale filter weights and apply them across all three RGB channels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def reshape_conv_weights(model, pretrained_weights, input_channels, new_input_channels):
    """Reshapes weights for the first convolutional layer to the new channel count."""
    
    layer_name = "conv_layer_1"
    if layer_name not in pretrained_weights:
        raise ValueError(f"Layer '{layer_name}' not found in pretrained weights.")
    
    pretrained_w = pretrained_weights[layer_name]['weights']
    pretrained_b = pretrained_weights[layer_name]['bias']
    
    new_w = model.get_layer(layer_name).get_weights()[0]
    new_b = model.get_layer(layer_name).get_weights()[1]

    if pretrained_w.shape[3] != new_w.shape[3]:
         raise ValueError("Output channel dimension of the first conv layer does not match the pre-trained model")

    if pretrained_w.shape[2] == new_w.shape[2]:
        new_w = pretrained_w
    elif pretrained_w.shape[2] == 1 and new_w.shape[2] == 3: #grayscale to RGB
      new_w = np.repeat(pretrained_w, 3, axis=2)
    elif pretrained_w.shape[2] == 3 and new_w.shape[2] == 1: # RGB to Grayscale
        new_w = np.mean(pretrained_w, axis=2, keepdims=True)

    model.get_layer(layer_name).set_weights([new_w, pretrained_b])


# Example usage
input_channels = 1  # Example grayscale input
new_input_channels = 3 # Example RGB input

filter_shape = (3,3)
num_filters = 32

# Define test model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, new_input_channels)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(num_filters, filter_shape, activation='relu', name='conv_layer_1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


# Create mock pretrained weights
pretrained_model_weights = {
    'conv_layer_1':{'weights': np.random.normal(size=(filter_shape[0], filter_shape[1], input_channels, num_filters)), 'bias':np.random.normal(size=(num_filters,))}
}


reshape_conv_weights(model, pretrained_model_weights, input_channels, new_input_channels)

print("Reshaped conv weights loaded successfully!")
```

The function `reshape_conv_weights` provides specific cases for common input channel transformations. More complex transformations or different initializations can be added to this approach as necessary. If the new number of channels is a multiple of the old number, a more advanced strategy can be used which duplicates filters.

These code examples highlight common strategies for dealing with weight loading in scenarios where input sizes differ. Ultimately the specific approach is dictated by the application needs and the desired level of transfer learning.

For additional information on model weight manipulation, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on model building, layer manipulation, and weight initialization. Furthermore, publications on transfer learning often contain detailed strategies for weight adaptation, particularly those dealing with image and natural language processing.
