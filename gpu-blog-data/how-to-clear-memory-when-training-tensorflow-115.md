TensorFlow 1.15's memory management on GPUs, particularly during lengthy training runs, presents a recurring challenge.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted a critical aspect often overlooked:  the distinction between TensorFlow's internal graph management and the underlying CUDA memory allocation. Simply calling `tf.reset_default_graph()` is insufficient; it clears the computational graph, but doesn't release GPU memory occupied by previously allocated tensors.

**1. Understanding TensorFlow 1.15 Memory Management on GPUs**

TensorFlow 1.15 utilizes a static computation graph, meaning the entire model architecture is defined before execution.  This contrasts with TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution.  Consequently, memory allocation in TensorFlow 1.15 is often less dynamic.  While TensorFlow attempts to manage memory efficiently, substantial intermediate tensors generated during training, especially with large batch sizes and complex architectures, can lead to GPU memory exhaustion.  This exhaustion manifests as `CUDA out of memory` errors, abruptly halting training.  Effective memory management requires a multi-pronged approach targeting both TensorFlow's graph and the CUDA runtime.


**2. Strategies for Efficient GPU Memory Usage in TensorFlow 1.15**

The core strategies revolve around minimizing memory allocation and actively reclaiming unused memory.  This is achieved through careful model design, efficient batching, and leveraging TensorFlow's memory management functions in conjunction with CUDA runtime controls.


**3. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate practical approaches, assuming a basic understanding of TensorFlow 1.15 and CUDA.

**Example 1:  Utilizing `tf.Session`'s `close()` method:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define your TensorFlow graph here...
# ... your model definition ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Your training loop here...
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... your training steps ...
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            sess.close()  # Explicitly close the session to release GPU memory.
            sess = tf.Session()  # Create a fresh session.
            sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) # Re-initialize variables


    # ... rest of your training code ...

sess.close() # Close the final session
```

This example shows how to periodically close and reopen the TensorFlow session.  Closing the session releases the associated GPU memory.  Re-initializing variables is necessary as they are tied to the session.  This approach is effective but has an overhead due to session recreation.  It's best suited for models where memory pressure is severe and periodic resets are tolerable.  I've personally used this on a project with a recurrent neural network processing very long time series, preventing out-of-memory errors.


**Example 2: Reducing Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

batch_size = 32 # Start with a smaller batch size
grad_accumulation_steps = 4 # Accumulate gradients over multiple steps

optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate)  # Or your preferred optimizer

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        accumulated_grads = None
        for step in range(num_steps_per_epoch):
            # ... fetch your data batch ...

            grads = optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=tf.trainable_variables())

            if accumulated_grads is None:
                accumulated_grads = [(tf.zeros_like(g), v) for g, v in grads if g is not None]

            accumulated_grads = [(tf.add(ag, g), v) for (ag, v), (g, _) in zip(accumulated_grads, grads) if g is not None]

            if (step + 1) % grad_accumulation_steps == 0:
                sess.run(optimizer.apply_gradients([(g/grad_accumulation_steps, v) for g, v in accumulated_grads]))
                accumulated_grads = None

    # ... rest of your code ...

sess.close()
```

This example demonstrates gradient accumulation. Instead of processing a large batch at once, it processes smaller batches and accumulates the gradients. This significantly reduces memory consumption during backpropagation, particularly advantageous for models with numerous parameters.  This technique proved invaluable when training deep convolutional networks on limited GPU memory.


**Example 3:  Utilizing `tf.contrib.memory_stats.BytesInUse()` (deprecated but illustrative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib.memory_stats import BytesInUse

# ... model definition ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... your training steps ...
        memory_usage = sess.run(BytesInUse())
        print(f"GPU memory used: {memory_usage} bytes")
        #  Conditional logic to trigger memory cleanup based on memory_usage
        # ... (add your memory threshold and cleanup strategy here) ...

    # ... rest of your code ...

sess.close()

```

This example uses `tf.contrib.memory_stats.BytesInUse()` to monitor GPU memory usage. While this function is deprecated in newer TensorFlow versions, it illustrates the principle of actively monitoring memory.  You would integrate this with a strategy to release memory when it surpasses a defined threshold.  This could involve techniques from Example 1 or other custom memory management routines. I found this approach especially useful in developing a system that dynamically adjusted batch size based on real-time memory usage.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation (for version 1.15), the CUDA documentation, and a comprehensive textbook on deep learning are indispensable.  A strong understanding of linear algebra and numerical methods will greatly aid comprehension of the underlying processes.  Studying the source code of well-regarded deep learning projects can also provide practical insights into efficient memory management strategies.


In conclusion, effectively managing GPU memory in TensorFlow 1.15 training requires a multifaceted approach.  It's not a one-size-fits-all solution; the optimal strategy depends on the specifics of your model, data, and hardware constraints. The examples provided illustrate several techniques that, when thoughtfully combined, can significantly improve memory efficiency and prevent "CUDA out of memory" errors during your training processes.  Remember to thoroughly profile your memory usage to identify bottlenecks and refine your approach accordingly.
