The "NotImplementedError" in TensorFlow's functional API typically stems from attempting an operation unsupported by the chosen backend or a mismatch between the expected input tensor shapes and the actual shapes fed into a custom layer or model.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue numerous times while developing custom layers for image segmentation and sequence modeling tasks, often tracing it back to subtle inconsistencies in tensor dimensions or unsupported operations within custom loss functions.  A thorough examination of your model architecture, input data preprocessing, and custom component implementations is crucial for resolving this.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow's functional API offers a high degree of flexibility in constructing complex models.  However, this flexibility comes with the responsibility of ensuring each component is correctly defined and compatible with the underlying computational graph.  The "NotImplementedError" arises when TensorFlow's execution engine encounters an operation it cannot perform given the current configuration.  Several contributing factors warrant investigation:

* **Backend Limitations:**  TensorFlow supports various backends, including CPU, GPU, and TPU.  Certain operations might be optimized for specific backends.  If your model relies on an operation not implemented for the selected backend, you'll encounter the error. Verify your backend selection using `tf.config.list_physical_devices()`.  During my work on a real-time object detection system, I inadvertently used a GPU-specific operation while running on a CPU, leading to this error.

* **Shape Mismatches:** The functional API meticulously tracks tensor shapes.  If the shapes of input tensors to a layer, custom function, or loss function don't match the expected shapes defined within those components, TensorFlow will raise a "NotImplementedError." This is particularly common with convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and custom loss functions involving element-wise operations on tensors of unequal dimensions.  I once spent a considerable amount of time debugging a recurrent neural network, only to discover a mismatch between the batch size in my input data and the batch size implicitly assumed in my custom recurrent layer.

* **Unsupported Operations within Custom Components:** When defining custom layers or loss functions, ensure that all operations used are supported by TensorFlow.  Employing operations or mathematical functions not readily available within TensorFlow's core library can trigger this error.  For instance, attempting to use a custom activation function defined using a non-differentiable operation will likely fail. In one project involving a novel attention mechanism, I overlooked the differentiability requirement, causing this error.

* **Incorrect Use of `tf.function`:** The `tf.function` decorator, while beneficial for performance optimization, can mask errors.  If used improperly, particularly when dealing with custom layers or functions with complex control flow, it might hide shape mismatches or unsupported operations until runtime, manifesting as a "NotImplementedError".

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Shape Mismatch in Convolutional Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Input shape crucial
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect input shape will lead to error
incorrect_input = tf.random.normal((10, 32, 32, 1))  # Shape mismatch!
model.predict(incorrect_input) # Raises "NotImplementedError" or similar error.
```

This example demonstrates a common scenario.  The convolutional layer expects an input of shape (batch_size, 28, 28, 1). Providing an input with a different height or width will result in a shape mismatch, often manifesting as a "NotImplementedError" or a more specific error detailing the incompatibility.


**Example 2: Unsupported Operation in Custom Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Hypothetical unsupported operation
        result = tf.py_function(lambda x: x**0.5, [inputs], tf.float32) # Avoid this approach for tensors.
        return result

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 32))
model.predict(input_tensor) # Might raise NotImplementedError if the operation is not supported by tf.
```

This demonstrates a custom layer attempting a potentially unsupported operation (`tf.py_function` with a non-differentiable operation). TensorFlow's automatic differentiation relies on its supported operations.  Using `tf.py_function` should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and even then, ensuring its operation is differentiable is essential.  Using built-in TensorFlow operations is always preferable.

**Example 3:  Improper Use of `tf.function`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_custom_function(x, y):
    if tf.shape(x)[0] != tf.shape(y)[0]:
        return tf.zeros_like(x)  #This could lead to issues
    return x + y

x = tf.random.normal((10, 32))
y = tf.random.normal((20, 32))  #Different batch size

result = my_custom_function(x, y)
print(result) # Might raise NotImplementedError in the context of model fitting
```

Here, the `tf.function` decorator is used with a function containing a conditional statement that might lead to inconsistent tensor shapes within the TensorFlow graph. While the conditional logic is seemingly handled correctly, the dynamic nature of the shape check within `tf.function` can, depending on the execution context, cause problems during automatic differentiation or within a larger model.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation is your primary resource.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing the functional API, custom layer implementation, and shape constraints.  Thoroughly examine the API documentation for each layer and function used in your model. Consult relevant TensorFlow books and tutorials that offer detailed guidance on building complex models using the functional API.  If debugging proves difficult, explore TensorFlow's debugging tools, such as the TensorFlow Profiler and the debugger interface, to identify the precise location and cause of the error.  The Keras documentation can also be invaluable, as many functional API constructs build upon Keras concepts. Finally, searching for the specific error message on relevant forums and Q&A sites can provide targeted solutions.  Remember that carefully reviewing the shape information at each step in your code is crucial for avoiding such issues.
