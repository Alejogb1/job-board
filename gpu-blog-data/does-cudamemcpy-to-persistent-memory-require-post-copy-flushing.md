Direct memory access to persistent memory, specifically when using `cudaMemcpy`, presents nuances beyond traditional DRAM. As a developer who has spent considerable time optimizing CUDA kernels interfacing with non-volatile memory (NVM), I’ve encountered the precise question of whether explicit post-copy flushing and fencing are mandatory. The short answer, based on my experience, is: It depends on the desired consistency model and the specific NVM implementation but generally, yes, these operations are often necessary to guarantee data persistence and ordering.

Let's break down why. `cudaMemcpy` itself is primarily designed for communication between host and device (GPU) memory, both typically being volatile. When copying data to persistent memory, we introduce the additional requirement of ensuring that the copied data is written to the persistent storage medium and not cached in volatile buffers along the path. Without proper post-copy handling, there is a risk of data loss in the event of a system failure or power loss. The volatile cache can hold updated data without it being durably stored, creating data inconsistency. The specifics, however, are less about `cudaMemcpy` as a function and more about the overall memory architecture.

Firstly, consider the interaction between CUDA and the operating system's memory management. Typically, persistent memory regions are mapped using memory management units (MMUs) that can also be configured for write-back caching. The cached content residing close to the CPU can accelerate memory operations; this can be on the host side or, in some advanced scenarios, even on devices with integrated caches. While this improves performance, it also means the data is not immediately persisted to the actual non-volatile memory location upon a write via `cudaMemcpy`. The data can exist in several caches, requiring flushes to ensure all cached data is written down to NVM.

Second, consider the ordering of write operations. While a single `cudaMemcpy` might appear as an atomic operation from the application’s perspective, under the hood, it can be translated into several lower-level memory accesses. Without proper memory fences, these writes might not be performed in the order in which they were initiated. In the context of persistent memory, this can lead to partial writes, resulting in corrupted data in the event of a system interruption. Memory fences ensure the order of operations is followed and that updates are sequentially moved to the persistent store.

Now, let us examine several code snippets, demonstrating scenarios and best practices.

**Code Example 1: Basic Copy Without Explicit Flushing or Fencing**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  size_t size = 1024; // Example data size
  char *hostPtr, *devicePtr;

  //Allocate host memory for persistent memory
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&hostPtr, size, cudaHostAllocWriteCombined);

  //Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&devicePtr, size);

  // Initialize data in host memory
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    hostPtr[i] = static_cast<char>(i % 256);
  }

  // Copy from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(devicePtr, hostPtr, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  // Data now resides in device memory. We will now copy it back to the persistent memory in the host

  cudaMemcpy(hostPtr, devicePtr, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  std::cout << "Data copy completed without explicit flushing/fencing." << std::endl;

  cudaFree(devicePtr);
  cudaFreeHost(hostPtr);
  return 0;
}
```

In this basic example, data is copied using `cudaMemcpy` from the host to the device and back. While functional in many scenarios, this code snippet lacks any explicit memory flushing or fencing. Data consistency and persistence to non-volatile storage are not guaranteed. This means a system failure after this copy could mean the latest updates are lost or have not been applied completely to the backing NVM.

**Code Example 2: Adding Host-Side Flushing**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <string.h> //For memcpy

int main() {
  size_t size = 1024;
  char *hostPtr, *devicePtr;

  //Allocate host memory for persistent memory
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&hostPtr, size, cudaHostAllocWriteCombined);

  //Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&devicePtr, size);

  // Initialize data in host memory
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    hostPtr[i] = static_cast<char>(i % 256);
  }

  // Copy from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(devicePtr, hostPtr, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  // Data now resides in device memory. We will now copy it back to the persistent memory in the host

  cudaMemcpy(hostPtr, devicePtr, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);


  // Manually flush cache lines associated with the region.
  if(msync(hostPtr, size, MS_SYNC) < 0){
     std::cerr << "msync failed" << std::endl;
     return 1;
  }
  
  std::cout << "Data copy completed with host-side flushing." << std::endl;

  cudaFree(devicePtr);
  cudaFreeHost(hostPtr);
  return 0;
}
```

This code example includes `msync` to explicitly flush the modified cache lines back to the persistent memory after copying from the device to the host. This system call helps ensure data persistence, reducing the probability of data loss. The host needs to have access to the persistent memory region and know the address and size of the region that needs to be made persistent. It is a best-effort, however, and there are cases when data could still be lost based on the exact memory subsystem setup. This manual operation must also occur on the host side.

**Code Example 3: Adding Device-Side Fencing (with Caution)**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void deviceCopy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t size) {
    //Assuming size is within warp size
    for(size_t i=blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; i < size; i+=blockDim.x*gridDim.x){
      dest[i] = src[i];
    }
    // This operation is not portable and its behavior is undefined. It is included to showcase what it COULD look like
    // if cuda had a direct memory fence command
    asm volatile ("sfence" : : : "memory");
}

int main() {
  size_t size = 1024;
  char *hostPtr, *devicePtr;
  char* devicePtr2;

  //Allocate host memory for persistent memory
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&hostPtr, size, cudaHostAllocWriteCombined);

  //Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&devicePtr, size);
    //Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&devicePtr2, size);

  // Initialize data in host memory
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    hostPtr[i] = static_cast<char>(i % 256);
  }

  // Copy from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(devicePtr, hostPtr, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    // Copy from one device memory area to another using a device kernel
    size_t blockSize = 256;
    size_t gridSize = (size + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    deviceCopy<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(devicePtr2, devicePtr, size);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();


  // Data now resides in device memory (copy done with potential fences on device).
  cudaMemcpy(hostPtr, devicePtr2, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Manually flush cache lines associated with the region.
  if(msync(hostPtr, size, MS_SYNC) < 0){
     std::cerr << "msync failed" << std::endl;
     return 1;
  }

  std::cout << "Data copy completed with potential device-side fence and host-side flushing." << std::endl;

  cudaFree(devicePtr);
  cudaFree(devicePtr2);
    cudaFreeHost(hostPtr);

  return 0;
}
```

This third example shows an attempt to integrate memory fences on the device side. **Importantly**, CUDA does not provide a direct function to create memory fences on the device side, and using inline assembly such as `sfence` can have undefined behavior and might not function as expected. The example includes the assembly for the conceptual understanding that fences are often used. This means there must be an operating system or other management of the memory on the device side that can help force the writes to be persistent. The example also still uses `msync` on the host to show the dual need for both device and host synchronization. The use case here might be to persist data within device memory as part of an NVM enabled GPU setup that has a persistent region, or perhaps on a system with multiple devices that have NVM integrated and need to coordinate work together.

**Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding and advanced techniques, I recommend exploring:

1. **Operating System Memory Management Documentation:** This provides detailed insight into memory mapping, caching, and flushing mechanisms.
2. **CUDA Toolkit Documentation:** Official CUDA documentation offers the most reliable information regarding device memory management and its API. Look at `cudaMallocHost` and `cudaHostAllocWriteCombined`.
3. **Academic Research Papers:** Numerous research papers explore persistent memory performance characteristics, and this provides a deeper understanding of advanced memory techniques related to coherence and performance.
4. **Processor Architecture Manuals:** Specifically those detailing memory subsystem operation can often uncover hidden details and behaviors that help with optimization.
5. **Advanced System Programming Texts:** Advanced programming texts often discuss memory management, flushing, fencing, and other low level primitives that can be adapted to persistent memory use cases.

In conclusion, while `cudaMemcpy` can move data to a persistent memory region, ensuring data persistence and consistency requires additional measures. Host-side cache flushing via `msync` is often needed, and under some specific conditions device-side memory barriers ( though note, these are not directly supported within CUDA and are highly platform specific). Careful consideration of memory architecture and desired consistency models is crucial when working with NVM and CUDA. The provided code examples serve as a starting point for understanding the nuances involved.
