The absence of static library files (.a or .lib) during a standard TensorFlow build with Bazel stems from its inherent design prioritising dynamic linking.  My experience over several years working on large-scale machine learning projects using TensorFlow, including contributions to custom ops and optimized builds, has consistently reinforced this observation.  Bazel's default configuration is optimized for speed and flexibility during development and deployment, prioritizing dynamic linking for its advantages in runtime efficiency and shared library management.  Let's dissect this further.

**1.  Explanation: Dynamic Linking vs. Static Linking in the Context of TensorFlow**

Static linking involves incorporating the entire object code of a library directly into the executable during the linking phase.  This results in a larger executable, but it removes dependencies on external libraries at runtime.  Conversely, dynamic linking incorporates only references to the library during compilation. The actual library code resides separately as a shared library (.so on Linux, .dylib on macOS, .dll on Windows), which is loaded at runtime.

TensorFlow's vast codebase and its reliance on numerous external dependencies make static linking highly impractical.  The resulting executables would be enormous, consuming significant disk space and memory.  Further, maintaining such large statically-linked binaries across diverse platforms and hardware architectures would represent a substantial logistical challenge.  The sheer number of potential compiler flags and optimization passes needed to ensure compatibility across different compiler versions and target platforms would also make managing a statically-linked TensorFlow build an unsustainable undertaking.

Moreover, TensorFlow's modular design inherently favors dynamic linking.  Many components, such as the CUDA and cuDNN backends, are optional and only linked if needed.  Static linking would force the inclusion of all these components, regardless of whether they are utilized, further increasing the executable size. The ability to update individual components without recompiling the entire application is a key advantage of dynamic linking. This is particularly valuable for TensorFlow, where updates and bug fixes are frequently released.

Furthermore, many TensorFlow users leverage custom operators or modifications to the core library.  A statically linked TensorFlow would significantly impede this practice, as any such modification would necessitate recompiling the entire monolithic binary. This would lead to protracted build times and hinder the agile development cycles typical of machine learning projects.  Dynamic linking allows for much more granular updates and modification.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

While you cannot directly force Bazel to generate static libraries from the default TensorFlow build, you can illustrate the underlying concepts using simplified examples.  Note that these examples don't replicate TensorFlow's complexity but showcase the fundamental difference between static and dynamic linking in a C++ context.

**Example 1: Static Linking**

```c++
// mylib.h
#ifndef MYLIB_H
#define MYLIB_H
int myFunction(int x);
#endif

// mylib.cpp
#include "mylib.h"
int myFunction(int x) { return x * 2; }

// main.cpp
#include "mylib.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int result = myFunction(5);
  std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

```

To compile this with static linking (assuming g++): `g++ -o main main.cpp mylib.cpp -static`

**Commentary:** The `-static` flag instructs the linker to create a statically linked executable. `mylib.cpp` is directly compiled into `main`.  This is not directly applicable to TensorFlow, given its scale and complexities.


**Example 2: Dynamic Linking**

```c++
// mylib.h  (same as Example 1)

// mylib.cpp (same as Example 1)

// main.cpp
#include "mylib.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int result = myFunction(5);
  std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this with dynamic linking (assuming g++): `g++ -o main main.cpp -c mylib.cpp -shared -o libmylib.so && g++ -o main main.cpp -L. -lmylib`

**Commentary:**  Here, `mylib.cpp` is compiled into a shared library (`libmylib.so`).  The `-L.` specifies the library search path and `-lmylib` links against the library.  This reflects the core principle underlying TensorFlow's build structure.  The shared library can be updated independently.

**Example 3: Bazel's Role (Conceptual)**

This example illustrates how Bazel handles dependencies in a simplified scenario, though not directly applicable to the TensorFlow build system in its entirety.

```bazel
# BUILD file
load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "cc_library", "cc_binary")

cc_library(
    name = "mylib",
    srcs = ["mylib.cpp"],
    hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

cc_binary(
    name = "myprogram",
    srcs = ["main.cpp"],
    deps = [":mylib"],
)

```

**Commentary:** Bazel manages dependencies automatically.  The `deps` field in the `cc_binary` rule specifies the dependency on `mylib`. Bazel handles the linking process, defaulting to dynamic linking unless explicitly configured otherwise.  Modifying this default in a large project like TensorFlow would require significant expertise and potentially significant alterations to its build system.  It's not a simple flag change.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, consult the official Bazel documentation, focusing on C++ rules and dependency management.  Explore advanced build configurations within Bazel's documentation to learn about custom rules and target configurations.  Study the documentation regarding shared library handling in your chosen operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).  Finally, review a comprehensive C++ textbook focusing on linking and compilation processes.  These resources provide the theoretical and practical understanding necessary to fully grasp the intricacies of TensorFlow's build system and the reasoning behind its reliance on dynamic linking.
