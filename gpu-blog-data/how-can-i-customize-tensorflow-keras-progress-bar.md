The core issue with customizing TensorFlow Keras progress bars lies not in the inherent limitations of the `tf.keras.utils.Progbar` class, but rather in its limited direct interface for textual manipulation.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this constraint, forcing me to delve into the underlying mechanics of the `Progbar` class and employ workarounds to achieve granular control over the displayed text.  Direct modification of the `Progbar` class itself is not recommended due to potential instability across TensorFlow versions.  Instead, a more robust approach leverages the `Progbar`'s internal state and the flexibility of custom callback functions.

**1. Understanding `tf.keras.utils.Progbar` Limitations and Workarounds**

The `tf.keras.utils.Progbar` class, while providing a convenient progress indicator, offers minimal customization regarding the displayed text. It primarily shows progress percentage, steps completed, and estimated time remaining.  Attempts to directly modify the internal `_write` method are discouraged, as such modifications may break with future TensorFlow updates.  My initial attempts to override the `update` method proved fragile; subtle changes in the internal workings of the `Progbar` often rendered my customizations incompatible.  A superior strategy involves creating a custom training callback that interacts with the model's training loop and independently manages progress display using alternative methods like `tqdm` or custom print statements.

**2. Implementing Custom Progress Bar Text via a Callback**

The most reliable way to customize Keras progress bar text involves crafting a custom callback that intercepts the training process and generates tailored progress updates.  This grants complete control over the displayed information and format, avoiding the inherent limitations of directly modifying the `Progbar` class.  Below are three code examples illustrating different levels of customization:

**Example 1: Simple Textual Augmentation**

This example demonstrates a basic extension of the default progress bar text, adding a custom metric to the displayed output.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomProgress(Callback):
    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        if logs is not None:
            # Access and display custom metrics
            custom_metric = logs.get('custom_metric', 0)
            print(f'\rBatch {batch+1}/{self.params["steps"]}, Custom Metric: {custom_metric:.4f}', end='', flush=True)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) #Your Model definition here
model.compile(...) #Your compilation here

custom_callback = CustomProgress()
model.fit(..., callbacks=[custom_callback])
```

This code defines a custom callback, `CustomProgress`. The `on_train_batch_end` method is overridden to access the `logs` dictionary provided by the training loop.  This dictionary contains metrics calculated during each batch.  We extract a hypothetical `custom_metric` (replace with your specific metric) and display it alongside the default progress information.  The `flush=True` argument ensures immediate output, preventing buffering issues.  Note that this method augments, not replaces, the default progress bar.


**Example 2: Replacing the Progress Bar with `tqdm`**

This example replaces the default `Progbar` with the more feature-rich `tqdm` library.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tqdm.keras import TqdmCallback
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomTqdm(Callback):
    def on_train_begin(self, logs=None):
        self.tqdm_callback = TqdmCallback(verbose=1)

    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
      self.tqdm_callback.on_epoch_begin(epoch, logs)

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
      self.tqdm_callback.on_epoch_end(epoch, logs)

    def on_train_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
      self.tqdm_callback.on_train_batch_begin(batch,logs)

    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
      self.tqdm_callback.on_train_batch_end(batch,logs)

    def on_test_begin(self, logs=None):
        self.tqdm_callback.on_test_begin(logs)

    def on_test_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.tqdm_callback.on_test_batch_begin(batch, logs)

    def on_test_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.tqdm_callback.on_test_batch_end(batch, logs)

    def on_test_end(self, logs=None):
        self.tqdm_callback.on_test_end(logs)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) #Your Model definition here
model.compile(...) #Your compilation here

custom_tqdm = CustomTqdm()
model.fit(..., callbacks=[custom_tqdm])

```

Here, a custom callback delegates progress bar rendering to `tqdm`.  `tqdm` offers more advanced features like dynamic descriptions and different progress bar styles.  This example leverages `TqdmCallback` for a seamless integration with Keras' training loop.  This approach is cleaner and more maintainable than directly manipulating `Progbar`.

**Example 3:  Completely Custom Progress Display**

This final example demonstrates complete control over the progress display by completely bypassing the built-in `Progbar`.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class FullCustomProgress(Callback):
    def on_train_begin(self, logs=None):
        print("Training started...")

    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}/{self.params['epochs']}")

    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        if logs is not None:
            loss = logs.get('loss')
            accuracy = logs.get('accuracy')
            print(f"Batch {batch+1}/{self.params['steps']} - Loss: {loss:.4f} - Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}", end='\r')

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        loss = logs.get('loss')
        accuracy = logs.get('accuracy')
        print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}/{self.params['epochs']} - Loss: {loss:.4f} - Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

    def on_train_end(self, logs=None):
        print("Training finished.")


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) #Your Model definition here
model.compile(...) #Your compilation here

custom_progress = FullCustomProgress()
model.fit(..., callbacks=[custom_progress])
```

This callback provides complete control, printing epoch and batch information according to a custom format. It removes the Keras `Progbar` entirely, offering maximal flexibility in progress display. This showcases a more advanced, though more verbose, solution for situations requiring intricate progress monitoring.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration into custom Keras callbacks and advanced progress bar implementations, consult the official TensorFlow documentation on callbacks and the `tqdm` library's documentation.  Understanding the structure of the Keras training loop and the information contained within the `logs` dictionary during training is crucial for effective custom callback development.  Familiarize yourself with Python's formatted string literals (`f-strings`) for efficient output formatting.  Thorough understanding of object-oriented programming principles will greatly aid in constructing robust and reusable callbacks.
