The necessity of `tf.reduce_mean` when implementing a custom loss function in TensorFlow hinges on the desired aggregation of individual losses across a batch.  In my experience developing and optimizing deep learning models for large-scale image classification, I've found that omitting this function often leads to unexpected and incorrect gradient calculations, especially when dealing with variable-sized batches or scenarios requiring per-example weighting.  While a simple sum might suffice for certain scenarios, `tf.reduce_mean` provides a crucial layer of normalization, ensuring consistent training behavior regardless of batch size.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's gradient descent optimizers operate on the *total* loss across a training batch.  A custom loss function typically computes a loss value for *each individual example* within that batch.  Without reduction using a function like `tf.reduce_mean` (or `tf.reduce_sum`), the optimizer receives a tensor of per-example losses. This tensor's shape is determined by the batch size, and the optimizer will attempt to compute gradients based on this multi-dimensional tensor.  This leads to several potential problems:

* **Incorrect Gradients:** The optimizer's calculations become significantly more complex and potentially inaccurate.  It needs to handle the entire tensor of losses, rather than a single scalar representing the average or total loss. This can lead to unstable training and prevent convergence.

* **Scale Dependence:** The magnitude of the loss gradients will directly depend on the batch size.  A larger batch size will result in larger loss values, potentially overwhelming the optimizer's learning rate adjustments. This variability hinders consistent model performance across different hardware and batch size configurations.

* **Inconsistent Behavior:** The training dynamics will become highly sensitive to the batch size, making it difficult to reproduce results and tune hyperparameters effectively.


`tf.reduce_mean` addresses these problems by collapsing the tensor of per-example losses into a single scalar value. This scalar represents the average loss across the batch, providing a consistent and easily interpretable measure for the optimizer to use.  This ensures that gradient calculations remain stable and independent of the batch size.  While `tf.reduce_sum` provides the total loss, `tf.reduce_mean` offers a normalized value which is usually preferable for consistent training behavior.

The choice between `tf.reduce_mean` and `tf.reduce_sum` becomes context-dependent when dealing with weighted losses or specialized training strategies.  For instance, in scenarios with class imbalance, weighting individual examples based on class frequency can be necessary. In such cases, summing the weighted individual losses (`tf.reduce_sum`) is appropriate before further normalization or scaling.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Mean Squared Error:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_mse(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates the mean squared error."""
  squared_diff = tf.square(y_true - y_pred)
  return tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff)

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8], [3.1, 3.9]])
loss = custom_mse(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward application of `tf.reduce_mean`. The function calculates the per-example squared difference and then averages these differences to produce the final MSE value.  This ensures consistent gradient updates across various batch sizes.


**Example 2:  Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights):
    """Calculates weighted binary cross-entropy."""
    epsilon = 1e-7 #added to avoid log(0)
    y_pred = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, epsilon, 1.0 - epsilon) #prevents log(0) error
    loss = -tf.reduce_sum(weights * (y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred) + (1.0 - y_true) * tf.math.log(1.0 - y_pred)))

    return loss

# Example usage
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.8, 0.3], [0.2, 0.7]])
weights = tf.constant([[0.5, 2.0], [2.0, 0.5]])  # Example weights
loss = weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights)
print(f"Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy: {loss.numpy()}")

```

Here, individual losses are weighted before summation using `tf.reduce_sum`. The resulting loss is a weighted sum of the individual example losses which reflects the class imbalance.  Note the use of tf.clip_by_value to prevent numerical instability. The final loss value is the total weighted loss across the batch, not a mean. Further normalization or scaling can be applied post-reduction depending on requirements.


**Example 3:  Per-example loss with custom aggregation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_with_aggregation(y_true, y_pred):
    """Custom loss function with per-example loss and custom aggregation."""
    per_example_loss = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred) # Example per-example loss function
    total_loss = tf.reduce_sum(per_example_loss)
    mean_loss = tf.reduce_mean(per_example_loss)

    # Return both the total and mean loss. The choice depends on optimization strategy
    return total_loss, mean_loss

# Example usage
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([1.1, 1.8, 3.2])
total_loss, mean_loss = custom_loss_with_aggregation(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Total Custom Loss: {total_loss.numpy()}")
print(f"Mean Custom Loss: {mean_loss.numpy()}")

```

This illustrates a scenario where both the total and the mean loss are relevant.  The choice of which to use for optimization depends on the specific training goals and optimizer properties. The mean loss is better for consistency, whereas the total loss might be preferable in certain weighted loss scenarios.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops, loss functions, and gradient calculations.  A comprehensive text on deep learning covering gradient-based optimization methods.  A relevant publication on advanced loss functions in deep learning.  Reviewing source code of established deep learning libraries can also provide insights.

In conclusion, while `tf.reduce_mean` is frequently essential for ensuring robust and stable training of deep learning models in TensorFlow, its necessity is conditional on the context of the loss function and the broader optimization strategy.  Careful consideration of the implications of batch size, weighting, and the specific properties of the gradient descent optimizer is crucial when designing and implementing custom loss functions.  The appropriate aggregation function – `tf.reduce_mean`, `tf.reduce_sum`, or a more complex custom aggregation – needs to be chosen based on the specific needs of the problem.
