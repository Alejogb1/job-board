The observed lack of multi-core utilization with `num_parallel_calls > 1` in TensorFlow 2.6, even on CPU, often stems from a misunderstanding of the function's scope and interaction with underlying threading models.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image processing pipelines revealed that `tf.data.Dataset.map`'s `num_parallel_calls` argument primarily controls the *degree of parallelism within the TensorFlow data pipeline*, not the level of parallelism at the operating system level.  Crucially, it doesn't inherently launch multiple threads or processes that fully exploit all available CPU cores.  The default Python interpreter's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) plays a significant role here.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.data.Dataset.map` applies a given function to each element of a dataset.  When `num_parallel_calls` is set to a value greater than 1, TensorFlow attempts to process multiple elements concurrently.  However, this concurrency happens *within the TensorFlow runtime*, not necessarily by directly spawning multiple operating system threads. The runtime might utilize internal thread pools, but their interaction with the OS's scheduler and the GIL is indirect and can be influenced by factors beyond `num_parallel_calls`.

The GIL, a mechanism in CPython (the standard Python implementation), prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously.  While TensorFlow operations are often implemented in C++ (thus bypassing the GIL for computationally intensive parts), the data transfer and function calls involved in `tf.data.Dataset.map` often involve Python code, which remains subject to the GIL. This means that even with multiple parallel calls, only one Python thread can actively execute Python code at a time; others might be waiting for I/O or other operations.

Furthermore, the efficiency of multi-core utilization depends on the nature of the mapping function. If the function itself is I/O-bound (e.g., reading files from disk), then increasing `num_parallel_calls` might yield performance gains as different files can be accessed concurrently. However, if the function is CPU-bound (e.g., intensive numerical computations), the GIL limitation will largely negate the benefits of increasing `num_parallel_calls` beyond a small number.  In such scenarios, employing multiprocessing rather than multithreading becomes necessary to fully utilize multiple cores.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: I/O-bound operation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import os

def read_file(filename):
  time.sleep(1) # Simulate I/O-bound operation
  with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    return f.read()

filenames = [f"file_{i}.txt" for i in range(10)]
for filename in filenames:
  open(filename, 'w').write("test") # Create dummy files

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(filenames)
dataset = dataset.map(read_file, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

start_time = time.time()
for item in dataset:
  pass
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time taken with AUTOTUNE: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(filenames)
dataset = dataset.map(read_file, num_parallel_calls=1)

start_time = time.time()
for item in dataset:
  pass
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time taken with num_parallel_calls=1: {end_time - start_time} seconds")


for filename in filenames:
  os.remove(filename) #clean up dummy files
```

In this example, `read_file` simulates an I/O-bound operation.  Increasing `num_parallel_calls` will likely improve performance, as multiple files can be read concurrently, bypassing the GIL's constraints on the I/O operations themselves.


**Example 2: CPU-bound operation (Illustrating GIL limitations)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

def cpu_bound_function(x):
  # Simulate CPU-bound operation
  total = 0
  for i in range(10000000):
    total += i * x
  return total

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
dataset = dataset.map(cpu_bound_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

start_time = time.time()
for item in dataset:
  pass
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time taken with AUTOTUNE: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
dataset = dataset.map(cpu_bound_function, num_parallel_calls=4)

start_time = time.time()
for item in dataset:
  pass
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time taken with num_parallel_calls=4: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

Here, `cpu_bound_function` simulates a CPU-bound task. Despite `num_parallel_calls = 4`, the performance improvement might be minimal or nonexistent due to the GIL's limitations.


**Example 3: Multiprocessing for CPU-bound operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import multiprocessing
import time

def cpu_bound_function(x):
    # Simulate CPU-bound operation
    total = 0
    for i in range(10000000):
        total += i * x
    return total

def process_data(data):
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(cpu_bound_function, data)
    return results

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
data_list = list(dataset.as_numpy_iterator())

start_time = time.time()
results = process_data(data_list)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time taken with multiprocessing: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

```

This example demonstrates how multiprocessing bypasses the GIL limitation for CPU-bound operations.  By utilizing `multiprocessing.Pool`, true parallel execution across multiple CPU cores is achieved. Note this is outside the `tf.data` pipeline and requires converting the dataset to a list first.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the GIL, consult the official Python documentation and relevant literature on concurrency in Python.  Study the TensorFlow documentation regarding the `tf.data` API and its performance optimization strategies, paying close attention to the distinctions between multithreading and multiprocessing. Explore resources on parallel programming concepts and the design of concurrent applications. Understanding thread pools and process pools is also critical.  Finally, familiarize yourself with profiling tools to measure the performance bottlenecks in your TensorFlow applications and pinpoint areas requiring optimization.
