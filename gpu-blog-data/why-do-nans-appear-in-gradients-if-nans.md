The propagation of NaN values through a neural network's gradient calculation, despite a seemingly correctly computed loss, stems fundamentally from the non-differentiable nature of NaN itself.  My experience debugging large-scale language models has repeatedly highlighted this issue, particularly during pre-training phases with noisy or incomplete datasets. While the loss function might yield a finite value due to robust handling of NaN inputs (e.g., ignoring or masking them), the subsequent backpropagation process faces an insurmountable challenge: the derivative of any function with respect to NaN is undefined, leading to NaN gradients.  This is not a bug in the automatic differentiation algorithms; it's a direct consequence of the mathematical properties of NaN.

The core problem lies in the chain rule of calculus, the bedrock of backpropagation.  The chain rule dictates that the gradient of a composite function is the product of the gradients of its constituent functions. If any of these constituent gradients is NaN, the entire gradient will become NaN, irrespective of the values of other gradients in the chain. This cascading effect can render large portions of the gradient unusable, effectively halting the training process.

Let's illustrate this with concrete examples. Consider a simplified neural network with a single hidden layer, using a mean squared error (MSE) loss function. We'll analyze how NaNs propagate through forward and backward passes.

**Example 1:  NaN in Input Layer**

Assume a simple network with one input neuron (`x`), one hidden neuron (`h`), and one output neuron (`y`). The activation function for the hidden layer is a sigmoid, and the output layer is linear.

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([np.nan])  # NaN input
w1 = np.array([0.5])     # Weight between input and hidden layer
w2 = np.array([1.0])     # Weight between hidden and output layer

h = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-w1 * x))  # Sigmoid activation
y_pred = w2 * h             # Linear output layer

loss = (y_true - y_pred)**2  # MSE loss, y_true is assumed to be a finite value.

# Backpropagation (simplified)
dy_pred = 2 * (y_pred - y_true)
dh = dy_pred * w2
dw1 = dh * h * (1 - h) * x # NaN propagated here due to x
dw2 = dy_pred * h
```

Here, even if `y_true` is a valid number and the loss is calculated successfully (possibly ignoring the NaN contribution),  `dw1` will be NaN because it involves a multiplication with the NaN input `x`. The derivative of the sigmoid with respect to `x` will be finite (depending on `h`), but the multiplication by `x` makes the entire expression NaN.

**Example 2: NaN in Weight**

Now let's consider a scenario where the NaN occurs in the weights instead of the input.

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1.0])
w1 = np.array([np.nan])
w2 = np.array([1.0])

h = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-w1 * x)) # h will be NaN
y_pred = w2 * h               # y_pred will be NaN
loss = (y_true - y_pred)**2   # Loss calculation (might handle NaN appropriately)

# Backpropagation (simplified)
dy_pred = 2 * (y_pred - y_true) # This will be NaN because y_pred is NaN
dh = dy_pred * w2                # This will be NaN, and will propagate further
dw1 = dh * h * (1 - h) * x       # This will be NaN
dw2 = dy_pred * h                # This will be NaN
```

In this example, the NaN weight `w1` immediately renders the hidden layer activation `h` NaN. This propagates to `y_pred`, resulting in a NaN gradient for all weights. The loss calculation may handle the NaN in `y_pred`, but the gradients are unequivocally NaN.


**Example 3: NaN in Activation Function (due to overflow)**

Consider a scenario where an intermediate calculation within the activation function leads to numerical overflow and the generation of a NaN. This is not uncommon with activation functions like the exponential.

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1000.0]) #Large input
w1 = np.array([1.0])
w2 = np.array([1.0])

h = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-w1 * x)) # h might overflow to inf then NaN
y_pred = w2 * h
loss = (y_true - y_pred)**2

#Backpropagation (simplified)
dy_pred = 2*(y_pred - y_true) #Will be NaN if y_pred is NaN
dh = dy_pred * w2 # NaN will propagate
dw1 = dh * h * (1 -h) * x # NaN propagates further
dw2 = dy_pred * h # NaN propagated
```

A large input value to the exponential function can cause an overflow, resulting in `h` becoming infinity, and subsequently `NaN` after the division. This will again lead to NaN gradients.


In conclusion, the appearance of NaNs in gradients despite a finite loss is not a software error but a direct consequence of the mathematical properties of NaN and its interaction with the chain rule during backpropagation.  Robust handling requires careful data preprocessing to mitigate NaN inputs and careful selection of activation functions and loss functions that handle potential numerical instability.  Thorough testing and debugging, especially on edge cases, are crucial in avoiding such issues.


**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  A comprehensive textbook on numerical analysis.  This will provide a solid foundation in understanding numerical instability and error propagation.
2.  A detailed reference manual for the deep learning framework you're using.  Pay close attention to sections on automatic differentiation and numerical stability.
3.  Research papers on handling missing data and robust optimization techniques in machine learning. These will offer insights into pre-processing strategies and loss function modifications to handle missing or erroneous data effectively.
