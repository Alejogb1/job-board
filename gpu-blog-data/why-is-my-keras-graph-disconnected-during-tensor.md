The issue of a disconnected Keras graph during tensor value retrieval stems fundamentally from a mismatch between the graph's execution phase and the attempt to access intermediate tensor values.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale model deployments points to a common root cause:  inconsistent use of `tf.function` decorators, leading to graph construction and execution disparities.  The Keras backend, relying heavily on TensorFlow's graph execution model, requires careful management of graph construction and the subsequent retrieval of tensor values.  Incorrect handling of this leads to the perceived "disconnected" state, manifesting as errors indicating the inability to fetch tensor values.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The Keras graph, at its core, represents a computational graph defining the forward pass of your model.  During model compilation, Keras constructs this graph based on the layers and operations defined.  This graph isn't inherently executable until execution is triggered, typically through a `model.fit`, `model.predict`, or similar method.  Tensor values reside within the graph's nodes, accessible only after the relevant portion of the graph has been executed.

The problem arises when attempting to retrieve tensor values from nodes that haven't been executed. This might occur if you're trying to access internal activations within a layer outside the context of a training or prediction step, or if you've inadvertently created a separate, disconnected subgraph through improper use of `tf.function` or eager execution.  Essentially, your code is asking the system for data that hasn't been computed because the necessary execution path wasn't triggered.  The "disconnected" message is a symptom, not the cause; it indicates a structural problem within your computational graph's execution flow.

A crucial aspect is understanding TensorFlow's graph mode versus eager execution.  Eager execution computes operations immediately, while graph mode constructs a graph first and executes it later.  Mixing these modes incorrectly within a Keras model, particularly with custom layers or callbacks using `tf.function`, is a frequent source of errors.  The use of `tf.function` without proper consideration for its graph-building behaviour can lead to subgraphs that are not connected to the main model graph during the standard training or inference loop.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect use of `tf.function` within a custom layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    @tf.function  # Problematic placement
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.units)(inputs)
        # Attempting to access x outside the tf.function context will fail.
        return x

model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(64),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# This will likely fail; 'x' is only defined within the tf.function
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    output = model(tf.random.normal((10, 32)))
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(output**2)  
# This section will lead to an error because `x` was calculated in graph mode and is not accessible outside.

```

**Commentary:**  The `tf.function` decorator in the `call` method creates a separate subgraph for the layer's computation.  Attempting to access the intermediate tensor `x` outside the `tf.function` context will result in a disconnected graph error because this tensor exists solely within the encapsulated subgraph, not the main model graph executed during training. The solution is to either remove `@tf.function`, enabling eager execution (potentially impacting performance), or restructure the code so that tensor value retrieval occurs within the `tf.function` itself.


**Example 2:  Accessing intermediate tensors during model training (incorrect):**

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Incorrect attempt to access intermediate activations
for layer in model.layers:
    if isinstance(layer, keras.layers.Dense):
        intermediate_activation = layer.get_output_at(0) #  This often fails during training


```

**Commentary:** This approach often fails because `get_output_at` relies on a constructed graph, and the relevant part of that graph hasn't been executed when called directly in this loop. The model's internal activations are only defined during the forward pass initiated by `model.fit` or `model.predict`.


**Example 3: Correct access using model prediction and layer output retrieval:**

```python
import numpy as np
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
input_data = np.random.rand(10,32)

# Correct way: use model prediction to execute the graph, then access layer outputs.
intermediate_output = model.predict(input_data)

intermediate_layer_output = model.layers[0](input_data)  # Access output of the first layer

# Now 'intermediate_output' and 'intermediate_layer_output' are accessible
print(intermediate_output.shape)
print(intermediate_layer_output.shape)

```

**Commentary:**  This example correctly retrieves intermediate activations.  First,  `model.predict` executes the model graph, populating all nodes with their calculated values. After execution, accessing layer outputs via a call is permissible.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on eager execution, `tf.function`, and graph construction.
*   A comprehensive guide to Keras, focusing on the model compilation process and backend mechanisms.
*   Debugging guides specific to TensorFlow and Keras, offering strategies for identifying and resolving graph-related errors.


By meticulously examining the usage of `tf.function`, ensuring that tensor value retrieval happens only after graph execution through methods like `model.predict`, and carefully considering the interaction between eager and graph execution modes, developers can effectively avoid the "disconnected graph" error during tensor value retrieval within Keras.  Understanding these fundamental aspects of the Keras backend is crucial for building robust and reliable deep learning models.
