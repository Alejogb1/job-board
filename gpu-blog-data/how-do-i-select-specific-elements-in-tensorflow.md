TensorFlow offers a versatile toolkit for tensor manipulation, and element selection represents a fundamental operation for data processing and model building. I've spent considerable time wrestling with the nuances of TensorFlow’s indexing and slicing mechanisms, which can initially appear complex, yet, with a firm grasp of its core principles, become quite powerful. The primary methods for selecting specific elements are through basic indexing, slicing, and the more advanced methods offered by `tf.gather` and `tf.boolean_mask`. The correct choice depends heavily on the dimensionality of the tensor and the nature of the desired selection.

Firstly, let’s consider basic indexing.  If you are working with a lower-dimensional tensor, say rank 1 (a vector) or rank 2 (a matrix), standard Python-style bracket notation `[]` operates intuitively. A tensor’s shape corresponds directly to the number of indices required.  A rank 1 tensor `tf.constant([10, 20, 30])` would use a single index like `tensor[1]` to return `20`. A rank 2 tensor `tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`, to access the value 4 would require `tensor[1, 1]`. Indexing in this manner directly corresponds to accessing elements located at those positions. The key point here is dimensionality: the number of indices must match the rank of the tensor. If you attempt to use `tensor[1]` on the rank 2 example, it returns a complete row (`tf.Tensor([3 4], shape=(2,), dtype=int32)`), rather than a single scalar value. Indexing, when properly applied, offers the fastest access patterns since specific memory locations are directly addressed. This makes it suitable for frequent retrieval of small sets of known locations.

Secondly, slicing allows you to extract regions from a tensor, not just individual elements. Slicing uses the syntax `start:stop:step` within the bracket notation, and it can be applied along each dimension of the tensor. A notable feature of TensorFlow is that it does not require specifying the entire range for all dimensions. For example, using the same rank 2 tensor as above, `tensor[:, 0]` selects the first column (outputting `tf.Tensor([1 3], shape=(2,), dtype=int32)`), where the `:` is a shortcut for taking the entire range along the row dimension. Similarly, `tensor[0, :]` would extract the first row. Slicing is especially powerful when combined with range specifications; `tensor[0:2, 0:1]` effectively selects a submatrix from the top-left corner of the initial matrix. Slices are resolved at the graph execution stage and return a new tensor object which shares memory with the source tensor but with the new view of the data. Consequently, changes made to the slice are reflected in the original if that slice was not copied. One must be conscious of this shared memory.

Finally, for more complex selection scenarios, `tf.gather` and `tf.boolean_mask` come into play. `tf.gather` selects elements at specified indices along a specific axis (or multiple axes). This is particularly useful when the element locations are not contiguous, such as when you need to pull out certain rows based on a computed list of indices, often output of another tensor operation.  `tf.boolean_mask` offers masking based on a boolean tensor. The returned tensor contains elements where the corresponding value in the mask is true. This operation is invaluable for filtering elements based on conditions.

Here are some code examples to solidify these concepts:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 1: Basic Indexing and Slicing
tensor1 = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
print("Example 1:")
print("Original tensor:", tensor1)
element = tensor1[2]
print("Element at index 2:", element) # Output: 30
slice1 = tensor1[1:4]
print("Slice [1:4]:", slice1) # Output: [20 30 40]

tensor2 = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print("Original 2D tensor:", tensor2)
element2 = tensor2[1,2]
print("Element at (1,2):", element2) # Output: 6
slice2 = tensor2[:, 1]
print("Column at index 1:", slice2) # Output: [2 5 8]
slice3 = tensor2[0:2,0:2]
print("Submatrix (0:2, 0:2):", slice3) # Output: [[1 2] [4 5]]
```

This example showcases the standard bracket notation, using indices for direct access and slices to extract contiguous regions from both rank 1 and rank 2 tensors. You can see that the syntax mirrors Python lists and NumPy arrays which aids readability for someone already familiar with them.

```python
# Example 2: tf.gather
tensor3 = tf.constant([100, 200, 300, 400, 500])
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 4])
print("\nExample 2:")
gathered = tf.gather(tensor3, indices)
print("Original tensor:", tensor3)
print("Gathered elements at [0, 2, 4]:", gathered) # Output: [100 300 500]

tensor4 = tf.constant([[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])
indices2 = tf.constant([0, 2])
gathered2 = tf.gather(tensor4, indices2, axis=1)
print("Original 2D tensor:", tensor4)
print("Gathered columns at [0, 2]:", gathered2) # Output: [[10 12] [13 15] [16 18]]

indices3 = tf.constant([[0,1], [1,2]])
gathered3 = tf.gather_nd(tensor4,indices3)
print("Gathered elements at [[0,1], [1,2]] : ", gathered3) # Output: [11 15]
```

This section highlights the utility of `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd` to select specific elements using an explicit set of indices. In this example, it picks out specific elements, which is impossible with standard slicing alone. Notice the usage of `axis` which directs `tf.gather` on a specified dimension of the tensor, and the use of `tf.gather_nd` to retrieve elements given index tuples.

```python
# Example 3: tf.boolean_mask
tensor5 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
mask = tf.constant([True, False, True, False, True, False])
print("\nExample 3:")
masked = tf.boolean_mask(tensor5, mask)
print("Original tensor:", tensor5)
print("Masked elements where mask is True:", masked) # Output: [1 3 5]

tensor6 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
mask2 = tf.constant([True, False, True])
masked2 = tf.boolean_mask(tensor6, mask2)
print("Original 2D tensor:", tensor6)
print("Masked rows where mask is True:", masked2) # Output: [[1 2] [5 6]]

mask3 = tf.constant([[True, False],[False,True], [True, True]])
masked3 = tf.boolean_mask(tensor6, mask3)
print("Masked elements:", masked3) # Output: [1 4 5 6]
```

This example demonstrates the power of `tf.boolean_mask` to select specific elements based on a boolean criterion.  Here, the boolean mask defines which elements should be included in the output tensor which can be of a different rank from the original tensor when applied to high-dimensional tensors.

In summary, TensorFlow provides multiple mechanisms for selecting tensor elements. Simple indexing and slicing with bracket notation suffices for most use cases with contiguous selections. The operations `tf.gather` and `tf.boolean_mask` provide additional functionality when more specialized selections are required. I recommend familiarizing yourself with the TensorFlow API documentation for `tf.slice`, `tf.gather`, `tf.gather_nd`, and `tf.boolean_mask`, along with their respective arguments and subtle differences, to fully master the nuances of data selection. Moreover, the TensorFlow tutorials offer practical examples for each function with further context. These should serve as good starting points for expanding your proficiency in tensor manipulation with TensorFlow.
