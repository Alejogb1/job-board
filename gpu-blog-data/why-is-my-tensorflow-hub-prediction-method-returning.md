The 404 "Not Found" error you're encountering in Postman when using your TensorFlow Hub prediction method stems almost exclusively from incorrect specification of the request URL or a misconfiguration within your serving infrastructure, not a problem inherent within the TensorFlow Hub model itself.  Over the years, I've debugged countless similar deployment issues, and this is the most common culprit.  Let's systematically examine the likely causes and solutions.

**1. Incorrect URL Construction:**

The most frequent reason for a 404 is a simple typo or an incomplete URL path. Your Postman request must accurately reflect the endpoint exposed by your serving infrastructure. This endpoint isn't directly defined by the TensorFlow Hub model but rather by the specific deployment mechanism you've chosen (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, a custom Flask/FastAPI application, or a cloud-based solution).

The URL typically includes several components: the base URL of your server (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:port`), the model name (as specified during deployment), and potentially a version identifier. Incorrectly specifying any of these will result in a 404.

For instance, if your model is deployed under the name "my_awesome_model" on a server running on port 8501, the correct URL might look like: `http://your-server-ip:8501/v1/models/my_awesome_model:predict`. Note the `:predict` suffix; this signals the intention to perform a prediction.  The presence of `v1` indicates the version.  Ensure your Postman request matches this precisely.  Careless omission or alteration, particularly of the model name or the `predict` suffix, is a major source of 404 errors.

**2. Server-Side Misconfigurations:**

Even with a correct URL, a 404 can arise from server-side problems.  This includes:

* **Incorrect Model Loading:**  The server might fail to load the model during startup. Check your server logs for any errors related to model loading.  Common causes include incorrect file paths, missing dependencies, or permission issues.

* **Endpoint Mismatch:**  The deployed model might not expose the `predict` endpoint correctly. The server configuration file may have an incorrect mapping between the URL and the model's prediction function.

* **Server Unavailability:** The server itself might be down or inaccessible. Verify that the server is running and responding to other requests.


**3. Request Body Issues:**

A 404 can sometimes disguise other problems. Incorrectly formatted request body can trigger a 404 instead of a more informative error code, especially if your server-side code doesn't handle invalid input gracefully.  Ensure the data sent to the prediction endpoint conforms precisely to the expected input format defined by the TensorFlow Hub model. This typically involves understanding the model's input tensor shape and data type.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating how to build a request, handle responses, and debug in different environments.

**Example 1: Python Client (using `requests`)**

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://your-server-ip:8501/v1/models/my_awesome_model:predict"
data = {
    "instances": [
        [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],  #Example input - adapt to your model
        [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
    ]
}

headers = {"content-type": "application/json"}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
    prediction = response.json()
    print(prediction)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as req_err:
    print(f"An API error occurred: {req_err}")
except json.JSONDecodeError as json_err:
    print(f"Error decoding JSON response: {json_err}")
```

This example uses the `requests` library.  The `try-except` block handles potential errors, including HTTP errors, request exceptions, and JSON decoding failures.   Crucially, the `raise_for_status()` method is essential for differentiating between a 404 (resource not found) and other HTTP errors.

**Example 2: Postman Request (JSON Body)**

In Postman, you would create a POST request.  The URL should be as described above.  The "Body" tab should be set to "raw" with JSON selected.  Paste the JSON payload (similar to the `data` in the Python example) into the body.  The headers should include `Content-Type: application/json`.  The Postman response will clearly indicate a 404 if the URL or the server is incorrectly configured. Pay close attention to the response body – it may contain more specific error messages.

**Example 3:  Handling Errors in a TensorFlow Serving Deployment (Python)**

This illustrates a basic server-side approach using TensorFlow Serving, assuming you are familiar with the TensorFlow Serving API:

```python
import tensorflow_serving_client as tfsc

try:
    channel = tfsc.Channel('localhost:8501', insecure=True)
    stub = tfsc.predict_pb2_grpc.PredictionServiceStub(channel)
    request = tfsc.predict_pb2.PredictRequest()
    request.model_spec.name = "my_awesome_model"
    # ... (Populate request.inputs appropriately) ...

    response = stub.Predict(request, timeout=10)
    # Process the response.predictions
except tfsc.client.MakeChannelError as e:
    print(f"Error connecting to TensorFlow Serving: {e}")
except grpc._channel._InactiveRpcError as e:  # Example of error handling
    print(f"gRPC Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Generic error: {e}")

```

This demonstrates more sophisticated error handling within a TensorFlow Serving environment.  Pay close attention to the exception handling; specific exceptions will provide more detailed information, helping to pinpoint the origin of the 404.


**Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow Serving documentation; TensorFlow Hub model deployment guides;  REST API design best practices;  Python's `requests` library documentation; gRPC documentation (if applicable).


Thorough examination of server logs, careful URL construction, and meticulous attention to request and response formats will almost certainly resolve your 404 issue. Remember to isolate potential causes—Is it the URL, server configuration, or a problem with your input data? Systematic debugging will be key.
