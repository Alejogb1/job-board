The fundamental insight regarding thread count and non-parallelizable tasks is this:  increasing the number of threads beyond a certain point does *not* improve performance, and in fact, often significantly degrades it.  This is due to the inherent overhead associated with thread management, which dwarfs any potential gains from parallelization that simply aren't available in inherently serial work.  My experience debugging high-frequency trading algorithms revealed this starkly – attempts to improve the speed of single-threaded data validation routines by adding threads resulted in a substantial performance *regression*.

The primary cause for this performance degradation lies in the operating system's thread scheduler.  Each thread requires resources: stack space, context switching overhead, and synchronization primitives, even if it is not actively performing any computational work. The scheduler's job is to allocate CPU time to these threads, but this process itself is not instantaneous.  Context switching – the act of saving the state of one thread and loading the state of another – introduces latency.  In a system with many threads, this context switching overhead can dominate the execution time, effectively negating any benefit from having multiple threads.  This becomes particularly pronounced when the task itself is inherently non-parallelizable – a single thread is all that's needed.

For a non-parallelizable task, adding threads introduces nothing but overhead.  This contrasts sharply with parallelizable tasks, where multiple threads can simultaneously work on independent portions of the problem, resulting in a speedup proportional to the number of cores (up to a point, subject to Amdahl's Law).  In the non-parallelizable case, the threads are essentially competing for the same resources, creating contention and hindering progress.  This contention is amplified by the presence of shared resources, such as memory, which need synchronization mechanisms (locks, mutexes, semaphores) to prevent race conditions.  These synchronization mechanisms themselves introduce overhead, further slowing down execution.

Let's illustrate this with code examples.  Consider the following scenario: processing a large sequential file, performing a complex calculation on each line.  This is inherently a serial task; one line must be processed before the next.

**Example 1: Single-threaded processing**

```python
import time

def process_line(line):
    # Simulate a complex calculation
    time.sleep(0.01)  # Replace with actual calculation
    return line.upper()

def process_file(filename):
    start_time = time.time()
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            process_line(line)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Single-threaded processing time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

process_file("large_file.txt")
```

This code processes the file sequentially.  Adding threads wouldn't speed it up.  Any attempt to parallelize the processing of individual lines would be counterproductive.

**Example 2: Inefficient multi-threaded processing (wrong approach)**

```python
import threading
import time

# ... (process_line function from Example 1) ...

def process_file_multithreaded(filename, num_threads):
    start_time = time.time()
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    threads = []
    chunk_size = len(lines) // num_threads
    for i in range(num_threads):
        start = i * chunk_size
        end = start + chunk_size if i < num_threads - 1 else len(lines)
        thread = threading.Thread(target=lambda: [process_line(line) for line in lines[start:end]])
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Multi-threaded processing time ({num_threads} threads): {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

process_file_multithreaded("large_file.txt", 4)
```

This example attempts multi-threading but ineffectively. It divides the file into chunks but does not resolve the fundamental serial nature of the task. Each thread still processes its chunk sequentially.  The added overhead of thread creation and management outweighs any potential benefits.  In practice, this will likely be slower than the single-threaded version.

**Example 3:  Correctly handling the non-parallelizable nature (but still single-threaded)**

```python
import time
import concurrent.futures

# ... (process_line function from Example 1) ...

def process_file_efficiently(filename):
    start_time = time.time()
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            process_line(line)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Efficient (single-threaded) processing time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

process_file_efficiently("large_file.txt")
```

This example demonstrates that for a genuinely non-parallelizable task, the optimal approach is to stick with a single thread.  Attempting to utilize multiple threads only introduces unnecessary overhead.  The `concurrent.futures` module might seem relevant, but its advantages only manifest with truly parallelizable tasks.

In conclusion, the number of threads has a profoundly negative impact on the performance of non-parallelizable tasks.  The overhead of thread creation, context switching, and synchronization mechanisms outweighs any potential benefits of parallelism, which simply aren't available.  Focusing on optimizing the single-threaded execution path is the most effective strategy in such scenarios.
