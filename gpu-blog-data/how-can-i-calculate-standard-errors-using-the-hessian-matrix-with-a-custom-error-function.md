Calculating standard errors from the Hessian matrix, especially when employing a custom error function, requires a careful understanding of numerical optimization and statistical inference principles. I've encountered this scenario frequently when fitting complex models, where pre-built statistical packages don't always accommodate the specific loss function I need. The core idea hinges on the fact that the inverse of the observed Fisher information matrix, which is approximated by the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood, provides an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix for the model parameters. Standard errors are simply the square roots of the diagonal elements of this variance-covariance matrix. This process is crucial for quantifying the uncertainty associated with our parameter estimates and generating meaningful confidence intervals.

The process involves three primary steps: first, defining your custom error function (which I'll assume is differentiable); second, calculating the Hessian matrix of this error function at the parameter values that minimize it; and third, inverting the Hessian and extracting the standard errors. When using a custom error function, we often can't rely on analytic derivatives. We must resort to numerical approximation techniques. This is where libraries such as those in Python's `scipy.optimize` become essential.

Let's begin with a concrete example. I frequently use logistic regression with a modified loss that penalizes outliers more aggressively. This is where my need for a custom error function arises. Consider a standard logistic regression loss with an additional quadratic term for observations whose predicted probabilities are outside a certain range. The objective function takes the form:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def custom_logistic_loss(params, X, y, threshold=0.1):
    """
    Custom logistic loss with added penalty for predictions outside threshold.

    Args:
        params (np.ndarray): Model parameters (coefficients and intercept).
        X (np.ndarray): Feature matrix.
        y (np.ndarray): Target vector (0 or 1).
        threshold (float): Probability threshold for penalty.

    Returns:
        float: Total loss.
    """

    intercept = params[0]
    coefficients = params[1:]
    linear_pred = np.dot(X, coefficients) + intercept
    probabilities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-linear_pred))

    base_loss = -np.mean(y * np.log(probabilities) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - probabilities))
    penalty = np.sum((probabilities < threshold) * (threshold - probabilities)**2) + \
              np.sum((probabilities > 1 - threshold) * (probabilities - (1 - threshold))**2)
    return base_loss + penalty
```

In this example, the standard logistic loss is augmented by a penalty that grows quadratically for predicted probabilities falling outside the defined threshold `0.1` on either side. The `custom_logistic_loss` function returns the combined loss. Notice that this function expects the intercept as the first element of the `params` array.

Next, we can proceed to optimize this loss function and calculate its Hessian. I typically use `scipy.optimize.minimize` for optimization. To calculate the Hessian, I leverage the `hess_approx='2-point'` argument which computes the Hessian numerically.

```python
def calculate_standard_errors(X, y, loss_function, initial_params, method='BFGS'):
    """
    Calculates standard errors of parameters after minimization.

    Args:
        X (np.ndarray): Feature matrix.
        y (np.ndarray): Target vector.
        loss_function (callable): The loss function to be minimized.
        initial_params (np.ndarray): Initial parameter values.
        method (str): Optimization method (default BFGS).

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Standard errors for the model parameters.
    """
    result = minimize(loss_function, initial_params, args=(X, y), method=method,
                     hess=lambda x: minimize(loss_function, x, args=(X,y), method=method,
                    hess_approx='2-point').hess_inv.todense()  ) # Hessian computation

    if not result.success:
       raise Exception("Optimization Failed")

    hessian_matrix = result.hess_inv
    variance_covariance_matrix = hessian_matrix  # Hessian is the inverse fisher information in this case

    standard_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(variance_covariance_matrix))

    return standard_errors
```

In the function above, the `minimize` function computes the hessian using numerical approximations, specifically the two point difference approximation. I have implemented a lambda function that returns the inverse of the Hessian. The result of the optimization, `result` provides us with a `hess_inv` which is then converted to a dense matrix and stored in `hessian_matrix`. Note, I've used the BFGS optimization method, though you can substitute other methods. `hess_inv` is already an approximation of the variance-covariance matrix, avoiding an explicit inversion operation, a common source of numerical instability. The standard errors are then extracted by taking the square root of the diagonal elements of the `variance_covariance_matrix`. I handle potential optimization failures and raise exceptions as good practice when building robust solutions.

Finally, let's demonstrate usage and generate simulated data for this example.

```python
# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
n_samples = 200
n_features = 5
X = np.random.randn(n_samples, n_features)
true_coefficients = np.array([0.5, -0.8, 0.3, 0.6, -0.2])
true_intercept = 1.0
linear_prediction = np.dot(X, true_coefficients) + true_intercept
probabilities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-linear_prediction))
y = np.random.binomial(1, probabilities)

# Initial parameter values
initial_params = np.zeros(n_features + 1)

# Calculate standard errors
standard_errors = calculate_standard_errors(X, y, custom_logistic_loss, initial_params)

print("Standard Errors:", standard_errors)
```

In the simulation, I generate a dataset with five features and 200 observations, where the target variable `y` is simulated based on the probabilities calculated from the linear prediction, thus creating a problem similar to logistic regression. We can observe that the shape of the standard errors matches the shape of the input parameters.

I recommend further study of numerical optimization techniques. Specifically, delve into methods like BFGS and L-BFGS as well as other approximation methods for hessians. These are foundational to understanding how this process functions under the hood. Consider studying the derivation of the Fisher Information matrix and how it relates to the variance of estimators in statistics texts that cover maximum likelihood estimation in detail.

I also suggest exploring libraries such as `statsmodels` in Python. Although it may not allow direct user customisation of the error function it provides a clear framework for inference, allowing a comparison of standard errors using common models, which is a useful debugging step. These are particularly useful if you need statistical hypothesis testing capabilities. The concepts explored in the response are crucial for developing reliable and custom statistical analysis workflows.
