AttributeError exceptions during TensorFlow Keras model loading are frequently encountered, and my experience indicates they stem from discrepancies between the saved model's structure and the execution environment’s understanding of that structure. Specifically, the primary cause lies in the inability of the loading process to locate or correctly interpret specific attributes, particularly model layers or custom objects, defined within the saved model file. This disconnect occurs when the environment, typically defined by the installed TensorFlow and Keras versions, does not possess the requisite class definitions to instantiate the model graph.

The saved model, whether in H5 or SavedModel format, essentially serializes the computational graph representing your trained neural network. This graph includes details on each layer, its configuration parameters, and importantly, the class definitions for these layers. When you attempt to load a model, the loading process deserializes this graph and reconstructs the model in memory. The challenge arises when the deserialization encounters a layer whose class definition is not known in the target environment. This could be due to several reasons:

1.  **Version Mismatch:** The most common culprit is a difference in TensorFlow or Keras versions between the environment where the model was trained and the environment where it's being loaded. Each release introduces, modifies, or deprecates classes, methods, or data structures. For example, a custom layer defined in a specific TF 2.x version might not be compatible, or even exist, in an earlier TF 1.x installation or a later TF 2.y release.  This can particularly affect models employing newer layers or functionalities that didn't exist in older versions. A discrepancy in Keras implementation (e.g. `tf.keras` vs. standalone `keras`) can also cause this.

2.  **Custom Objects:** If the model incorporates custom layers, losses, metrics, or other non-standard components, these classes must be made explicitly known to the loading process. Saving a model which utilizes `tf.keras.layers.Layer` subclasses without explicitly handling the class during loading is a frequent source of errors. The saving process only stores the class name, not the full class definition, and so during loading, if this class isn’t resolvable from the loaded environment, an `AttributeError` is inevitable. The same applies to models which use custom losses, metrics, callbacks or other non-standard components of Keras.

3.  **Missing Dependencies:** Some layers might rely on specific optional TensorFlow modules or even external packages, such as when utilizing TensorFlow Addons. If the environment lacks these dependencies, the loading procedure will fail to instantiate the corresponding layers, leading to errors related to missing attributes.

4.  **File Corruption:** Although rare, data corruption in the model file can also lead to issues. While often accompanied by different types of errors, corrupt metadata within the serialized structure may manifest as seemingly illogical attribute retrieval failures. This usually requires examining the file with debugging tools if version or custom object issues are ruled out.

Let us consider the issue of custom objects. Suppose that during training, I defined a custom `ResidualBlock` layer, as demonstrated in the code snippet below.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ResidualBlock(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size, **kwargs):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')
        self.conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')
        self.bn1 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.bn2 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.add = tf.keras.layers.Add()

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv1(inputs)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        residual = self.add([inputs, x]) # Ensure shape compatibility with inputs
        return tf.nn.relu(residual)

# ... Later in the training process ...
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))
x = ResidualBlock(32,3)(input_layer)
x = ResidualBlock(32,3)(x)
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)
model.save("my_model.h5")
```

The above code defines a basic custom layer `ResidualBlock`. If one attempts to load this model directly without any special consideration for the custom layer, the `AttributeError` occurs. The saved `my_model.h5` file does not contain a complete representation of the `ResidualBlock` class definition; rather it only saves a pointer or placeholder for it. Thus, during loading, Keras looks to its standard module library for `ResidualBlock`, it doesn't find it, so it throws `AttributeError`. This behavior can be handled by utilizing `tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope` or similar mechanisms as seen in the example below.

```python
# When loading, an AttributeError will occur if not handled:
# loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_model.h5")

# Correct method using custom_object_scope:
import tensorflow as tf

class ResidualBlock(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size, **kwargs):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')
        self.conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')
        self.bn1 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.bn2 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.add = tf.keras.layers.Add()

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv1(inputs)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.bn2(x)
        residual = self.add([inputs, x])
        return tf.nn.relu(residual)

with tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope({'ResidualBlock': ResidualBlock}):
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_model.h5")

# The loaded model can be used
```

Here, `custom_object_scope` is used to associate the string representation of the custom object, i.e. `'ResidualBlock'`, to its actual class definition. This enables the loading process to successfully instantiate the `ResidualBlock` layer when deserializing the saved graph. The loaded model can then be used as if it was just created.

Another common use case would be loading custom losses or metrics when those have been included in the saved model. For example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
def my_custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true-y_pred))
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(input_layer)
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs = output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss = my_custom_loss)
model.save("custom_loss_model.h5")

# Attempting to load this will throw AttributeError unless:
with tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope({'my_custom_loss': my_custom_loss}):
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("custom_loss_model.h5")

# This loaded_model will be fully functional as intended.
```

In cases where external dependencies might be causing the `AttributeError`, it would be essential to ensure all necessary libraries are installed and correctly configured.  For example, a model utilizing TensorFlow Addons must be loaded in an environment where those addons are also present.  While resolving the root cause can be intricate, these examples demonstrate that by carefully checking for version mismatches, handling custom objects explicitly, and ensuring all dependencies are present, the loading of Keras models can be reliably achieved.

For further reading on the topic, the TensorFlow website offers comprehensive guides on model saving and loading. The official Keras documentation, as well, has sections dedicated to custom object management. Consulting these resources often provides detailed explanations and troubleshooting steps for common loading errors. Specific searches on web resources discussing TF model versions, custom Keras classes, or dependency issues can also shed light on specific situations.
