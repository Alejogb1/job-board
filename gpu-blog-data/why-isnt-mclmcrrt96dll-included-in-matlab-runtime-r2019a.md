The absence of `mclmcrrt9_6.dll` from the MATLAB Runtime for R2019a stems from a significant architectural shift in the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) distribution strategy implemented starting with that release.  My experience debugging deployment issues across various MATLAB versions, including extensive work with legacy applications and their migration to newer runtimes, highlights this as a key change impacting compatibility.  Prior to R2019a, the MCR was structured with a more monolithic approach, including numerous DLLs, often leading to larger deployment packages and potential version conflicts.  R2019a introduced a more modular and streamlined MCR, significantly reducing the number of individual DLLs included in the standard distribution.

**1. Explanation of the Change**

The `mclmcrrt9_6.dll` file, a component of the MATLAB Compiler Runtime, specifically pertains to a legacy version of the MathWorks Compiler Runtime.  This DLL handled core aspects of the MATLAB engine's interaction with the operating system, including memory management and process handling. Its inclusion in earlier MCR versions was a consequence of the overall design philosophy.  The transition to a more modular approach in R2019a aimed to address several issues:

* **Reduced Deployment Size:**  The older, monolithic structure resulted in larger deployment packages, impacting download times and storage space. By decoupling functionality and only including necessary components, the R2019a (and subsequent) MCR significantly reduced the overall size.

* **Improved Version Management:**  The monolithic approach often led to version conflicts, particularly when multiple MATLAB applications with varying dependencies were deployed on a single system.  The modularization aimed to minimize these conflicts by allowing finer-grained control over which components were included in each deployment.

* **Enhanced Security:**  A more modular design offers better security by reducing the attack surface.  Including only strictly necessary components limits potential vulnerabilities.

* **Simplified Maintenance:**  The modularity simplifies maintenance and updates.  Specific components can be updated independently without requiring a full MCR reinstallation.

Therefore, the absence of `mclmcrrt9_6.dll` isn't a bug or omission but a deliberate design choice reflecting a fundamental shift in the MCR architecture.  If your application requires this specific DLL, it's highly indicative of a reliance on an older MCR version.  Attempting to use it with the R2019a runtime will inevitably result in failure.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the implications of this change and highlight the approach to mitigating compatibility issues.  These are simplified for clarity but represent the core principles involved.

**Example 1:  Attempting to use an application compiled with an older MCR on R2019a:**

```matlab
% This code attempts to run a legacy application compiled against an older MCR
% This will fail because the R2019a runtime doesn't contain mclmcrrt9_6.dll

try
    system('legacyApplication.exe'); %  Legacy application executable
catch ME
    disp(['Error running application: ' ME.message]); % Handle the error
end
```

This example demonstrates a direct attempt to run a legacy application. The error message will explicitly highlight the missing DLL or a related incompatibility.  The solution requires recompiling the application using the R2019a compiler.

**Example 2:  Correctly deploying an application compiled with R2019a:**

```matlab
% This example shows the correct deployment procedure for R2019a

% ... Compilation process using MATLAB Compiler R2019a ...

% The deployment process will automatically include the necessary MCR components
% based on the dependencies of the compiled application.  No manual intervention is needed
% for mclmcrrt9_6.dll as it will not be required.

% ... Deployment steps including packaging the application and required MCR files...

% The application should now run correctly without any errors related to missing DLLs.
```

This example highlights the correct approach to deployment for applications built using the R2019a compiler.  The compiler will automatically handle the inclusion of all necessary runtime components, eliminating the need for manual management of individual DLLs such as `mclmcrrt9_6.dll`.

**Example 3:  Handling potential compatibility issues during migration:**

```matlab
% This code illustrates a strategy for handling potential discrepancies during migration.

% ...Attempt to load the application using the newer MCR...

try
    % Attempt to load and run the application
catch ME
    % Handle potential errors gracefully
    if contains(ME.message, 'mclmcrrt9_6.dll') % Check for specific error
        disp('Application requires recompilation for R2019a or a compatible runtime.');
        % ... Implementation of a fallback mechanism or user notification...
    else
        % Handle other error scenarios
        rethrow(ME); % Rethrow the error if not related to DLL incompatibility
    end
end
```

This example demonstrates error handling during the migration process.  It specifically checks for errors related to `mclmcrrt9_6.dll` and provides a more informative message to the user, guiding them toward the appropriate solution: recompilation with the correct MATLAB version.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further information, I recommend consulting the official MATLAB documentation on deploying applications and the release notes for R2019a. The MATLAB Compiler documentation also provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and best practices for deployment.  Finally, reviewing the MathWorks support websiteâ€™s troubleshooting guides for deployment errors can be beneficial for resolving specific issues encountered during migration.
