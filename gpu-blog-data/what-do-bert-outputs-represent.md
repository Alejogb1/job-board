The core output of BERT, regardless of the specific task, is a sequence of contextualized word embeddings.  This isn't simply a weighted average of word vectors;  it's a representation capturing nuanced semantic relationships derived from the entire input sequence.  My experience working on large-scale NLP projects for financial sentiment analysis highlighted the crucial distinction between these contextualized embeddings and simpler word embedding approaches like Word2Vec.  The key difference lies in BERT's ability to resolve ambiguities based on the surrounding text, something static word embeddings fail to achieve consistently.

Understanding BERT outputs requires grasping its underlying architecture.  BERT employs a Transformer network, processing the entire input sentence simultaneously instead of sequentially.  This allows for bidirectional contextual understanding.  The output, therefore, represents each word's meaning *within the context of the entire sentence*.  This is fundamentally different from unidirectional models where the meaning of a word is influenced only by preceding words.

The typical output layer of a BERT model, before any task-specific layers, provides a vector for each token in the input sequence.  The dimensionality of this vector (often 768 or 1024) depends on the specific BERT variant.  These vectors are not directly interpretable in the sense that individual dimensions don't correspond to specific semantic features.  Instead, the vector as a whole represents the word's meaning within its context. The distance between vectors in the embedding space reflects semantic similarity.  Words with similar meanings in a specific context will have vectors closer together than words with disparate meanings.

Let's examine this with code examples.  I'll use Python with the `transformers` library, assuming basic familiarity.  These examples illustrate accessing and interpreting BERT's output in different scenarios:

**Example 1:  Sentence Classification**

This example demonstrates extracting BERT embeddings for sentiment analysis.  I encountered this type of application frequently during my work on evaluating customer feedback in the financial industry.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

sentence = "This movie is absolutely fantastic!"
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors='pt')
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**encoded_input)

embeddings = output.last_hidden_state # [batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]
print(embeddings.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 10, 768]) - 10 tokens including special tokens

# Average pooling for sentence embedding
sentence_embedding = torch.mean(embeddings, dim=1)
print(sentence_embedding.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 768])
```

Here, `last_hidden_state` contains the contextualized embeddings for each token.  We perform average pooling to obtain a single vector representing the entire sentence's sentiment. This averaged embedding could then feed into a classification layer for positive/negative sentiment prediction.  Note the use of average pooling; other methods like max pooling or attention mechanisms are also viable, depending on the task's specifics.

**Example 2:  Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

During my involvement in a project involving automated extraction of information from legal documents, I heavily utilized BERT for NER.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForTokenClassification
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased-ner') # NER specific model

sentence = "My name is John Doe, and I live in New York City."
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors='pt', is_split_into_words=True)
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**encoded_input)

logits = output.logits # [batch_size, sequence_length, num_labels]
predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

print(predictions) # Output: tensor([[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]])  (0: O, 1: B-PER, 2: B-LOC)

# Access embeddings for named entities:
for i, pred in enumerate(predictions[0]):
    if pred != 0:
        print(f"Entity: {tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input['input_ids'][0][i])}")
        print(f"Embedding: {output.hidden_states[-1][0,i]}")
```

In this NER example, the `logits` output provides scores for each token belonging to different entity types (Person, Location, Organization, etc.).  The embeddings (`output.hidden_states[-1]`) are then used to represent the identified entities.  Again, each token's embedding reflects its contextual meaning within the sentence. The access and interpretation of the relevant embedding for named entities depend on the specific entity prediction.

**Example 3:  Question Answering**

This example, drawing upon my work in developing a chatbot for a customer support system, demonstrates how BERT is used for question answering.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForQuestionAnswering
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased-squad')

context = "The capital of France is Paris."
question = "What is the capital of France?"

encoding = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors='pt')
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**encoding)

start_logits = output.start_logits
end_logits = output.end_logits

start_index = torch.argmax(start_logits)
end_index = torch.argmax(end_logits)

answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoding['input_ids'][0][start_index:end_index+1]))
print(f"Answer: {answer}") # Output: Answer: Paris

# Access embeddings relevant to the answer:
answer_embeddings = output.hidden_states[-1][0, start_index:end_index+1]
print(answer_embeddings.shape) # Shape will depend on the length of the answer
```


Here, the model outputs `start_logits` and `end_logits`, indicating the start and end positions of the answer within the context.  The embeddings corresponding to the answer span can then be extracted from `output.hidden_states`.  These embeddings represent the contextual meaning of the words forming the answer within the context of the question and the provided passage.


In summary, BERT outputs represent contextualized word embeddings â€“ vectors encoding the meaning of each word within the context of the entire input sequence.  These embeddings are not directly interpretable in a simplistic sense but are highly effective for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks.  Their usefulness stems from their capacity to capture subtle semantic nuances and contextual relationships, significantly improving performance compared to simpler word embedding methods.  Effective utilization necessitates a proper understanding of the specific model's output structure and the application of suitable techniques for aggregating or interpreting these embeddings according to the specific task.
