The immediate visibility of an API request within a browser’s Network tab, contrasted with its failure to elicit the expected behavior within an Angular application, often points towards a discrepancy between the request as sent by the browser and as anticipated by the Angular application's execution context. This discrepancy, rooted in the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests and Angular's change detection mechanism, typically involves one or a combination of the following: incorrect request construction within Angular, improper handling of the response, or issues related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Let’s examine these common causes in detail, drawing from several situations I've encountered over the years.

Firstly, discrepancies often stem from issues within the Angular application's code itself. When inspecting the Network tab, the browser often displays the *outcome* of the fetch – the successful request and the server's response – but not necessarily how the client formulated it or how Angular then proceeds. It is essential to meticulously verify how the request is constructed and transmitted within your Angular service or component. Incorrect headers, body structure, or query parameters are frequent culprits. If the server expects JSON and you're not providing the correct `Content-Type` header (e.g., `application/json`), the server might not process the request properly, even if a `200 OK` status code is observed. Similarly, failing to serialize the request body properly or providing the wrong data types within your payload can cause the server to respond with unexpected data, which Angular, then, cannot handle, leading to perceived failures despite the visible HTTP activity in the Network tab.

Secondly, successful retrieval doesn't always equate to successful use. Angular's change detection cycle isn't triggered automatically by the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests. This means you must ensure that when the response arrives, it’s correctly processed in a way that modifies the component’s data, causing an update to the view. Neglecting this leads to scenarios where data is returned from the server (visible in the Network tab) but the user interface remains unchanged. The usual remedy is employing RxJS Observables to manage the asynchronous operation. However, even proper usage of observables does not guarantee success; one might make a mistake in subscribing to an observable, handling potential errors, or manipulating the response data to match component data structures. If any of these are misconfigured, while the HTTP request was indeed successful, Angular will appear not to work. I recall one instance where I had forgotten to map data from a different format into a format the component could use, leading to a situation that seemed to fit this description.

Thirdly, CORS is a recurrent point of concern. While the request might appear perfectly executed in the browser’s Network tab, the browser might refuse the response based on CORS policies. If the server's response doesn't include appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers, the browser will block the Javascript code (Angular included) from accessing the content of the response, leading to the impression that the request has failed. The Network tab shows that the resource was requested from the server, potentially indicating a `200 OK` response, but in reality the content is unavailable to the application, often throwing cryptic errors in the browser's console which require careful debugging to discern that they originate from CORS issues. This is especially tricky when the backend is under development; misconfiguration on the server side might be responsible for the problems. The server must be explicitly configured to allow cross-origin requests originating from the frontend application's domain or port.

Let's consider some code examples to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Incorrect Header Configuration**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {

  private apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/data';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  fetchData(): Observable<any> {
    // Incorrect headers, missing application/json.
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
        'Authorization': 'Bearer my-auth-token'
    });

    return this.http.post(this.apiUrl, { message: 'Hello' }, { headers });
  }
}
```

In this example, the service `DataService` attempts a POST request but forgets to include the critical `Content-Type: application/json` header. Though the request is visible in the Network tab with a success status, the server might not be able to parse the body properly, and thus could return an error or incorrect data that would be hard to diagnose without closely inspecting the server logs or the browser's console. This is a classic case where the request seems valid, but it fails because of hidden assumptions about data exchange. To fix this, add `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` to the `HttpHeaders`.

**Example 2: Missing Change Detection Trigger**

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div>{{ myData | json }}</div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  myData: any;

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.dataService.fetchData().subscribe(
      (data) => {
         //Incorrectly mutating the object without assignment
         this.myData = data
      },
      (error) => { console.error("Error fetching data:", error) }
    );
  }
}
```

Here, even if the response from `dataService.fetchData()` arrives successfully, the `myData` might not update the view if the object is modified without triggering Angular's change detection. When this happened to me, the request was clearly visible in the Network tab, with correct data, but the template remained unchanged. Instead of direct modification, replacing the data using assignment is vital.

**Example 3: CORS Issue with No Visible Error**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ExternalApiService {

  private apiUrl = 'https://external.api.example.net/items';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  fetchItems(): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.get(this.apiUrl);
  }
}
```

In this third example, the API request appears in the Network tab, with a `200 OK`, however, the browser likely blocks the JavaScript application (Angular) from accessing the response data due to a missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the server's response, typically manifested in the developer console as a CORS error, sometimes subtle. This indicates that the issue is not with the client-side code per se, but rather, with the server configuration not allowing requests from the Angular's origin.

To improve debugging, I would also recommend familiarizing yourself with the capabilities of browser developer tools, especially the Network tab which can provide granular detail about requests, headers, responses and timing. The console is the main place to look for the subtle but very important CORS errors. Additionally, using an effective HTTP debugging proxy (Charles Proxy, Fiddler) allows for capturing requests and responses that can be analyzed outside of the browser itself. In terms of documentation, thoroughly understanding the Angular HTTP client and the underlying concepts of Observables is necessary to avoid many of these issues. Finally, thoroughly reviewing server-side logging is often crucial to diagnose server-side problems that might interact with Angular, even though the server's response, viewed in isolation in the network tab, looks correct. This often requires a dialogue with the backend team.
