When training neural networks for tasks involving spatial data, such as image processing or video analysis, the input dimension’s spatial size, often represented by height and width, is not a static requirement. I’ve encountered scenarios, particularly in my work with object detection pipelines where processing variable resolution images, that necessitate adapting spatial input dimensions during training. The typical approach of fixed input size can lead to wasted computation, unnecessary downsampling, or the inability to process high-resolution inputs. Instead, strategies exist to dynamically alter input dimensions, optimizing performance for different data characteristics.

The core of this issue lies in how convolutional layers, fundamental building blocks for spatial data processing, operate. They expect input tensors with a predefined spatial dimension. A straightforward solution of simply resizing input images to a fixed size during preprocessing, although common, has drawbacks. It can distort aspect ratios, introduce artifacts when scaling to drastically different resolutions, and hinder training effectiveness, particularly for objects that vary greatly in size and aspect ratio across the dataset. Therefore, a more flexible approach is necessary.

My experience primarily uses a technique I'll refer to as "dynamic padding and cropping with learned aspect ratios.” This involves setting a base input size and applying padding to the spatial dimensions of each batch to ensure they meet a certain minimum size. Subsequent to padding, the spatial dimension is cropped to a size proportional to the images within the batch. This enables learning spatial features, using a variety of size and shape images while preserving important information. Specifically, the cropping region is determined by examining the aspect ratios of all images within the batch, thus preserving the aspect ratio, while also standardizing the shape.

Let’s examine a concrete implementation using PyTorch. The following code snippet demonstrates how to adjust input dimensions by calculating appropriate padding and cropping regions:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class DynamicInput(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_size, padding_mode='constant'):
        super(DynamicInput, self).__init__()
        self.base_size = base_size
        self.padding_mode = padding_mode

    def forward(self, images):
      # images is a torch tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width)
        batch_size, _, h, w = images.shape
        
        #1 Calculate Padding
        pad_h = max(0, self.base_size - h)
        pad_w = max(0, self.base_size - w)

        pad_top = pad_h // 2
        pad_bottom = pad_h - pad_top
        pad_left = pad_w // 2
        pad_right = pad_w - pad_left
        
        padded_images = F.pad(images, (pad_left, pad_right, pad_top, pad_bottom), mode=self.padding_mode)
        _, _, padded_h, padded_w = padded_images.shape

        #2 Calculate Crop
        aspect_ratios = w/h
        
        min_aspect = torch.min(aspect_ratios)
        max_aspect = torch.max(aspect_ratios)
        
        target_aspect_ratio = (min_aspect + max_aspect) /2
        
        if target_aspect_ratio >= 1: #w >= h
            crop_h = self.base_size
            crop_w = int(self.base_size * target_aspect_ratio)

        else: #h > w
            crop_w = self.base_size
            crop_h = int(self.base_size / target_aspect_ratio)
        
        
        crop_h = min(crop_h, padded_h)
        crop_w = min(crop_w, padded_w)

        start_h = (padded_h - crop_h) // 2
        start_w = (padded_w - crop_w) // 2
        
        cropped_images = padded_images[:, :, start_h:start_h + crop_h, start_w:start_w + crop_w]

        resized_images = F.interpolate(cropped_images, size=(self.base_size, self.base_size), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)

        return resized_images
```
This code defines a module that takes a batch of images as input. First, it calculates the necessary padding, ensuring all images have at least `base_size` dimensions on each side. The calculation of how much to pad each side, ensures that the image remains centered within the padded tensor. Then, the aspect ratio of every image in the batch is considered, and a target aspect ratio is determined. This target ratio is used to calculate the crop size. The padded images are then cropped. Finally, the cropped image is scaled to the base size. This ensures a uniform input shape for the subsequent layers, while also maintaining the overall aspect ratio of the images.

Another approach for adapting spatial dimensions involves using fully convolutional networks (FCN). Unlike networks relying on fixed-size fully connected layers, FCNs process input data of arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, the spatial dimension of the output feature map depends on the spatial dimension of the input feature map. The overall architecture, comprised of only convolutional, pooling, and upsampling layers, permits processing inputs of varying spatial dimensions without requiring explicit changes in the network’s structure, however, there may still be a lower limit for dimensions due to the nature of pooling layers. This is particularly advantageous for working with images of varied size during training.

Here's an example of how an FCN can implicitly handle spatial dimension changes using a simplified structure, although a specific architecture may be far more complex:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleFCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleFCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        self.conv4 = nn.Conv2d(64, num_classes, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self, x):
      # x is a torch tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width)
        x = self.pool1(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = F.relu(self.conv3(x))
        x = self.conv4(x)

        return x

```

In this example, the `SimpleFCN` doesn’t have a fixed input size. Regardless of the input image dimension, the output will always produce a feature map with the same number of channels as defined in the last convolutional layer, namely the `num_classes`. The spatial dimensions will be derived by the pooling operations and padding of the input. The FCN architecture allows it to operate on input data of arbitrary spatial size. The final 1x1 convolutional layer reduces the number of channels to `num_classes`, forming a semantic map.

Finally, progressive resizing offers a training strategy where the input spatial dimension increases gradually during the training process. I've found this technique particularly helpful when training from scratch. It begins with smaller, down-sampled images, enabling the network to learn coarse features before being exposed to high-resolution images. This technique often stabilizes training and has been demonstrated to improve final performance by allowing the model to learn broader, more abstract features, before focusing on more specific spatial attributes.

The below code illustrates a simplified implementation of progressive resizing during training:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

class ImageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ImageModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 10)  # Fixed output size after convolutions

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

def resize_image_batch(images, target_size):
    resized_images = F.interpolate(images, size=target_size, mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)
    return resized_images

# Generate mock image data
def create_mock_dataset(batch_size, num_batches, initial_size):
  images = torch.randn(num_batches*batch_size, 3, initial_size, initial_size)
  labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (num_batches*batch_size,))
  return images, labels

def progressive_resize_training(model, train_images, train_labels, optimizer, batch_size, num_epochs, initial_size, target_size):
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    num_batches = len(train_images) // batch_size

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      resize_factor = epoch / num_epochs
      current_size = int(initial_size + (target_size - initial_size) * resize_factor)
      print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, input size: {current_size}")
      
      for i in range(0, num_batches*batch_size, batch_size):
        images_batch = train_images[i:i+batch_size]
        labels_batch = train_labels[i:i+batch_size]
        resized_images = resize_image_batch(images_batch, (current_size, current_size))

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(resized_images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels_batch)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()


# Training configuration and data generation.
batch_size = 32
initial_size = 16
target_size = 64
num_epochs = 5
num_batches = 100
train_images, train_labels = create_mock_dataset(batch_size, num_batches, initial_size)
model = ImageModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

progressive_resize_training(model, train_images, train_labels, optimizer, batch_size, num_epochs, initial_size, target_size)
```

In this example, during each epoch, the input image resolution is gradually increased from `initial_size` to `target_size`. Note that the convolutional layers of `ImageModel` are still limited by the `fc` layers, and would fail if the pooling layers reduced the spatial dimension below 8x8. This code illustrates the core concept of progressive resizing. The function `resize_image_batch` performs the resizing, while `progressive_resize_training` controls the training procedure.

These strategies provide robust methods for addressing variations in input spatial dimensions during training. I would recommend further exploring resources related to advanced image resizing techniques, fully convolutional networks, and the optimization of deep learning training schedules. A review of PyTorch's official documentation concerning image processing and data loading, as well as the concepts behind stochastic gradient descent, can further enhance one's understanding of training with spatial data. Books covering advanced deep learning practices would offer more comprehensive insights into optimizing complex deep learning pipelines.
