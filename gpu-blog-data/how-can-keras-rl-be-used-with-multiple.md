The implementation of multi-output reinforcement learning agents in Keras RL, while not explicitly a primary focus of its original design, is achievable through careful manipulation of the model architecture and the application of custom training loops. The core challenge stems from the fact that typical Keras RL agents are designed to interact with a single action space and, consequently, optimize a single policy. However, situations often arise where an agent needs to perform multiple, potentially independent, actions concurrently, each requiring its own dedicated output.

The core principle to addressing this lies in understanding that a Keras model can indeed produce multiple outputs. We just need to interpret these outputs within the context of the reinforcement learning paradigm. Instead of having a single action prediction, we can structure our model to predict multiple action components. For instance, consider a robotic arm that needs to control both its base rotation and its gripper at the same time; these actions, while related to the same overall task, operate within different action spaces.

Iâ€™ve encountered this exact scenario during my work on a simulated robotic assembly line. The robot needed to select both a type of component to pick up and the orientation in which to place it, which could be achieved by using a multi-output model.

**Explanation**

The standard Keras RL library expects a model where the final layer outputs a single vector of Q-values, one for each possible action. In our multi-output case, we will have multiple such output layers. The overall structure becomes a function approximation that takes in states and outputs multiple vectors representing Q-values or, in the case of policy gradient methods, directly the actions or their parameters. The key adjustments need to be made during training and inference.

First, the loss function needs to be adapted. For Q-learning based methods such as DQN, we no longer have a single scalar target Q-value but multiple ones. These need to be handled appropriately. We can use a custom loss function that calculates a distinct loss term for each output and sums them (or takes an average) to get the overall loss. Similarly, when using policy gradient methods, each output's gradient must be calculated separately before being applied to the overall model. The selection of which type of RL method to use depends on the requirements of the task at hand, and the characteristics of the multi-output action spaces.

Second, during the replay step for off-policy methods, we will need to store not just a single action, but the multiple actions that the agent took within its interaction with the environment. The replay buffer should store each individual action component, and during training, each output can have its loss and gradient calculated and updated separately.

Finally, for policy methods, during the action selection, each output will produce its respective actions, and those actions can be fed to the environment. Here, one has to ensure the proper handling of the action structure for the specific environment. In some cases, one could use a joint action space, which can be simply formed by concatenating each individual action space. In other cases, actions need to be processed separately or passed as separate parameters when interacting with the environment.

**Code Examples**

*Example 1: Multi-output DQN with Custom Loss*

Here's a simplified example of creating a DQN model with two output layers using Keras. The custom loss function highlights how the target Q-values are matched with the predicted Q-values, keeping in mind that we have multiple outputs. I am not considering the complexity of the underlying state handling for the sake of brevity.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers
import numpy as np

def create_multi_output_dqn(input_shape, num_actions_output1, num_actions_output2):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Conv2D(32, 8, strides=4, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 4, strides=2, activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, strides=1, activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.Flatten()(x)
    x = layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)

    output1 = layers.Dense(num_actions_output1, activation='linear', name='output1')(x)
    output2 = layers.Dense(num_actions_output2, activation='linear', name='output2')(x)
    
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[output1, output2])
    return model

def custom_dqn_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    output1_true = y_true[0]
    output1_pred = y_pred[0]
    output2_true = y_true[1]
    output2_pred = y_pred[1]

    loss1 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(output1_true, output1_pred)
    loss2 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(output2_true, output2_pred)

    return loss1 + loss2

input_shape = (84, 84, 4)
num_actions_output1 = 5
num_actions_output2 = 3
model = create_multi_output_dqn(input_shape, num_actions_output1, num_actions_output2)

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.00025, clipnorm=1.0)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=custom_dqn_loss)

# Example training step (with dummy data):
state = np.random.rand(1, 84, 84, 4)
target_q_values_output1 = np.random.rand(1, num_actions_output1)
target_q_values_output2 = np.random.rand(1, num_actions_output2)

# Note that the target Q-values are provided as a list
loss = model.train_on_batch(state, [target_q_values_output1, target_q_values_output2])
print(f"loss: {loss}")
```

The above code sets up a DQN model with two distinct output layers. The `custom_dqn_loss` function calculates individual losses for each output and sums them, facilitating the training of the multi-output network. Each output layer corresponds to one specific action.

*Example 2: Policy Gradient Method with Multiple Outputs*

This example demonstrates how to modify a policy network to have multiple outputs for policy gradient methods. Consider an agent with two action spaces (continuous): control of speed and rotation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers
import numpy as np


def create_multi_output_actor(input_shape, num_actions_output1, num_actions_output2):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)

    output1_mean = layers.Dense(num_actions_output1, activation='tanh', name='output1_mean')(x)
    output1_std = layers.Dense(num_actions_output1, activation='softplus', name='output1_std')(x)
    
    output2_mean = layers.Dense(num_actions_output2, activation='tanh', name='output2_mean')(x)
    output2_std = layers.Dense(num_actions_output2, activation='softplus', name='output2_std')(x)


    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[output1_mean,output1_std, output2_mean, output2_std])
    return model


def policy_gradient_loss(action_advantages, policy_outputs):
    output1_mean, output1_std, output2_mean, output2_std = policy_outputs

    action1_advantages, action2_advantages = action_advantages
    
    normal_dist1 = tf.distributions.Normal(loc=output1_mean, scale=output1_std)
    normal_dist2 = tf.distributions.Normal(loc=output2_mean, scale=output2_std)

    log_prob1 = normal_dist1.log_prob(action1_advantages)
    log_prob2 = normal_dist2.log_prob(action2_advantages)
    
    return -tf.reduce_mean(log_prob1 + log_prob2)
    
input_shape = (10,)
num_actions_output1 = 1
num_actions_output2 = 1
actor = create_multi_output_actor(input_shape, num_actions_output1, num_actions_output2)

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001, clipnorm=0.5)
#Dummy Data
state = np.random.rand(1, 10)
action1 = np.random.normal(0,1, size=(1, num_actions_output1))
action2 = np.random.normal(0,1, size=(1, num_actions_output2))
action_advantages = [action1, action2]

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    policy_outputs = actor(state)
    loss = policy_gradient_loss(action_advantages, policy_outputs)
grads = tape.gradient(loss, actor.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, actor.trainable_variables))

print(f"loss: {loss}")

```

The policy network now predicts both the mean and standard deviation of two normal distributions for each output, allowing the sampling of two separate continuous action sets, which are subsequently combined when interacting with the environment.

*Example 3: Custom Training Loop with multiple losses*

This example highlights the implementation of a custom training loop where the gradient is calculated explicitly based on multiple output layers, useful for complex scenarios where custom gradient operations are necessary.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers
import numpy as np

def create_multi_output_model(input_shape, num_actions_output1, num_actions_output2):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)

    output1 = layers.Dense(num_actions_output1, activation='linear', name='output1')(x)
    output2 = layers.Dense(num_actions_output2, activation='linear', name='output2')(x)

    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[output1, output2])
    return model


def custom_loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
    output1_true = y_true[0]
    output1_pred = y_pred[0]
    output2_true = y_true[1]
    output2_pred = y_pred[1]

    loss1 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(output1_true, output1_pred)
    loss2 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(output2_true, output2_pred)
    return loss1, loss2

input_shape = (10,)
num_actions_output1 = 5
num_actions_output2 = 3
model = create_multi_output_model(input_shape, num_actions_output1, num_actions_output2)

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001, clipnorm=1.0)

state = np.random.rand(1, 10)
target_q_values_output1 = np.random.rand(1, num_actions_output1)
target_q_values_output2 = np.random.rand(1, num_actions_output2)
y_true = [target_q_values_output1, target_q_values_output2]


with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(state)
    loss1, loss2 = custom_loss_function(y_true, y_pred)
    total_loss = loss1 + loss2


grads = tape.gradient(total_loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

print(f"Total Loss: {total_loss}, Loss1: {loss1}, Loss2: {loss2}")
```

In the above code, we explicitly separate losses for each output, which gives granular control over backpropagation and updates. This granular control can be very useful when outputs need to be treated differently.

**Resource Recommendations**

*   TensorFlow Documentation: The official TensorFlow documentation is the authoritative source for information on Keras APIs and TensorFlow functionalities. Pay specific attention to sections on model building, custom training loops, and gradient manipulation.

*   Reinforcement Learning Textbooks: Consider consulting general reinforcement learning textbooks. These provide a foundation on RL concepts. Look for resources that discuss multi-agent and multi-objective scenarios, as the techniques used there are often relevant.

*   Research Papers: Look for publications in top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) that present novel algorithms and approaches for handling multi-action spaces in RL. This is often cutting-edge material but will give you the latest information available.

In summary, while Keras RL is not immediately tailored for multi-output situations, you can effectively apply these techniques through model construction, custom loss functions, and, where needed, explicit gradient calculations.
