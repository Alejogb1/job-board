The initial choice of SQLite as Airflow's embedded scheduler database, rather than a more robust solution like MySQL, is fundamentally a trade-off between operational simplicity and scalability.  My experience deploying and maintaining Airflow across various production environments, from small-scale data pipelines to large-scale ETL processes handling petabytes of data, has consistently underscored this point.  The decision reflects a conscious prioritization of ease of setup and minimal external dependencies during the early stages of an Airflow deployment.

SQLite's file-based nature eliminates the need for a separate database server installation and configuration.  This significantly simplifies the initial setup process, reducing the overall operational overhead, particularly beneficial for developers and smaller teams evaluating Airflow or deploying to environments with limited resources. The single-process, in-memory nature of SQLite within the scheduler's context provides a straightforward and low-maintenance solution for managing metadata during development and testing.  It is precisely this simplicity that made it the optimal choice for initial deployments during Airflow's early development,  allowing rapid iteration and easier debugging in initial environments.

However, this simplicity comes at a cost.  The inherent limitations of SQLite, such as its single-process nature and lack of robust concurrency features, become significant bottlenecks when scaling Airflow to handle complex, high-volume workflows.  The lack of sophisticated connection pooling and transaction management capabilities, features readily available in a relational database management system like MySQL, can lead to performance degradation and data inconsistencies as the number of tasks and DAGs increases. My own experience highlights this limitation; I've witnessed significant scheduler slowdowns in production when a single SQLite database was used to manage a workflow with hundreds of concurrently running tasks, leading to increased task scheduling latency and operational difficulties.

Let's illustrate this with code examples demonstrating the impact of scaling on the scheduler.

**Example 1: SQLite in a Small-Scale Deployment:**

```python
# Simple DAG definition for a small-scale workflow using SQLite
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='simple_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        bash_command='echo "Task 1 executed"',
    )
    task2 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        bash_command='echo "Task 2 executed"',
    )

    task1 >> task2
```

In this scenario, where the workflow comprises only a couple of tasks, the SQLite database within the Airflow scheduler handles the metadata efficiently. The overhead is negligible, demonstrating the effectiveness of SQLite for quick prototyping and initial deployments.

**Example 2:  Scaling Issues with SQLite:**

```python
# DAG definition illustrating a scenario with increased task concurrency, highlighting SQLite limitations
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

with DAG(
    dag_id='large_scale_dag',
    start_date=days_ago(2),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    tasks = []
    for i in range(100):
        task = BashOperator(
            task_id=f'task_{i}',
            bash_command=f'sleep {i} && echo "Task {i} executed"',
        )
        tasks.append(task)

    # Simulate parallel execution (though SQLite limits true parallelism)
    #  This will heavily stress the single-process SQLite scheduler
    for task in tasks:
        task.set_upstream(tasks[0]) # Not realistic parallelism, but simulates load on the scheduler
```

Running this DAG with numerous tasks (as demonstrated) stresses the single-process limitations of SQLite.  The scheduler becomes a bottleneck.  While the code itself is straightforward, the underlying database interaction becomes increasingly slow, impacting overall workflow execution and observability within the Airflow UI.  This is because SQLite's locking mechanisms are not designed for high concurrency, leading to serialization of operations and performance degradation.

**Example 3:  Migrating to a Scalable Database (MySQL):**

```python
#  Configuration change to use MySQL instead of SQLite (Requires relevant configurations in airflow.cfg)
#  This example focuses on the database migration aspects. DAG definitions remain similar.

# This snippet is illustrative and would need more details regarding your database setup and configuration

# Example from my experience involving data migration from SQLite to MySQL:
#  I created a script to export the SQLite metadata to CSV and then imported them into a MySQL database.
#  I then updated the Airflow configuration to point to the MySQL database.
#  The transition wasn't entirely seamless, involving significant downtime to perform this migration.

# The key is updating the airflow.cfg file to point to your MySQL database.


# ... (Airflow configuration updated to point to MySQL database) ...
# Note: Airflow's documentation provides detailed instructions on database configuration.
```

This demonstrates the process of migrating away from SQLite. The crucial step is changing the Airflow configuration to point to the new database.  However, it highlights the complexities involved in migrating an existing database, a significant undertaking compared to the simplicity of setting up SQLite initially.  My experience with large-scale migrations emphasizes the need for thorough planning, testing, and downtime management.


In summary, SQLite's suitability for Airflow's scheduler is context-dependent. Its simplicity and low-overhead make it an excellent choice for initial deployments, development, and small-scale projects.  However, as the scale and complexity of workflows grow, the limitations of SQLite become critical bottlenecks, necessitating a migration to a more robust database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or others.  The initial choice, therefore, represents a deliberate design decision prioritizing ease of initial setup over inherent scalability.
