The most efficient GPU-based method for calculating and storing maximum values hinges on understanding memory access patterns and leveraging the inherent parallelism of the GPU architecture.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing kernels for financial modeling revealed that naive approaches, such as straightforward reductions, often fall short due to memory bandwidth limitations.  The optimal strategy involves a hierarchical reduction coupled with efficient data storage leveraging texture memory or shared memory, depending on the problem size and GPU architecture.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Efficient maximum value calculation on a GPU necessitates a multi-stage process.  A single, monolithic reduction, where the entire dataset is reduced to a single value in a single kernel pass, is inefficient for large datasets.  This is primarily because of the global memory bandwidth bottleneck.  The bottleneck arises from the relatively slow speed of transferring data from global memory to the processing units (stream processors) compared to the speed of the computation itself.

To mitigate this, we employ a hierarchical reduction approach. The initial step involves dividing the input data into smaller blocks, typically sized to fit within shared memory. Each block undergoes a reduction within the shared memory of a single multiprocessor, exploiting the much faster access speed. The results of these smaller reductions – one maximum value per block – are then accumulated through subsequent reduction stages until a global maximum is obtained.  This hierarchical approach significantly reduces the number of global memory accesses, accelerating the overall computation.

The storage of the maximum value depends on the application's requirements.  For simple cases where only the single global maximum is needed, storing it in a single variable in global memory suffices.  However, for applications requiring per-block maxima or intermediate results for further analysis, careful consideration of the memory hierarchy is critical.  Texture memory, offering high bandwidth and cache coherency, proves beneficial for read-only access to intermediate maxima.  Alternatively, global memory with optimized data structures, like arrays aligned to memory pages, can also improve performance.  Choosing between these approaches depends on factors like the dataset size and the access pattern of the subsequent computations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the hierarchical reduction strategy using CUDA.  Each example focuses on a particular aspect of optimization.

**Example 1: Basic Hierarchical Reduction using Shared Memory**

```cuda
__global__ void maxReduction(const float* input, float* output, int numElements) {
  __shared__ float sharedMax[256]; // Adjust block size as needed
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  float maxVal = -FLT_MAX; // Initialize with negative infinity

  if (i < numElements) {
    maxVal = input[i];
  }

  // Local reduction within shared memory
  for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
    if (threadIdx.x < s) {
      maxVal = max(maxVal, sharedMax[threadIdx.x + s]);
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
    sharedMax[0] = maxVal;
  }
  __syncthreads();

  // Global reduction (requires additional kernel for large datasets)
  if (blockIdx.x == 0 && threadIdx.x == 0) {
    output[0] = sharedMax[0];
  }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates the core idea of shared memory reduction. The local reduction within shared memory significantly reduces the number of global memory accesses.  However, for large datasets, a separate kernel will be required to further reduce the block-wise maxima.  The `__syncthreads()` call is crucial for ensuring all threads within a block complete their local operations before proceeding.

**Example 2:  Using Atomic Operations for Global Reduction (Smaller Datasets)**

```cuda
__global__ void atomicMax(const float* input, float* output, int numElements) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < numElements) {
        atomicMax(output, input[i]);
    }
}
```

For smaller datasets where the overhead of a hierarchical approach outweighs its benefits, using atomic operations can simplify the code.  However, contention on the `output` variable can become a significant bottleneck as the number of threads increases.  Therefore, this is suitable only for datasets that are small enough to avoid substantial contention.

**Example 3:  Leveraging Texture Memory for Intermediate Results (Read-Only Access)**

```cuda
// ... (Kernel to compute intermediate maxima and store in texture memory) ...

// Subsequent kernel utilizing texture memory for faster access
texture<float, 1, cudaReadModeElementType> texRef;
__global__ void processMaxima(float* output, int numBlocks){
    int blockIndex = blockIdx.x;
    if(blockIndex < numBlocks){
        output[blockIndex] = tex1Dfetch(texRef, blockIndex);
    }
}
```

This approach is effective when multiple kernels require access to the intermediate maxima.  Storing the intermediate results in texture memory provides faster read-only access compared to global memory, significantly speeding up subsequent computations. Note that this requires setting up the texture memory appropriately before kernel launch.  The `tex1Dfetch` function provides coherent access to texture memory.

*   CUDA Programming Guide:  Understanding CUDA's memory hierarchy and programming model is fundamental for optimization.
*   NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Documentation:  This provides detailed information on CUDA functions and libraries.
*   High-Performance Computing Textbooks:  A solid foundation in parallel algorithms and architecture is essential.


My years working on high-frequency trading algorithms have shown the critical need for meticulous attention to memory access patterns when dealing with GPU computation. The hierarchical reduction strategy, as exemplified above, along with judicious use of texture or shared memory, remains the most robust solution for efficiently calculating and storing maximum values on GPUs, even with large datasets, avoiding the performance bottlenecks encountered with simpler approaches.  The selection of the specific technique should always be guided by the dataset size, computational requirements, and the overall application architecture.
