The unexpected output of `Layer.get_weights()` as `(1, 1, 1, 2080, 1536)` strongly suggests a misinterpretation of the layer's internal structure, likely stemming from an unconventional architecture or an incorrect application of a reshaping operation.  In my experience debugging convolutional neural networks, this shape almost invariably indicates a dimension representing a single element being incorrectly interpreted as a spatial dimension.  This usually occurs when dealing with layers preceding or succeeding a flattening or reshaping operation, or within layers designed for specific, non-standard input formats.  Correct interpretation requires a careful analysis of the layer’s input and output tensors, the activation function, and the preceding and subsequent layers in the model.

**1. Explanation of the Shape and Potential Causes:**

The shape `(1, 1, 1, 2080, 1536)` implies five dimensions.  Conventionally, in convolutional layers, we expect to see a shape representing (batch_size, height, width, channels).  The presence of three leading singleton dimensions (1, 1, 1) points to an unusual situation.  Let's break it down:

* **(1):** Likely represents the batch size, a single sample.  This is common during testing or inference, but less common during training unless you're processing samples individually.
* **(1):** This first singleton dimension hints at a spatial dimension being misinterpreted. A single-element dimension isn’t inherently wrong; it’s the context that matters.  This extra dimension may have been introduced through a `tf.reshape` or `np.reshape` operation.
* **(1):** A second singleton dimension further reinforces the suspicion of misinterpretation.  The original intended spatial dimensions may have been erroneously expanded.
* **(2080):**  This is likely the flattened representation of one of the original spatial dimensions or potentially a feature dimension. The size suggests it might stem from the flattening of a higher-dimensional representation.
* **(1536):** This is probably the flattened representation of another spatial dimension or feature dimension.  Again, its large size suggests the possibility of an earlier flattening.

Several scenarios could lead to this shape:

* **Incorrect Reshaping:**  A layer might have been inappropriately reshaped using functions like `tf.reshape` or `np.reshape` before the weight extraction, introducing extra singleton dimensions.  This often happens when trying to adapt a layer for different input sizes without fully understanding the implication on weight dimensions.
* **Custom Layer with Unconventional Structure:** A custom layer might have been implemented with an unconventional weight organization. The weights could be arranged in a way that's not consistent with standard Keras or TensorFlow layer implementations.
* **Interaction with other layers:** A layer might be inappropriately interacting with a preceding flattening layer or a succeeding layer that doesn’t correctly account for the dimensionality.
* **Misinterpretation of the activation function:** Some activation functions, if incorrectly applied, could unexpectedly alter the tensor shape or interpretation of the weight shape.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three examples that illustrate potential scenarios and debugging strategies.  These examples use TensorFlow/Keras, but the principles apply to other frameworks.

**Example 1: Incorrect Reshaping before Weight Extraction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple convolutional layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), # Flattening occurs here
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Incorrect Reshape before getting weights
weights_before_reshape = model.layers[0].get_weights()

# Introducing an unnecessary reshape
reshaped_weights = np.reshape(weights_before_reshape[0], (1, 1, 1, weights_before_reshape[0].shape[2], weights_before_reshape[0].shape[3]))

# Incorrect shape is observed here
print(reshaped_weights.shape) # Output: (1, 1, 1, 32, 3)

# Correct way to access weights
correct_weights = model.layers[0].get_weights()
print(correct_weights[0].shape) # Output: (3, 3, 1, 32)

```

This illustrates how an arbitrary reshaping operation can dramatically alter the apparent shape of the weights, making them uninterpretable.


**Example 2: Custom Layer with Mismanaged Dimensions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=10, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MyCustomLayer(units=1536),
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape((1, 1, 1, 1536)) #This is the incorrect operation
])

print(model.layers[1].get_weights()[0].shape) # Output: (784, 1536)

#Note that the reshape operation happens after the layer, potentially leading to the incorrect shape being recorded in the final model summary
```

Here a custom layer, when coupled with an improper reshaping operation, could introduce the unwanted dimensions.  The key is to carefully manage dimensions within the custom layer's `build` and `call` methods.

**Example 3: Debugging through Layer-by-Layer Inspection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') #load your model

#Inspect the shapes of intermediate activations and weights
for layer in model.layers:
    try:
        print(f"Layer: {layer.name}, Output Shape: {layer.output_shape}, Weights Shape: {layer.get_weights()[0].shape}")
    except IndexError:
        print(f"Layer: {layer.name} has no trainable weights")
    except AttributeError:
        print(f"Could not access weights for layer: {layer.name}")

```

This demonstrates a systematic approach.  By examining the output shape of each layer, you can pinpoint where the dimensionality unexpectedly changes, tracing back to the problematic section.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation;  Keras documentation;  NumPy documentation;  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning; a debugging guide specific to your chosen deep learning framework.  These resources will provide detailed explanations of tensor manipulation, layer implementation, and debugging techniques relevant to your specific scenario. Remember that careful attention to input shapes and output shapes at each stage of your neural network is paramount to identifying and resolving dimensional inconsistencies.
