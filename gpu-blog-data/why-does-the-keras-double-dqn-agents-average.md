The instability and failure to converge frequently observed in Keras-based Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQNs) often stems from a subtle interplay between hyperparameter selection, network architecture, and the inherent instability of the Q-learning algorithm itself, exacerbated by the double DQN modification.  My experience debugging similar issues over several projects points towards three primary culprits: insufficient exploration, inadequate network capacity, and inappropriate target network updates.

1. **Insufficient Exploration:**  DDQN, while mitigating overestimation bias present in standard DQN, still relies heavily on the exploration-exploitation trade-off.  Inadequate exploration prevents the agent from discovering optimal actions, especially in complex state spaces.  The agent may become trapped in a local optimum due to insufficient sampling of the action space, leading to a seemingly decreasing average reward.  This manifests as the agent consistently choosing suboptimal actions, resulting in a negative feedback loop that drives the average reward downwards.  The choice of exploration strategy, its parameters (e.g., epsilon in epsilon-greedy), and the annealing schedule significantly impact convergence.  A decaying epsilon that decreases too rapidly can prematurely limit exploration, hindering the agent's ability to escape suboptimal strategies.

2. **Inadequate Network Capacity:** The neural network approximating the Q-function must possess sufficient capacity to represent the complex relationships between states and actions within the environment.  A network that is too small – lacking enough neurons or layers – may struggle to accurately estimate Q-values. This results in inaccurate action selection and hampers the learning process.  Similarly, an overly complex network can lead to overfitting, where the agent performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen states.  Overfitting manifests as high variance in the Q-value estimates, leading to unpredictable and unstable learning.  Finding the right balance is crucial, and often requires systematic experimentation with different architectures.

3. **Inappropriate Target Network Updates:**  The target network in DDQN plays a critical role in stabilizing the learning process.  It provides a relatively stable estimate of future rewards, reducing oscillations and facilitating convergence.  However, infrequent or overly frequent updates can negatively impact performance.  Infrequent updates can lead to slow learning and possibly divergence, whereas excessively frequent updates can negate the stability benefits of the target network, effectively turning it into a constantly shifting target, leading to unstable Q-value estimations and poor performance. The update frequency is usually controlled by a separate update interval, often decoupled from the main network update frequency.


Let's illustrate these points with code examples, assuming a simple cartpole environment:

**Example 1: Insufficient Exploration (Epsilon-Greedy with Rapid Decay)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# ... (Environment setup using gym.make('CartPole-v1')) ...

model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(state_size,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(action_size, activation='linear')
])
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001))

epsilon = 1.0
epsilon_decay = 0.995 # This is too rapid a decay
epsilon_min = 0.01

# ... (Training loop) ...
  if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
      action = env.action_space.sample()  # Explore
  else:
      action = np.argmax(model.predict(state)[0]) # Exploit

  epsilon = max(epsilon * epsilon_decay, epsilon_min) # Rapid decay leads to insufficient exploration
# ... (Rest of the training loop) ...
```

This example demonstrates how a rapid decay in epsilon can severely limit exploration, potentially leading to premature convergence to a suboptimal policy.  A slower decay or a different exploration strategy (e.g., Boltzmann exploration) would be more suitable.


**Example 2: Inadequate Network Capacity (Shallow Network)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# ... (Environment setup) ...

model = Sequential([ # Too shallow a network
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(state_size,)),
    Dense(action_size, activation='linear')
])
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001))

# ... (Training loop) ...
```

This code snippet shows a very shallow network.  The limited capacity prevents it from accurately representing the complex Q-function, hindering performance and potentially leading to a failure to converge.  Adding more layers and neurons (experimenting with different architectures) can improve the network's representational power.


**Example 3: Inappropriate Target Network Updates (Infrequent Updates)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Environment setup) ...

model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(state_size,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(action_size, activation='linear')
])
target_model = tf.keras.models.clone_model(model) # Target network

model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001))

target_update_freq = 1000 # Infrequent updates

# ... (Training loop) ...
  # ... (Training step for model) ...
  if step % target_update_freq == 0:
      target_model.set_weights(model.get_weights()) # Infrequent target network updates
# ... (Rest of the training loop) ...
```

Here, the target network is updated infrequently (`target_update_freq = 1000`).  This infrequent updating can lead to slow learning and potentially divergence, because the target Q-values are not updated often enough to reflect the current Q-values, leading to poor estimations and instability.  A more frequent update (e.g., every 100 steps or using a soft update mechanism) would be more appropriate.

Through rigorous experimentation and careful consideration of these aspects – exploration, network architecture, and target network updates – I have consistently improved the stability and convergence of my DDQN agents.  Addressing these points often resolves the observed decrease in average reward and ensures successful training. Remember that hyperparameter tuning is crucial and often requires iterative adjustment based on observed performance.
