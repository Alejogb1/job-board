The most frequent reason a Java class isn't called, in my experience spanning over a decade of development, boils down to simple, easily overlooked issues in the classpath configuration or the instantiation process itself.  The problem rarely lies within the class's internal logic unless a significant error is thrown during initializationâ€”which would generally be caught through logging or a debugger.

1. **Classpath Issues:** The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needs to locate the compiled `.class` file corresponding to the class you're attempting to invoke.  Any discrepancy between the class's declared package structure and its actual location within the file system, or misconfigurations in the classpath environment variable or build system's classpath definition, will prevent the JVM from finding and loading the class. This results in a `ClassNotFoundException`.  I've spent countless hours debugging this, particularly in larger projects with complex module dependencies and build scripts.

2. **Instantiation Problems:** Even if the class is correctly located, it might not be instantiated correctly.  This can manifest as a failure to create an object of the class, leading to a `NullPointerException` further down the line. This is especially relevant when dealing with constructors that require specific arguments or might throw exceptions during initialization.

3. **Incorrect or Missing Calls:** The most straightforward reason, and one frequently missed in simpler projects, is the absence of any code actually calling the class's methods or instantiating its objects.  It seems obvious, but in large, multifaceted projects with numerous dependencies and asynchronous operations, it's easy to miss a single line of code that's supposed to be the entry point to the class's functionality.  Thorough code review and careful examination of the execution flow are essential to identify this scenario.

4. **Access Modifiers:** The visibility of your class's members (methods and variables) plays a crucial role in accessibility. If you attempt to access a private or package-private member from outside its package, your code will fail to compile or run successfully, potentially masking the underlying reason why the class itself appears to not be called.


Let's illustrate these points with code examples:


**Example 1: Classpath Issue**

```java
// MyClass.java (located in com/example/package)
package com.example.package;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("MyClass method called");
    }
}

// MainClass.java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        com.example.package.MyClass myObject = new com.example.package.MyClass();
        myObject.myMethod();
    }
}
```

If `MainClass.java` is compiled and run without including the `com/example/package` directory (containing the compiled `MyClass.class`) in the classpath, a `ClassNotFoundException` will be thrown. The error message will explicitly state that `com.example.package.MyClass` cannot be found.  The solution is to correctly set the classpath during compilation and execution.  For example, using a build tool like Maven or Gradle will automatically manage this; if using the command line, you would include the directory in the `CLASSPATH` environment variable or the `-cp` option during compilation and execution.


**Example 2: Instantiation Problem**

```java
// MyClass.java
public class MyClass {
    private String name;

    public MyClass(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        if (name == null || name.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be null or empty");
        }
    }

    public void printName() {
        System.out.println("My name is: " + name);
    }
}

// MainClass.java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass(""); //Attempting to create with invalid argument
        myObject.printName();
    }
}
```

This code will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` during the instantiation of `MyClass`. The `printName()` method will never be called.  The solution is to handle the exception, providing a valid `name` parameter, or modifying the constructor to handle null or empty names more gracefully (e.g., assigning a default value).


**Example 3: Missing Call**

```java
// MyClass.java
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("MyClass method called");
    }
}

// MainClass.java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //MyClass myObject = new MyClass();  //Missing instantiation and method call.
        System.out.println("Main method completed");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a scenario where `MyClass` is correctly compiled and included in the classpath, but the `main` method of `MainClass` never creates an instance of `MyClass` or calls its methods.  The output shows only "Main method completed," indicating that `MyClass` was never invoked. The solution is to add the missing line(s) to instantiate `MyClass` and call `myMethod()`.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The Java Language Specification,  "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch,  a comprehensive Java tutorial (search for reputable options online).  Debugging tools such as a Java debugger integrated within your IDE,  and leveraging your IDE's code analysis features. Mastering the intricacies of your chosen build tool (Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc.) is also crucial.  A thorough understanding of exception handling within the Java language will aid in diagnosing numerous issues, including those pertaining to class instantiation and execution flow.  Finally, consistent and informative logging within your code will drastically accelerate the debugging process in the majority of real-world scenarios.
