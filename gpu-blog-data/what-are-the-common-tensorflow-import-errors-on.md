TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi 3, while achievable, often presents unique import challenges primarily stemming from resource constraints and platform-specific compilation complexities. Having spent a considerable amount of time optimizing machine learning deployments on this hardware, I’ve encountered a few recurring import errors, each typically indicating a distinct underlying issue.

The most prevalent errors revolve around library incompatibilities, architecture mismatches, and insufficient resources. These factors manifest during the initial ‘import tensorflow’ statement, halting the program execution before it can even begin utilizing the framework. It's a brittle step in the deployment process, so a comprehensive understanding is necessary.

Let’s explore the common errors I have experienced, outlining their causes and typical solutions.

**1. 'Illegal Instruction' Error**

This error, a particularly cryptic one, often presents itself as "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" immediately following the import statement. It does not typically stem from an actual instruction issue within your code. Instead, it is primarily caused by attempting to run a TensorFlow binary compiled for a different CPU architecture than the Raspberry Pi 3’s ARMv7 processor.

The core problem lies in the fact that many pre-built TensorFlow wheels available on pip’s repository are built for x86-64 architectures found in desktop computers, not ARM architectures. This mismatch prevents the CPU from understanding the instructions provided in the library. Attempting to execute such binaries results in the ‘Illegal instruction’ error.

_Solution:_

To mitigate this, you cannot simply install any TensorFlow wheel with `pip install tensorflow`. Instead, you require one specifically compiled for the Raspberry Pi 3's ARMv7 architecture. The recommended approach here is to either install an appropriately built wheel (often available on community-maintained repositories) or to compile TensorFlow from source. Compiling from source, while more time consuming, ensures that all dependencies are properly aligned with the target architecture. It involves setting up the appropriate compiler tools and configuring the build flags specifically for ARMv7.

**Code Example (Attempt to Install Incompatible Wheel)**

```python
# This code will typically result in an 'Illegal Instruction' error on Raspberry Pi 3
# if the wheel isn't compatible.
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)

# The error would manifest on execution of the import.
```

This illustrates the issue without doing anything more than importing TensorFlow. The print statement doesn’t even execute; the error occurs as the import is processed. It highlights the fundamental incompatibility issue. The problem is not in our Python code but in how the TensorFlow library itself was built.

**2. 'ImportError: libtensorflow_framework.so: cannot open shared object file' Error**

Another frequent culprit is the "ImportError: libtensorflow_framework.so: cannot open shared object file" error. This error occurs because the dynamic library required by TensorFlow, named `libtensorflow_framework.so`, is either not found or incompatible with the system's architecture or its other libraries. This indicates issues relating to the correct installation or pathing of dependencies.

There are two main reasons this appears. One is that during the TensorFlow installation, the `libtensorflow_framework.so` library didn’t get placed in a location the runtime linker searches by default, or that environment variables pointing to this path are not properly configured. This means even if TensorFlow itself is correctly installed, the system is unable to locate its critical dependency.

The second reason is a compatibility issue with other dynamic libraries on the system, particularly ones related to `glibc`. The TensorFlow library, built under a specific version of these libraries, might not load if the system's version is different. It leads to runtime link issues that manifests as the "cannot open shared object file" error.

_Solution:_

The fix involves ensuring the dynamic linker can locate the required `libtensorflow_framework.so` file. Sometimes, this involves directly copying the `.so` file into directories already included in the system's library path.  It’s also often achieved by explicitly defining the path in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable before starting the python program. This tells the runtime linker where it should search for the shared object file. If a compatibility conflict exists, downgrading TensorFlow or recompiling with a compatible toolchain is essential.

**Code Example (Demonstrating the Pathing Issue)**

```python
# Example demonstrating incorrect LD_LIBRARY_PATH

import os
# This code is meant to be run in the terminal, not in a python script directly.

# In a terminal, try running this:
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/incorrect/libdir python your_program.py

# The following line shows the user what their current search path is.
os.system("ldconfig -p | grep tensorflow")
# This will not return the correct shared object, as the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is wrong.
```

This example demonstrates an incorrect path. If the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable points to a directory that does not contain a correct `libtensorflow_framework.so`, you will experience the `cannot open shared object file` error. The `ldconfig` check helps you to understand the current pathing setup on your system. This example needs to be run from the terminal and not directly in Python.

**3. 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'' Error**

Although seemingly trivial, the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'" error frequently surfaces. It indicates that while a TensorFlow installation may have completed, it's not accessible within the current Python environment. This can occur in a multitude of situations involving virtual environments, multiple installations, or corrupted installations.

The error is usually caused when TensorFlow is installed into a virtual environment that is not activated or when Python searches a path that is not where you installed TensorFlow. A situation where a pip-managed installation differs from what the default python binary recognizes also happens when using `sudo pip install`. `sudo pip` places libraries under `root`, which will not be picked up by the user's version of python if called without sudo. It essentially renders your installation effectively invisible to a standard user environment, resulting in the “ModuleNotFoundError”.

_Solution:_

The immediate step here is to verify that the active Python interpreter is indeed the one where you installed TensorFlow. Using virtual environments or explicitly directing the Python program to use a specific environment where you’ve installed TensorFlow solves most instances. Always activating the intended environment before execution is paramount. When using `pip install`, do not use `sudo` if possible. If that’s not an option, make sure to use the `sudo` context when calling the script also.

**Code Example (Environment Isolation Problem)**

```python
# Assumes a situation where you've used a different install context.

import sys
import os

# This shows where python is looking.
print(sys.path)
# Typically if you did not install tensorflow with `sudo pip`, you should use
# your user environment's python interpreter.

# This code would trigger the ModuleNotFoundError if tensorflow is not located in the listed paths.
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(tf.__version__)

except ModuleNotFoundError:
    print("Tensorflow is not installed in this python environment!")
    print("Make sure to activate the correct python environment.")
    print("Try running with the correct environment or activating a venv.")

```
This snippet demonstrates the issue of an incorrect python environment context. This check highlights the need to ensure both pip and the script are referencing the same locations. If TensorFlow is not installed in any of the paths found in the `sys.path`, a `ModuleNotFoundError` will be the result. It illustrates the need for awareness of which python environment is actually being run and what is present in its site-packages directory.

**Resource Recommendations**

While providing direct links to external sites goes against the instructions, I can confidently recommend the official TensorFlow documentation as a primary resource. Furthermore, community forums dedicated to Raspberry Pi and machine learning often contain practical solutions and user experiences regarding these issues. GitHub repositories of Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow projects will have specific instructions and troubleshooting advice. Finally, utilizing search engines with a clear description of the errors is useful in finding solutions to specific environments and situations, and to find the specific build of TensorFlow required.
