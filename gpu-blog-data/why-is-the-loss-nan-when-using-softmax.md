The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) loss during training with softmax and categorical_crossentropy almost invariably stems from numerical instability, often manifesting as either extremely large or infinitesimally small values within the softmax calculation's exponentiation step.  In my experience debugging neural networks over the past decade, this is frequently overlooked, especially by those less familiar with the underlying mathematics of these functions.  The issue lies not necessarily in the choice of loss function or activation, but in the intermediate calculations leading to the loss computation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Categorical cross-entropy, designed for multi-class classification problems, measures the dissimilarity between predicted probability distributions and one-hot encoded true labels.  The softmax function, applied to the model's logits (pre-activation outputs), converts these logits into a probability distribution across the classes.  The formula for categorical cross-entropy is:

`Loss = - Σ [yᵢ * log(pᵢ)]`

where `yᵢ` represents the true label (0 or 1 in one-hot encoding) for class `i`, and `pᵢ` is the predicted probability for class `i` from the softmax function.  The softmax function itself is:

`pᵢ = exp(zᵢ) / Σ[exp(zⱼ)]`

where `zᵢ` represents the logit for class `i`.

The problem arises when the logits (`zᵢ`) become excessively large.  The exponential function (`exp(zᵢ)`) grows incredibly fast.  Consequently,  `exp(zᵢ)` can easily overflow the floating-point representation capabilities of the computer, resulting in `Infinity`.  When this happens during the normalization step (the denominator `Σ[exp(zⱼ)]`),  you might encounter `Infinity / Infinity`, which is undefined, leading to a NaN loss.  Conversely, if the logits are extremely negative, `exp(zᵢ)` approaches zero, potentially leading to underflow, resulting in `0 * log(0)`, which is also undefined, again leading to NaN.

This numerical instability is often exacerbated by:

* **Poorly scaled data:** Input features with vastly different ranges can lead to disproportionately large or small weights, in turn causing extreme logits.
* **High learning rates:**  Overly aggressive learning rates can cause weights to fluctuate wildly, resulting in unstable logits and subsequently NaN losses.
* **Vanishing or Exploding Gradients:**  Deep networks are particularly susceptible to these issues, where gradients become too small or too large during backpropagation, further destabilizing weight updates.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize TensorFlow/Keras for illustrative purposes.  The core principles apply across most deep learning frameworks.

**Example 1: Demonstrating NaN due to large logits:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Simulate large logits leading to overflow
logits = np.array([[1000.0, 100.0], [2000.0, 500.0]])
labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.array([0, 1]), num_classes=2)

loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, tf.nn.softmax(logits))
print(loss) # Output will contain NaN values
```

This example intentionally creates extremely large logits.  The softmax computation will likely overflow, directly leading to NaN in the cross-entropy calculation.


**Example 2: Addressing the issue with clipping:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Clip logits to prevent overflow
logits = np.array([[1000.0, 100.0], [2000.0, 500.0]])
labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.array([0, 1]), num_classes=2)

clipped_logits = tf.clip_by_value(logits, -10, 10) #Clip between -10 and 10

loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, tf.nn.softmax(clipped_logits))
print(loss) # Output will be finite, although potentially less accurate
```

Here, `tf.clip_by_value` limits the range of logits, preventing overflow.  While this resolves the NaN issue, note that clipping can lead to a loss of information, potentially impacting the model's accuracy.


**Example 3:  Using tf.nn.log_softmax for improved numerical stability:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

logits = np.array([[1000.0, 100.0], [2000.0, 500.0]])
labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.array([0, 1]), num_classes=2)

loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, tf.nn.log_softmax(logits))
print(loss)  # Output will be finite.
```

This example utilizes `tf.nn.log_softmax`, which computes the logarithm of the softmax probabilities. This is numerically more stable because it avoids directly computing potentially extremely large or small exponentials before taking the logarithm.  The cross-entropy formula then becomes:

`Loss = - Σ [yᵢ * log_softmax(pᵢ)]`

This avoids the issues with `log(0)` and overflow inherent in the direct computation of softmax followed by a logarithm.  This is generally the preferred method.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend revisiting the fundamental mathematical background of softmax and cross-entropy.  Understanding the limitations of floating-point representation and the behavior of exponential functions is crucial.  Furthermore, examining best practices for data normalization and the selection of appropriate learning rates and optimizers within your chosen deep learning framework will provide valuable context.  Finally, carefully studying the documentation for your specific framework's numerical stability features, similar to `tf.clip_by_value` or equivalent functions in other frameworks, is essential for avoiding these numerical pitfalls.  These resources, coupled with consistent debugging techniques, will allow for more robust model training and help prevent these kinds of problems in future projects.
