Parameter size mismatches between processes stem fundamentally from differing data type interpretations and memory management strategies employed by each process.  Over the course of my fifteen years developing high-performance distributed systems, I've encountered this issue countless times, primarily in scenarios involving inter-process communication (IPC) and legacy code integration.  The core problem isn't simply a matter of differing numerical values; itâ€™s rooted in how these values are represented in memory, affecting the number of bytes allocated to each parameter.

**1.  Explanation:**

The most common cause is the use of differing data models or architectures across processes.  Consider a scenario where Process A, written in C++, uses a 64-bit integer to represent a particular value, while Process B, a Java application, utilizes a 32-bit integer for the same variable. When Process A attempts to send this 64-bit integer to Process B via a shared memory segment or message queue, Process B will only receive the lower 32 bits, leading to data truncation and potentially catastrophic failure.  This discrepancy is magnified when dealing with complex data structures:  a struct in C++ might contain padding bytes for alignment purposes, while the equivalent Java class might not, leading to variations in overall size.

Furthermore, endianness plays a crucial role.  A process running on a big-endian system will arrange bytes in a data structure differently compared to a little-endian system.  If no explicit byte-order conversion occurs during IPC, a parameter sent from a big-endian process to a little-endian one will be misinterpreted, resulting in an apparent mismatch.  This isn't a size mismatch in the strict sense, but produces the same outcome: incorrect data interpretation.

Another significant factor is the use of different compiler versions or settings. Compilers might optimize data structures differently, introducing padding or alignment variations that alter the parameter sizes. Similarly, the use of different operating systems, particularly with varying calling conventions, can lead to inconsistencies. The way parameters are passed on the stack or in registers can be OS-specific and affect the perceived size at the receiving end.

Finally, the presence of legacy code or undocumented data structures significantly amplifies the complexity.  Unclear documentation, combined with evolving system architectures, makes it difficult to track down the precise discrepancies without rigorous analysis and reverse engineering of the involved processes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: C++ and Java IPC using a Shared Memory Segment**

This example demonstrates a potential size mismatch when sending a struct from a C++ process to a Java process using a shared memory segment.


```c++
// Process A (C++)
struct Data {
    int32_t value1;
    int64_t value2;
    char padding[4]; // padding for alignment
};

int main() {
    Data data = {10, 20000000000, {0}}; // Initialize data
    // ... attach to shared memory segment ...
    // ... copy data to shared memory ...
    return 0;
}

//Process B (Java)
public class Receiver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... attach to shared memory segment ...
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(16); // Assumes 16 bytes
        buffer.getInt(); // Reads value1
        buffer.getLong();//Reads value2

        // ...access data...
    }
}
```

Commentary:  The C++ struct `Data` includes padding, resulting in a size larger than the Java code anticipates. If the Java code doesn't account for this padding, it will lead to incorrect data interpretation.  The correct approach involves explicitly defining the data structure in both languages with identical byte representation and handling padding explicitly.


**Example 2: Python and C through a Named Pipe**

This illustrates size discrepancies when communicating between Python and a C program via a named pipe.

```python
# Process A (Python)
import os
pipe_name = "/tmp/mypipe"
os.mkfifo(pipe_name)
with open(pipe_name, 'wb') as pipe:
    data = (10, 20.5)
    pipe.write(b'\x00\x00\x00\x0A\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x40\x20\x00\x00') #Directly writing byte representation
```

```c
// Process B (C)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("/tmp/mypipe", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) return 1;
    char buffer[14];
    read(fd, buffer, 14);
    int val1 = *(int*)buffer;
    float val2 = *(float*)(buffer + 4);
    printf("val1: %d val2: %f", val1, val2);
    return 0;
}

```

Commentary: This example uses explicit byte representation, circumventing Python's potentially variable serialization. However, the C code still needs careful type casting and relies on the assumption that the data in the pipe is structured as precisely defined. A safer and more robust solution would involve a more structured data exchange format like Protocol Buffers.


**Example 3:  Endianness Issue**

This code demonstrates the issue of endianness when transmitting a short integer.

```c
// Big-Endian System
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
int main() {
    uint16_t value = 0x1234; // Hex representation of 4660
    char buffer[2];
    buffer[0] = (value >> 8) & 0xFF; // high byte first
    buffer[1] = value & 0xFF;       // low byte next
    // send buffer to Little Endian System
}
```

```c
// Little-Endian System
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
int main() {
    char buffer[2];
    // receive buffer from Big-Endian System
    uint16_t value = (uint16_t)buffer[1] | ((uint16_t)buffer[0] << 8);
    printf("Value: %x", value); //output: 3412
}
```


Commentary:  The big-endian system sends the most significant byte first.  The little-endian system reconstructs incorrectly without explicit byte-swapping.  Functions like `htonl()` and `ntohl()` (for network byte order) can help address this endianness issue.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For advanced inter-process communication, explore established frameworks such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and ZeroMQ.  They offer robust solutions for handling data serialization, and address many of the potential issues inherent in direct memory sharing or custom IPC mechanisms. Studying network programming concepts, byte-order representation, and data serialization/deserialization techniques is also crucial.  Familiarize yourself with compiler optimization flags and their impact on data structure alignment. Finally, thorough documentation and structured coding practices are essential to mitigate the risks of parameter size mismatches in complex systems.
