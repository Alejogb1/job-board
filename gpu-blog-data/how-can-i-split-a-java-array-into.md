Splitting an array and storing its segments into objects within another array requires careful consideration of array bounds, object instantiation, and memory management. I’ve encountered this scenario frequently when processing large datasets derived from formatted text files, where each line needs to be parsed into distinct fields and then encapsulated into object representations for further analysis. Effectively handling this demands a methodical approach.

Fundamentally, the process involves iterating through the original array, extracting subsets of elements based on a predetermined delimiter, and then constructing new objects using those extracted values. This assumes that the initial array contains data that logically groups together to form a cohesive entity—think of a line from a CSV file split into comma-separated values. The new array will then store references to these newly created objects, effectively changing the data structure. The key lies in managing the iteration boundaries and making sure each segment corresponds correctly to the required constructor parameters of the target object.

Let’s clarify with an example. Imagine an array of `String`s holding comma-separated data: `{"John,30,Engineer", "Jane,25,Teacher", "Peter,40,Doctor"}`. I need to split each of these strings and store the resulting parts in an array of `Person` objects, where the `Person` class has the structure `Person(String name, int age, String job)`.

The core logic involves: 1) creating the target array based on the size of original array, assuming we have one-to-one correspondence between initial strings and new objects, 2) iterating over initial array, 3) splitting each string using the delimiter, and 4) instantiating a new `Person` object using split parts and storing it in corresponding position in the target array.

Here’s the first code snippet demonstrating the fundamental concept:

```java
public class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    String job;

    public Person(String name, int age, String job) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.job = job;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
      return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Job: " + job;
    }
}

public class ArraySplitter {
   public static Person[] splitAndCreateObjects(String[] inputStrings) {
       Person[] people = new Person[inputStrings.length];

       for (int i = 0; i < inputStrings.length; i++) {
           String[] parts = inputStrings[i].split(",");
           String name = parts[0];
           int age = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
           String job = parts[2];

           people[i] = new Person(name, age, job);
       }
        return people;
   }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] input = {"John,30,Engineer", "Jane,25,Teacher", "Peter,40,Doctor"};
        Person[] result = splitAndCreateObjects(input);
       for(Person person : result){
           System.out.println(person);
       }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `splitAndCreateObjects` method takes a `String[]` as input. It iterates through this array, splits each string by commas using the `split(",")` method, converts the second part to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`, and creates a `Person` object using the resulting parts. These objects are then stored in a newly created `Person[]` which is returned. It is crucial to handle potential `NumberFormatException`s if the input is not always clean. The main method demonstrates the usage, initializes an input, invokes the function and iterates over the result and prints it out.

However, input data might not always be perfect. Sometimes, the split parts might not have the right number of elements or elements might contain leading/trailing spaces. I've faced situations where additional logic was needed to ensure data integrity. Robust implementations need to validate the number of split parts and also trim each element to remove unwanted white spaces. Failure to do so can lead to exceptions or incorrect data representation.

Consider the following updated snippet, demonstrating handling malformed input:

```java
public class ArraySplitter {
    public static Person[] splitAndCreateObjects(String[] inputStrings) {
        Person[] people = new Person[inputStrings.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < inputStrings.length; i++) {
            String[] parts = inputStrings[i].split(",");
           if (parts.length != 3) {
                System.err.println("Skipping malformed input at index " + i + ": " + inputStrings[i]);
                continue; // Skip to next iteration.
           }
            try {
                String name = parts[0].trim();
                int age = Integer.parseInt(parts[1].trim());
                String job = parts[2].trim();

                people[i] = new Person(name, age, job);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                System.err.println("Error parsing age at index " + i + ": " + inputStrings[i] + " " + e.getMessage());
                continue; // Skip to next iteration
            }
        }
        return people;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] input = {"John,30,Engineer", "Jane, 25 ,Teacher", "Peter,40,Doctor", "Invalid Entry", "Tom,35, ", "Mark,notanumber,Writer"};
        Person[] result = splitAndCreateObjects(input);
        for (Person person : result) {
             if(person!=null){
                 System.out.println(person);
             }

        }
    }
}

```

Here, I’ve added a check for the length of the `parts` array. If it's not equal to 3, a message is printed to the error stream, and that iteration of the loop skips to the next entry. Additionally, a `try-catch` block has been added to handle potential `NumberFormatException` when parsing the age. Also, I am now trimming leading and trailing spaces from parts. This ensures that input like `"Jane, 25 ,Teacher"` is handled gracefully. The resulting array might contain `null` elements due to skipped incorrect input. The main method now contains incorrect inputs demonstrating how skipped elements lead to null entries. The output loop includes a null check.

Sometimes, instead of skipping invalid data, you might want to replace it with default values or create a "placeholder" object. This is especially relevant when you need to preserve the size and integrity of the output array. This can be achieved by introducing a placeholder object constructor in the `Person` class.

```java
public class Person {
   String name;
   int age;
   String job;
    
    public Person(String name, int age, String job) {
         this.name = name;
         this.age = age;
         this.job = job;
    }

    public Person(){
        this.name = "N/A";
        this.age = -1;
        this.job = "N/A";
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
       return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Job: " + job;
    }
}

public class ArraySplitter {
     public static Person[] splitAndCreateObjects(String[] inputStrings) {
        Person[] people = new Person[inputStrings.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < inputStrings.length; i++) {
           String[] parts = inputStrings[i].split(",");
           if (parts.length != 3) {
               System.err.println("Replacing malformed input at index " + i + ": " + inputStrings[i]);
               people[i] = new Person(); // placeholder object
               continue;
           }
            try {
                String name = parts[0].trim();
                int age = Integer.parseInt(parts[1].trim());
                String job = parts[2].trim();

                people[i] = new Person(name, age, job);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                System.err.println("Replacing invalid number at index " + i + ": " + inputStrings[i] + " " + e.getMessage());
                people[i] = new Person(); // placeholder object
                continue;
            }
        }
         return people;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
       String[] input = {"John,30,Engineer", "Jane, 25 ,Teacher", "Peter,40,Doctor", "Invalid Entry", "Tom,35, ", "Mark,notanumber,Writer"};
        Person[] result = splitAndCreateObjects(input);
        for (Person person : result) {
           System.out.println(person);
        }
    }
}
```

In this final iteration,  a no-argument constructor in `Person` is added, which provides default values and is invoked when the input string does not conform to the expected pattern or when a `NumberFormatException` is thrown. Now, the resulting array will not contain null values, but rather placeholder objects. This approach has its advantages, particularly when further processing expects a continuous stream of `Person` objects.

For resources, I suggest examining materials focusing on Java Collections, especially those related to array manipulation and parsing strings. Furthermore, understanding exception handling is paramount in these scenarios. Textbooks and tutorials covering core Java programming concepts, data structures, and input/output streams will prove valuable. Exploring the Java documentation for `String` methods, the `Integer` wrapper class, and exception handling mechanisms will also deepen your understanding. Understanding common design principles related to data validation would also prove valuable.
