Identifying the precise indices of mismatched sub-tensors within larger PyTorch tensors is a recurring challenge, particularly when dealing with complex data structures or comparing model outputs against ground truth.  Direct element-wise comparison followed by indexing isn't always sufficient, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional tensors and the need for granular mismatch location identification.  My experience debugging complex neural network training pipelines frequently highlighted the inefficiency of naive approaches.  This requires a more sophisticated strategy that leverages PyTorch's capabilities for efficient tensor manipulation and boolean indexing.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The core problem lies in effectively translating element-wise comparisons into meaningful indices reflecting the sub-tensor level mismatches.  A direct comparison using `==` will yield a boolean tensor indicating element-wise equality. However, this doesn't inherently provide the indices of the *sub-tensors* where discrepancies exist.  Instead, we need to aggregate these element-wise comparisons to identify contiguous regions of mismatch within a defined sub-tensor structure.  This typically involves defining a sub-tensor shape and iterating, or using advanced indexing techniques.

The optimal approach depends heavily on the definition of a "sub-tensor."  Are these fixed-size blocks, sliding windows, or variable-sized segments dictated by another tensor?  The examples below illustrate solutions for different sub-tensor interpretations.  Crucially, the method must minimize redundant computation and efficiently handle potentially large tensors.  Pre-allocation of memory for storing results and vectorization wherever possible are essential for performance optimization, lessons learned through years of optimizing PyTorch code for large-scale datasets.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Mismatch detection in fixed-size sub-tensors**

This example assumes sub-tensors are non-overlapping blocks of a pre-defined size.

```python
import torch

def find_mismatched_subtensors_fixed(tensor1, tensor2, subtensor_shape):
    """Finds indices of mismatched fixed-size sub-tensors.

    Args:
        tensor1: The first tensor.
        tensor2: The second tensor.
        subtensor_shape: A tuple defining the shape of each sub-tensor.

    Returns:
        A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the starting indices of a mismatched sub-tensor.
        Returns an empty list if tensors are equal.  Raises exceptions for shape mismatches.
    """

    if tensor1.shape != tensor2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Tensors must have the same shape.")

    if any(dim % sub_dim != 0 for dim, sub_dim in zip(tensor1.shape, subtensor_shape)):
        raise ValueError("Tensor dimensions must be divisible by sub-tensor dimensions.")

    mismatches = []
    for i in range(0, tensor1.shape[0], subtensor_shape[0]):
        for j in range(0, tensor1.shape[1], subtensor_shape[1]):
            #Efficiently compare sub-tensors using allclose for floating-point tolerance
            if not torch.allclose(tensor1[i:i+subtensor_shape[0], j:j+subtensor_shape[1]],
                                  tensor2[i:i+subtensor_shape[0], j:j+subtensor_shape[1]]):
                mismatches.append((i,j))

    return mismatches

# Example usage:
tensor_a = torch.randint(0, 10, (6, 6))
tensor_b = torch.clone(tensor_a)
tensor_b[1:3, 1:3] = torch.randint(0, 10, (2, 2))

mismatch_indices = find_mismatched_subtensors_fixed(tensor_a, tensor_b, (2,2))
print(f"Mismatched sub-tensor indices: {mismatch_indices}")

```

This function efficiently iterates through the tensor, comparing sub-tensors using `torch.allclose` to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies.  Error handling ensures input validity.  The use of slicing enables direct sub-tensor comparison without unnecessary data copying.


**Example 2:  Mismatch detection using sliding windows**

This approach utilizes sliding windows to identify mismatches, allowing for overlapping sub-tensors.

```python
import torch

def find_mismatched_subtensors_sliding(tensor1, tensor2, window_shape):
    """Finds indices of mismatched sub-tensors using a sliding window.

    Args:
      tensor1: The first tensor.
      tensor2: The second tensor.
      window_shape: A tuple defining the shape of the sliding window.

    Returns:
      A list of tuples, each tuple containing the starting indices of a mismatched sub-tensor.  Returns an empty list if the tensors are identical.
    """

    if tensor1.shape != tensor2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input tensors must have the same shape.")

    mismatches = []
    for i in range(tensor1.shape[0] - window_shape[0] + 1):
        for j in range(tensor1.shape[1] - window_shape[1] + 1):
            if not torch.allclose(tensor1[i:i+window_shape[0], j:j+window_shape[1]],
                                  tensor2[i:i+window_shape[0], j:j+window_shape[1]]):
                mismatches.append((i, j))
    return mismatches

#Example Usage
tensor_c = torch.randint(0,5,(5,5))
tensor_d = torch.clone(tensor_c)
tensor_d[2,2] = 10

mismatch_indices_sliding = find_mismatched_subtensors_sliding(tensor_c, tensor_d,(3,3))
print(f"Mismatched sub-tensor indices (sliding window): {mismatch_indices_sliding}")
```

This function efficiently iterates using a sliding window, making it suitable for identifying localized discrepancies even if not perfectly aligned with a fixed sub-tensor grid.


**Example 3:  Mismatch detection guided by a mask tensor**

This example uses a separate mask tensor to define the sub-tensors to be compared.

```python
import torch

def find_mismatched_subtensors_masked(tensor1, tensor2, mask):
    """Finds indices of mismatched sub-tensors based on a mask.

    Args:
        tensor1: The first tensor.
        tensor2: The second tensor.
        mask: A boolean tensor of the same shape indicating sub-tensors to compare.  True indicates a sub-tensor to be considered.

    Returns:
        A list of tuples representing the starting indices (row,column) of mismatched sub-tensors as identified by the mask. Returns an empty list if no mismatches are found or if the tensors are equal. Raises exceptions for shape mismatches.
    """

    if tensor1.shape != tensor2.shape or tensor1.shape != mask.shape:
        raise ValueError("Tensors and mask must have the same shape.")

    mismatches = []
    for i in range(tensor1.shape[0]):
        for j in range(tensor1.shape[1]):
            if mask[i,j] and not torch.allclose(tensor1[i,j],tensor2[i,j]):
                mismatches.append((i,j))
    return mismatches

#Example Usage
tensor_e = torch.randint(0,10,(4,4))
tensor_f = torch.clone(tensor_e)
tensor_f[1,1] = 100
mask = torch.zeros((4,4),dtype=torch.bool)
mask[0:2,0:2] = True


mismatches_masked = find_mismatched_subtensors_masked(tensor_e, tensor_f, mask)
print(f"Mismatched sub-tensor indices (masked): {mismatches_masked}")
```

This method offers flexibility, allowing for comparisons of arbitrarily shaped and positioned sub-tensors defined by the mask. This approach becomes crucial when dealing with irregular or dynamically defined regions of interest within the tensors.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding of PyTorch tensor manipulation and advanced indexing, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation and exploring resources focused on NumPy array manipulation, as many concepts directly translate to PyTorch.  A strong grasp of boolean indexing and vectorized operations is particularly beneficial for optimizing performance.  Exploring examples of image processing and segmentation tasks, which often necessitate sub-region comparisons, would also be valuable.  Finally, studying techniques for efficient memory management in Python, especially when dealing with large tensors, is crucial for avoiding bottlenecks during computation.
