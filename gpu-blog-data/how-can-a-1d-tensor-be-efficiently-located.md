The core challenge in efficiently locating a 1D tensor within a 2D tensor lies in recognizing the problem as a pattern-matching task, not simply a linear search.  Direct comparisons across the entire 2D tensor are computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.  My experience optimizing image processing algorithms has highlighted the importance of leveraging optimized array operations and understanding memory layout for substantial performance gains.  Therefore, the optimal approach depends critically on the data characteristics and the desired level of accuracy.


**1. Explanation: Algorithm Selection Based on Data Characteristics**

Several algorithms can address this problem, each with its own trade-offs regarding computational complexity and memory usage.  The choice depends primarily on two factors:  the nature of the 1D tensor (e.g., is it a sequence of unique values, or does it contain repeated elements?) and the expected frequency of occurrences within the 2D tensor.

For scenarios involving relatively small 1D tensors and infrequent occurrences within the 2D tensor, a brute-force approach using nested loops and direct comparison may suffice. However, this method has O(m*n*k) time complexity, where 'm' and 'n' are the dimensions of the 2D tensor and 'k' is the length of the 1D tensor. This quickly becomes intractable for large datasets.

More efficient solutions involve leveraging convolution operations or optimized search algorithms.  Convolutional approaches, as implemented in libraries like NumPy, allow for fast pattern matching by sliding the 1D tensor across the 2D tensor and calculating the cross-correlation. This reduces the complexity significantly, often to O(m*n), making it suitable for moderately sized datasets.


For situations with high frequency of the 1D tensor within the 2D tensor, employing more advanced techniques like suffix trees or hashing might be beneficial, though these come with increased upfront computational cost for index construction.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the implementation of three different approaches using Python and NumPy.  Note that these examples assume the 1D and 2D tensors are NumPy arrays.

**Example 1: Brute-force Approach**

This approach directly compares the 1D tensor with all possible sub-arrays of the 2D tensor.  It is simple but inefficient for large datasets.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_1d_in_2d_bruteforce(tensor_2d, tensor_1d):
    m, n = tensor_2d.shape
    k = len(tensor_1d)
    indices = []
    for i in range(m - k + 1):
        for j in range(n - k + 1):
            if np.array_equal(tensor_2d[i:i+k, j], tensor_1d):
                indices.append((i, j))
    return indices

#Example Usage
tensor_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]])
tensor_1d = np.array([6, 7, 8])
indices = find_1d_in_2d_bruteforce(tensor_2d, tensor_1d)
print(f"Indices: {indices}") # Output: Indices: [(1, 1)]

```


**Example 2: Convolutional Approach using NumPy**

This method utilizes `np.convolve` for efficient pattern matching. It's significantly faster than the brute-force method, especially for larger tensors.  However, it only detects exact matches. Variations exist for handling partial matches or incorporating tolerance levels.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_1d_in_2d_convolution(tensor_2d, tensor_1d):
    k = len(tensor_1d)
    indices = []
    for i in range(tensor_2d.shape[0]):
        row_conv = np.convolve(tensor_2d[i,:], tensor_1d[::-1], 'valid')
        matches = np.where(row_conv == np.sum(tensor_1d**2))[0]
        for match in matches:
            indices.append((i, match))
    return indices


#Example Usage
tensor_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]])
tensor_1d = np.array([6, 7, 8])
indices = find_1d_in_2d_convolution(tensor_2d, tensor_1d)
print(f"Indices: {indices}") # Output: Indices: [(1, 0)]
```


**Example 3: Optimized Search with Pre-processing (Illustrative)**

This example sketches a more sophisticated approach,  suitable when the 1D tensor is searched repeatedly within different 2D tensors. The pre-processing step creates a hash table mapping sub-arrays to their locations, significantly speeding up subsequent searches. This example simplifies the hashing aspect for brevity.


```python
import numpy as np

def create_subarray_index(tensor_2d, k):
    index = {}
    m, n = tensor_2d.shape
    for i in range(m - k + 1):
        for j in range(n - k + 1):
            sub_array = tuple(tensor_2d[i:i+k, j].flatten())
            if sub_array not in index:
                index[sub_array] = [(i,j)]
            else:
                index[sub_array].append((i,j))
    return index

def find_1d_in_2d_indexed(index, tensor_1d):
    sub_array_tuple = tuple(tensor_1d.flatten())
    return index.get(sub_array_tuple, [])


#Example usage
tensor_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4], [13, 14, 15, 16]])
tensor_1d = np.array([6, 7, 8])
k=3
index = create_subarray_index(tensor_2d, k)
indices = find_1d_in_2d_indexed(index, tensor_1d)
print(f"Indices: {indices}") #Output: Indices: [(1, 1)]

```

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of array operations and efficient algorithms, I recommend studying the documentation for NumPy and SciPy.  Exploring texts on algorithm design and analysis, with a focus on pattern matching and string algorithms, will provide further context.  Furthermore, specialized literature on image processing and computer vision frequently addresses similar problems, offering alternative methodologies and optimizations.  Finally, delving into the performance characteristics of different array data structures (like sparse matrices) can be highly beneficial for very large datasets with sparse occurrences of the 1D tensor.
