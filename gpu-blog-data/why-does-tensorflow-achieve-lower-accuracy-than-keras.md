TensorFlow's lower accuracy compared to Keras in direct comparisons is rarely an inherent property of the frameworks themselves, but rather a consequence of differing default configurations, model architectures, and training methodologies frequently employed within each ecosystem.  My experience over the past five years working on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects has consistently shown this to be the case.  The apparent performance discrepancy stems from subtle, often overlooked, implementation details rather than a fundamental superiority of Keras.

**1.  Explanation of the Discrepancy:**

Keras, while being a high-level API that runs *on top of* TensorFlow (or other backends), provides a streamlined, opinionated workflow.  This frequently leads to users inadvertently adopting best practices embedded within Keras's defaults that are not as readily apparent or consistently applied when working directly with TensorFlow.  These practices influence several critical aspects of model training:

* **Optimizer Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Keras defaults to optimizers like Adam, often with sensible default hyperparameters.  While Adam is a robust choice,  manually configuring optimizers within TensorFlow, particularly without meticulous hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, weight decay, etc.), can easily lead to suboptimal performance.  Improper optimization can hinder convergence, resulting in lower accuracy.

* **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:** Keras offers convenient data preprocessing and augmentation utilities integrated within its `ImageDataGenerator` and similar tools.  These functionalities, often overlooked when working directly with TensorFlow's lower-level APIs, significantly impact model robustness and generalization.  Inconsistent or inadequate data preprocessing – such as improper scaling or a lack of augmentation – readily leads to inferior results.

* **Regularization Techniques:** Keras's functional and sequential APIs encourage the inclusion of regularization layers (dropout, L1/L2 regularization) through straightforward methods.  Implementing these in bare TensorFlow requires more manual coding and is prone to errors, potentially leading to overfitting and subsequently reduced generalization performance.

* **Early Stopping:** Keras's `ModelCheckpoint` and `EarlyStopping` callbacks effectively prevent overfitting by monitoring validation performance and halting training prematurely.  Manually implementing these features in TensorFlow demands extra effort and precision, and their omission directly impacts model accuracy.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate these points, comparing equivalent models trained using Keras and bare TensorFlow.  Note that these are simplified examples for illustrative purposes; real-world applications demand considerably more sophisticated architectures and preprocessing steps.

**Example 1: Simple CNN using Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255
x_train = x_train[..., tf.newaxis]
x_test = x_test[..., tf.newaxis]

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

This Keras example leverages built-in functionalities for model construction, compilation, and training.  The Adam optimizer, a common best practice, is implicitly used.


**Example 2: Equivalent CNN using TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
metrics = ['accuracy']

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255
x_train = x_train[..., tf.newaxis]
x_test = x_test[..., tf.newaxis]

for epoch in range(10):
    for x, y in tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(32):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(x)
            loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

This TensorFlow example achieves the same functionality but requires explicit definition of the optimizer, loss function, and training loop.  The potential for errors in hyperparameter selection and training loop implementation is significantly increased.

**Example 3: Illustrating Data Augmentation in Keras**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=40,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

datagen.fit(x_train)

model.fit(datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32), epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

This demonstrates the ease with which data augmentation is integrated into the Keras workflow, improving model generalization without significant coding overhead. Replicating this level of augmentation in pure TensorFlow would require manual image manipulation and batch processing.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult the official TensorFlow and Keras documentation.  Explore resources focusing on practical deep learning and hyperparameter optimization techniques.  Furthermore, studying advanced topics like transfer learning and regularization strategies will greatly enhance your ability to build high-performing models regardless of the framework used.  Consider reviewing research papers on best practices for various deep learning architectures.


In conclusion, attributing lower accuracy solely to TensorFlow is inaccurate.  The observed differences often stem from the simplified, opinionated, and often best-practice-encouraging nature of Keras, which facilitates effective model building and training, leading to superior results compared to less structured TensorFlow implementations, particularly for those less experienced with the intricacies of deep learning optimization.  Careful attention to model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, regularization, and training procedures is crucial for achieving optimal accuracy regardless of the chosen framework.
