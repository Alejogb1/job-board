The `AttributeError: set_model` encountered within Keras callbacks stems from an incompatibility between the callback's expected Keras API version and the actual version used in the model's training process.  This typically manifests when utilizing custom callbacks designed for older Keras versions (pre-TensorFlow 2.x integration) within a more recent TensorFlow/Keras environment.  My experience troubleshooting this error across numerous projects, particularly during the transition from Keras 2.x to the TensorFlow 2.x integrated Keras, underscores the criticality of aligning callback design with the Keras API version.

The core issue is that the `set_model` method, once a standard part of the Keras callback API for configuring the callback with the underlying model, was deprecated and subsequently removed. Modern Keras callbacks achieve model integration through alternative mechanisms.  Correctly handling this necessitates adapting the callback to leverage the new API's methods for accessing model information and states during training.  Failure to adapt results in the `AttributeError`, as the callback attempts to call a non-existent method.

Let's examine the correct implementation strategies.  The most straightforward solution involves replacing `set_model` with the methods available within the `on_train_begin`, `on_epoch_begin`, `on_epoch_end`, `on_train_end`, etc.  These methods, part of the standard callback interface, offer access to the model instance (`self.model`) and other relevant training data.  The specific method used depends on when the callback needs to access the model. For instance, model weights can be accessed within `on_epoch_end`.


**Code Example 1: Adapting a Legacy Callback**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class LegacyCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LegacyCallback, self).__init__()
        self.model_weights = None # Variable to store model weights

    # Replacing set_model functionality
    def on_train_begin(self, logs=None):
        print("Training begins. Accessing model structure.")
        print(self.model.summary()) # Access model using self.model


    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        self.model_weights = self.model.get_weights() # Access and store weights
        print(f"Epoch {epoch} ended. Model weights saved.")

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

callback = LegacyCallback()
model.fit(x=tf.random.normal((100, 10)), y=tf.random.normal((100, 10)), epochs=5, callbacks=[callback])
```

This example demonstrates a proper adaptation of a hypothetical legacy callback.  Instead of using a deprecated `set_model` method, the `on_train_begin` method is utilized to access the model, allowing for operations like printing the summary.  `on_epoch_end` demonstrates access to model weights, showcasing the appropriate method for accessing model state during training.


**Code Example 2:  A New Callback from Scratch**

This example shows a new callback built for the current Keras API.  Notice the lack of `set_model` and the use of the standard callback methods.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class CustomAccuracyCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_train_begin(self, logs=None):
        self.accuracies = []

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        predictions = self.model.predict(self.validation_data[0])
        accuracy = np.mean(np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) == np.argmax(self.validation_data[1], axis=1))
        self.accuracies.append(accuracy)
        print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1} Validation Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)

callback = CustomAccuracyCallback()
model.fit(x_train[:1000], y_train[:1000], epochs=3, validation_data=(x_test[:100], y_test[:100]), callbacks=[callback])

```

This demonstrates a custom callback that calculates validation accuracy after each epoch without relying on the deprecated `set_model`.  This is considered best practice for modern Keras development.  Note the explicit use of `self.validation_data` which is populated during the `model.fit` call.


**Code Example 3: Handling Model Access within `on_predict`**

Callbacks can also extend beyond training.  This example illustrates model access during prediction.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class PredictionCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_predict_begin(self, logs=None):
        print("Prediction begins.  Accessing model for prediction phase.")

    def on_predict_end(self, logs=None):
        print("Prediction finished.  Model accessed successfully.")

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

callback = PredictionCallback()
predictions = model.predict(tf.random.normal((10, 10)), callbacks=[callback])
```

This example showcases access to the model within the prediction phase using `on_predict_begin` and `on_predict_end`. This pattern emphasizes that the `self.model` attribute is consistently available within the standard callback methods, replacing the need for `set_model`.


**Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections detailing Keras callbacks and model training, provides comprehensive guidance.  Furthermore, review materials covering the evolution of the Keras API across different TensorFlow versions will be highly beneficial in understanding the changes affecting callback implementation.  Finally, exploring example callback implementations within the Keras source code itself can provide valuable insights into best practices.  Thoroughly understanding the callback lifecycle and the various methods available at each stage is crucial for resolving similar issues encountered during custom callback development.
