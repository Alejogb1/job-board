The behavior of TensorFlow regarding GPU memory allocation, even when `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(True)` is enabled, often deviates from user expectations due to a complex interplay of factors beyond a simple boolean switch. The underlying issue frequently stems from how TensorFlow's memory management interacts with the CUDA driver and the specific demands of model execution, rather than a straightforward bug in the `allow_growth` flag itself.

The primary function of `allow_growth` is to prevent TensorFlow from seizing all available GPU memory upfront. When set to `False` (the default), TensorFlow will aggressively allocate almost all the available memory, even if it doesn't immediately require it. This initial allocation is intended to avoid fragmentation and potential performance slowdowns during model training. However, `allow_growth = True` tells TensorFlow to allocate memory only when needed and to incrementally grow the allocated space as the model's demands increase.

However, this "growth" is not limitless nor is it a guarantee of perfectly frugal memory usage. Several factors can contribute to a situation where TensorFlow seems to allocate more memory than expected, despite the `allow_growth` setting. One critical aspect is the fragmentation of memory. CUDA memory allocation is a complex process, and after multiple allocation and deallocation events, memory might become fragmented, leading to situations where TensorFlow must allocate larger blocks than seemingly necessary to satisfy a request. This happens because free blocks are not contiguous and the contiguous block needed is too large, resulting in a larger contiguous allocation to guarantee the availability. The growth is not per tensor or individual operation but in large contiguous allocations as needed.

Furthermore, TensorFlow employs a caching mechanism for frequently used kernel operations. Even with `allow_growth = True`, TensorFlow might pre-allocate memory to cache these commonly utilized kernels on the GPU, improving efficiency by avoiding frequent data transfers from host to device. This cached memory consumption can appear as excessive allocation to the user, although it improves overall performance.

Another relevant factor includes the granularity of memory allocation requests. TensorFlow requests memory from CUDA in chunks. While `allow_growth` controls *when* allocations happen, the size of each incremental allocation is determined internally based on a variety of factors, not always directly transparent to the user. These allocated chunks, even if not completely used immediately, still occupy GPU memory. This is more evident when dealing with large tensors. In my experience, model training involving large embedding layers can frequently demonstrate this behavior, where the initial growth seems smaller but increases rapidly after first use of the embedding.

Lastly, and often a source of confusion, is that TensorFlow may reserve memory even if tensors are not actively used in the current computational graph. Although technically not being used, the memory is marked as allocated to a tensor in the overall memory map of the GPU allocated by tensorflow. While this memory may appear unused, TensorFlow will not release that chunk. This is part of how Tensorflow plans itâ€™s execution, such as deciding if a tensor requires a particular memory location.

To better illustrate, let's examine the behavior through some code examples.

**Example 1: Initial Minimal Allocation with Tensor Creation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Ensure that TF is using the GPU you expect to use
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    # Restrict TensorFlow to only use one GPU
    try:
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Visible devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

print(f"Num GPUs Available: {len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))}")

# Create a relatively small tensor
x = tf.random.normal((100, 100))

# Print a message. The memory allocation would have happened in above creation.
print("Tensor Created")
```

In this example, the focus is on the initial memory footprint. With `allow_growth = True`, the memory allocated should be minimal to store the `x` tensor and some overhead from TensorFlow and CUDA driver. In an environment with proper monitoring tools, such as `nvidia-smi`, one would observe that the GPU memory usage is considerably low after this code. Even before the tensor is computed, the device memory must be acquired to house its values. The caching would also increase the memory footprint. This provides a baseline for subsequent examples.

**Example 2: Allocation Growth with Computation and Gradient Tape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Ensure that TF is using the GPU you expect to use
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    # Restrict TensorFlow to only use one GPU
    try:
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Visible devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

print(f"Num GPUs Available: {len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))}")

# Create a small tensor for computation
x = tf.random.normal((100, 100), dtype=tf.float32)
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((100,100), dtype=tf.float32))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((100,),dtype=tf.float32))

def loss_func(x,y):
    return tf.reduce_sum((x - y)**2)

# Simulate training with gradient tape, which allocates memory
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = tf.matmul(x,W) + b
    loss = loss_func(y,x)
grads = tape.gradient(loss, [W,b])


# Print message, memory will grow after this.
print("Computation complete. Memory grown.")
```

In this second example, the memory allocation is expected to increase beyond the space occupied by the original tensors. The gradient tape requires additional memory to store intermediate activations and gradients. During the backward pass, additional memory is needed to compute gradients. This example illustrates how a seemingly small operation like gradient computation can lead to a considerable expansion in GPU memory usage and the allocation of memory required by TensorFlow. The allocation might not be just the sum of all tensors.

**Example 3: Cached Kernel and Potential Fragmentation Impact**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Ensure that TF is using the GPU you expect to use
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    # Restrict TensorFlow to only use one GPU
    try:
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Visible devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

print(f"Num GPUs Available: {len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))}")

# Create two tensors for multiple computations
x1 = tf.random.normal((100, 100), dtype=tf.float32)
x2 = tf.random.normal((100,100), dtype=tf.float32)


def multiply(x):
    return tf.matmul(x,x)


# Do some computation, which caches the multiplication kernel
_ = multiply(x1)
_ = multiply(x2)

# Deallocate tensors
del x1
del x2
# Do computation again. Tensorflow reuses the cached kernel
x3 = tf.random.normal((100,100), dtype=tf.float32)
_ = multiply(x3)


print("Computation with cached kernels done. Memory might be more than what you expect")
```

This final example introduces the effect of kernel caching. After the first use of `multiply()`, TensorFlow might cache the operation to avoid the cost of re-compilation for subsequent uses. While the code deallocates the initial tensors (`x1`, `x2`), the cached kernel remains in memory. In many cases, the memory used might be more than just for x3, even if x1 and x2 do not exist. This example also highlights that even when tensors are explicitly deallocated in Python, the GPU memory used is not directly relinquished by TensorFlow. This can result in memory appearing as 'allocated' despite its explicit deletion in the program, further confusing users and making resource management difficult. This is particularly visible with larger models.

To effectively manage GPU memory with TensorFlow and `allow_growth = True`, one should prioritize several strategies. First, it's imperative to profile memory usage with tools such as `nvidia-smi` or TensorFlow profiler to understand the specific memory bottlenecks in your model. Additionally, consider batch sizes carefully; smaller batches often reduce overall GPU memory demands. Optimizing tensor shapes and data types can minimize memory footprint; using `float16` or `int8` where appropriate is an example. Finally, avoid unnecessary tensor copies and utilize TensorFlow's optimized operations.

Further resources for investigation include the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on memory management and GPU utilization, online forums dedicated to TensorFlow and deep learning, and literature regarding the CUDA memory management and resource usage. Combining these resources with diligent profiling and code review enables one to address issues with the perceived excessive memory usage despite the intended behavior of `allow_growth`.
