Saving a TensorFlow tensor as an image without eager execution necessitates a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model and the necessary data transformations.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines for medical imaging highlighted the importance of this distinction, especially when dealing with resource-constrained environments where eager execution's overhead is undesirable.  The crucial aspect lies in utilizing `tf.io.write_file` within a TensorFlow graph context, avoiding direct interactions with NumPy arrays which are inherently tied to eager execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's graph execution model constructs a computational graph before execution.  This graph defines the operations and their dependencies.  Saving a tensor as an image requires converting the tensor data into a suitable image format (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and writing it to a file.  However, directly using NumPy's `imageio` or similar libraries inside a TensorFlow graph is incompatible with graph mode.  Instead, we leverage TensorFlow's own file writing operations within the graph definition.  This ensures compatibility and allows for optimization across the entire computation graph.  The process broadly involves:

a. **Tensor Transformation:** Ensure the tensor representing the image data has the correct shape and data type (typically `uint8` for image formats like PNG).  This might involve rescaling, type casting, and potentially channel rearrangement depending on the tensor's origin.

b. **Encoding:** Use TensorFlow operations to encode the tensor data into the chosen image format. While TensorFlow doesn't directly offer encoding functions for all formats, PNG encoding can be handled efficiently through `tf.io.encode_png`.  For JPEG, one would typically need a custom op or a workaround involving saving as PNG and then converting externally.

c. **File Writing:** Utilize `tf.io.write_file` to write the encoded image data to a file.  This operation is graph-compatible and handles the file I/O within the graph's execution context.  The filename should be specified as a TensorFlow string tensor, allowing for dynamic filename generation within the graph.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Saving a grayscale image (PNG):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def save_grayscale_image(tensor, filename):
    """Saves a grayscale tensor as a PNG image.

    Args:
        tensor: A 2D TensorFlow tensor representing the grayscale image.  
               Should be of type tf.uint8.
        filename: A TensorFlow string tensor specifying the output filename.
    """
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        png_image = tf.io.encode_png(tensor)
        write_op = tf.io.write_file(filename, png_image)
        sess.run(write_op, feed_dict={tensor: tf.constant([[100, 150],[200, 255]], dtype=tf.uint8), filename: tf.constant("grayscale_image.png")})

#Example usage
grayscale_tensor = tf.constant([[100, 150],[200, 255]], dtype=tf.uint8)
filename_tensor = tf.constant("grayscale_image.png")
save_grayscale_image(grayscale_tensor, filename_tensor)

```

This example demonstrates saving a simple 2x2 grayscale image. The `tf.io.encode_png` function directly handles the PNG encoding, and `tf.io.write_file` writes the result to disk. The use of `tf.compat.v1.Session` is crucial for graph execution.  Note the explicit type specification (`tf.uint8`) for the tensor.


**Example 2: Saving a color image (PNG):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def save_color_image(tensor, filename):
    """Saves a color tensor as a PNG image.

    Args:
        tensor: A 3D TensorFlow tensor representing the color image (H, W, C).
               Should be of type tf.uint8.  C should be 3 for RGB.
        filename: A TensorFlow string tensor specifying the output filename.
    """
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        png_image = tf.io.encode_png(tensor)
        write_op = tf.io.write_file(filename, png_image)
        sess.run(write_op, feed_dict={tensor: tf.constant([[[255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0]], [[0, 0, 255], [255, 255, 255]]], dtype=tf.uint8), filename: tf.constant("color_image.png")})


#Example Usage
color_tensor = tf.constant([[[255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0]], [[0, 0, 255], [255, 255, 255]]], dtype=tf.uint8)
filename_tensor = tf.constant("color_image.png")
save_color_image(color_tensor, filename_tensor)

```

This extends the previous example to handle color images. The tensor now has three dimensions (height, width, channels), and the data represents RGB pixel values.  Again, `tf.uint8` is essential for image data.


**Example 3: Handling variable-sized tensors:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def save_image_variable_size(tensor, filename, shape):
  """Saves an image tensor of variable size as a PNG image.

  Args:
      tensor: A TensorFlow tensor representing the image.  Should be of type tf.uint8.
      filename: A TensorFlow string tensor specifying the output filename.
      shape:  A tf.Tensor representing the intended shape of the image (height, width, channels)
  """
  with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, shape)
      png_image = tf.io.encode_png(tf.cast(reshaped_tensor, tf.uint8))  #Explicit type casting
      write_op = tf.io.write_file(filename, png_image)
      sess.run(write_op, feed_dict={tensor: tf.random.uniform([12,12,3], minval=0, maxval=255, dtype=tf.int32), filename: tf.constant("variable_image.png"), shape: tf.constant([12,12,3])})

# Example Usage:
variable_tensor = tf.random.uniform([12*12*3], minval=0, maxval=255, dtype=tf.int32)
filename_tensor = tf.constant("variable_image.png")
shape_tensor = tf.constant([12,12,3])
save_image_variable_size(variable_tensor, filename_tensor, shape_tensor)

```

This example showcases the flexibility to handle tensors of varying sizes, a common requirement in many applications.  The tensor is reshaped using `tf.reshape` before encoding and writing.  Explicit type casting to `tf.uint8` is included for robustness.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on graph execution and file I/O operations, provide essential information.  A comprehensive textbook on TensorFlow's internals and lower-level APIs will further solidify understanding.  Finally, reviewing relevant Stack Overflow threads focusing on graph mode operations in TensorFlow will be invaluable for troubleshooting specific issues.
