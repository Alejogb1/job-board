Directly manipulating tensor indices in PyTorch requires careful consideration of tensor properties, particularly data type and the distinction between in-place operations and tensor creation.  My experience working on large-scale neural network training pipelines has highlighted the importance of efficient index manipulation for optimal performance.  Incorrect handling can lead to unexpected behavior or performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with tensors residing on GPU memory.

**1. Clear Explanation**

PyTorch tensors, unlike standard Python lists, are generally not mutable in the same way. While you can modify elements *in-place* under certain conditions, attempting direct assignment using bracket notation like `tensor[index] = value` may not always work as expected, especially for tensors with specific data types or requiring gradient tracking.  The most robust approach is to leverage PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities, combined with the `torch.scatter` function for efficient in-place updates when applicable, or creating new tensors via slicing and concatenation when in-place modification is undesirable or not supported.

The choice between in-place modification and tensor creation hinges on several factors:  whether gradient tracking is active (using `requires_grad=True`), the type of tensor (e.g., CUDA tensors), and the desired level of code clarity versus performance optimization.  In-place operations, while potentially faster, can sometimes make debugging more difficult and may have subtle limitations related to automatic differentiation.  Creating a new tensor often increases memory consumption but simplifies debugging and ensures predictable behavior across different scenarios.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `torch.scatter` for in-place modification**

This method provides an efficient way to update multiple indices simultaneously. It's particularly useful when dealing with sparse updates or when performance is critical.  I've extensively utilized this approach in my work optimizing reinforcement learning algorithms, achieving significant speedups in the training process.

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.zeros(5, dtype=torch.float32)
indices = torch.tensor([1, 3])
values = torch.tensor([2.5, 7.1])

torch.scatter_(tensor, 0, indices, values)  # In-place modification using underscore suffix

print(tensor)  # Output: tensor([0.0000, 2.5000, 0.0000, 7.1000, 0.0000])
```

The `_` suffix in `torch.scatter_` indicates an in-place operation. The first argument specifies the tensor to modify, the second argument defines the dimension along which to scatter (0 for rows in this case), the third specifies the indices, and the fourth provides the values to insert.  This approach avoids explicit looping, making it considerably faster than iterative methods for large tensors.


**Example 2:  Creating a new tensor using slicing and concatenation**

This approach is more straightforward and less error-prone, especially for beginners. It's also preferable when gradient tracking is crucial and in-place modification could interfere with automatic differentiation.  I've found this technique exceptionally useful when working with complex tensor manipulations where maintaining a clear lineage of operations is essential.


```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=True)
index = 2
value = 10.0

new_tensor = torch.cat((tensor[:index], torch.tensor([value]), tensor[index+1:]))

print(new_tensor)  # Output: tensor([ 1.,  2., 10.,  4.,  5.])
print(tensor.grad) # Output will be None as creating a new tensor doesn't affect the original


```

This code creates a new tensor by slicing the original tensor before and after the target index and concatenating these slices with a new tensor containing the desired value. This method clearly separates the original tensor from the modified one.


**Example 3: Handling multi-dimensional tensors**

Manipulating indices in multi-dimensional tensors necessitates a more nuanced understanding of indexing conventions.  The following example demonstrates how to insert a value into a specific location within a 2D tensor using advanced indexing.  In my research involving convolutional neural networks, I often employed similar techniques for targeted modifications to feature maps.

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4).float()
row_index = 1
col_index = 2
value = 99.0

tensor[row_index, col_index] = value  # Direct assignment, works in this specific case

print(tensor)
#Output:
#tensor([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.],
#        [ 4.,  5., 99.,  7.],
#        [ 8.,  9., 10., 11.]])

```

Here, direct assignment using bracket notation is valid because we're modifying a single element and no gradient tracking is active. For more complex scenarios involving multiple indices or tensors with `requires_grad=True`, the `torch.scatter_` approach or tensor creation remains the recommended strategy.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official PyTorch documentation.  A thorough understanding of tensor operations and advanced indexing is vital.  The PyTorch tutorials, particularly those focusing on tensor manipulation and automatic differentiation, provide valuable practical examples.  Finally,  exploring documentation related to sparse tensor operations can be beneficial for optimizing specific use cases.  Studying examples from published research papers that use PyTorch extensively can also provide insights into effective techniques.
