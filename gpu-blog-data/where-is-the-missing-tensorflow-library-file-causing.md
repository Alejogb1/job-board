The most common cause of `ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow'` isn't a truly *missing* TensorFlow library file in the traditional sense of a file physically absent from the filesystem. Instead, the issue stems from the Python interpreter's inability to locate the installed TensorFlow package within its search path.  This is a frequent problem I've encountered over the years developing and deploying machine learning models, often manifesting in seemingly inexplicable ways.  The solution involves verifying the installation, confirming Python environment consistency, and correctly configuring the environment variables.

**1. Explanation:**

The Python interpreter searches for modules in a specific order, defined by the `sys.path` variable.  This variable is a list of directories where Python looks for modules. When you use `import tensorflow`, Python searches each directory in `sys.path` for a directory named `tensorflow` containing an `__init__.py` file, indicating a package. If this is not found, the `ImportError` is raised.

Several factors can lead to this:

* **Incorrect Installation:** TensorFlow might not be installed in the Python environment you're currently using.  This is particularly relevant when multiple Python versions or virtual environments coexist.  A simple `pip install tensorflow` in the wrong environment won't resolve the issue.

* **Environment Variable Issues:** The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, while not strictly required, can significantly influence the module search path.  If `PYTHONPATH` is set to point to a directory that doesn't contain TensorFlow, it can override the standard search locations. Conversely, an improperly configured or missing `PYTHONPATH` might inadvertently exclude the correct directory.

* **Virtual Environment Problems:** When using virtual environments (venv, conda), it's crucial to activate the correct environment before attempting to import TensorFlow.  Failing to do so will cause the interpreter to search in the wrong location.

* **Conflicting Installations:** Multiple TensorFlow versions could be installed, potentially creating conflicts. Using a package manager like `pip` with the `--upgrade` flag can sometimes inadvertently cause these conflicts.  Careful package management is essential.

* **System-Level Installation Issues:** In some rare cases, system-level Python installations might lack the necessary permissions or encounter issues during the installation process, leaving TensorFlow partially or incorrectly installed. This is less common with modern package managers.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying Installation and Environment:**

```python
import sys
import tensorflow as tf

print("Python version:", sys.version)
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("Python path:", sys.path)

try:
    # Test TensorFlow functionality. A simple calculation is sufficient.
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
    b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print("Matrix multiplication result:\n", c)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"AttributeError: {e}")


```

This code snippet checks the Python version, TensorFlow version (if installed), and the `sys.path`.  The `try-except` block attempts a simple TensorFlow operation to verify functionality.  The output will pinpoint the problem â€“ either a version mismatch, an import error, or successful execution.  Carefully examine the `sys.path` output; the TensorFlow installation directory should be present.


**Example 2: Using a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'myenv' with your desired name)
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source myenv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install TensorFlow within the activated environment
pip install tensorflow

# Run your Python script (after activation)
python your_script.py
```

This example explicitly demonstrates using a virtual environment to isolate the TensorFlow installation.  This method is strongly recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-level Python installations.  Activating the environment is absolutely essential; omitting this step is a frequent source of errors.


**Example 3: Checking and Setting PYTHONPATH (Use with caution):**

```bash
# Check the current PYTHONPATH (Linux/macOS/Windows)
echo $PYTHONPATH

# Set PYTHONPATH (Linux/macOS; replace '/path/to/tensorflow' with the actual path)
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/tensorflow:$PYTHONPATH"

# Set PYTHONPATH (Windows)
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\path\to\tensorflow

# Run your Python script after setting PYTHONPATH
python your_script.py
```

This demonstrates how to check and set the `PYTHONPATH`.  **However, modifying `PYTHONPATH` is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary and you understand its implications.** Incorrectly setting `PYTHONPATH` can lead to more problems. This method should be a last resort after exhausting other options.  Always prioritize virtual environments.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive installation guides and troubleshooting advice. Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions specific to your operating system and Python version.  Consult your Python distribution's documentation for information on managing virtual environments and package installations.  Exploring relevant Stack Overflow discussions and community forums (with careful consideration of potential outdated information) can help you find solutions to specific issues that might not be explicitly addressed in the official documentation.  Remember to always verify the credibility and relevance of any external resources.
