The reduction in channel size after a `MaxPool2D` layer in TensorFlow 2.0 is not inherent to the pooling operation itself; rather, it's a consequence of how the operation interacts with the input tensor's spatial dimensions and, crucially, the absence of any explicit channel-wise operation within the `MaxPool2D` layer.  My experience optimizing CNNs for image recognition tasks has highlighted this point numerous times.  `MaxPool2D` performs a downsampling operation across the spatial dimensions (height and width) while preserving the number of channels.  Any decrease in the number of channels arises from preceding or subsequent layers.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `MaxPool2D` layer in TensorFlow (and most other deep learning frameworks) operates independently on each channel.  Consider an input tensor with shape `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`.  The `MaxPool2D` layer, specified with a `pool_size` and `strides`, applies a max pooling operation to each `height x width` window within each individual channel.  The output tensor will have a reduced height and width, determined by the `pool_size` and `strides`, but crucially, the number of channels remains unchanged.  For example, if the input is `(32, 64, 64, 3)` and we use `MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2))`, the output will be `(32, 32, 32, 3)`.  The spatial dimensions are halved, but the three channels are preserved.

Therefore, if you observe a reduction in the number of channels after a `MaxPool2D` layer, the cause lies elsewhere in your model's architecture. This is commonly due to one of the following reasons:

* **Convolutional layers with fewer output filters:**  A convolutional layer preceding the `MaxPool2D` layer might be configured with a smaller number of output filters than the input channels.  This directly reduces the channel dimension before the pooling operation even begins.
* **Incorrect layer ordering or unintended layer application:**  Accidental inclusion of a layer such as a `Conv2D` with fewer filters or a `DepthwiseConv2D` (which is a channel-wise convolution that can decrease the number of channels depending on its parameters) before or even after the pooling layer (though that is less common). In my experience, such errors are surprisingly frequent, particularly when prototyping.  Careful model architecture design and rigorous testing are essential to prevent such oversights.
* **Global Average Pooling or Flatten layers:** Though not directly related to `MaxPool2D`, a `GlobalAveragePooling2D` layer following `MaxPool2D` will further reduce dimensions to `(batch_size, channels)` before the final dense layers. Similarly, flattening the tensor will convert the spatial dimensions into a single feature vector of size `height * width * channels`, leading to a different interpretation of the dimensionality, but not a change in the number of channels until the introduction of a fully connected (dense) layer.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Preserving Channels**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates that the `MaxPool2D` layer does not change the number of channels.  The `Conv2D` layer sets the number of channels to 32, which is then maintained by the `MaxPool2D` layer.  The reduction of spatial dimensions in the `MaxPool2D` layer is evident in the output shape. The channel dimension only changes once the `Flatten` operation reduces spatial dimensions, leading to an interpretation change.  The final `Dense` layer alters the number of channels again to the final number of output classes.

**Example 2: Channel Reduction before MaxPool2D**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.summary()
```

Here, a convolutional layer with only 16 output filters precedes `MaxPool2D`. This reduces the channel count to 16 *before* the pooling operation, which then preserves this reduced number of channels. This illustrates how a preceding layer dictates the channel count that `MaxPool2D` operates on.

**Example 3:  Illustrating a common error (Incorrect Layer Ordering)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2)),  # Incorrect placement - Before feature extraction.
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.summary()
```

This example highlights a potential error: placing `MaxPool2D` before a convolutional layer.  This will typically result in unexpected behavior and potentially drastically reduced performance, as meaningful feature extraction does not happen before pooling.  In this case, the error does not directly affect the channel count but it would degrade performance.  The channel count change can happen later from other factors, but this demonstrates one way the expected behavior may break.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow documentation.
* A comprehensive textbook on deep learning.
* A good reference guide on convolutional neural networks.
* Advanced deep learning literature.
* Relevant research papers on CNN architectures.


By carefully examining the architecture and paying attention to the number of output filters in convolutional layers before and after `MaxPool2D`, you can pinpoint the source of channel reduction.  Remember that `MaxPool2D` itself does not reduce the number of channels; it operates independently on each channel, reducing spatial dimensions while preserving the channel count.  The key is to carefully analyze the entire model's construction to pinpoint the layer(s) responsible for the observed decrease.  Debugging such issues often involves examining the output shape of each layer using `model.summary()` as shown in the examples above, which is a fundamental debugging practice I've used extensively in my work.
