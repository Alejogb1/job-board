The presence of lower mixed layers in an InceptionV3 model summary, even when only training higher mixed layers, stems from the inherent architecture of the model and how optimizers handle gradients during backpropagation. I've observed this behavior firsthand during numerous image classification projects using transfer learning, and it's a core component of understanding efficient deep learning practice.

The InceptionV3 model, like many convolutional neural networks, relies on backpropagation to update its weights based on the calculated loss. During this process, the loss is computed at the output layer, then the gradients are calculated and propagated *backward* through the network. It's essential to recognize that this backpropagation doesn't simply stop at the layers you have explicitly targeted for training. Instead, the gradient flow naturally traverses all preceding layers in the computational graph.

Even when you freeze the lower layers – which effectively prevents the *weights* of those layers from being updated – the gradients are still being calculated for those layers. The optimizer may not modify the weights of the lower layers, but it still processes those gradients and uses them to inform the weight updates of the subsequent, trainable layers. This is where the "mixed" layers, as shown in the model summary, come into play.

The 'mixed' layers in InceptionV3 are not just individual layers, but rather collections of operations bundled together. This typically includes convolutional operations, pooling, and concatenations. When visualizing the summary, one sees individual layer names along with output shapes and parameter counts, but the underlying mechanism involves a sequential flow of data and gradients within these blocks.

Let's visualize this with code. The following example shows the common approach when using transfer learning with InceptionV3, freezing lower layers and training higher ones.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D

# Load the pre-trained InceptionV3 model, excluding the top (classification) layer
base_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(299, 299, 3))

# Freeze lower layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    if "mixed" not in layer.name or int(layer.name.split("mixed")[1]) < 5:
        layer.trainable = False

# Add custom classification layers
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # 10 classes for this example
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.summary()
```

In this snippet, I load the InceptionV3 model without its classification head. I then selectively freeze layers up to the mixed4 layer (arbitrarily). Even though only layers after mixed4 are intended for training, `model.summary()` will show the entire network. This confirms my experience: the lower mixed layers remain present in the graph, even if they are set to `trainable = False`.

The `trainable` attribute dictates if the gradients will be used to update the layer's *weights*. When set to `False`, it means the weights of those layers remain unchanged through the training process. However, the gradients are still computed and flow through those layers.

Consider a simplified example focusing on gradient flow using placeholder layers. This illustrates the propagation, even with non-trainable layers:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Placeholder input
input_tensor = Input(shape=(10,))

# Layer A (Trainable)
layer_a = Dense(5, activation='relu', trainable=True)(input_tensor)

# Layer B (Not Trainable)
layer_b = Dense(3, activation='relu', trainable=False)(layer_a)

# Layer C (Trainable)
layer_c = Dense(2, activation='softmax', trainable=True)(layer_b)

# Build model
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=layer_c)

# Dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 2))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x_train)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean((y_train - predictions)**2)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

# The trainable variables will not contain the weights of Layer B
print("Trainable variables:")
for var in model.trainable_variables:
    print(var.name)

print("\nGradients:")
for grad in gradients:
    print(grad.shape)

```

In this code, even though `layer_b` is not trainable, the gradients still flow through it and impact the gradients computed for `layer_a`. This is because the loss calculation (derived from `layer_c`) depends on the output of all the preceding layers. The gradient is calculated with respect to each of the trainable layers *through* the preceding layers. Thus, gradients for all layers are computed, although only gradients of trainable parameters are ultimately used to update their weights. This behavior is essential for the backpropagation algorithm.

Finally, lets consider what happens if we don't freeze any of the layers at all, showcasing that the earlier layers also gain gradients and their trainable variables updated.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D

# Load the pre-trained InceptionV3 model, excluding the top (classification) layer
base_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(299, 299, 3))

# Add custom classification layers
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # 10 classes for this example
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print the trainable variables to show ALL parameters are trainable
print("Trainable variables:")
for var in model.trainable_variables:
    print(var.name)

model.summary()
```

Here, we don’t freeze any layer, so all trainable variables from all layers will be updated. This further demonstrates that when they aren't explicitly frozen, their gradients are used to update the network's parameters. If the layer is set to not trainable, the gradient will flow through it, as stated earlier, and no updates will occur on that specific layer’s trainable variables.

The key takeaway is that gradients propagate backward through the entire network, regardless of whether specific layers are marked as trainable. The `model.summary()` function displays the complete computational graph, showing all layers and their parameter counts. While freezing layers prevents their *weights* from being updated, it does *not* prevent the gradients from being computed for or passing through those layers. Understanding this distinction is crucial when fine-tuning pre-trained models.

For further in-depth exploration, I recommend consulting resources covering backpropagation and gradient descent techniques specific to deep neural networks. Framework-specific documentation, like the TensorFlow guides on automatic differentiation and transfer learning, provides valuable insights and more technical detail. Additionally, texts such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., provide fundamental knowledge on the topic.
