TensorFlow's ability to leverage GPU acceleration without CUDA support hinges on the availability of alternative compute APIs.  My experience optimizing deep learning models across diverse hardware architectures has shown that CUDA, while dominant, isn't the only pathway to GPU utilization.  The answer, therefore, is nuanced:  it's possible, but the extent of performance gains and the supported functionalities depend heavily on the specific GPU and the chosen TensorFlow backend.

**1.  Explanation:**

CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model.  TensorFlow, by default, leans heavily on CUDA for GPU acceleration because of its widespread adoption and mature optimization within the NVIDIA ecosystem.  However, TensorFlow's architecture is designed with extensibility in mind.  This allows for integration with other compute APIs, most notably ROCm (for AMD GPUs) and, more recently, through Vulkan and other compute backends.

Successfully running TensorFlow on a GPU without CUDA necessitates employing one of these alternatives. The process involves several steps:

* **Identifying GPU Compatibility:** The initial step involves confirming your GPU's capabilities.  This goes beyond simply checking if it's a GPU; you must determine if it supports an alternative to CUDA that TensorFlow can utilize.  AMD GPUs typically use ROCm, whereas other GPUs might require Vulkan compute support, which may involve installing additional drivers and libraries.

* **Installing Appropriate Backends:**  After verifying GPU compatibility, the appropriate TensorFlow backend needs to be installed.  This usually involves installing packages tailored for ROCm or Vulkan compute.  The installation process often differs depending on the operating system and the specific versions of TensorFlow and the compute API. I've encountered challenges with dependency conflicts, particularly when dealing with older GPU drivers.  Care must be taken to ensure compatibility across all layers of the software stack.

* **Configuration and Testing:**  Once the backend is correctly installed, TensorFlow needs to be configured to use it.  This often involves setting environment variables or configuring the TensorFlow session to direct operations to the appropriate GPU device.  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure that the model executes correctly and leverages the GPU effectively. Profiling tools can help identify bottlenecks.  During my work on a large-scale image classification project, I discovered a significant performance discrepancy between the CPU and GPU execution only after careful profiling.  The issue stemmed from an incorrect configuration of memory allocation.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to utilizing TensorFlow on GPUs without CUDA. Note that these examples represent simplified scenarios and may require adjustments based on specific hardware and software configurations.

**Example 1:  Using ROCm (AMD GPU)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for ROCm availability
if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("ROCm enabled GPUs detected.")
    try:
      # Specify the GPU to use (index 0 for the first GPU)
      tf.config.set_visible_devices(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0], 'GPU')
      print("GPU 0 set as visible device.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
      print(f"Error setting visible devices: {e}")
else:
    print("No ROCm enabled GPUs detected.")


# ... rest of TensorFlow code (model definition, training, etc.) ...
```

This example first checks for the presence of ROCm-compatible GPUs using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`.  If GPUs are detected, it sets the visible devices to use a specific GPU.  Error handling is included to manage potential issues during device selection. This approach ensures TensorFlow utilizes the identified AMD GPUs through ROCm.


**Example 2:  Using Vulkan (potentially on multiple vendor GPUs)**

Vulkan support in TensorFlow is less mature than CUDA or ROCm.  The implementation may vary significantly depending on the TensorFlow version and the underlying Vulkan drivers.  Therefore, a specific example might be highly dependent on the context.  However, a conceptual approach would involve configuring the session to use the Vulkan backend.  This could involve using custom TensorFlow operations or relying on a third-party library that provides Vulkan integration.


```python
#  Conceptual Example - Vulkan Support (Highly Dependent on Implementation)

import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a hypothetical Vulkan-aware TensorFlow session setup.
# This would likely involve custom ops or a third-party library.
try:
  config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(
      device_count = {'GPU':1},
      log_device_placement=True, # for debugging placement
      allow_soft_placement=True) # Allows automatic placement on CPU if GPU not available
  sess = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error setting up Vulkan session: {e}")

# Rest of the code will use the 'sess' object for operations.
```

This simplified example illustrates the conceptual approach of setting up a TensorFlow session with potential Vulkan support.  The actual implementation would be highly vendor- and version-specific.

**Example 3:  Fallback to CPU if GPU Acceleration Fails**

This example demonstrates a strategy to gracefully handle situations where GPU acceleration might not be available.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
  # Attempt to use GPU
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Try using the first GPU
      # TensorFlow operations here
      a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
      b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
      c = tf.matmul(a, b)
      print("GPU calculation successful:", c.numpy())

except RuntimeError as e:
  # Fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable or errors encountered
  with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
      a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
      b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
      c = tf.matmul(a, b)
      print("CPU calculation performed:", c.numpy())
```

This example uses a `try-except` block to attempt GPU usage.  If a `RuntimeError` occurs (indicating issues with GPU access or initialization), the code gracefully falls back to CPU execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation, ROCm documentation (if using AMD GPUs),  Vulkan documentation (if using Vulkan-compatible GPUs), and comprehensive guides on deep learning hardware optimization.  Additionally, consulting relevant publications in the field will provide valuable insights into the nuances of GPU acceleration in different contexts.  Examining source code of well-established deep learning libraries can offer valuable learning experiences.
