The impact of `num_workers` on PyTorch `DataLoader` performance is not straightforward; it's a complex interplay between hardware, dataset characteristics, and the specific application.  My experience optimizing data loading for large-scale image classification projects has shown that simply increasing `num_workers` doesn't always translate to linear speed improvements.  In fact, beyond a certain point, increasing this parameter can lead to performance degradation due to increased overhead and potential bottlenecks.

**1.  Explanation of `num_workers` and its Performance Influence:**

The `num_workers` argument in PyTorch's `DataLoader` specifies the number of subprocesses used to load data in parallel.  The primary goal is to decouple data loading from model training, allowing the model to utilize the GPU while the CPU concurrently prepares the next batch of data.  This is crucial for maximizing GPU utilization and preventing idle time during training.

However, this parallelism introduces overhead.  Each worker process incurs the cost of communication with the main process (via inter-process communication or IPC), data serialization, and deserialization. This overhead becomes increasingly significant as `num_workers` increases.  Furthermore, contention for system resources (CPU cores, memory bandwidth, disk I/O) can become a limiting factor.  If the dataset is small or the data loading process is already fast (e.g., data resides in RAM), the overhead might outweigh the benefits of parallelism.  Conversely, with large datasets and slow I/O operations, a higher `num_workers` value is generally beneficial up to a point of diminishing returns.

The optimal value for `num_workers` is highly dependent on several factors:

* **Number of CPU cores:**  Exceeding the number of available CPU cores is rarely beneficial and often detrimental.  Ideally, `num_workers` should be less than or equal to the number of physical cores, though hyperthreading can sometimes allow for slightly higher values.

* **Dataset size and characteristics:**  Large datasets with slow I/O operations (e.g., reading from disk) benefit most from a higher `num_workers`.  For smaller datasets residing in memory, a lower value (even 0) might be sufficient.  The type of data transformation also plays a role; complex transformations will increase the processing time per worker.

* **Data loading speed:**  If the data loading is already very fast, increasing `num_workers` might not provide much improvement and could introduce unnecessary overhead.

* **Inter-process communication overhead:** The overhead of communication between workers and the main process increases with the number of workers. This is particularly relevant when dealing with large datasets or complex data transformations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic DataLoader with varying `num_workers`:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Sample data (replace with your actual dataset)
data = torch.randn(10000, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (10000,))
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)

# Different DataLoader configurations
dataloaders = [
    DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=0),
    DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=4),
    DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=8),
    DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=16)
]

# Measure training time for each configuration (simplified for demonstration)
for i, loader in enumerate(dataloaders):
    start = time.time()
    for batch in loader:
        # Simulate training step
        pass
    end = time.time()
    print(f"num_workers={i*4}: Time = {end-start:.2f} seconds")

```

This example demonstrates how to create different `DataLoader` instances with varying `num_workers`. The `time.time()` calls provide a basic timing mechanism;  for a more robust evaluation, consider using more sophisticated profiling tools.

**Example 2:  DataLoader with custom data loading function:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_path):
        # ... load your data from data_path ...
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self):
        # ... load and pre-process data for a single item ...
        return data_item, label

# Create dataloader with a custom dataset
dataset = MyDataset("my_data.csv")
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)

# Training loop (with proper pin_memory for efficiency)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        data, labels = batch
        # Move data to GPU (if using a GPU)
        data = data.cuda()
        labels = labels.cuda()
        # Training step ...
```

This demonstrates how to use `num_workers` with a custom dataset.  Note the addition of `pin_memory=True`, which is crucial when using GPUs to improve data transfer efficiency.


**Example 3:  Handling exceptions with `DataLoader`:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Sample data
data = torch.randn(10000, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (10000,))
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)


try:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=8, pin_memory=True)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
            #  Training step. Includes error handling for individual batches
            try:
                # Your training logic
                data, target = batch
                # ... Your training operations ...

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error processing batch {i+1} in epoch {epoch+1}: {e}")
                # Implement appropriate recovery strategy
                continue # Skip current batch

except RuntimeError as e:
    # Handle higher level RuntimeErrors during data loading
    print(f"RuntimeError: {e}")
    # Possible solutions include reducing num_workers, adjusting pin_memory, or examining dataset consistency.

```

This example showcases how to handle potential exceptions that may arise during parallel data loading.  Robust error handling is critical when utilizing multiple worker processes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's data loading mechanisms and performance optimization, consult the official PyTorch documentation.  Explore advanced topics such as `pin_memory`, different data loading strategies (e.g., using `IterableDataset` for potentially infinite datasets), and profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.  Furthermore, studying the source code of established PyTorch projects that manage large datasets can provide invaluable insights into practical best practices.  Consider exploring research papers focusing on efficient data loading techniques for deep learning.  Finally, the general understanding of parallel processing and operating system concepts is essential for properly interpreting the impact of `num_workers`.
