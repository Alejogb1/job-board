Chaining requests and aggregating their results in RxSwift hinges on the effective use of operators like `flatMap`, `concat`, `merge`, and `zip`, carefully selected based on the desired ordering and concurrency characteristics of the requests.  My experience working on a large-scale financial data aggregation application heavily utilized these strategies to manage asynchronous network calls, and I've found that a nuanced understanding of these operators is crucial for avoiding common pitfalls like race conditions and inefficient resource utilization.

**1. Explanation of the Core Concepts**

RxSwift's power lies in its ability to represent asynchronous operations as observable sequences.  When chaining requests, we treat each request as an observable that emits a result (or an error).  The choice of operator dictates how these observables interact and how their emissions are combined into a final result.

* **`flatMap` (and `flatMapLatest`):**  This operator is ideal when the order of individual request results isn't critical, and subsequent requests can be initiated regardless of the status of preceding ones.  `flatMap` subscribes to each inner observable, emitting all of their values.  `flatMapLatest` only subscribes to the most recently emitted inner observable, canceling previous ones, useful for preventing a backlog of results from outdated requests.

* **`concat`:** This operator sequentially subscribes to and emits values from multiple observables.  The subsequent observable only begins emitting after the previous one completes, ensuring strictly ordered results. This is suitable when the results of earlier requests are prerequisites for later ones.

* **`merge`:** Similar to `flatMap`, `merge` subscribes to multiple observables concurrently.  It emits values from any observable as they become available, interleaving them without regard for their original order.  This is appropriate when the order of results is inconsequential, and maximizing concurrency is prioritized.

* **`zip`:** This operator combines the emissions of multiple observables into a tuple.  It emits a tuple only when all observables have emitted at least one value, and it proceeds in a lock-step fashion.  This is useful when the combined result requires a value from each observable.

The selection of the appropriate operator heavily depends on the nature of the requests and the dependencies between them.  Misusing these operators can lead to unexpected behavior, including unhandled errors, data races, and inefficient resource usage.  For instance, using `flatMap` when strict ordering is required will lead to unpredictable results. Conversely, using `concat` when concurrency is desired will result in unnecessary delays.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Using `flatMap` for independent network requests**

This example fetches user data and then, independent of the user data result, fetches their profile picture. The order of results doesn't matter.

```swift
import RxSwift

func fetchData() -> Observable<UserData> {
    // Simulate network request
    return Observable.create { observer in
        // Simulate network delay
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
            observer.onNext(UserData(name: "John Doe", id: 1))
            observer.onCompleted()
        }
        return Disposables.create()
    }
}

func fetchProfilePicture(userId: Int) -> Observable<Data> {
    // Simulate network request
    return Observable.create { observer in
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
            observer.onNext(Data()) // Placeholder for image data
            observer.onCompleted()
        }
        return Disposables.create()
    }
}

fetchData()
    .flatMap { userData in
        fetchProfilePicture(userId: userData.id)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { data in
        print("Profile picture fetched: \(data.count) bytes")
    }, onError: { error in
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }, onCompleted: {
        print("Completed")
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)

struct UserData {
    let name: String
    let id: Int
}

let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
```

**Example 2: Using `concat` for sequential, dependent requests**

This example fetches authentication tokens, then uses the token to fetch user data.  The user data request depends on the successful completion of the token request.


```swift
import RxSwift

func fetchAuthToken() -> Observable<String> {
    // Simulate network request
    return Observable.create { observer in
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
            observer.onNext("valid-token")
            observer.onCompleted()
        }
        return Disposables.create()
    }
}

func fetchUserData(token: String) -> Observable<UserData> {
    // Simulate network request
    return Observable.create { observer in
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
            observer.onNext(UserData(name: "Jane Doe", id: 2))
            observer.onCompleted()
        }
        return Disposables.create()
    }
}

Observable.concat([fetchAuthToken(), fetchAuthToken().flatMap { token in fetchUserData(token: token)}])
    .subscribe(onNext: { result in
        print("Result: \(result)")
    }, onError: { error in
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }, onCompleted: {
        print("Completed")
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

**Example 3: Using `zip` for combined results**

This example fetches user information and their current location concurrently, then combines them into a single data structure.  The final result is only emitted when both requests are complete.

```swift
import RxSwift

func fetchLocation() -> Observable<Location> {
    // Simulate network request
    return Observable.create { observer in
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.5) {
            observer.onNext(Location(latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437)) // Los Angeles
            observer.onCompleted()
        }
        return Disposables.create()
    }
}

Observable.zip(fetchData(), fetchLocation()) { userData, location in
    return UserWithLocation(userData: userData, location: location)
}
    .subscribe(onNext: { userWithLocation in
        print("User with location: \(userWithLocation)")
    }, onError: { error in
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }, onCompleted: {
        print("Completed")
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)

struct Location {
    let latitude: Double
    let longitude: Double
}

struct UserWithLocation {
    let userData: UserData
    let location: Location
}
```

*  A well-structured RxSwift tutorial focusing on practical examples and common use cases.


This detailed response covers the fundamental concepts and provides practical examples illustrating how to effectively chain requests and aggregate multiple results within RxSwift.  Remember to always carefully consider the dependencies and ordering requirements of your requests when choosing the appropriate RxSwift operator.  Ignoring these aspects can lead to significant problems in more complex scenarios.
