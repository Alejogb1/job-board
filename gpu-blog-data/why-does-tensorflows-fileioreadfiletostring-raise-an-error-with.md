The `tf.io.read_file_to_string` function, when used with the `binary_mode=True` argument, does not operate in the way one might expect if familiar with Python's built-in file reading modes. It does not inherently handle binary file reads in the sense of interpreting raw bytes. Instead, the `binary_mode=True` flag, or specifically its interaction with TensorFlow's I/O system, triggers an attempt to read the file as a serialized TensorFlow proto message, rather than treating it as an opaque sequence of bytes. This is a subtle but crucial distinction that has led to numerous debugging hours across my machine learning projects.

This functionality stems from TensorFlow's internal design, which optimizes for reading files that are often saved in serialized formats â€“ think of saved model graphs or datasets that utilize Protocol Buffers. When `binary_mode=False` (or when the argument is omitted, which defaults to `False`), TensorFlow interprets the file as a text file encoded with UTF-8, and any errors encountered during decoding (such as invalid byte sequences) will result in `UnicodeDecodeError`. However, with `binary_mode=True`, TensorFlow switches gears and attempts to parse the file content as a TensorFlow proto message, typically a `tensorflow.TensorProto` or similar, based on its internal assumptions about file structures it usually handles. The raised error is frequently a variation of 'invalid proto message,' indicating that the file's contents do not conform to this assumed structure, rather than any issue with binary I/O.

My initial encounter with this was while attempting to load weights from a custom binary file, not a serialized proto, into a TensorFlow model. I assumed `binary_mode=True` would simply return the raw bytes, but was instead met with an opaque error about an invalid message. This forced me to examine the internals of `tf.io` and realize that the name `binary_mode` is not indicative of its function and should be better understood as "TensorFlow proto reading mode". This mode is useful in specific cases but problematic as a general approach for binary I/O.

To illustrate this, consider these code examples:

**Example 1: Attempting to read a simple text file with `binary_mode=True`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Create a sample text file
file_path = 'example.txt'
with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write('This is a test.')

try:
  content = tf.io.read_file(file_path, binary_mode=True)
  print("Successfully read binary:", content)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print("Error occurred:", e)
os.remove(file_path)
```

Here, the program will not successfully read the file and decode it as a byte string. Instead, an `InvalidArgumentError` will be raised due to the file not being a valid proto message, despite the binary_mode being enabled. This highlights the crucial distinction:  it's not about pure binary file reading but rather an attempt to parse a proto message.

**Example 2: Reading a proto message with `binary_mode=True`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.core.framework import tensor_pb2
import os

# Create a serialized TensorProto message
tensor_proto = tensor_pb2.TensorProto()
tensor_proto.dtype = tf.float32.as_datatype_enum
tensor_proto.tensor_shape.dim.add(size=1)
tensor_proto.float_val.append(3.14)

serialized_proto = tensor_proto.SerializeToString()
file_path = 'tensor_example.pb'
with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(serialized_proto)


try:
    content = tf.io.read_file(file_path, binary_mode=True)
    print("Successfully read proto message:", content)
    parsed_proto = tensor_pb2.TensorProto()
    parsed_proto.ParseFromString(content.numpy())
    print("Successfully parsed proto:", parsed_proto)

except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print("Error occurred:", e)
os.remove(file_path)
```

In this case, because the file actually *is* a serialized TensorProto, the code successfully reads the data when `binary_mode=True`. The output will reveal that it reads correctly and when parsed gives access to the value 3.14. The crucial point is that if this is not the case the same error from the first example would occur. Thus, the `binary_mode` is not intended for reading generic binary files.

**Example 3: Reading a binary file correctly with alternative methods**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Create a dummy binary file
file_path = 'binary.bin'
with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
  f.write(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05') # write some bytes

#Correct way to load binary content
with open(file_path,'rb') as f:
    binary_data = f.read()
print("Raw Binary:", binary_data)

# Attempting with `tf.io.read_file` and not using `binary_mode=True`
try:
    text_content = tf.io.read_file(file_path)
    print("Successfully read as text (incorrect)", text_content) # will not print, next catch will activate
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print("Error reading as text (correct)", e)


os.remove(file_path)
```

This example demonstrates the more appropriate approach: using Python's built-in `open` with `'rb'` mode for reading raw binary data. `tf.io.read_file` will attempt to read as text, fail and throw the error. The error message is different this time. It is related to not being able to decode as text. This makes apparent the difference between the internal reading modes, and how they behave in error cases.

From these examples, it should be evident that `binary_mode=True` is not designed to fetch raw bytes in the way that a user might expect. It's a mechanism for reading serialized TensorFlow proto messages.

If you encounter situations where you need to load arbitrary binary files in a TensorFlow environment, you should not rely on `tf.io.read_file` with `binary_mode=True`. Instead, use Python's native file handling tools (specifically, opening with `'rb'`) to load the bytes, then, if required, convert the resulting byte string into a TensorFlow tensor using `tf.constant` or similar operations, or by other parsing based on the specific format you are handling.  Similarly, if a text file needs to be read outside of the UTF-8 format, a Python native `open` call can be used together with the correct encoding option and converted to a tensor once it is loaded correctly.  Tensorflow operations should then be used from this point onwards if the use case needs to operate on tensors.

For further understanding of TensorFlow's file I/O, I would suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation regarding the `tf.io` module. Pay close attention to the sections covering file reading and parsing, paying specific focus to the `tf.io.read_file` and its associated arguments, especially `binary_mode`. Furthermore, examining the `tensorflow.core.framework` package would help with understanding how serialized protobuf messages are handled. Consider reading tutorials and discussions on serializing and deserializing TensorFlow proto messages which will make it more apparent how this system interacts internally with files. Finally, examining TensorFlow's source code itself, especially the C++ components responsible for file I/O, can offer an incredibly detailed but perhaps complex insight into its behavior. This provides the most comprehensive understanding but requires dedicated time.
