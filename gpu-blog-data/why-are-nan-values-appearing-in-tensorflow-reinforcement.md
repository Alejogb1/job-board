NaN values appearing in TensorFlow Reinforcement Learning RNNs after gradient-based optimization are almost invariably a consequence of numerical instability stemming from exploding gradients or, less frequently, from incorrect reward function implementation.  My experience debugging such issues across numerous projects, from robotics simulations to financial market prediction models, points directly to the gradient calculation as the primary culprit.  The high dimensionality and sequential nature of RNNs, coupled with the inherent stochasticity of reinforcement learning, exacerbate these problems.

**1.  Explanation of the Root Cause:**

The core issue lies in the propagation of gradients through the recurrent connections of the RNN.  During backpropagation through time (BPTT), the gradient is calculated for each timestep. This gradient is then multiplied across all timesteps, effectively chaining the errors.  If the gradients are consistently greater than 1 in magnitude, they will grow exponentially over longer sequences â€“ this is the exploding gradient problem.  The resulting excessively large values overflow the numerical precision of the floating-point representation, leading to NaN (Not a Number) values in the weight matrices and ultimately, the loss function.

Several factors contribute to this instability:

* **RNN Architecture:**  Certain RNN architectures, like the basic recurrent neural network (RNN) or even LSTMs and GRUs under specific conditions, are inherently more susceptible to exploding gradients than others. The interaction of activation functions (like tanh or sigmoid) and the weight matrix norms strongly influences the gradient magnitude.

* **Learning Rate:**  An excessively high learning rate can accelerate the growth of gradients, prematurely driving the model into numerical instability.  The learning rate effectively controls the step size during gradient descent, and a large step can easily overshoot the optimal weights, leading to NaN values.

* **Reward Function:** Although less common, an improperly designed reward function can also contribute to NaN values.  If the reward function produces extremely large or unstable rewards, the gradients derived from them will reflect this instability and propagate through the network.  Incorrect handling of reward scaling can magnify this effect.

* **Data Preprocessing:**  Insufficient data normalization or standardization can result in large input values, amplifying the gradient magnitudes and increasing the likelihood of exploding gradients.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential issues and their mitigation strategies within a TensorFlow reinforcement learning context.  These are simplified for clarity; real-world applications often involve more intricate model architectures and reward structures.

**Example 1: Exploding Gradients due to High Learning Rate**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition using tf.keras.Sequential or tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn) ...

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)  # High learning rate

# ... (Training loop) ...

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # ... (Forward pass and loss calculation) ...
        loss = calculate_loss(...)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    # Check for NaN values after each optimization step:
    if any(tf.math.is_nan(x).numpy().any() for x in gradients):
        print("NaN encountered! Reduce learning rate.")
        break

# ... (Rest of the training loop) ...
```
This snippet demonstrates a straightforward training loop. The crucial element is the `learning_rate` parameter within the Adam optimizer.  A high learning rate (like 0.1 in this case) increases the risk of exploding gradients. The `tf.math.is_nan` check provides a mechanism for early detection of NaN values, allowing for runtime intervention.


**Example 2: Gradient Clipping to Mitigate Exploding Gradients**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition) ...

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
clip_norm = 1.0 # Gradient clipping norm

# ... (Training loop) ...

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # ... (Forward pass and loss calculation) ...
        loss = calculate_loss(...)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    gradients, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(gradients, clip_norm) #Gradient Clipping
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

# ... (Rest of the training loop) ...
```

Here, gradient clipping is introduced using `tf.clip_by_global_norm`. This function limits the L2 norm of the gradient vector to `clip_norm`, preventing individual gradients from becoming excessively large and thus preventing the NaN issue.


**Example 3:  Normalization of Rewards**

```python
import numpy as np

# ... (Reward generation within the environment) ...

rewards = environment.get_rewards()
normalized_rewards = (rewards - np.mean(rewards)) / np.std(rewards) # Normalize rewards

# ... (Use normalized_rewards for loss calculation) ...
```

This snippet illustrates reward normalization using z-score standardization.  By subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, the rewards are scaled to have zero mean and unit variance.  This reduces the impact of unusually large rewards on the gradient calculations, improving numerical stability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting advanced textbooks on neural networks, specifically those covering recurrent neural networks and optimization techniques. A strong grasp of numerical methods and linear algebra is also critical.  Specialized texts on reinforcement learning algorithms and their implementation in TensorFlow will further enhance your ability to troubleshoot these problems effectively. Furthermore, carefully reviewing TensorFlow's documentation on gradient handling and optimization algorithms is invaluable.  Scrutinizing research papers on addressing instability in RNN training will provide practical insights into sophisticated mitigation strategies.
