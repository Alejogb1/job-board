A frequent challenge encountered when training neural networks on regression tasks involves managing output distributions that deviate significantly from normality. Scikit-learn's `TargetTransformRegressor` addresses this pre-training transformation via a user-specified function, but Keras/TensorFlow models lack a direct, built-in equivalent. However, we can achieve similar functionality by crafting a custom layer that applies the inverse transformation to the model's predictions during inference and during training as loss normalization when needed.

The fundamental issue lies in the modular nature of Keras/TensorFlow models. They operate on a forward-pass paradigm, where inputs flow through layers to generate predictions. While data preprocessing is naturally handled before feeding data into the model, transforming outputs at the model’s terminus requires a slightly different approach than what is provided out-of-the-box. We must integrate the transformation within the model’s architectural definition. This is more crucial when a consistent, inverse transform needs to be applied during inference while also considering the impact of the forward transformation during training for the model to converge correctly.

Let's consider a scenario where I was working with energy consumption data. The target variable, representing energy usage, exhibited substantial skewness, making it difficult for a standard linear regression neural network to perform effectively. In this case, it would be helpful to transform it via logarithm or box-cox during the training, and then back transform the result during prediction. The key is to create a Keras layer that handles both the inverse transformation during prediction and the forward transformation, when we wish to apply a loss function to the transformed value, during training.

First, we'll define a custom layer that incorporates the inverse transformation. This layer will take the raw model output as input and apply a transformation specified by the user. We'll make use of TensorFlow's capabilities to define custom operations, in this instance we would like to create a Box-Cox transform and its inverse as well as a Log transform and its inverse.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class InverseTransformLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, transform_type, lambda_param=None, **kwargs):
        super(InverseTransformLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.transform_type = transform_type
        self.lambda_param = tf.Variable(lambda_param, dtype=tf.float32, trainable=False) if lambda_param is not None else None

    def call(self, inputs):
      if self.transform_type == "boxcox":
        if self.lambda_param is None:
            raise ValueError("Lambda parameter is required for Box-Cox transform.")
        if abs(self.lambda_param) < 1e-7:
            return tf.exp(inputs)
        else:
            return tf.math.pow(inputs * self.lambda_param + 1.0, 1.0 / self.lambda_param)
      elif self.transform_type == "log":
            return tf.exp(inputs)
      else:
         return inputs

    def get_config(self):
        config = super(InverseTransformLayer, self).get_config()
        config.update({
            "transform_type": self.transform_type,
            "lambda_param": self.lambda_param.numpy() if self.lambda_param is not None else None
        })
        return config
```

In the above code example, the `InverseTransformLayer` class is a custom layer that can apply either a Box-Cox inverse transform, when initialized with `transform_type='boxcox'` and a provided `lambda_param`, or the inverse of the natural logarithm transform, when initialized with `transform_type='log'`. During the layer initialization, the `lambda_param` is defined as a non trainable variable. This value can be populated during data preprocessing using a data sample of the target variable. The `call` method checks the transformation type requested and applies the appropriate inverse operation. If any operation different than `boxcox` or `log` is provided, it defaults to a pass through. The `get_config` method allows the layer to be serialized for saving the model.

Next, let's look at how we integrate this layer into a Keras model. I will use a simple Sequential model as an example:

```python
def build_model_with_transform(input_shape, transform_type, lambda_param=None):
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])
  # Add the inverse transform layer here
  inverse_transform_layer = InverseTransformLayer(transform_type, lambda_param)
  outputs = inverse_transform_layer(model.output)
  return tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=outputs)


# Example usage with log transform
input_shape = (10,)  # Example input shape
model_log = build_model_with_transform(input_shape, transform_type='log')
model_log.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_log.summary()

# Example usage with boxcox transform
# This lambda value would be determined from the training data's target variable
lambda_param_val = 0.25
model_boxcox = build_model_with_transform(input_shape, transform_type='boxcox', lambda_param = lambda_param_val)
model_boxcox.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_boxcox.summary()
```

In this example, the `build_model_with_transform` function receives an input shape, the transformation type and an optional lambda parameter. It then defines a sequential model, then applies the `InverseTransformLayer` which takes as input the output of the model's dense layer. Finally, this is returned as a functional Keras model object. This way the model output is already inverse transformed by this final layer. In the following code, this function is used to define two models: the first one uses a log transform, and the second uses a box-cox transform with an arbitrarily defined parameter (a better practice would be to estimate this based on the training data).

The above implementations correctly handle the inverse transform on the model output. However, it does not take into consideration the need to normalize the loss during the training of the model using a transformed output. This can be achieved by extending the `InverseTransformLayer` to receive an optional parameter to normalize a given loss function when it is provided during the training phase. The idea is that during training the predictions should be compared with the transformed ground truth value. It is useful to use the same method for transforming the model outputs to be used in this comparison.

```python
class TransformLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, transform_type, lambda_param=None, **kwargs):
        super(TransformLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.transform_type = transform_type
        self.lambda_param = tf.Variable(lambda_param, dtype=tf.float32, trainable=False) if lambda_param is not None else None

    def call(self, inputs):
      if self.transform_type == "boxcox":
        if self.lambda_param is None:
            raise ValueError("Lambda parameter is required for Box-Cox transform.")
        if abs(self.lambda_param) < 1e-7:
          return tf.math.log(inputs)
        else:
          return (tf.math.pow(inputs, self.lambda_param)-1.0) / self.lambda_param
      elif self.transform_type == "log":
        return tf.math.log(inputs)
      else:
         return inputs

    def get_config(self):
        config = super(TransformLayer, self).get_config()
        config.update({
            "transform_type": self.transform_type,
            "lambda_param": self.lambda_param.numpy() if self.lambda_param is not None else None
        })
        return config

    def transform_loss(self, y_true, y_pred):
      y_true_t = self.call(y_true)
      y_pred_t = self.call(y_pred)
      return tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true_t, y_pred_t)

def build_model_with_transform_and_loss(input_shape, transform_type, lambda_param=None):
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])
  # Add the inverse transform layer here
  inverse_transform_layer = InverseTransformLayer(transform_type, lambda_param)
  outputs = inverse_transform_layer(model.output)
  transform_layer = TransformLayer(transform_type, lambda_param)
  return tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=outputs), transform_layer


# Example usage with log transform
input_shape = (10,)  # Example input shape
model_log_transf, transf_layer_log = build_model_with_transform_and_loss(input_shape, transform_type='log')
model_log_transf.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=transf_layer_log.transform_loss)
model_log_transf.summary()

# Example usage with boxcox transform
# This lambda value would be determined from the training data's target variable
lambda_param_val = 0.25
model_boxcox_transf, transf_layer_boxcox = build_model_with_transform_and_loss(input_shape, transform_type='boxcox', lambda_param = lambda_param_val)
model_boxcox_transf.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=transf_layer_boxcox.transform_loss)
model_boxcox_transf.summary()
```

In this last example, the `TransformLayer` is similar to the `InverseTransformLayer` but it uses the forward transformation instead of the inverse. It also includes a `transform_loss` method that applies the transform to both the predicted and ground truth values before feeding them to the `mean_squared_error` function provided by Keras. The `build_model_with_transform_and_loss` function returns both the transformed model using the `InverseTransformLayer`, and the transformation layer that will be used to calculate the loss. This implementation correctly handles the inverse transformation of the model’s output, and the loss normalization during the training of the model.

For a deeper understanding of custom layers in Keras/TensorFlow, I highly recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation. Specifically, focus on the guide for building custom layers and models. Also, research techniques for creating custom loss functions with TensorFlow backend. It’s also beneficial to study advanced techniques in data preprocessing including the Box-Cox transformation, and its applications. There are plenty of statistics texts that describe these methods in detail. This should provide a sound basis for implementing transformations in neural network pipelines.
