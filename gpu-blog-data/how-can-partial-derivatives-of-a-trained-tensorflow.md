The efficacy of gradient-based optimization in training TensorFlow v2 neural networks hinges on the accurate computation of partial derivatives.  Directly accessing these derivatives, however, requires a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities and the underlying computational graph.  My experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models has underscored the importance of choosing the appropriate method, depending on the specific needs of the application.  Incorrect approaches can lead to significant performance bottlenecks and inaccurate results.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow v2, by design, utilizes automatic differentiation (AD) through its `GradientTape` context manager.  This mechanism efficiently computes gradients with respect to specified tensors.  The crucial aspect to understand is that the `GradientTape` records operations performed within its context. Subsequently, calling the `gradient()` method calculates the partial derivatives of a target tensor (typically the loss function) with respect to other tensors (the model's trainable variables).  The choice of AD method—forward-mode or reverse-mode—is implicitly handled by TensorFlow; reverse-mode is almost always the optimal choice for training deep networks due to its computational efficiency, especially with a large number of inputs and fewer outputs.  However, direct access to partial derivatives beyond simply calculating gradients for optimization requires a more deliberate approach. One might need them for sensitivity analysis, visualizing gradients for model interpretation, or implementing custom training loops.

The computation is not merely a simple derivative calculation; it's a sophisticated traversal of the computational graph.  The `GradientTape` constructs this graph during the forward pass, enabling efficient backward propagation to determine partial derivatives.  The gradients returned are themselves TensorFlow tensors, allowing for further manipulation and analysis within the TensorFlow ecosystem. It's important to note that the gradients are computed *with respect to the variables the tape is watching*.  Ignoring this can lead to incorrect results or errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Input data and target
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]])
y_true = tf.constant([[10.0]])

# Define the loss function
def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Compute gradients using GradientTape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(x)
  loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

# Print the gradients
for var, grad in zip(model.trainable_variables, gradients):
  print(f"Gradient for {var.name}: {grad}")
```

This example showcases the fundamental use of `GradientTape`. It defines a simple model, computes a loss, and uses `tape.gradient()` to obtain the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's trainable weights. The output shows the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the model.


**Example 2:  Accessing Partial Derivatives for Specific Variables**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition and data as in Example 1) ...

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(x)
  loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)

# Access gradients for specific layers
layer1_weights, layer1_bias = model.layers[0].weights
layer2_weights, layer2_bias = model.layers[1].weights

layer1_weights_grad = tape.gradient(loss, layer1_weights)
layer2_bias_grad = tape.gradient(loss, layer2_bias)

print(f"Gradient for Layer 1 weights: {layer1_weights_grad}")
print(f"Gradient for Layer 2 bias: {layer2_bias_grad}")

```

This example demonstrates finer-grained control.  Instead of obtaining gradients for all trainable variables at once, it specifically targets the weights and bias of individual layers. This allows for more targeted analysis of the model’s behavior.


**Example 3: Higher-Order Derivatives (Hessian)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition and data as in Example 1) ...

with tf.GradientTape() as outer_tape:
  with tf.GradientTape() as inner_tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
  gradients = inner_tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
hessian = outer_tape.jacobian(gradients, model.trainable_variables)

# hessian will be a list of tensors representing the Hessian matrix for each variable.
# Note: Computing the full Hessian can be computationally expensive for large models.

#Process Hessian (requires careful consideration of shape and dimensionality)
#...
```

This example illustrates the computation of higher-order derivatives, specifically the Hessian matrix.  Nested `GradientTape` contexts are used; the inner tape computes the first-order gradients, and the outer tape then computes the Jacobian of these gradients with respect to the model's variables, yielding the Hessian.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge that computing the full Hessian can be computationally expensive, especially for large models.  Approximation methods might be necessary in such scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation, is indispensable.  Furthermore,  research papers on backpropagation and automatic differentiation provide a deeper theoretical understanding.  Finally, reviewing example code and tutorials from reputable sources focusing on gradient computation and advanced TensorFlow usage will aid in practical application.  Thorough understanding of linear algebra and calculus, particularly multivariable calculus, forms a crucial foundation for comprehending the underlying principles.
