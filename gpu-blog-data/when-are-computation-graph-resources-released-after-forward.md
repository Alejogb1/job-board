The lifecycle of computation graph resources, particularly memory allocation, after forward propagation on a subset of samples in deep learning frameworks is a nuanced process primarily dictated by the framework's execution mode: eager versus graph.  My experience developing custom backpropagation algorithms within TensorFlow and PyTorch has highlighted these differences, as optimal resource management is paramount for large model training and deployment.

In the eager execution mode, commonly used in frameworks like TensorFlow (when not using `tf.function`) and PyTorch, the computational graph is dynamically constructed and executed on-the-fly. This means that for each forward pass on a subset of data (a batch), the operations are performed immediately and the memory allocated for intermediate values is generally released once those values are no longer needed for the ongoing computation within that same pass. In practice, this release happens fairly quickly. The framework essentially keeps track of the dependencies within the forward pass and deallocates resources as soon as they are no longer referenced. If, for instance, the gradient computation is not immediately invoked on the loss, the memory used for intermediate results within the forward pass can be freed, unless those values are explicitly saved for a later point. In other words, resources are released soon after each forward pass *unless* they are required for backward propagation.

However, this eager release doesn’t mean the entire forward pass is instantly erased from memory the moment it’s done. Frameworks typically employ caching strategies and rely on garbage collection to handle resource deallocation efficiently. While the resources used to compute the output of an activation function, for example, might be released once its output is used to compute the following layer, some metadata related to that activation might remain temporarily to allow for gradient backpropagation or other functionality.

On the other hand, the static graph mode, used when employing `tf.function` in TensorFlow or explicitly creating computation graphs in other deep learning environments, the forward pass behaves rather differently in terms of resource release. The entire computation graph for a batch of samples is constructed first; it’s a symbolic representation rather than an immediate calculation. In this case, resources are not released after each operation within the forward pass on a batch. Instead, the resources required for the forward pass are usually only released once the entire batch has passed and the backward pass is either not required, or, if it is required, then after the backward pass is completed. The framework now has a complete graph to optimize and execute, which influences the memory management procedure. Resources required for nodes within the computation are held until they are no longer required to compute both the forward or the backward passes on the entire batch.

In summary, the key distinction lies in whether the computational graph is dynamically executed (eager mode) or statically compiled and optimized (graph mode). Eager mode frees resources more readily, while static graph mode keeps resources allocated for longer durations.

The choice between eager and graph modes significantly impacts resource usage and memory footprint. Eager mode, while offering more flexibility for debugging and control, can incur a slightly higher memory overhead due to the fine-grained nature of its resource allocation and deallocation. Conversely, the graph mode generally offers more efficient execution and resource management, particularly for larger, more complex models, because the graph structure allows optimization. However, graph execution sacrifices some debuggability and flexibility.

Consider this code example in a conceptualized deep learning framework to illustrate the eager behavior. Assume a function `forward(x, w1, w2)` performs a simple two-layer neural network:

```python
def forward(x, w1, w2):
  h1 = matmul(x, w1) # Matrix Multiplication: Resource Allocated for h1
  a1 = relu(h1)      # Activation: Resource Allocated for a1
  h2 = matmul(a1, w2) # Matrix Multiplication: Resource Allocated for h2
  return h2          # Output: h2 is kept (returned value)

#Example Eager Execution
x = Tensor(data)
w1 = Tensor(weights1)
w2 = Tensor(weights2)

output = forward(x, w1, w2) # forward pass
#Resources for h1, a1, h2 are released, (except returned value), assuming no backward pass needed
print(output) # Use returned output
```

In this example, intermediate values such as `h1`, `a1`, and intermediate result of matmul and relu, would likely be released soon after `h2` is computed *provided* there is no explicit storage of these intermediate values needed for, say, gradient calculation. The framework manages this deallocation automatically, unless they are part of the return output or otherwise specifically stored. The key point is that this freeing of resources happens at the *operation* level, often soon after each is computed. The timing is generally not at the end of forward pass, but between the end of the operation and start of the next operation.

Let's illustrate the static graph behavior in an example, imagining a similar setup but with a graph compilation stage:

```python
def forward(x, w1, w2):
  h1 = matmul(x, w1)
  a1 = relu(h1)
  h2 = matmul(a1, w2)
  return h2

#Example Graph Execution
x = Tensor(data) # Dummy Tensor input, just to denote a symbol
w1 = Tensor(weights1)
w2 = Tensor(weights2)

graph = compile_to_graph(forward, (x, w1, w2)) #Compile the forward function into graph, it needs dummy tensors

input_tensor = Tensor(data_batch) # Now actual input data
output = graph.execute(input_tensor) # Execute the graph with the batch data

#Resources used in forward pass are released *after* backward pass is done, or if there is no backward pass, after this execute command.
print(output)
```

In this static graph example, resources allocated for the operations inside the `forward` pass (e.g., h1, a1, and h2) are not immediately released after each operation. They are maintained during the entire forward pass within the `execute` call. These resources will only be released after the backward pass, or when the `execute` command is finished. The crucial distinction lies in the fact that the resource management occurs at the *graph* level. The whole execution and resource allocation is done by the graph’s `execute` function and it is this execute that will dictate when memory is freed.

Consider a scenario where a gradient is needed.

```python
def forward(x, w1, w2):
  h1 = matmul(x, w1)
  a1 = relu(h1)
  h2 = matmul(a1, w2)
  return h2

def loss(y_hat, y):
    return mean_squared_error(y_hat, y)


#Example with Gradient Backpropagation

x = Tensor(data) # Dummy Tensor input, just to denote a symbol
w1 = Tensor(weights1)
w2 = Tensor(weights2)
y_true = Tensor(true_labels)

graph = compile_to_graph(forward, (x, w1, w2)) #Compiling the forward pass
loss_graph = compile_to_graph(loss, (graph.execute(x), y_true)) #Compiling loss pass
gradient_ops = create_gradient_operations(loss_graph)

input_data_batch = Tensor(data_batch)
label_data_batch = Tensor(label_batch)

output = graph.execute(input_data_batch) # forward pass on an actual data batch
loss_value = loss_graph.execute(output, label_data_batch) #loss calculation
gradients = gradient_ops.execute() # backward pass

#Resources used in forward pass are released *after* backward pass is done, after this last gradient_ops.execute() command
print(gradients)
```

In this case, the intermediate results of the forward pass *must* be stored as they are needed for backpropagation. The gradient_ops.execute function will call functions that use the intermediate values stored during forward execution, and thus they will only be released after gradient is computed, and after gradient_ops.execute command is done.

Understanding these nuances is critical when designing and debugging deep learning models. For resource management and performance tuning, it is vital to know when memory is released to choose between eager and graph execution modes. Eager execution favors interactive development and debugging, while graph mode can be more efficient when the model is fully defined and ready for training or deployment.

For a comprehensive understanding, I would recommend exploring resources like the official documentation of deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which provide detailed insights into their computational graph mechanisms. Books on deep learning architecture and implementations can also provide a deeper dive into computational graph construction and resource management. Publications from academic research that delves into the inner workings of auto-differentiation and compiler optimization related to tensor operations would be relevant. These resources offer a deeper theoretical foundation. Finally, code repositories offering examples of custom computation graph implementation and experimentation offer practical insights to the topic.
