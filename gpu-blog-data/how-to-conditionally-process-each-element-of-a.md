The ability to selectively apply transformations to elements within a TensorFlow tensor is fundamental for constructing complex data processing pipelines and model architectures. Directly looping through a TensorFlow vector using standard Python constructs is discouraged due to performance bottlenecks; instead, TensorFlow's vectorized operations and specialized functions should be utilized to achieve efficient conditional processing.

My experience working on a large-scale recommendation system involved extensive manipulation of user feature vectors. One common requirement was to apply different normalization strategies based on feature categories, which necessitated efficient conditional processing at the vector level. This is not a simple "if/else" operation on a loop, but rather a parallel, tensor-aware implementation of the same logic.

The key is to leverage `tf.where` combined with boolean masks derived from the conditions we want to apply. `tf.where` accepts a boolean tensor (the mask), a tensor to return where the mask is `True`, and a tensor to return where the mask is `False`. In this manner, vectorized conditional logic is readily expressed. The operation is performed element-wise and executes much faster than looping in Python. When the result of your transformations is another tensor with identical shape, this is a straightforward solution. However, if the shape is different, we will look at alternatives such as `tf.map_fn` later.

**Example 1: Basic Conditional Scaling**

Consider a scenario where we have a vector of numerical features, and we wish to scale values greater than 10 by a factor of 0.5, while leaving other values untouched.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_scale(vector):
    """
    Scales elements in a vector that are greater than 10 by a factor of 0.5.

    Args:
      vector: A TensorFlow tensor (vector).

    Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor with scaled values.
    """

    condition = tf.greater(vector, 10.0)
    scaled_vector = tf.where(condition, vector * 0.5, vector)
    return scaled_vector

# Example usage
input_vector = tf.constant([5.0, 12.0, 3.0, 25.0, 8.0], dtype=tf.float32)
output_vector = conditional_scale(input_vector)
print(output_vector)  # Output: tf.Tensor([5.  6. 3. 12.5 8.], shape=(5,), dtype=float32)
```

In this code, we start by creating a boolean mask using `tf.greater`, which evaluates each element in the input vector against the condition (greater than 10). The resulting boolean tensor then serves as the condition argument for `tf.where`. When an element satisfies the condition, the corresponding value from `vector * 0.5` is used; otherwise, the original element from `vector` is returned.  This ensures that the output tensor has the same shape as the input and implements the conditional scaling operation as intended.

**Example 2: Applying Different Functions Based on Threshold**

In more complex situations, one might need to apply completely different transformations based on a condition. Suppose we want to apply the square function to elements above a threshold and the square root function to others.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_function_application(vector, threshold):
    """
    Applies different functions based on a threshold.
    Squares elements greater than the threshold, and calculates square root otherwise.

    Args:
      vector: A TensorFlow tensor (vector).
      threshold: A scalar tensor.

    Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor with transformed values.
    """
    condition = tf.greater(vector, threshold)
    squared_vector = tf.math.square(vector)
    sqrt_vector = tf.math.sqrt(tf.abs(vector)) # Using abs() to avoid NaN for negative values
    transformed_vector = tf.where(condition, squared_vector, sqrt_vector)
    return transformed_vector

# Example usage
input_vector = tf.constant([-4.0, 2.0, 9.0, 16.0, 25.0], dtype=tf.float32)
threshold_value = tf.constant(10.0, dtype=tf.float32)
output_vector = conditional_function_application(input_vector, threshold_value)
print(output_vector) # Output: tf.Tensor([2.0, 1.4142135, 3., 16., 25.], shape=(5,), dtype=float32)
```
Here, instead of simply scaling, we pre-calculate both the squared and square-rooted version of the input tensor. The `tf.where` function then selects between the appropriate transformed vectors according to the threshold condition. This example demonstrates the flexibility of `tf.where` for conditional application of arbitrary functions. A small change compared to the previous example is that we need to ensure no NaN values are generated when calculating square roots for negative numbers and thus added `tf.abs` before calculating the square root.

**Example 3:  Conditional Processing with Different Output Shapes using `tf.map_fn`**

Situations may arise when different transformations generate results with different dimensions. Consider a scenario where positive values are replaced by a one-hot vector of a fixed size and other values are simply dropped (replaced by 0). In this case, the output tensor has a different shape than the original vector. `tf.where` is no longer suitable, and we must use `tf.map_fn` which can handle operations with different shapes as output.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_one_hot(vector, one_hot_size):
  """
  Replaces positive values with a one-hot vector, and others with 0.

  Args:
      vector: A TensorFlow tensor (vector).
      one_hot_size: The length of the one-hot encoding.

  Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor with the modified values.
  """
  def map_function(element):
    condition = tf.greater(element, 0.0)
    one_hot_vector = tf.one_hot(tf.zeros((), dtype=tf.int32), depth=one_hot_size, dtype=tf.float32)
    return tf.cond(condition, lambda: one_hot_vector, lambda: tf.zeros((one_hot_size,), dtype=tf.float32))

  return tf.map_fn(map_function, vector, dtype=tf.float32)


# Example usage
input_vector = tf.constant([-2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3.0, -5.0], dtype=tf.float32)
one_hot_size_value = 3
output_tensor = conditional_one_hot(input_vector, one_hot_size_value)
print(output_tensor) # Output: tf.Tensor(
# [[0. 0. 0.]
# [1. 0. 0.]
# [0. 0. 0.]
# [1. 0. 0.]
# [0. 0. 0.]], shape=(5, 3), dtype=float32)
```

In this example,  `tf.map_fn` allows us to apply the provided `map_function` to each individual element of the vector. The key here is using `tf.cond` to evaluate the condition and apply different logic. If the element satisfies the condition (positive number), we return a one-hot vector. Otherwise, we return a zero vector of the same length. `tf.map_fn` is particularly useful when the shape of output varies per element since `tf.where` expects that the selected tensors have the same shape, which is not the case here. `tf.map_fn` does not offer as much optimization as `tf.where` but it allows different shapes as output from its mapping function.
Note that the shapes of the results should be consistent for each execution of the `map_function`.

In summary, while `tf.where` is most often the most efficient choice for simple conditional transformations where the output shape remains the same as the input shape, `tf.map_fn` provides flexibility for complex scenarios, such as when the output shape changes based on the condition. Using these tools,  conditional processing within TensorFlow vectors is achieved in an efficient, vectorized fashion.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further study, I would suggest exploring the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor operations, specifically focusing on `tf.where`, `tf.map_fn`, and broadcasting rules. Additionally, research on vectorized operations versus iterative loops, particularly in the context of numerical computation frameworks like TensorFlow, could prove valuable. Consulting online examples of implementing conditional logic for tensors will also provide further insight and ideas. Finally, any good book on deep learning with TensorFlow should cover this topic in detail.
