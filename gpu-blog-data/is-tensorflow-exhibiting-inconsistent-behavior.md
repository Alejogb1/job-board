TensorFlow's purported inconsistency often stems from a misunderstanding of its computational graph execution model and the intricacies of automatic differentiation.  In my experience debugging large-scale TensorFlow models across diverse hardware configurations, the apparent inconsistencies are rarely inherent to the framework itself but rather originate from subtle errors in code implementation, data preprocessing, or a lack of awareness regarding TensorFlow's behavior under various operational settings.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's execution relies on building a computational graph, which is subsequently executed.  This graph representation allows for optimizations like automatic differentiation and parallel processing.  However, the specifics of graph construction and execution can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.  The key factors contributing to perceived inconsistency include:

* **Graph Construction vs. Execution:**  TensorFlow distinguishes between the definition phase (graph construction) and the execution phase (session running).  Variables, operations, and placeholders are defined during graph construction.  Actual computation happens only when the graph is executed within a `tf.compat.v1.Session` (or its equivalent in later versions).  Errors in how these phases interact can produce seemingly inconsistent behavior.  For instance, modifying a variable outside the context of a `tf.assign` operation within the graph will not reflect in the computation.

* **Statefulness and Variable Initialization:**  Variables in TensorFlow maintain state across multiple executions.  Improper initialization, particularly when dealing with multiple sessions or distributed training, can lead to incorrect or varying results.  Failure to explicitly initialize variables or relying on implicit initialization can create unpredictable behavior, particularly across different runs.

* **Random Seed Management:**  TensorFlow's randomization functions, like those used in weight initialization or dropout layers, rely on a random seed.  Without explicitly setting a seed, each run will employ a different sequence of random numbers, leading to varying model outputs.  This is not an inconsistency but rather a consequence of stochasticity unless the randomness is deliberately controlled.

* **Hardware and Software Variations:** The execution environment's hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU) and software (driver versions, CUDA toolkit) can subtly affect performance and numerical precision.  These variations may manifest as discrepancies across runs, especially concerning floating-point computations, that are not indicative of TensorFlow's inherent instability.

* **Data Dependencies:**  The ordering of operations and data dependencies within the graph can impact the results.  Operations that depend on each other will execute sequentially, even if potentially parallelizable.  This sequence might not always be apparent from the code, and a failure to recognize such dependencies can give the impression of unpredictable results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Modifying the variable outside the graph
x = tf.Variable(0.0)
x.assign(1.0) #This is done outside of a session, so doesn't affect the graph

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  print(sess.run(x))  # Output: 0.0 (not 1.0)


# Correct:  Using tf.assign within the graph
x = tf.Variable(0.0)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  sess.run(x.assign(1.0))
  print(sess.run(x))  # Output: 1.0
```

This example highlights the crucial difference between modifying a variable's value directly and using `tf.assign` within the computational graph.  The first instance demonstrates an incorrect approach where the variable's value is not updated within the TensorFlow graph, leading to an unexpected result. The second showcases the correct usage of `tf.assign` within the graph.


**Example 2:  Uncontrolled Randomness**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Uncontrolled Randomness
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(x))

# Controlled Randomness
tf.random.set_seed(42)  # Setting the seed for reproducibility
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(x))
```

This illustrates the effect of setting a random seed.  The first instance shows uncontrolled random number generation. Each execution will produce a different output.  The second uses `tf.random.set_seed`, making the generated tensor consistent across multiple runs.


**Example 3: Data Dependency Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])
c = tf.add(a, b)
d = tf.multiply(a, 2)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c))  # Output: [5 7 9]
    print(sess.run(d))  # Output: [2 4 6]

#Incorrect assumption of parallel execution
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run([c,d])) #The order in which c and d are evaluated is determined by TensorFlow's optimization, not necessarily the order specified here.
```

This demonstrates that while `c` and `d` appear independent, their execution order is determined by TensorFlow's internal optimization. There is no guarantee that `c` and `d` will execute in the order presented in the code, although in this example, they likely will, leading to seemingly predictable behaviour, highlighting the potential pitfalls of assuming parallel execution without careful consideration of the graph structure.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, consult the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on graph execution, variable management, and random number generation.  Explore advanced topics such as TensorFlow's execution strategies and distributed training methodologies to further grasp its complexities.  Furthermore, a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus is essential for comprehending the intricacies of automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization, which form the core of many TensorFlow applications.  Reviewing materials on numerical stability and floating-point arithmetic will be helpful in understanding the limitations of computations performed on computers.  Finally, studying debugging techniques specifically tailored for TensorFlow is indispensable for efficient troubleshooting.
