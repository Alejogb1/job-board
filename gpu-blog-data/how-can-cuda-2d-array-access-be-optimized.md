Optimizing CUDA 2D array access hinges on understanding memory coalescing.  In my experience developing high-performance computing applications for geophysical simulations, failing to address coalesced memory access consistently resulted in significant performance bottlenecks, sometimes exceeding orders of magnitude.  The fundamental principle is simple: threads within a warp should access consecutive memory locations to maximize memory throughput.  Deviating from this leads to multiple memory transactions for a single warp, drastically reducing performance.

The efficiency of memory access in CUDA is directly tied to the hardware architecture.  Threads within a warp (typically 32 threads) execute instructions concurrently.  Global memory accesses are performed in groups of 32 consecutive memory locations.  If the threads in a warp access memory locations that are not consecutive, multiple memory transactions are required, significantly slowing down execution.  This lack of coalesced memory access is a common source of performance degradation.

**1.  Explanation: Strategies for Coalesced Access**

Achieving coalesced memory access necessitates careful consideration of array indexing and thread organization.  The most straightforward approach involves organizing the data in memory in a way that maps naturally to the thread organization.  This usually means storing data in row-major order, and ensuring that threads within a warp access consecutive elements within a row.

Consider a scenario where we're processing a 2D array representing an image.  If threads are organized such that they process elements sequentially along rows, with each warp processing consecutive rows, we'll achieve optimal memory coalescing.  Conversely, if threads access elements column-wise without careful consideration of warp organization, the access pattern becomes non-coalesced, resulting in substantial performance overhead.

Another crucial aspect involves understanding shared memory. Shared memory is a fast, on-chip memory accessible by all threads in a block.  Efficient use of shared memory can significantly reduce reliance on global memory, which is considerably slower.  By loading portions of the global memory array into shared memory, we can perform calculations using the fast shared memory and minimize the number of global memory accesses. This approach requires carefully designing data transfer between global and shared memory to maintain coalesced accesses.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Suboptimal Access (Non-Coalesced)**

```c++
__global__ void nonCoalescedKernel(int *data, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int index = y * width + x; // Non-coalesced access if threads in a warp have different y values.
    data[index] *= 2;
  }
}
```

In this example, if threads within a warp have different `y` values, the memory accesses will be non-coalesced.  The calculation of `index` leads to scattered memory accesses for a single warp, resulting in poor performance. This is especially true if the `width` is large, causing significantly distanced memory locations to be accessed by a single warp.

**Example 2: Optimized Access (Coalesced)**

```c++
__global__ void coalescedKernel(int *data, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y; // y is same for all threads in a block

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    for (int i = 0; i < blockDim.y && y + i < height; ++i){
      int index = (y + i) * width + x;
      data[index] *= 2;
    }
  }
}
```

This kernel improves coalescence by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.  Each thread in the warp now operates on consecutive elements along a single row.  The outer loop iterates over rows, while the inner loop performs operations on elements within the same row.  Although the increased number of instructions per thread is a small overhead, the significant performance gain from coalesced memory access usually outweighs this.

**Example 3: Using Shared Memory for Optimization**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *data, int width, int height) {
  __shared__ int tile[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_HEIGHT];

  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int globalIndex = y * width + x;
    tile[tx][ty] = data[globalIndex]; // Load data from global memory into shared memory. Coalesced if TILE_WIDTH is a multiple of 32.
    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads in the block have loaded their data

    //Perform computations using shared memory
    tile[tx][ty] *= 2;

    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all writes to shared memory are complete

    data[globalIndex] = tile[tx][ty]; // Write results back to global memory. Coalesced if TILE_WIDTH is a multiple of 32.
  }
}
```

This kernel showcases the use of shared memory.  We load a tile of data from global memory into shared memory, perform calculations within shared memory, and then write the results back to global memory.  The `TILE_WIDTH` and `TILE_HEIGHT` parameters need to be carefully chosen to ensure both global memory access and write-back operations are coalesced.  The `__syncthreads()` function synchronizes threads within a block, ensuring data consistency.  The effectiveness of this technique heavily depends on the size of the tile and the nature of the computation.  Larger tiles are beneficial if the computations require significant data locality, but extremely large tiles might cause excessive shared memory usage.  This is a typical trade-off that I've frequently encountered when optimising such kernels.
