PyTorch tensor indexing, specifically operations involving boolean or integer arrays for advanced indexing, does not inherently *fail* for tensor sizes below 32. The behavior users often perceive as failure arises from specific interaction with CUDA kernels and their inherent optimizations, particularly when operating on GPUs. This is not a fundamental limitation of PyTorch’s indexing logic itself, but rather an edge case where efficiency considerations related to GPU parallelism clash with the small problem size.

The crux of the matter is that GPU processing excels at performing computations on large batches of data concurrently. To realize this parallelism, CUDA kernels are launched with a substantial number of threads, organized into blocks and grids.  When indexing a small tensor (sizes far below 32 elements), the GPU's parallel processing power is often underutilized. The overhead of launching the kernel, managing the threads, and transferring data becomes disproportionately large relative to the actual computational workload. This often results in significant performance penalties and, in some situations, might even exhibit different behavior than expected due to the kernel’s optimization paths.

Furthermore, kernel implementations often include various optimizations designed for larger tensors. These optimizations might bypass some edge cases which manifest when applied to small data sets. This is not a bug in the traditional sense but rather an outcome of prioritization of performance for typical usage scenarios. Such prioritization is generally a good trade-off to maximize overall performance of larger tensor operations.

Let's illustrate this with specific code examples and examine the underlying mechanics at play.

**Example 1: Integer Array Indexing**

```python
import torch

# Initialize a small tensor on CPU and GPU
cpu_tensor = torch.arange(10)
gpu_tensor = torch.arange(10).cuda()

# Define index arrays
cpu_indices = torch.tensor([2, 5, 8])
gpu_indices = torch.tensor([2, 5, 8]).cuda()

# CPU indexing
cpu_result = cpu_tensor[cpu_indices]
print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}")

# GPU indexing
gpu_result = gpu_tensor[gpu_indices]
print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}")


```

In this example, the indexing operations are straightforward. Whether on the CPU or GPU, they will function as intended: extracting the elements at indices 2, 5, and 8. Both outputs will be tensors containing `[2, 5, 8]`. This demonstrates that basic integer array indexing works correctly even with tensors smaller than 32. However, underlying GPU computations will be less efficient here because GPU kernel is launched for tiny data.

**Example 2: Boolean Mask Indexing**

```python
import torch

# Initialize a small tensor on CPU and GPU
cpu_tensor = torch.arange(10)
gpu_tensor = torch.arange(10).cuda()

# Define boolean mask
cpu_mask = (cpu_tensor > 3) & (cpu_tensor < 8)
gpu_mask = (gpu_tensor > 3) & (gpu_tensor < 8)

# CPU boolean indexing
cpu_result = cpu_tensor[cpu_mask]
print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}")

# GPU boolean indexing
gpu_result = gpu_tensor[gpu_mask]
print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}")
```

Here, a boolean mask is used to extract elements that are greater than 3 and less than 8. The output on both CPU and GPU is `[4, 5, 6, 7]`. Again, we don’t observe indexing failure. The operation appears to function identically regardless of processing location. However, this doesn't mean they perform equally well. The overhead of GPU operation on such a small amount of data may outweigh its potential speed advantages compared to its CPU counterpart.

**Example 3: Modification via Indexing**

```python
import torch

# Initialize a small tensor on CPU and GPU
cpu_tensor = torch.arange(10)
gpu_tensor = torch.arange(10).cuda()

# Define indices and values for replacement
cpu_indices = torch.tensor([1, 3, 5])
cpu_values = torch.tensor([100, 200, 300])

gpu_indices = torch.tensor([1, 3, 5]).cuda()
gpu_values = torch.tensor([100, 200, 300]).cuda()

# CPU replacement
cpu_tensor[cpu_indices] = cpu_values
print(f"Modified CPU tensor: {cpu_tensor}")

# GPU replacement
gpu_tensor[gpu_indices] = gpu_values
print(f"Modified GPU tensor: {gpu_tensor}")
```

This example demonstrates in-place modification via indexing. Both CPU and GPU results correctly update the specified indices with new values. The output for both is a modified tensor with elements at positions 1, 3, and 5 changed to 100, 200, and 300 respectively. The key observation, though, is that despite this correct function, the GPU performance will be suboptimal due to the small tensor size. There are scenarios where specific edge cases related to GPU kernel implementation could manifest with extremely small tensors, potentially leading to unexpected behavior during in-place modifications, though this isn’t likely in typical uses like this.

The crucial takeaway from these examples is that indexing itself doesn’t fail for small tensors. Instead, performance suffers considerably on the GPU due to its architecture’s focus on large-batch parallelism. The perceived "failure" is primarily a consequence of this performance degradation and, in rare cases, unexpected behavior related to specific kernel optimizations on very small datasets.

I have observed this personally when implementing custom tensor operations involving heavy indexing on different datasets. Initially, I noticed seemingly inconsistent behavior or dramatic performance swings depending on the sizes of the tensors being indexed. Tracing the behavior revealed that the issue was not the indexing logic in PyTorch itself, but rather the CUDA kernel launching overhead and optimization logic coming into play. Switching to operations that avoid advanced indexing for small tensors or using CPU based computation proved effective in these scenarios.

To improve performance with small tensors, consider these strategies. When you encounter the need to operate on very small tensors, processing them on the CPU might be faster than using the GPU. Employing operations optimized for small tensors using libraries specifically geared towards such scenarios, or, if possible, reorganizing data flow to work with larger tensors, are also effective.

For further exploration of these nuances, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on tensor operations and CUDA programming, and examining the source code of PyTorch tensor implementations. Additionally, researching CUDA kernel optimization techniques can provide further insights into the performance characteristics of tensor operations on GPUs. These resources provide a deeper understanding of the interaction between PyTorch tensor operations and hardware-specific details and are essential for navigating performance issues related to small tensor sizes.
