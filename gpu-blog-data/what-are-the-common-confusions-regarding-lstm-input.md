The most frequent misunderstanding surrounding LSTM input shapes stems from the inherent sequential nature of the data and the network's expectation of time series information.  Many newcomers fail to appreciate that LSTMs don't process single data points but rather sequences of data points, each point typically represented as a vector. This distinction fundamentally impacts how the input data needs to be structured.  In my experience debugging numerous recurrent neural network projects, this oversight consistently leads to shape mismatches and subsequent runtime errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

An LSTM network processes sequences.  A sequence is an ordered collection of data points.  Each data point within this sequence is often referred to as a timestep.  Consider a simple example: predicting the next word in a sentence.  The sequence would be the sentence itself, with each word being a timestep.  Now, each word isn't simply a single value; it’s represented by a vector, often a word embedding representing its semantic meaning.  Therefore, the input to an LSTM is not a single vector but a sequence of vectors.

The input shape, as expected by the Keras or TensorFlow/PyTorch LSTM layer, needs to reflect this structure.  It's typically represented as (number of samples, number of timesteps, input dimensionality).  Let's break down each component:

* **Number of Samples (batch size):** This is simply the number of independent sequences you are feeding to the network in a single training iteration.  If you're processing 32 sentences at once, this would be 32.

* **Number of Timesteps:** This is the length of each individual sequence.  Using the sentence example, this is the number of words in each sentence.  Sequences of varying lengths require padding or truncating to maintain a consistent number of timesteps across the batch.

* **Input Dimensionality:** This is the dimensionality of the vector representing each timestep.  If you’re using 100-dimensional word embeddings, this would be 100.  For time series data, this might represent multiple features at each time point (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).

Failure to correctly configure these three dimensions leads to errors, often cryptic shape mismatches reported during model compilation or training.  This usually stems from either misunderstanding the sequential nature of the data or improperly pre-processing the input.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three distinct scenarios using Keras, a popular deep learning library. I've chosen Keras for its user-friendly API and widespread adoption, reflecting the tools I've utilized extensively in my past projects.

**Example 1:  Simple Time Series Prediction**

This example demonstrates predicting the next value in a simple univariate time series.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: a time series of 100 points
data = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100))

# Reshape data for LSTM input (samples, timesteps, features)
# We create sequences of length 10, so each input is a sequence of 10 time points
timesteps = 10
X = []
y = []
for i in range(len(data) - timesteps):
    X.append(data[i:i + timesteps])
    y.append(data[i + timesteps])
X = np.array(X).reshape(-1, timesteps, 1)  # Reshape to (samples, timesteps, features)
y = np.array(y)

# Build the LSTM model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)
```
Here, the crucial step is reshaping `X` to `(samples, timesteps, 1)`. The `1` represents the single feature (the sine value) at each timestep.  Incorrectly providing a 2D array directly would result in a shape mismatch.

**Example 2:  Sentiment Analysis with Word Embeddings**

This example tackles sentiment analysis using pre-trained word embeddings.  Note the pre-processing step to ensure correct input shaping.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Embedding, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Assume 'sentences' is a list of sentences, and 'embeddings' is a pre-trained embedding matrix.
# Each sentence is tokenized and represented by a list of indices in 'embeddings'.

# Pad sequences to ensure consistent length
maxlen = 50 # Maximum sentence length
padded_sentences = pad_sequences(sentences, maxlen=maxlen)

# Assuming embeddings has shape (vocabulary_size, embedding_dim)
embedding_dim = 100
model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(len(embeddings), embedding_dim, weights=[embeddings], input_length=maxlen, trainable=False),
    LSTM(100),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_sentences, labels, epochs=10) # labels are 0 or 1 for sentiment
```

This demonstrates using an `Embedding` layer to transform word indices into word vectors.  `pad_sequences` handles varying sentence lengths, creating a consistent number of timesteps.  The input shape to the LSTM is implicitly defined by `input_length` in the Embedding layer.

**Example 3:  Multivariate Time Series Forecasting**

This involves predicting multiple variables from multiple input variables.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: multiple time series with multiple features
data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 3) # 100 samples, 10 timesteps, 3 features

# Prepare data for LSTM:  No reshaping needed as it's already in (samples, timesteps, features)
timesteps = 10
X = data[:, :-1, :]  # Input: first 9 timesteps
y = data[:, -1, :]  # Output: last timestep (all 3 features)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, 3)),
    Dense(3) # 3 output neurons because we're predicting 3 features
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)
```

This highlights how multivariate time series with multiple features are handled.  The input shape explicitly specifies three features (`input_shape=(timesteps, 3)`).  The output layer also adjusts to reflect the three features being predicted.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I would recommend consulting the official documentation for Keras and TensorFlow/PyTorch.  Furthermore, exploring introductory materials on recurrent neural networks and LSTM architectures in standard machine learning textbooks would prove highly beneficial.  Finally, searching for tutorials focusing specifically on LSTM input preparation and data pre-processing techniques would solidify your comprehension.  Paying close attention to example code and systematically analyzing the dimensions of your data will prove instrumental in preventing shape-related errors.
