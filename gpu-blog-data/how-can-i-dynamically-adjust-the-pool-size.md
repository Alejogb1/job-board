Dynamically adjusting the pool size of an `AveragePooling2D` layer within a Keras sequential model isn't directly supported through built-in mechanisms.  The `pool_size` argument in the layer's constructor is a fixed parameter defining the pooling window dimensions at instantiation.  My experience working on several image processing projects involving variable-resolution input has led me to develop alternative strategies to achieve this functionality.  The key is to leverage Keras's flexibility with custom layers and model manipulation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The limitation stems from the static nature of Keras sequential models. Once a model is defined, its architecture, including layer parameters, is generally fixed. To circumvent this, we must create a mechanism to replace the `AveragePooling2D` layer itself with a new instance having the desired pool size. This necessitates employing a custom layer or a technique that dynamically rebuilds a portion of the model.  I've found that constructing a custom layer offering dynamic pool size control provides the cleanest and most maintainable solution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Custom Layer with Dynamic Pool Size**

This approach defines a custom layer inheriting from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. The pool size is passed as an input during the `call` method execution.  This allows runtime modification.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicAveragePooling2D(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(DynamicAveragePooling2D, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs, pool_size):
        if not isinstance(pool_size, (tuple, list)) or len(pool_size) != 2:
            raise ValueError("pool_size must be a tuple or list of length 2.")
        return tf.nn.avg_pool2d(inputs, ksize=pool_size + (1, 1), strides=pool_size + (1, 1), padding='VALID')

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        if not isinstance(self.pool_size, (tuple, list)) or len(self.pool_size) != 2:
            raise ValueError("pool_size must be a tuple or list of length 2.")
        rows = input_shape[1] // self.pool_size[0]
        cols = input_shape[2] // self.pool_size[1]
        return (input_shape[0], rows, cols, input_shape[3])

#Model Usage
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),  # Example input shape
    DynamicAveragePooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Dynamically adjust pool size during inference or training
pool_size = (2, 2)  # Initial pool size
output = model(input_tensor, pool_size)

pool_size = (3,3) # Change pool size
output = model(input_tensor, pool_size)

```

**Commentary:**  The `compute_output_shape` method is crucial; it informs Keras about the output dimensions based on the dynamic `pool_size`. Error handling is incorporated to ensure valid input.  This method allows for a clean integration into the model, maintaining a sequential structure while offering the required flexibility.  I've used this approach extensively in projects dealing with image pyramids and multi-scale feature extraction.



**Example 2:  Model Reconstruction (Less Efficient)**

This approach involves rebuilding a portion of the model each time the pool size needs to change. Itâ€™s less efficient but demonstrates an alternative technique.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def rebuild_model(model, new_pool_size):
    new_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        model.layers[0] # Input layer remains the same
    ])
    new_model.add(tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=new_pool_size))
    for layer in model.layers[2:]: #Add remaining layers
        new_model.add(layer)
    return new_model


# Model definition (initial pool size)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Change pool size
new_pool_size = (3,3)
model = rebuild_model(model,new_pool_size)

```

**Commentary:** This method is less elegant due to the repeated model construction. The overhead of recreating the model can impact performance, especially with larger, more complex models.  I typically reserve this for scenarios where the model's overall structure needs significant alteration, not just a single parameter change.



**Example 3:  Lambda Layer (Less Recommended)**

While possible, using a `Lambda` layer with a custom function to apply average pooling is less straightforward and potentially less efficient.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def dynamic_avg_pool(x, pool_size):
    return tf.nn.avg_pool2d(x, ksize=pool_size + (1, 1), strides=pool_size + (1, 1), padding='VALID')

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: dynamic_avg_pool(x, (2,2))), # Initial pool size
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Attempting to change the pool size here is problematic and requires model reconstruction, similar to Example 2.


```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates how to incorporate dynamic pooling with a `Lambda` layer. However, altering the `pool_size` requires a model rebuild akin to Example 2, negating the benefits of a sequential model.  This approach introduces more complexity without significant advantages. I generally avoid this method unless absolutely necessary for highly specialized operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of custom Keras layers, consult the official Keras documentation on custom layer creation and the TensorFlow documentation on average pooling operations.  Understanding the concepts of  `tf.keras.layers.Layer`,  `call` method implementation, and `compute_output_shape` is essential.  Reviewing material on functional Keras models can also be beneficial, although not strictly necessary for the solutions presented.  Finally, exploring the intricacies of TensorFlow's `tf.nn` module for low-level tensor manipulation will enhance your understanding of the underlying operations.
