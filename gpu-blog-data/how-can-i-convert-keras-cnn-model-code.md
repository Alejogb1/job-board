Migrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from Keras to PyTorch requires a careful understanding of the distinct architectural and implementation paradigms each framework employs. Having personally transitioned several complex models between these platforms, I can confirm that a direct one-to-one translation is often impractical. It's less about a literal code conversion and more about rebuilding the model using the PyTorch equivalent components and methodologies.

The core discrepancy arises from how Keras, acting as a high-level API, abstracts away much of the low-level tensor manipulation that PyTorch, a more research-oriented framework, exposes explicitly. Keras focuses on declarative model building, whereas PyTorch adopts an imperative, object-oriented approach. Keras sequential and functional APIs are geared towards layered models, while PyTorch relies on defining models as classes inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`, necessitating explicit forward pass definition.

The process can be broken down into several essential steps. Firstly, identify the Keras layer types used: convolutional layers (Conv2D, Conv1D), pooling layers (MaxPooling2D, AveragePooling1D), dense layers, activation functions, normalization layers, and potentially custom layers. For each identified layer, map its function to its corresponding PyTorch module in `torch.nn`. For instance, `keras.layers.Conv2D` translates to `torch.nn.Conv2d`, and `keras.layers.Dense` becomes `torch.nn.Linear`.

Secondly, pay meticulous attention to parameter initialization. Keras often employs sensible defaults for kernel initializations and biases, while PyTorch sometimes defaults to simpler initializers. Ensure that equivalent initialization strategies are utilized in PyTorch to achieve comparable training dynamics. This often requires explicitly defining initialization schemes, such as Xavier initialization, using `torch.nn.init`. Similarly, activation functions such as ReLU or Sigmoid may need to be explicitly defined as layers in PyTorch using `torch.nn.ReLU` and `torch.nn.Sigmoid`.

Thirdly, Keras handles data format using the channel-last convention (N, Height, Width, Channels) by default, while PyTorch defaults to channel-first (N, Channels, Height, Width). This disparity necessitates either transposing the tensors when they are inputted to the model, or modifying the PyTorch network's first layer parameters to accept channel-last tensors, which will also necessitate transposing of input data before being supplied to the network. I suggest the first approach as generally being less cumbersome.

Batch normalization, a common component, requires understanding subtle differences. Keras' `keras.layers.BatchNormalization` has different semantics and internal logic than `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d` (or `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`) and needs special attention. Specifically, running mean and variance accumulation during training, and the use of these statistics during inference, needs to be explicitly managed within a PyTorch model.

The model’s forward pass in PyTorch must be explicitly specified within the model’s class using the `forward` method. This is where the sequence of PyTorch modules, including activation functions, normalization layers, and pooling operations, is described. Also, consider utilizing `torch.nn.Sequential` for basic linear layer sequences to reduce code verbosity.

Lastly, Keras layers frequently incorporate additional parameters (like `padding='same'`) not explicitly present in their `torch.nn` counterparts, often necessitating the usage of padding functions from `torch.nn.functional` (e.g. `torch.nn.functional.pad`). Attention to these differences is critical for effective conversion.

Here are illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Simple Convolutional Layer Conversion**

```python
# Keras Version
import tensorflow as tf
keras_conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(28,28,3))

# PyTorch Version
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PyTorchConvLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super(PyTorchConvLayer, self).__init__()
      self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
      self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
      x = x.permute(0, 3, 1, 2) # Input Tensor is in NHWC format, convert to NCHW format
      x = self.conv(x)
      x = self.relu(x)
      return x

pytorch_conv = PyTorchConvLayer()

# Note: Input to keras_conv would be (None, 28, 28, 3). Input to pytorch_conv would be (None, 28, 28, 3)
# The padding='same' in Keras is equivalent to padding=1 when kernel_size is 3, because padding=(kernel-1)/2.
# Transposition of tensor input is done within the `forward` method for ease of use.

```
**Commentary:** In this snippet, `keras.layers.Conv2D` with a 'same' padding parameter is mapped to `torch.nn.Conv2d`. The input shape parameter, required in Keras, is not necessary in PyTorch’s `Conv2d`. Instead, the `in_channels` parameter sets the input channel dimension. `padding='same'` translates to `padding=1` in `torch.nn.Conv2d` due to an implicit calculation of padding amount for a convolution operation when the kernel is an odd number. Also note the transposition of tensors to accommodate the NCHW format.

**Example 2: Converting a Keras Sequential Model**

```python
# Keras Version
import tensorflow as tf
keras_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# PyTorch Version
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PyTorchModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super(PyTorchModel, self).__init__()
    self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3)
    self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)
    self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3)
    self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)
    self.fc = nn.Linear(64 * 14 * 14, 10)  # Adjusted size based on MaxPooling operations. Input shape is 64x64

  def forward(self, x):
    x = x.permute(0, 3, 1, 2) # Input is NHWC format, convert to NCHW
    x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
    x = self.pool1(x)
    x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
    x = self.pool2(x)
    x = x.view(-1, 64 * 14 * 14) # Flatten the output for the FC layer
    x = F.softmax(self.fc(x), dim=1) # Softmax along the class dimension, use F.softmax for numerical stability
    return x

pytorch_model = PyTorchModel()

# Note: Output tensor size of conv and pooling operations should be calculated to know what
# size the input to the fully connected dense layer needs to be. Padding is not added here, so input
# reduction will need to be calculated.
```
**Commentary:** This demonstrates a more complex, sequential Keras model's translation. The `tf.keras.models.Sequential` is explicitly created as a PyTorch model using `nn.Module` and its constituent layers, such as `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.MaxPool2d` and `nn.Linear`. The `forward` method now defines the forward pass utilizing `F.relu` as a functional form of ReLU and `F.softmax`, a numerically more stable implementation of the softmax function. An output size calculation of `14x14x64` is required since padding is set to the default `padding=0`.

**Example 3: Handling Batch Normalization**
```python
# Keras Version
import tensorflow as tf
keras_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
])


# PyTorch Version
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PyTorchModelBN(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super(PyTorchModelBN, self).__init__()
    self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3)
    self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(32)
    self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)

  def forward(self, x):
    x = x.permute(0, 3, 1, 2) # Input is NHWC format, convert to NCHW
    x = F.relu(self.conv(x))
    x = self.bn(x)
    x = self.pool(x)
    return x

pytorch_model_bn = PyTorchModelBN()

# Note: The pytorch BatchNormalization layers have an input requirement of NCHW data format.
# The equivalent keras BatchNormalization layer will receive NHWC tensors.
# The number of channels for the PyTorch Batch Normalization layer must match the output channels of the convolutional layer.

```
**Commentary:** This showcases the conversion of a Keras model that includes batch normalization. The `keras.layers.BatchNormalization` is mapped to `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`, which requires that the tensor input has the format NCHW. This example also demonstrates another situation where tensor transpositions need to be performed. The number of channels for the PyTorch `BatchNorm2d` layer has to match the number of output channels of the `Conv2d` layer.

For further understanding, consult the official PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections covering `torch.nn`, and the various tutorials available on the framework's official website. Books that focus on deep learning and PyTorch, such as those published by O’Reilly or Manning, would be of significant help for an in depth understanding. Additionally, accessing and engaging with online community forums, without direct links, that discuss PyTorch best practices and practical model migration scenarios can provide valuable real world insights. Utilizing publicly available example code of convolutional networks will aid in understanding framework specific best practices.
