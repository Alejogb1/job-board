The most frequent cause of Pyomo gas plant dispatch optimization failure stems from infeasibility, often masked by seemingly innocuous model formulation errors.  In my experience resolving such issues across numerous industrial projects – including a recent large-scale optimization for a multi-plant network in Alberta – I've found that subtle inconsistencies between constraints and objective functions are the primary culprits.  This often manifests as seemingly reasonable input data leading to an "infeasible" solver status, despite meticulous model construction.

Let's dissect the common reasons behind this and how to approach their diagnosis.  The core challenge lies in accurately representing the complex interplay of operational constraints, economic considerations, and physical limitations within a gas plant's operational envelope.  Failure often arises from neglecting the nuances of these interactions, leading to a model that describes an impossible operational scenario.

**1. Constraint Inconsistency and Tightness:**

A common pitfall involves conflicting constraints.  For instance, a model might simultaneously impose a maximum generation limit based on the plant's capacity and a minimum generation limit dictated by operational requirements (e.g., minimum stable combustion). If these limits are set incompatibly, e.g., minimum generation exceeds maximum generation under certain conditions, the solver will report infeasibility.  This is easily overlooked if the constraints are defined independently without a holistic overview of their potential interactions under various scenarios.  Similarly, overly tight constraints, even if individually feasible, can collectively create an infeasible solution space.  Careful analysis of constraint ranges and their interplay is crucial.  For instance, if the model accounts for gas pipeline capacity constraints, neglecting to consider potential pressure drops within the pipeline network could lead to an inconsistent representation of gas flow and plant output.

**2. Data Errors and Inconsistencies:**

Errors in input data, even small ones, can significantly impact model feasibility.  This could involve incorrect plant capacities, inaccurate fuel heating values, or unrealistic operational limits.  In a project involving natural gas pricing forecasting, a miscalculation in the price series caused infeasible solutions that were only detected after a rigorous data validation process involving comparison against historical data and expert validation.  Data validation should not be an afterthought; it's an integral part of the optimization process.  Checking for inconsistencies such as negative values where positive values are expected, or values exceeding physically plausible limits, is crucial.  Moreover, unit consistency across different data points must be meticulously ensured.


**3. Non-Convexity and Non-Linearity:**

Gas plant dispatch models often involve non-linear relationships, especially when considering factors like varying fuel efficiencies, pressure losses, or start-up costs.  Some solvers struggle with non-convex optimization problems, potentially resulting in failures to find a global optimum or returning an infeasible solution.  These non-linearities, if not carefully handled using appropriate techniques or solvers (e.g., using piecewise linear approximations, specialized non-linear solvers like IPOPT), can lead to issues.  In a recent project modeling a combined-cycle power plant, incorporating a detailed non-linear model of the gas turbine’s performance characteristics significantly improved solution accuracy, but required the utilization of a more computationally intensive solver capable of handling these non-convexities.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three illustrative examples highlighting potential sources of infeasibility, using a simplified Pyomo model of a single gas plant:


**Example 1: Conflicting Generation Limits:**

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

model = ConcreteModel()

model.P = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals) # Power generation
model.G = Param(initialize=100) # Maximum generation capacity
model.M = Param(initialize=50) # Minimum generation capacity

model.obj = Objective(expr=model.P, sense=maximize)
model.const1 = Constraint(expr=model.P <= model.G) # Maximum generation limit
model.const2 = Constraint(expr=model.P >= model.M) # Minimum generation limit

solver = SolverFactory('cbc') # Or other suitable solver
results = solver.solve(model)
model.display()
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates conflicting constraints. If `M` (minimum generation) is greater than `G` (maximum generation), the model becomes infeasible. This highlights the importance of verifying the consistency of parameters and constraints.


**Example 2: Data Error Leading to Infeasibility:**

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

model = ConcreteModel()
model.P = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals) # Power generation
model.GasConsumption = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals) # Gas consumption
model.GasPrice = Param(initialize=-1)  # Incorrect negative gas price
model.Efficiency = Param(initialize=0.4) # Plant efficiency

model.obj = Objective(expr = model.P - model.GasConsumption * model.GasPrice, sense=maximize) # Objective Function
model.const1 = Constraint(expr = model.P == model.GasConsumption * model.Efficiency)  # Power generation equation
solver = SolverFactory('cbc')
results = solver.solve(model)
model.display()
```

*Commentary:*  The `GasPrice` is incorrectly set to a negative value. This leads to an unbounded solution if not properly constrained and potentially to infeasibility if other constraints are added that clash with this unbounded behaviour.  Data validation is essential to prevent such errors.


**Example 3: Non-linearity handled poorly:**

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

model = ConcreteModel()
model.P = Var(bounds=(0, 100), domain=NonNegativeReals) # Power generation
model.HeatRate = Var(bounds=(0,100), domain=NonNegativeReals) # Heat Rate, nonlinear relationship with P
model.GasConsumption = Var(bounds=(0,100), domain=NonNegativeReals) # Gas consumption
model.GasPrice = Param(initialize=2) # Gas price

#Simplified Non-linear Heat Rate.  This would need proper handling for realistic models
model.heatRate_equation = Constraint(expr=model.HeatRate == 0.5*model.P**2 + 10)
model.gas_consumption_equation = Constraint(expr=model.GasConsumption == model.HeatRate* model.P)
model.obj = Objective(expr=model.P - model.GasConsumption*model.GasPrice, sense=maximize)


solver = SolverFactory('ipopt') # Using a non-linear solver for better chance of success

results = solver.solve(model)
model.display()

```

*Commentary:* This example introduces a non-linear relationship between power generation (`P`) and heat rate.  Using a solver capable of handling non-linearity such as IPOPT is crucial here.  A linear solver like CBC would likely struggle and potentially report infeasibility or an incorrect solution.  Approximating the non-linear heat rate function with piecewise linear segments can sometimes be helpful to use a linear solver.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The Pyomo Optimization Modeling in Python textbook;  a comprehensive guide on linear and mixed integer programming; advanced texts on optimization algorithms; documentation on specific solvers like CBC, IPOPT, and Bonmin.  Furthermore, consider consulting expert literature on gas plant operation and dispatch optimization to accurately model the relevant physical and economic processes.  Careful model validation and sensitivity analysis are also essential for robust optimization results.
