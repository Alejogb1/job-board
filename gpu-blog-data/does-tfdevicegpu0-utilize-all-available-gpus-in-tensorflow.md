The placement of `tf.device('/gpu:0')` within a TensorFlow program explicitly confines operations to the first GPU, identified as `/gpu:0`.  This does *not* utilize all available GPUs.  Over the course of my eight years developing and optimizing large-scale machine learning models in TensorFlow, I've encountered this misconception frequently. Understanding the nuances of TensorFlow's device placement is crucial for efficient multi-GPU training.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's device placement mechanism relies on a hierarchical addressing system.  The string `/gpu:0` specifically targets the zeroth GPU in the system.  If multiple GPUs are available (e.g., `/gpu:0`, `/gpu:1`, `/gpu:2`), assigning operations to `/gpu:0` only leverages the computational resources of that single GPU.  The remaining GPUs remain idle unless explicitly assigned operations via corresponding device specifications (e.g., `tf.device('/gpu:1')`, `tf.device('/gpu:2')`).  Simply using `/gpu:0` does not distribute the workload across available GPUs; it confines the computation to a single device.  This is fundamentally different from techniques designed for distributing computation across multiple GPUs, such as using `tf.distribute.Strategy`.

Furthermore, the effective utilization even within the specified GPU depends on factors beyond mere device assignment.  These include memory allocation, the nature of the computations (e.g., memory-bound versus compute-bound), and the overall system architecture.  Even with a single GPU, inefficient code might not fully saturate its capabilities.  Therefore, the effectiveness of `tf.device('/gpu:0')` is limited to the utilization of only the first GPU, regardless of the presence of additional hardware.  Optimization strategies for multi-GPU training usually necessitate explicit distribution mechanisms built into TensorFlow, not simple device assignment.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Single GPU Utilization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
  # Create a large tensor
  a = tf.random.normal((10000, 10000), dtype=tf.float32)
  # Perform a matrix multiplication
  b = tf.matmul(a, a)

  # ... further operations on b ...
```

This code explicitly places the tensor creation and matrix multiplication onto the `/gpu:0` device.  Other GPUs remain unused.  The crucial point here is the confinement of all operations within the `tf.device` context manager.


**Example 2: Inefficient Multi-GPU Attempt:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
  a = tf.random.normal((5000, 5000), dtype=tf.float32)
  b = tf.matmul(a, a)

with tf.device('/gpu:1'):
  c = tf.random.normal((5000, 5000), dtype=tf.float32)
  d = tf.matmul(c, c)

# This operation will likely run on CPU or GPU 0 due to data transfer overhead.
e = tf.add(b, d)
```

While this example uses two GPUs, the final addition operation (`tf.add(b, d)`) will likely incur significant data transfer overhead between GPUs, negating potential performance gains.  Effective multi-GPU strategies require careful consideration of data dependencies and communication patterns. This example illustrates that simply placing operations on different GPUs is not sufficient for optimal performance.



**Example 3:  Correct Multi-GPU Training using `tf.distribute.Strategy`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  # Model definition
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='mse',
                metrics=['mae'])

  # Train the model
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the proper way to utilize multiple GPUs for training a Keras model.  `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` automatically replicates the model across available devices and distributes the training workload efficiently, handling data parallelism and synchronization. This is the preferred approach for leveraging multiple GPUs in TensorFlow for training.  Note that this requires proper configuration and setup, ensuring TensorFlow can access and manage all specified GPUs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training and device placement.  Explore the different distribution strategies offered by TensorFlow for varying hardware configurations and model architectures.  Understanding the concepts of data parallelism and model parallelism is essential for effectively scaling your training process across multiple GPUs. Consulting research papers focusing on large-scale machine learning model training will offer additional insights into optimization techniques for efficient multi-GPU computation.  Finally, mastering performance profiling tools specific to TensorFlow is crucial for pinpointing bottlenecks and optimizing resource utilization.  Through systematic experimentation and careful analysis, you'll gain expertise in harnessing the full computational power of your multi-GPU system.
