Computation graphs, representing a sequence of operations on data, offer significant advantages in terms of optimization and reusability.  However, their effective reuse with varying input data requires careful consideration of the graph's structure and the mechanism for data injection. My experience optimizing large-scale machine learning models has highlighted the critical role of graph modularity and data-agnostic operation definitions in achieving this.  The key is to decouple the computational structure from the specific values being processed.

**1.  Explanation: Decoupling Data Flow from Graph Structure**

The core principle for reusing computation graphs with varying input data lies in designing the graph such that its nodes represent operations independent of the actual data values.  Instead of hardcoding input values within the graph, we utilize placeholders or symbolic representations that are populated with concrete data only during execution. This separation ensures that the graph's structure remains unchanged regardless of the input.

This approach is fundamental to many modern deep learning frameworks.  The graph itself is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, activation functions) and edges represent data dependencies.  These operations are defined in a way that they accept arbitrary tensor shapes as input, as long as the dimensions are compatible with the operation's requirements.  The framework then handles the efficient execution of the graph by optimizing the data flow and potentially performing operations in parallel.  The key is that the graph definition only describes *what* operations are performed, not *on what* specific data.

Crucially, we must distinguish between the graphâ€™s definition and its execution.  The graph definition is a static representation of the computation.  Execution involves providing concrete input data to the placeholders within this static graph.  The same graph definition can then be executed multiple times with different input data sets, leveraging the same optimized computational structure.

Efficient reuse hinges on leveraging features like:

* **Parameterization:**  Defining the graph with parameters (weights, biases in neural networks) allows for different data to influence the computation without altering the graph's topology.
* **Data-agnostic operations:** Employing operations that can handle varying input shapes (e.g., broadcasting, reshaping).
* **Input placeholders:** Defining symbolic input nodes that are populated during runtime with specific data.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate these concepts using a simplified, hypothetical framework.  The syntax is illustrative and not representative of any specific framework.


**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
# Graph Definition
graph = Graph()
x = graph.placeholder("x")  # Input placeholder
w = graph.parameter("w", shape=(1,)) # Weight parameter
b = graph.parameter("b", shape=(1,)) # Bias parameter
y_pred = graph.add(graph.multiply(x, w), b) # Prediction

# Execution with different inputs
input_data1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
output1 = graph.execute(y_pred, {x: input_data1})

input_data2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
output2 = graph.execute(y_pred, {x: input_data2})

print(f"Output 1: {output1}")
print(f"Output 2: {output2}")
```

This example demonstrates a simple linear regression model.  The graph is defined independently of any specific input.  The `placeholder` acts as a container for input data during execution, allowing us to run the same graph with different `input_data` sets.


**Example 2: Modular Graph Construction**

```python
# Define reusable modules
def relu_layer(x, num_neurons):
    weights = graph.parameter(f"weights_{num_neurons}", shape=(x.shape[-1], num_neurons))
    biases = graph.parameter(f"biases_{num_neurons}", shape=(num_neurons,))
    z = graph.matmul(x, weights) + biases
    return graph.relu(z)

# Build a larger graph using reusable modules
graph = Graph()
x = graph.placeholder("x", shape=(None, 10))
hidden1 = relu_layer(x, 20)
hidden2 = relu_layer(hidden1, 10)
output = relu_layer(hidden2, 1)


# Execution with varying input shapes
input_data1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
output1 = graph.execute(output, {x: input_data1})

input_data2 = np.random.rand(50, 10)
output2 = graph.execute(output, {x: input_data2})
```

This example showcases modularity.  The `relu_layer` function creates a reusable component.  Different layers can be composed to build complex graphs, facilitating reuse and maintainability. The input shape `(None, 10)` allows for different batch sizes.


**Example 3: Handling Variable-Length Sequences**

```python
# Graph for processing variable-length sequences
graph = Graph()
sequences = graph.placeholder("sequences", shape=(None, None, 10)) # Variable length sequences
lstm_cell = graph.LSTMCell(hidden_size=20) #Hypothetical LSTM cell
initial_state = graph.zeros((20,))
output_states = graph.dynamic_rnn(lstm_cell, sequences, initial_state)
final_output = graph.fully_connected(output_states[-1], 1) #Process final hidden state


# Execution with different sequence lengths
input_data1 = np.random.rand(5, 10, 10) # 5 sequences of length 10
output1 = graph.execute(final_output, {sequences: input_data1})

input_data2 = np.random.rand(2, 15, 10) #2 sequences of length 15
output2 = graph.execute(final_output, {sequences: input_data2})
```

This illustrates handling variable-length sequences, a common challenge in natural language processing and time-series analysis. The `None` dimension in the placeholder allows for sequences of varying lengths, demonstrating adaptability. The `dynamic_rnn` executes the LSTM for each sequence length efficiently.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend studying textbooks on numerical computation, linear algebra, and graph theory.  Specific attention should be paid to resources covering computational graph construction, automatic differentiation, and optimization techniques used in machine learning frameworks.  Exploration of the internal mechanisms of popular deep learning libraries will also prove invaluable.  Finally, studying papers on efficient graph representation and execution strategies would further enhance your understanding.
