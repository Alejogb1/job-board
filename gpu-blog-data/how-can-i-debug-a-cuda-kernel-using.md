Debugging CUDA kernels effectively, particularly with more complex code or when encountering subtle race conditions, demands a structured approach and a familiarity with the tools provided by NVIDIA Nsight.  I’ve spent considerable time profiling and debugging GPU code for scientific simulations, and understanding how to leverage Nsight’s features has been crucial for delivering performant applications.  The debugging process isn't simply about stepping through lines of code; it requires understanding how the GPU executes threads, memory access patterns, and the impact of warp execution.

The primary challenge with debugging CUDA kernels lies in their parallel nature. Traditional CPU debuggers are ill-suited for managing the massive number of threads executing simultaneously on the GPU. Nsight, however, bridges this gap by offering a specialized environment that understands the GPU architecture and allows for thread-level inspection.  It's important to realize that debugging performance and logic errors often requires different techniques and Nsight views. For pure logic errors, the Nsight Graphics debugger is more appropriate, while performance analysis relies heavily on Nsight Systems. For my focus here, I will primarily discuss the debugging aspects for logic errors using the Nsight Graphics debugger as its features are more relevant to this question, and is what most commonly requires meticulous use in development.

To begin debugging, you first need to configure your CUDA project to be compatible with the Nsight debugger. This usually involves ensuring that debugging symbols are included in your compiled code. Within your build system (whether it’s CMake, Visual Studio, or a Makefile), you’ll typically need to set compiler flags like `-g` or `-G` (for NVIDIA's NVCC compiler) to generate these debugging symbols. This ensures that Nsight can correctly map execution to your source code. Additionally, ensure that you are using a Debug build type since optimization levels can impact the debugging experience and may make tracing execution challenging.

Once configured, you can launch Nsight and connect to your application. Nsight can be launched independently of your IDE, and it then connects to your running application which you instruct to use its services. Typically, a process is launched which will attach to the CUDA context and allow you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and control execution on the GPU.  One crucial aspect when using the debugger is understanding the execution model of the GPU which affects where breakpoints are most effective. CUDA executes threads in warps (typically 32 threads on NVIDIA GPUs). When you set a breakpoint, it will halt all threads in the *same warp* when one thread hits the breakpoint; not every single thread. This is important to keep in mind because you’re effectively debugging “warp-synchronously”. Thus, when inspecting a variable, you’ll need to specify which *lane* (individual thread ID within a warp) you wish to examine.

I often find myself using the "CUDA Breakpoints" view within Nsight Graphics. This view allows setting breakpoints in your CUDA kernels similar to breakpoints you set in a CPU debugger. But, unlike traditional debuggers, you can also specify conditions for the breakpoint. For example, you could set a breakpoint that only triggers when the `threadIdx.x` is 0, effectively debugging only the first thread in each block. You can also set a breakpoint on a specific lane of a warp if you have a warp-divergence issue you want to analyze. I use this feature when tracking down race conditions where only some threads access a piece of shared memory in a specific way. The “CUDA Variables” view is used to inspect the contents of registers, shared memory, global memory, etc. on a per-thread basis.

Let's consider some practical examples.

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition with a Fault**

Suppose we have a CUDA kernel to perform simple vector addition with a bug:

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i + 1]; // Incorrect access: b[i+1]
    }
}
```

This kernel has an out-of-bounds access bug because `b[i+1]` can access beyond the bounds of the allocated memory if `i` is close to `n`. To debug this with Nsight:

1.  Set a breakpoint within the `if` statement. I normally set it just after the `i` assignment.
2.  Run the application. When the breakpoint is hit, Nsight will pause execution.
3.  Use the “CUDA Variables” view and inspect `i` and `n`. If `i` is close to `n`, the bug will be apparent.
4.  Inspect `a[i]` and `b[i+1]` and see where the out of bounds is occurring.
5.  Correct the code by changing `b[i+1]` to `b[i]`.

**Example 2: Race Condition in Shared Memory**

Let's consider a kernel that tries to accumulate values in shared memory, but does so incorrectly, creating a race condition:

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryAccumulate(float* input, float* output, int n) {
    __shared__ float sum[128];
    int i = threadIdx.x;
    sum[i] = 0.0f;
    __syncthreads(); // Barrier here

    for(int j = blockIdx.x; j < n; j+= gridDim.x) {
        atomicAdd(&sum[i], input[i + j*blockDim.x]); // Potential race condition
    }
    __syncthreads();
    if (i == 0) {
        for(int k = 0; k < blockDim.x; ++k) {
            output[blockIdx.x] += sum[k];
        }
    }
}
```

Here the `atomicAdd` is on the individual lanes with the same index `i`. The intent here is for each lane to sum data that is partitioned according to `blockIdx.x`. The issue here is that the initial zeroing of the `sum` variable is done in an improper fashion. The values of sum must be initialized *before* any work is done.  This kernel produces the correct answer, but the issue becomes apparent if the `for` loop is nested in an outer loop for multiple iterations, since `sum` is only ever initialized once.  To debug this with Nsight:

1.  Set a breakpoint before the `atomicAdd` line.
2.  Examine the value of `j` and `i` and notice the value of sum. If we step into multiple iterations the value of `sum` will change unexpectedly.
3.  Examine the value of `sum` after the for loop, to realize the issue.
4. Correct the code by setting `sum[i]` inside the `for` loop, setting it to zero on each iteration.

**Example 3: Divergent Control Flow**

Consider a kernel that experiences warp divergence:

```c++
__global__ void conditionalExecution(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        if(i % 2 == 0){
            c[i] = a[i] * 2.0f;
        }
         else {
            c[i] = b[i] / 2.0f;
        }
    }
}
```

This code branches based on if `i` is even or odd. Such branches cause warp divergence, reducing performance. While this may not cause a bug, it’s good to be aware of how Nsight identifies warp divergence:

1.  Set a breakpoint inside the conditional execution block.
2.  Run the application.
3.  Observe the “CUDA Warp State” view, which will show you how threads in the same warp are executing different branches. This is not necessarily a bug, but can impact performance if these branches cause the warp to become serialized.
4. Refactor the code to avoid this branch to improve performance if needed.

Beyond these examples, Nsight offers advanced features. The "Compute" view provides information about register usage, instruction counts, and memory access patterns on a per-thread basis. This is very useful for fine-tuning performance and identifying areas of inefficiency. Also, the “Memory Analysis” view helps to analyze memory access patterns and detect potential coalescing issues. Being familiar with these views is essential for advanced performance debugging and optimization. I often use the memory analysis view to track down issues with read/write operations on shared memory or global memory, making sure that the memory requests for each warp is indeed a coalesced one.

For further learning about CUDA debugging, I would recommend exploring resources such as NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections on debugging and performance analysis.  Also, books like "CUDA Programming: A Developer's Guide to Parallel Computing with GPUs" provide a comprehensive overview of GPU programming concepts, including debugging techniques.  Finally, NVIDIA’s developer forums are an invaluable resource for solving specific issues and learning from the community. The debugger, in my experience, has evolved substantially with each release, and staying up-to-date with the documentation is critical. The more time spent exploring the tool and applying it to different scenarios, the more comfortable and efficient you will be at using it.
