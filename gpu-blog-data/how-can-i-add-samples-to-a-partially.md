Adding samples to a partially trained PyTorch model necessitates a nuanced understanding of the training process and the model's architecture.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects at a previous firm underscored the importance of incremental training rather than retraining from scratch when adding new data.  Simply appending the new data to the existing training set and restarting training is often inefficient and can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses performance on previously learned data.  The optimal approach depends on several factors, including the size of the new dataset, the model's architecture, and the desired performance trade-offs.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core strategy for adding samples involves resuming the training process with the augmented dataset. This requires careful management of the optimizer's state, the learning rate, and potentially the model's architecture if the new data introduces new classes or features.  Directly loading the previously saved model weights is crucial.  We avoid retraining from scratch, preserving the knowledge acquired during the initial training phase.

The approach's success hinges on judicious learning rate scheduling.  A significantly smaller learning rate than the one used in the initial training is typically required to fine-tune the model's weights without disrupting the previously learned representations.  Too large a learning rate risks overwriting the existing weights and undermining the model's initial performance.

Furthermore, the new samples should ideally be carefully integrated into the training data loader. Techniques like stratified sampling can ensure a representative mix of old and new data across training epochs, preventing biases towards the newly added data. The batch size should be carefully considered; overly large batches might overwhelm the model with new information, while smaller batches may not provide sufficient updates.

Finally, regular validation on a hold-out dataset is essential to monitor the model's performance on both the old and new data. This enables early stopping if the model's overall performance degrades, avoiding potential overfitting to the added samples.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Resuming Training with a Reduced Learning Rate**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Load pre-trained model and optimizer state
model = torch.load('model_checkpoint.pth')['model']
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5) # Significantly reduced learning rate
optimizer.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_checkpoint.pth')['optimizer'])

# Load new data
new_data = torch.randn(1000, 784) # Example: 1000 samples, 784 features
new_labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,)) # Example: 10 classes
new_dataset = TensorDataset(new_data, new_labels)
new_loader = DataLoader(new_dataset, batch_size=64)

# Combine old and new data loaders (if necessary)
# ... code to combine old and new loaders ...

# Resume training
model.train()
for epoch in range(10): # Reduced number of epochs
    for inputs, labels in new_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Save the updated model
torch.save({'model': model, 'optimizer': optimizer}, 'updated_model.pth')
```

This example demonstrates resuming training with a significantly reduced learning rate.  The pre-trained model and optimizer states are loaded, and the new data is processed via a DataLoader. The number of training epochs is also reduced, further mitigating the risk of overfitting to the new data.  Crucially, I've emphasized the importance of saving the updated model for future use.  I would typically include more sophisticated validation steps here, omitted for brevity.


**Example 2: Incremental Training with a Learning Rate Scheduler**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

# ... (Load pre-trained model, optimizer, and new data as in Example 1) ...

# Use a learning rate scheduler
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min', patience=2, factor=0.1)

# Resume training with learning rate scheduling
model.train()
for epoch in range(20):
    for inputs, labels in combined_loader: # Assuming old and new loaders are combined
        # ... (Training loop as in Example 1) ...
    scheduler.step(loss) # Update learning rate based on validation loss

# ... (Save updated model) ...
```

This example utilizes a learning rate scheduler (`ReduceLROnPlateau`), dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on the validation loss. This adaptive approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model efficiently learns from the new data without discarding previously acquired knowledge.  The patience and factor parameters are tuned according to the specific situation and the characteristics of the dataset.


**Example 3: Handling New Classes with Feature Extraction and Fine-tuning**

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# Load pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet)
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = torch.nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10 + 5) # Add 5 new classes

# Freeze initial layers
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
for param in model.fc.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True # Only fine-tune the new fully connected layer

# ... (Load new data, including samples from new classes) ...

# ... (Train only the new fully connected layer with a small learning rate) ...
```

This example addresses the situation where the new samples introduce new classes.  A pre-trained model is loaded, and the final fully connected layer is modified to accommodate the increased number of classes. Importantly, the initial layers of the pre-trained model are frozen, preventing disruption of the existing feature extractors.  Only the new fully connected layer is trained with a low learning rate, allowing for efficient adaptation to the new classes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation is an indispensable resource.  Deep learning textbooks focusing on practical applications provide valuable theoretical background and insights.  Research papers on transfer learning and incremental learning techniques offer more specialized knowledge for complex scenarios.  Finally, attending workshops and conferences focused on deep learning and PyTorch can significantly enhance understanding and skills in these areas.  These resources will significantly assist in addressing more complex scenarios and in troubleshooting potential issues.
