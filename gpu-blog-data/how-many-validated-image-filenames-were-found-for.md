The core challenge in determining the count of validated image filenames per class lies in the inherent ambiguity of "validated."  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects at Xylos Corp. highlighted the crucial role of rigorous data validation procedures, often involving multiple stages and criteria.  Therefore, a straightforward file count is insufficient; we must define the validation criteria first before proceeding to the quantification.  My approach involves a three-stage process: defining validation criteria, implementing a validation function, and finally, performing the aggregation.

**1. Defining Validation Criteria:**

The definition of a "validated" image filename is project-specific and depends on several factors. In my previous work, validation encompassed several checks:

* **File Existence:** The file must physically exist in the designated directory. Missing files, often due to corrupted downloads or data transfer errors, are common issues.
* **File Format:** The file must adhere to expected image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .jpeg).  Unexpected formats often indicate errors in the data acquisition or labeling process.
* **File Size:**  Images below a certain size threshold might be considered invalid, possibly representing corrupted or incomplete images.  Conversely, excessively large files may warrant investigation.
* **Metadata Integrity:**  If metadata (e.g., EXIF data) is crucial, validation should incorporate checks for its presence and consistency with expected values.  For example, incorrect geolocation data or timestamps could invalidate the image.
* **Class Label Consistency:** The filename should follow a predefined naming convention reflecting its class label.  Inconsistencies here often signal errors in the data labeling or organization.

The specific criteria will dictate the implementation of the validation function.

**2. Implementing a Validation Function:**

The following code examples demonstrate how to implement the validation process using Python.  They assume a directory structure where each class is represented by a subdirectory containing the images.  Each example represents a progressively more robust approach:

**Example 1: Basic File Existence and Format Check:**

```python
import os
import pathlib

def validate_images_basic(class_dir):
    """
    Basic validation: Checks for file existence and format.
    """
    valid_count = 0
    allowed_formats = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'}
    for filename in os.listdir(class_dir):
        filepath = os.path.join(class_dir, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath) and pathlib.Path(filepath).suffix.lower() in allowed_formats:
            valid_count += 1
    return valid_count


# Example usage:
class_directory = "/path/to/images/class_A"
valid_images = validate_images_basic(class_directory)
print(f"Number of validated images in {class_directory}: {valid_images}")
```

This example only checks for file existence and a limited set of allowed file formats.  It lacks checks for file size or metadata.

**Example 2: Incorporating File Size and Metadata Check (Illustrative):**

```python
import os
import pathlib
from PIL import Image

def validate_images_advanced(class_dir, min_size_kb=10): #Added minimum file size
    """
    Advanced validation: Includes file size and metadata checks (Illustrative).
    """
    valid_count = 0
    allowed_formats = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'}
    for filename in os.listdir(class_dir):
        filepath = os.path.join(class_dir, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath) and pathlib.Path(filepath).suffix.lower() in allowed_formats:
            try:
                img = Image.open(filepath)
                file_size_kb = os.path.getsize(filepath) / 1024
                if file_size_kb >= min_size_kb: #Check minimum size
                    #Illustrative metadata check - adapt as needed
                    if 'width' in img.info and 'height' in img.info:
                        valid_count += 1
                    else:
                        print(f"Warning: Missing metadata in {filename}")
                else:
                    print(f"Warning: File size too small for {filename}")

            except IOError as e:
                print(f"Error processing {filename}: {e}")
    return valid_count

# Example usage:
class_directory = "/path/to/images/class_A"
valid_images = validate_images_advanced(class_directory)
print(f"Number of validated images in {class_directory}: {valid_images}")
```

Example 2 adds a check for minimum file size and an illustrative metadata check (replace with your specific metadata requirements). Error handling is included to manage potential exceptions.


**Example 3:  Class Label Consistency Check (Illustrative):**

```python
import os
import re

def validate_images_class_label(class_dir, class_label):
    """
    Validation including class label consistency check.
    """
    valid_count = 0
    pattern = re.compile(rf"{class_label}_.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png)", re.IGNORECASE)  #Adjust regex as needed

    for filename in os.listdir(class_dir):
        if pattern.match(filename):
            filepath = os.path.join(class_dir, filename)
            if os.path.isfile(filepath):
                valid_count+=1
            else:
                print(f"File not found: {filepath}")
        else:
            print(f"Filename does not match expected pattern: {filename}")

    return valid_count

#Example Usage
class_directory = "/path/to/images/class_A"
class_label = "classA" #Adjust to match filename convention
valid_images = validate_images_class_label(class_directory, class_label)
print(f"Number of validated images in {class_directory}: {valid_images}")
```

This example incorporates a regular expression to verify that filenames match a predefined pattern incorporating the class label.  This is crucial for ensuring data integrity and preventing misclassifications.  Remember to adjust the regular expression according to your specific naming conventions.


**3. Aggregation:**

Once the validation function is defined, iterating through each class directory and applying the validation function provides the count of validated images per class.  This could be implemented using a loop and a dictionary to store the results:

```python
import os

class_directories = ["/path/to/images/class_A", "/path/to/images/class_B", "/path/to/images/class_C"]
validation_results = {}

for class_dir in class_directories:
    class_name = os.path.basename(class_dir) #Extract class name from directory path
    valid_count = validate_images_advanced(class_dir) #Use chosen validation function
    validation_results[class_name] = valid_count

print(validation_results)
```

This code snippet iterates through the class directories, calls the chosen validation function (in this instance, `validate_images_advanced`), and stores the results in a dictionary.  This approach allows for efficient aggregation and reporting of the validated image counts per class.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For robust image processing, consider exploring the Pillow library. For regular expression handling, Python's built-in `re` module is sufficient.  A comprehensive understanding of file system operations in Python is also necessary.  Consult relevant documentation for these libraries and modules. Remember to adapt the provided code to your specific project requirements and validation criteria.  Thorough testing and error handling are critical for reliable results in real-world scenarios.
