The selection of the optimal input dimension for a Conv2D-LSTM architecture, particularly the dimensionality entering the LSTM layer, is highly contextual and does not admit a single universally "optimal" value. It's a balancing act between information preservation, computational efficiency, and the specific characteristics of your data and task. I've navigated this problem multiple times during my work on video analysis projects, specifically with tasks ranging from gesture recognition to anomaly detection in surveillance feeds. My observations, derived both empirically and through a theoretical lens, consistently highlight that the input dimension to the LSTM shouldn't be a direct replica of the spatial dimensions of the convolutional output. Rather, it often requires careful manipulation and often benefits from being significantly smaller.

Fundamentally, the Conv2D layers are feature extractors, and these extracted features are, typically, what we want to process temporally with the LSTM. If the output of a convolutional layer is, say, a feature map of 64x64x32 (width x height x number of channels), feeding the entire 64x64x32 tensor directly into an LSTM unit would be highly inefficient and, in many cases, detrimental to performance. LSTMs, despite their ability to handle sequential data, are fundamentally designed to process vectors, not multidimensional tensors. The sheer number of parameters within the LSTM required to handle such a high-dimensional input often leads to overfitting and extended training times.

The optimal input dimension, therefore, is not the raw spatial output of the Conv2D layers but rather a distilled representation, typically achieved via techniques such as flattening and further dimensionality reduction. Consider this flow: convolutional layers -> feature maps -> flattening -> optional dimensionality reduction -> LSTM. Let's dissect that further:

First, convolutional layers extract spatially relevant information. The output, feature maps, represent spatial patterns in a multi-channel format. The next critical step involves flattening this multi-dimensional output into a single vector. Let's assume our hypothetical 64x64x32 feature map. Flattening this gives us a vector of length 64 * 64 * 32 = 131,072. This vector contains all spatial information, encoded channel by channel, ready for sequential processing.

However, as noted earlier, feeding 131,072 features directly into an LSTM isn't wise. Hence, I routinely employ strategies to reduce this vector's dimension. The crucial aspect here is not to arbitrarily reduce the size but to preserve the most informative parts of the feature vector. Two techniques have proven consistently effective in my experience:

1.  **Global Average Pooling (GAP):** GAP replaces each feature map with the average value across the spatial dimensions. The benefit of GAP is its simplicity; the resulting vector's length corresponds to the number of channels of the feature map which is usually much smaller. For example, the 64x64x32 feature maps will result in 32 output vector size after a GAP layer, which is significant reduction compared to flattening directly. It is a very compact representation of feature maps.

2.  **Fully Connected Layers (FCL):** After flattening the feature map, a FCL, also known as a dense layer, can be used for explicit dimensionality reduction. Here, I typically design a layer that maps the large flattened vector to a significantly smaller dimension via a weight matrix followed by a non-linear activation function. The dimension of the output vector of FCL can be set to any desired dimension.

The choice between these methods depends on the desired level of granularity in feature aggregation. GAP collapses all spatial information into single scalars per channel and it discards spatial detail. FCL retains all the information from the flattened vector while mapping it to desired dimensions with an aim to discard redundant or less relevant information.

Here are some code examples to further illustrate:

**Example 1: Using Global Average Pooling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConvLSTM_GAP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, conv_filters, lstm_hidden_size, lstm_layers):
        super(ConvLSTM_GAP, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, conv_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.global_avg_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))  # Output is (1, 1, channels)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(conv_filters, lstm_hidden_size, num_layers=lstm_layers, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x is of shape (batch_size, seq_len, input_channels, height, width)
        batch_size, seq_len, _, h, w = x.size()
        x = x.view(batch_size * seq_len, _, h, w) # Combine batch and sequence for spatial feature extraction
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.global_avg_pool(x) # (batch_size * seq_len, conv_filters, 1, 1)
        x = x.squeeze(3).squeeze(2) # (batch_size * seq_len, conv_filters)
        x = x.view(batch_size, seq_len, -1) # Reshape for LSTM input (batch_size, seq_len, conv_filters)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        return out # (batch_size, seq_len, lstm_hidden_size)
```

In this example, the `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` layer reduces each spatial feature map to a single scalar, resulting in a vector whose size is equal to the number of convolutional filters. This vector serves as the input to the LSTM. This approach is very compact, suitable for data with less spatial variability and strong channel-wise correlations.

**Example 2: Using Fully Connected Layer for Dimensionality Reduction**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConvLSTM_FCL(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, conv_filters, lstm_hidden_size, lstm_layers, fc_units=128):
        super(ConvLSTM_FCL, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, conv_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten(start_dim=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64*64*conv_filters, fc_units)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(fc_units, lstm_hidden_size, num_layers=lstm_layers, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x is of shape (batch_size, seq_len, input_channels, height, width)
        batch_size, seq_len, _, h, w = x.size()
        x = x.view(batch_size * seq_len, _, h, w) # Combine batch and sequence for spatial feature extraction
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.flatten(x) # (batch_size * seq_len,  64*64*conv_filters) Assuming 64x64 feature map for simplicity.
        x = self.fc(x) # (batch_size * seq_len, fc_units)
        x = x.view(batch_size, seq_len, -1) # Reshape for LSTM input (batch_size, seq_len, fc_units)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        return out  #(batch_size, seq_len, lstm_hidden_size)
```

Here, the `Flatten` layer converts the feature map into a single vector. Subsequently, a `Linear` layer (the FC layer) reduces the dimension to a pre-defined size using a learned weights, often less than half of the original flattened vector size, and the resulting dimension is used as the input size to the LSTM. I often find this technique works well when intricate features must be kept.

**Example 3: Combining Both**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConvLSTM_Hybrid(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, conv_filters, lstm_hidden_size, lstm_layers, fc_units=64):
        super(ConvLSTM_Hybrid, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, conv_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.global_avg_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten(start_dim=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(conv_filters, fc_units)  # Reduce dimension from GAP output
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(fc_units, lstm_hidden_size, num_layers=lstm_layers, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, seq_len, _, h, w = x.size()
        x = x.view(batch_size * seq_len, _, h, w)
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.global_avg_pool(x) # (batch_size * seq_len, conv_filters, 1, 1)
        x = x.squeeze(3).squeeze(2) # (batch_size * seq_len, conv_filters)
        x = self.fc(x)  # Dimension reduction to fc_units
        x = x.view(batch_size, seq_len, -1)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        return out
```

This combines both a GAP and a FC layer for further refinement. The idea here is to keep a compact representation of the feature maps using GAP and to perform an additional learned non-linear transformation to obtain the input to the LSTM.

In summary, there's no magic number. The "optimal" input dimension to an LSTM within a Conv2D-LSTM architecture is highly specific to your data, task, and computational budget. Experimenting with dimensionality reduction via Global Average Pooling, fully connected layers, or a combination of the two, is imperative to reach optimal performance.

For further understanding, I would suggest exploring resources on convolutional neural network architectures, particularly VGGNet, ResNet and their applications for feature extraction. Textbooks on sequence modeling and recurrent neural networks can provide detailed information on LSTM internals, and it is very beneficial to consult resources that focus on time series forecasting and time series analysis. These materials, combined with diligent experimentation, should guide you towards determining the ideal input dimensions for your specific Conv2D-LSTM needs.
