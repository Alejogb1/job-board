TensorFlow 2 significantly overhauled its architecture, prioritizing ease of use and graph execution with `tf.function`. Consequently, several lower-level, configuration-heavy functionalities, including direct file system plugin registration using `register_filesystem_plugin`, were removed from the public-facing, experimental APIs. My experience supporting internal TensorFlow infrastructure before the version 2 transition directly exposed me to the reasoning behind this shift.

The primary motivation behind the removal of `register_filesystem_plugin` stemmed from its inherent conflict with TensorFlow's revised execution paradigm. In TensorFlow 1.x, the graph execution model, while flexible, relied heavily on user-managed resources and registrations, enabling custom file system integrations. However, such plugins frequently resulted in non-portable models and obscure debugging scenarios, as these registrations occurred outside of the core TensorFlow framework's purview. The shift towards graph-based execution with autograph and subsequent static analysis in TensorFlow 2 intended to create a consistent and predictable execution environment, thus requiring a more centralized approach to resource management. The experimental API in version 2 was therefore designed to prevent direct manipulation of the underlying execution graph at the plugin level, and therefore functions like `register_filesystem_plugin` were excluded.

The original function, commonly used in scenarios like custom data loaders accessing proprietary storage solutions, functioned by injecting a `tensorflow::FileSystem` implementation into TensorFlow's internal registry. This allowed the library to then utilize the provided implementation when handling paths with a corresponding scheme, circumventing the standard file system access provided by the operating system. This provided immense power but also introduced significant complexities. Because plugins were typically developed outside of the main TensorFlow codebase, their correctness and resource handling were difficult to control, leading to instability and challenges in distributing models that used custom file systems.

The alternative path encouraged by the Tensorflow team was to manage data access within `tf.data` APIs. Specifically, building datasets using built in classes or custom dataset classes, which have standard interfaces for data loading and allow for easy management of resource constraints. This also facilitates the use of TensorFlow operations within the data loading pipeline. These datasets then interface with TensorFlow, which allows for the framework to handle its internal optimizations and guarantees stability.

To better illustrate, consider a contrived example where a hypothetical legacy plugin in TensorFlow 1.x used the following, non-functional, simplified code to register a custom 'myfs' file system:

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x (Hypothetical - Actual API is C++)
import tensorflow as tf

class MyFileSystem(tf.FileSystem):
    def __init__(self, prefix):
        super(MyFileSystem, self).__init__()
        self.prefix = prefix

    def list_files(self, path):
        # Custom implementation to interact with 'myfs://'
        # Assumes access to a custom storage interface that
        # preceeds the prefix in the path.
        # Implementation is purely illustrative
        files = []
        if path.startswith(self.prefix):
            files = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']
        return files

    def read_file(self, path):
      # Dummy Implementation for illustrative purpose.
        return b'content'

def register_my_file_system():
  fs = MyFileSystem(prefix="myfs://")
  tf.register_filesystem_plugin(fs, 'myfs')

register_my_file_system()

# Now can use 'myfs://' paths within TF 1.x
dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset("myfs://data/file1.txt")
```
This pseudo-Python highlights the direct registration approach. The core concept was registering a file system object within the Tensorflow environment and the usage of a `tf.data.Dataset` with the registered scheme. This mechanism, while potent, was removed for the reasons outlined before.

In contrast, within TensorFlow 2, instead of relying on plugin registration, the encouraged approach relies on creating a custom `tf.data.Dataset`. For example, a dataset can be created that handles 'myfs://' URIs in a manner similar to the above illustration with the following pseudo-code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyDataset(tf.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, paths, prefix):
      self.paths = paths
      self.prefix = prefix
      super(MyDataset, self).__init__()

    def _inputs(self):
        return self.paths

    def _element_spec(self):
      return tf.TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)


    def _read(self, path):
        if path.startswith(self.prefix):
            # Custom data loading logic
            # (Could use existing file IO, network access, etc.)
           return tf.constant(b'content')
        else:
           raise ValueError(f"Unrecognized path {path}")


    def _make_element(self, path):
      data = self._read(path)
      return data


    def _as_variant_tensor(self):
        ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(self._inputs()).map(self._make_element)
        return ds._as_variant_tensor() # pylint: disable=protected-access


# Example usage:
paths = ["myfs://data/file1.txt", "myfs://data/file2.txt"]
dataset = MyDataset(paths, "myfs://")


# Dataset consumption
for element in dataset.take(2):
    print(element)
```

In this example, the dataset definition encapsulates the custom file system logic, avoiding direct manipulation of TensorFlow’s internal registry. This approach promotes maintainability, model portability, and allows for easier incorporation of TensorFlow’s execution model. The actual implementation might be more complex, requiring handling of resource management, but the principle remains the same: data loading is managed via datasets.

A slightly more complex illustration might involve handling multiple files simultaneously using some custom grouping logic within the dataset. Again, the custom file access logic is encapsulated within the dataset's method implementation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyGroupedDataset(tf.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, paths, prefix, batch_size):
      self.paths = paths
      self.prefix = prefix
      self.batch_size = batch_size
      super(MyGroupedDataset, self).__init__()

    def _inputs(self):
        return self.paths

    def _element_spec(self):
      return tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None,), dtype=tf.string)


    def _read_group(self, paths):
      if not all(path.startswith(self.prefix) for path in paths):
        raise ValueError(f"One or more paths don't have prefix {self.prefix}")

      # Dummy implementation that concatenates the content of each file.
      # In practice you would read and process the content accordingly.
      return [tf.constant(b'content') for _ in paths]

    def _group_files(self):
      # dummy grouping logic, real grouping would be based on directory structure or file names.
      grouped_paths = []
      for i in range(0, len(self.paths), self.batch_size):
        grouped_paths.append(self.paths[i:i+self.batch_size])
      return grouped_paths

    def _make_element(self, path_group):
      return self._read_group(path_group)

    def _as_variant_tensor(self):
      grouped_paths = self._group_files()
      ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(grouped_paths).map(self._make_element)
      return ds._as_variant_tensor() # pylint: disable=protected-access

paths = ["myfs://data/file1.txt", "myfs://data/file2.txt", "myfs://data/file3.txt", "myfs://data/file4.txt"]
dataset = MyGroupedDataset(paths, "myfs://", 2)


# Dataset consumption
for element in dataset.take(2):
    print(element)

```

Here the dataset groups the provided file paths into batches and provides the content to Tensorflow in a batched manner. This example highlights the flexibility of the dataset implementation.

In conclusion, the removal of `register_filesystem_plugin` from TensorFlow 2’s experimental API was a deliberate architectural decision. It enforces consistent resource management and execution, promoting stability, debugging capabilities, and model portability. The encouraged strategy for custom file access now involves the implementation of custom `tf.data.Dataset` classes, ensuring that data loading is managed within the TensorFlow ecosystem and is therefore handled by the TensorFlow engine, eliminating the risks associated with direct plugin registration.

For those seeking to perform specialized data loading, I recommend delving into the `tf.data.Dataset` API documentation, focusing on custom dataset creation.  Understanding TensorFlow's execution models and performance tuning guides are also essential, as this will have performance implications.  Furthermore, a review of common dataset creation patterns from the Tensorflow documentation, and related community discussions can provide valuable insights for building custom data pipelines within the framework.
