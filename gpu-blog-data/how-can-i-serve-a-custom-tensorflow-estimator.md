Serving a custom TensorFlow Estimator in versions 1.10 and above requires a nuanced understanding of the `SavedModel` format and the TensorFlow Serving infrastructure.  My experience developing and deploying large-scale machine learning models for a major financial institution highlighted the critical role of efficient model serving, particularly when dealing with custom estimators.  The key is to understand that the Estimator API itself isn't directly served; instead, we export the trained model's graph and variables as a `SavedModel`, which TensorFlow Serving then loads and executes.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The TensorFlow Estimator API simplifies model building, but deployment necessitates a different approach.  The Estimator's `export_savedmodel()` method is crucial.  This function takes a `serving_input_receiver_fn` as an argument.  This function defines how input data will be received and preprocessed by the served model.  Crucially, this function must map the input data to the tensors expected by your model's `model_fn`.  Failure to correctly define this function is a common source of deployment errors.  The output of `export_savedmodel()` is a directory containing the model's graph definition and variable values, structured according to the `SavedModel` protocol buffer.  This directory can then be loaded and served using TensorFlow Serving.  The `serving_input_receiver_fn` is pivotal in this process because it bridges the gap between the external input format expected by the serving system and the internal tensor representations used by your model.  The key to success is ensuring seamless data transformation from the served input to the format expected by your `model_fn`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Regression Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # Simple linear regression
    W = tf.get_variable("W", [1], dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.get_variable("b", [1], dtype=tf.float32)
    prediction = tf.add(tf.multiply(features['x'], W), b)

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(prediction - labels))

    optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(params['learning_rate'])
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())

    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(
        mode=mode,
        predictions={"prediction": prediction},
        loss=loss,
        train_op=train_op
    )

def serving_input_receiver_fn():
    inputs = {'x': tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None,1], name='input_x')}
    return tf.estimator.export.ServingInputReceiver(inputs, inputs)

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn, params={'learning_rate': 0.01})

# ... training code ...

estimator.export_savedmodel("./exported_model", serving_input_receiver_fn)
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a straightforward linear regression model. The `serving_input_receiver_fn` creates a placeholder for the input feature 'x'.  This placeholder is then directly passed as both input and output to maintain a simple mapping. The key is that the `input_x` placeholder in the `serving_input_receiver_fn` must match the name used to access features within the `model_fn`.


**Example 2:  Model with Preprocessing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # Model with feature scaling
    scaled_features = tf.divide(features['x'], params['scaling_factor'])
    # ... rest of your model ...

def serving_input_receiver_fn():
    x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None,1], name='input_x')
    scaled_x = tf.divide(x, 10.0) # Scaling done during serving
    receiver_tensors = {'input_x': x}
    features = {'x': scaled_x}
    return tf.estimator.export.ServingInputReceiver(features, receiver_tensors)

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn, params={'scaling_factor': 10.0, 'learning_rate':0.01})
# ... training code ...

estimator.export_savedmodel("./exported_model", serving_input_receiver_fn)
```

*Commentary:* Here, preprocessing (feature scaling) is incorporated.  The `serving_input_receiver_fn` scales the input before passing it to the model. This avoids the need for scaling logic within the `model_fn` itself, keeping the model definition clean and focusing on the prediction logic. This example is more realistic for production scenarios where preprocessing steps might be computationally expensive. Note that the 'x' tensor is still defined in the `serving_input_receiver_fn` as the input tensor `receiver_tensors`, but the scaled version of 'x' is passed as the feature to the `model_fn`.

**Example 3:  Multi-Input Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # Model with multiple input features
    combined_features = tf.concat([features['x'], features['y']], axis=1)
    # ... rest of your model ...

def serving_input_receiver_fn():
    x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None,1], name='input_x')
    y = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None,1], name='input_y')
    receiver_tensors = {'input_x': x, 'input_y': y}
    features = {'x': x, 'y': y}
    return tf.estimator.export.ServingInputReceiver(features, receiver_tensors)

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn, params={'learning_rate': 0.01})
# ... training code ...

estimator.export_savedmodel("./exported_model", serving_input_receiver_fn)
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates a model that accepts multiple input features.  The `serving_input_receiver_fn` defines placeholders for each input and maps them to the feature dictionary expected by the `model_fn`.  This demonstrates handling more complex input structures, essential for real-world applications.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel and TensorFlow Serving are invaluable.  Understanding the intricacies of the `SavedModel` protocol buffer is crucial for advanced troubleshooting.  Deeply familiarizing yourself with the TensorFlow Serving API, particularly the configuration options, will significantly benefit deployment.  Finally, investing time in understanding best practices for model serialization and deployment will yield significant gains in efficiency and reliability.  These resources will provide the necessary background and guidance for effectively deploying and managing your custom TensorFlow Estimators.
