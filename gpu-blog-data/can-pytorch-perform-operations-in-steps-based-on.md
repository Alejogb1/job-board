PyTorch's ability to perform operations in a step-wise manner based on batch size is fundamentally tied to its data loading and model architecture.  It doesn't inherently possess a "step" mechanism separate from iteration through a data loader, but its flexibility allows for highly controlled, batch-size-dependent computation through careful management of data input and model execution.  I've encountered this need numerous times in my work on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects, often involving custom training loops for optimization.  My experience reveals that achieving step-wise operation hinges on how you structure your data handling and model forward/backward passes.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's core strength lies in its tensor operations and automatic differentiation.  While there isn't a built-in "step" function explicitly tied to batch size, the desired functionality is achieved by iterating over your dataset using a `DataLoader`. This `DataLoader` yields batches of specified size.  Each batch processed within a training loop constitutes a "step."  The size of the batch dictates the amount of data processed in each step, directly influencing computation time and memory usage.  Consequently, controlling the batch size indirectly controls the granularity of your step-wise operations.  Further control comes from utilizing features like gradient accumulation, which allows for effective batch sizes larger than available GPU memory by accumulating gradients over multiple smaller batches before performing a single optimization step.

Crucially, the "step" isn't inherently tied to a single forward and backward pass through your model.  A single "step" might involve multiple forward and backward passes if gradient accumulation is employed.  Conversely,  a single forward/backward pass may constitute multiple "steps" if dealing with extremely small batch sizes within a larger training loop.  Therefore, defining "step" within the context of PyTorch necessitates clarity on how data is fed and gradients are handled.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Standard Training Loop with Batch-Size-Dependent Steps:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Generate sample data
X = torch.randn(1000, 10)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1)
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)

# Initialize model, optimizer, and loss function
model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
        # Each iteration of this loop constitutes a "step"
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Step: {i+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example demonstrates a basic training loop. Each iteration over the `dataloader` processes a batch of size 32.  Each iteration represents a single "step" in this context. The `batch_size` parameter in the `DataLoader` directly determines the number of data points processed per step.


**Example 2:  Gradient Accumulation for Effectively Larger Batch Sizes:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# ... (Model, data, optimizer, loss function definition as in Example 1) ...

# Gradient accumulation parameters
accumulation_steps = 4
batch_size = 8  # Smaller batch size for demonstration

# Training loop with gradient accumulation
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels) / accumulation_steps # Normalize loss
        loss.backward()

        if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:  # Perform optimization every 4 steps
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Step: {i+1}, Loss: {loss.item() * accumulation_steps}") #Un-normalize loss for output
        else:
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Accumulating gradients, Step:{i+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```

Here, gradient accumulation simulates a larger effective batch size (32) using smaller batches (8).  The optimization step (`optimizer.step()`) is performed only after accumulating gradients over `accumulation_steps` (4 smaller batches). Each optimization step, though encompassing multiple forward/backward passes, still represents a single "step" in the broader training process.

**Example 3: Manual Batch Iteration for Fine-Grained Control:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model and optimizer definition as in Example 1) ...

# Data as a single tensor (for simplicity)
X = torch.randn(1000, 10)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1)

# Manual batch iteration
batch_size = 16
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i in range(0, len(X), batch_size):
        # Define batch boundaries
        batch_X = X[i:i + batch_size]
        batch_y = y[i:i + batch_size]

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(batch_X)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Step: {i // batch_size + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example provides the most granular control.  The data is iterated over manually, defining batches explicitly. This approach gives maximum flexibility but requires careful management of indexing and boundary conditions, especially for datasets of varying sizes.  Each iteration over a manually defined batch forms a "step."


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I'd recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `DataLoader` and `optimizers`.  A good introductory textbook on deep learning with a PyTorch focus would also be beneficial.  Finally, exploring the source code of well-established PyTorch projects can provide valuable insights into advanced techniques for managing data flow and training loops efficiently.  These resources provide more detailed information and practical examples that complement the insights presented here.
