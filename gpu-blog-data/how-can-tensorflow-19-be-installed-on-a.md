TensorFlow 1.9's compatibility with the Raspberry Pi's ARM architecture presents a unique challenge due to the significant architectural changes introduced in TensorFlow 2.0.  My experience working on embedded vision projects leveraging older TensorFlow versions underscores the necessity of a multi-stage approach, encompassing careful dependency management and code refactoring.  Direct installation of TensorFlow 1.9 using pip, as is common on x86_64 systems, frequently fails due to pre-compiled wheel file incompatibility.  Therefore, a custom build from source is generally required.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Installation and Adaptation Process:**

The installation process necessitates a methodical approach.  First, the Raspberry Pi must be equipped with a compatible operating system, preferably a recent Raspbian Lite image.  This minimizes conflicts with existing libraries and provides a clean foundation. Second, the necessary build tools must be installed. This includes a C++ compiler (typically g++), CMake, and other essential dependencies like Python development packages.  These are typically obtained through `apt-get`.

Next, we must source the TensorFlow 1.9 repository. Due to the project's archived status, this requires careful navigation of the TensorFlow GitHub history. Once the source code is downloaded, the build process itself often requires configuring the build system to specify the target architecture (ARMv7 or ARMv8, depending on your Raspberry Pi model).  This configuration typically involves setting environment variables and modifying CMakeLists.txt files.  The compilation process is resource-intensive, potentially taking several hours depending on the Pi's processing power and memory.

Finally, successful compilation yields a wheel file or a set of libraries.  Installation involves the standard Python procedure of using pip, which might require root privileges (`sudo pip3 install ...`).

Adapting existing TensorFlow 1.x code for TensorFlow 2 compatibility necessitates a deep understanding of the API changes.  Key modifications include the transition from `tf.Session()` to the eager execution paradigm introduced in TensorFlow 2.  This often involves restructuring code that relied heavily on graph construction.  Furthermore, many functions and modules were deprecated or renamed, necessitating a systematic review and replacement of outdated calls with their TensorFlow 2 counterparts.  Specific changes often involve handling tensor manipulation,  replacing `tf.contrib` modules with equivalents in TensorFlow 2, and understanding the changes to higher-level APIs like Keras.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  TensorFlow 1.9 Code (using `tf.Session`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x code: graph-based execution
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 3])
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... further computations using sess.run(...) ...
```

This demonstrates the now-obsolete `tf.Session()` usage prevalent in TensorFlow 1.x.


**Example 2: Equivalent TensorFlow 2 Code (eager execution):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 2.x code: eager execution
x = tf.Variable([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
W = tf.Variable([[0.0], [0.0], [0.0]])
b = tf.Variable([0.0])

y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

# ... computations are directly performed ...
print(y.numpy())
```

This code leverages eager execution, eliminating the explicit session management. The `.numpy()` method retrieves the NumPy array representation of the tensor.


**Example 3:  Handling deprecated `tf.contrib` module:**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x code using tf.contrib.layers
import tensorflow as tf

# ... code using tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected ...

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
import tensorflow as tf

# ... replace tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected with tf.keras.layers.Dense ...
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])
# ... continue using tf.keras.layers ...
```

This demonstrates the migration from the deprecated `tf.contrib` modules (often containing experimental features) to the more stable and structured `tf.keras` API in TensorFlow 2.  This example, while simplified, showcases the core principle of replacing deprecated functions with their updated equivalents.  Note that the specific replacement will depend on the precise function used in the original 1.9 code.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the migration guide from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x, is indispensable.  Additionally,  consulting the Raspberry Pi Foundation's documentation for managing dependencies and compiling software on their platform will prove invaluable.  Finally, reviewing the TensorFlow source code for version 1.9 and 2.x will provide crucial insights into the low-level implementation changes.  Understanding the differences between the underlying graph execution and eager execution is key to successful code adaptation.  The use of a comprehensive version control system (such as Git) for managing code changes during the migration process is strongly advised.
