The inherent inefficiency in the provided NumPy code likely stems from its iterative nature when processing adjacent pairs within a 2D array.  My experience optimizing similar array operations points to leveraging NumPy's vectorized capabilities to achieve significant speed improvements.  Instead of looping through each element and its neighbor, we can reshape and manipulate the array to perform comparisons across multiple pairs concurrently. This significantly reduces Python interpreter overhead, relying instead on highly optimized NumPy functions.

My approach centers on creating overlapping windows of pairs and then efficiently comparing these across the array. This method avoids explicit looping and leverages NumPy's broadcasting capabilities for parallel computation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The original (hypothetical) inefficient code probably iterates through each element, checks its neighbors (up, down, left, right), and appends unique pairs to a list.  This is computationally expensive for large arrays. The core idea of the optimized approach involves generating all potential adjacent pairs simultaneously using array slicing and reshaping.  We then utilize NumPy's `unique` function to filter out duplicates, achieving significant speed improvements over element-wise iteration.

The process involves these steps:

* **Horizontal Pair Generation:** Slice the array to create overlapping horizontal pairs. This can be done efficiently using `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` for memory efficiency, avoiding unnecessary data copying.

* **Vertical Pair Generation:** Similarly, generate overlapping vertical pairs.

* **Concatenation:**  Combine horizontal and vertical pairs into a single array.

* **Uniqueness Determination:** Employ `numpy.unique` to identify the unique pairs, eliminating redundant entries.

This vectorized approach avoids explicit loops, relying instead on NumPy's optimized functions for superior performance.  Furthermore, the memory footprint is minimized by employing techniques that avoid unnecessary data duplication.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Implementation using `as_strided` (Most Efficient):**

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided

def find_unique_adjacent_pairs_strided(array_2d):
    """Finds unique adjacent pairs in a 2D array using as_strided for efficiency."""
    rows, cols = array_2d.shape
    
    # Horizontal pairs
    horizontal_pairs = as_strided(array_2d[:, :-1], shape=(rows, cols - 1, 2), strides=array_2d.strides * 2)
    horizontal_pairs = horizontal_pairs.reshape(-1, 2)

    # Vertical pairs
    vertical_pairs = as_strided(array_2d[:-1, :], shape=(rows - 1, cols, 2), strides=(array_2d.strides[0], 0, array_2d.strides[1]))
    vertical_pairs = vertical_pairs.reshape(-1, 2)

    # Combine and find unique pairs
    all_pairs = np.concatenate((horizontal_pairs, vertical_pairs))
    unique_pairs = np.unique(all_pairs, axis=0)

    return unique_pairs


#Example usage
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
unique_pairs = find_unique_adjacent_pairs_strided(array)
print(unique_pairs)
```

This example leverages `as_strided` for optimal memory management, directly creating views of the original array representing adjacent pairs. This minimizes memory overhead compared to explicitly creating new arrays.


**Example 2:  Alternative using `reshape` and `concatenate` (Less Memory Efficient):**

```python
import numpy as np

def find_unique_adjacent_pairs_reshape(array_2d):
    """Finds unique adjacent pairs using reshape and concatenate (less efficient)."""
    rows, cols = array_2d.shape
    
    # Horizontal pairs
    horizontal_pairs = np.concatenate([np.stack((array_2d[:, i], array_2d[:, i+1]), axis=-1) for i in range(cols -1)], axis=0)

    # Vertical pairs
    vertical_pairs = np.concatenate([np.stack((array_2d[i, :], array_2d[i+1, :]), axis=-1) for i in range(rows -1)], axis=0)

    # Combine and find unique pairs
    all_pairs = np.concatenate((horizontal_pairs, vertical_pairs))
    unique_pairs = np.unique(all_pairs, axis=0)
    return unique_pairs

#Example usage
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
unique_pairs = find_unique_adjacent_pairs_reshape(array)
print(unique_pairs)
```

This approach is less memory-efficient due to the creation of intermediate arrays within the list comprehension. While functional, it highlights the advantage of `as_strided` for memory optimization.

**Example 3: Handling potential errors:**

```python
import numpy as np

def find_unique_adjacent_pairs_robust(array_2d):
    """Finds unique adjacent pairs with error handling for small arrays."""
    rows, cols = array_2d.shape
    if rows < 2 and cols < 2:
        return np.empty((0, 2), dtype=array_2d.dtype) # Return empty array for insufficient size

    # ... (Rest of the code is similar to Example 1 or 2, choosing the preferred method) ...

#Example Usage
array = np.array([[1]])
unique_pairs = find_unique_adjacent_pairs_robust(array)
print(unique_pairs)
```
This example demonstrates robust error handling for cases where the input array is too small to have any adjacent pairs, preventing potential errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  The official NumPy documentation.  Pay close attention to sections on array manipulation, broadcasting, and advanced array indexing.
*  A comprehensive textbook on numerical computing with Python.  These often provide in-depth explanations of performance considerations and optimized array operations.
*  Articles and tutorials focusing on vectorization techniques in NumPy and SciPy.  These can provide practical examples and best practices for improving the speed of array-based computations.


Through these examples and by understanding the core principles, you can significantly improve the performance of your code.  Remember to profile your code to verify the effectiveness of each optimization strategy for your specific use case and data characteristics.  The choice between `as_strided` and the `reshape` method will depend on your dataset size and memory constraints; for very large arrays, `as_strided` is generally preferable for its memory efficiency.  Always prioritize clear and maintainable code while aiming for optimal performance.
