Predicting new data hinges fundamentally on the underlying data generating process.  My experience in developing forecasting models for high-frequency financial transactions taught me that accurate prediction is not about applying a single algorithm, but rather a careful understanding of the data's characteristics and choosing the appropriate modeling approach.  This requires a rigorous assessment of data stationarity, autocorrelation, and the presence of non-linear relationships.

**1. Explanation:**

Data prediction relies on identifying patterns and trends within existing data to extrapolate into the future. The core methodologies fall under two broad categories: parametric and non-parametric methods. Parametric methods assume a specific underlying probability distribution for the data, such as a normal distribution for linear regression.  These methods offer efficiency and interpretability but are sensitive to the accuracy of the distributional assumption.  Non-parametric methods, conversely, make fewer assumptions about the data's distribution, providing robustness but potentially sacrificing interpretability.  The selection between these depends critically on the characteristics of the dataset at hand.

Before any modeling, preprocessing is crucial. This includes handling missing data (imputation, removal), outlier detection and treatment, and feature scaling or transformation to optimize model performance.  The choice of preprocessing techniques is often intertwined with the chosen modeling approach.  For example, techniques like Box-Cox transformation may be employed to stabilize variance for time-series data before applying autoregressive models.  Furthermore, dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be necessary for high-dimensional datasets to improve model efficiency and reduce overfitting.

Model selection involves considering factors like the data type (time-series, cross-sectional), the presence of seasonality or trend, the complexity of the relationships between variables, and the desired level of accuracy versus interpretability.  Methods range from simple linear regression to complex neural networks, each with its strengths and limitations.  Evaluating model performance is equally critical, usually involving metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.  Cross-validation techniques are essential to prevent overfitting and to obtain reliable estimates of model generalization performance.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Linear Regression for Predicting House Prices**

This example uses linear regression, a parametric method, to predict house prices based on features like size and location.  This assumes a linear relationship between the features and the price.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
house_size = np.array([1500, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2500]).reshape(-1, 1)
house_price = np.array([300000, 360000, 400000, 440000, 500000])

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(house_size, house_price, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

This code demonstrates a basic implementation. In real-world scenarios, feature engineering, data scaling, and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for optimal performance.


**Example 2: ARIMA for Time Series Forecasting**

This example utilizes the ARIMA model, a parametric method particularly suitable for time-series data exhibiting autocorrelation and seasonality.

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

# Sample time-series data (replace with your actual data)
data = pd.Series([10, 12, 15, 14, 18, 20, 22, 25, 23, 27])

# Check for stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
result = adfuller(data)
print('ADF Statistic: %f' % result[0])
print('p-value: %f' % result[1])

# Difference the data if necessary to achieve stationarity
#  (This step is omitted here for simplicity assuming data is already stationary)

# Fit the ARIMA model (order (p,d,q) needs to be determined through ACF/PACF analysis)
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1,0,0))  # Example order, adjust as needed
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make predictions
predictions = model_fit.predict(start=len(data), end=len(data)+5) #Predicting 5 future values.
print(predictions)
```

This illustrates a basic ARIMA application. Proper order selection requires careful analysis of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF).


**Example 3: Support Vector Regression (SVR) for Non-linear Relationships**

This example uses SVR, a non-parametric method, to handle potentially non-linear relationships between variables.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [4, 3], [5, 2]])
y = np.array([3, 5, 2, 6, 4])

# Scale the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the SVR model (kernel selection is crucial)
model = SVR(kernel='rbf')  # Example kernel, consider alternatives like linear or poly
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

```

This demonstrates a basic SVR implementation. Careful consideration of the kernel function is crucial for capturing the data's non-linear characteristics.  Different kernels (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function) will yield different results.
