The discrepancy in sine wave prediction between TensorFlow and Keras often stems from subtle differences in default settings and underlying optimization algorithms, despite Keras being a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow.  My experience debugging neural networks for time series analysis, specifically within financial modeling, revealed this isn't a fundamental conflict, but rather a consequence of how hyperparameters influence model behavior.  These differences become particularly apparent when using simpler architectures, like those suitable for capturing the periodic nature of sine waves.

**1.  Explanation of Discrepancies:**

The core issue arises from the interaction between the optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD), the loss function (typically MSE for regression tasks), and the initialization of the neural network's weights.  While both TensorFlow and Keras ultimately utilize TensorFlow's computational backend, Keras offers a more streamlined interface that may employ default values for hyperparameters that differ from what one might explicitly specify in a purely TensorFlow implementation.  These differences, although seemingly minor, significantly impact the learning process and, consequently, the predicted sine wave.

For instance, Keras models often default to the `glorot_uniform` (Xavier uniform) weight initializer, while a TensorFlow implementation might use a different method, such as `truncated_normal`.  These initializers control the distribution of initial weights, influencing the starting point of the optimization process.  Different initializers can lead to different convergence points, thus affecting the final model's predictive accuracy and the shape of the predicted wave.  Moreover, Keras's default optimizer, Adam, uses adaptive learning rates which can further contribute to varying results.  Explicitly defining the optimizer, learning rate, and initializer within a TensorFlow model gives you granular control that the higher-level abstraction of Keras sometimes masks.  Variations in batch size, which influences the gradient update process, can also contribute to the observed discrepancies.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the potential differences.  These are simplified for clarity and highlight core concepts. In my own work, these models were vastly expanded with added layers, regularization techniques, and more sophisticated optimizers for improved performance.

**Example 1: Keras Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Generate sine wave data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
y = np.sin(x)
x = x.reshape(-1, 1) # Reshape for Keras input

# Build Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(x)
```

This Keras example uses the default Adam optimizer and a `relu` activation in the hidden layer. The simplicity highlights how Keras manages much of the underlying TensorFlow operations implicitly.


**Example 2: TensorFlow Model with Explicit Hyperparameter Control**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate sine wave data (same as Example 1)
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
y = np.sin(x)
x = x.reshape(-1, 1)

# Build TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal(stddev=0.02), input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal(stddev=0.02))
])

# Define optimizer with explicit learning rate
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model.fit(x, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(x)
```

This example demonstrates explicit control over the optimizer (Adam with a specified learning rate) and weight initialization (`truncated_normal`).  Note that while we are using `tf.keras`, the level of control is much closer to a "pure" TensorFlow approach. This often yields more consistent and predictable results across runs compared to the implicit settings in Example 1.  Changing the `stddev` parameter within `TruncatedNormal` can drastically alter the outcome.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Batch Size Impact (TensorFlow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (Data generation same as above) ...

# Build TensorFlow model (simplified for brevity)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

#Different batch sizes
batch_sizes = [32, 64, 128]

for batch_size in batch_sizes:
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
    model.fit(x, y, epochs=100, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=0)
    predictions = model.predict(x)
    print(f"Predictions for batch size {batch_size}: {predictions}")
```

This example showcases how altering the `batch_size` affects the model's learning trajectory and, therefore, the final predictions.  Larger batch sizes offer a more accurate estimate of the gradient but require more memory, potentially leading to different convergence properties compared to smaller batches.  The observed discrepancy across different `batch_sizes` further highlights the sensitivity of neural network training to hyperparameter selection.

Understanding the interplay between optimizers, weight initialization, learning rate, batch size, and loss function is crucial for consistent and reliable results in neural network training.  The examples provided illustrate how seemingly small differences in these settings can lead to significant variations in sine wave prediction between a Keras model and a TensorFlow model, even though they share a common underlying computational engine.  My experience suggests systematic experimentation and careful hyperparameter tuning are essential for achieving dependable results in time series prediction using neural networks.
