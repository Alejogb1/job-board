The core issue with a `ValueError` stemming from incompatible input tensor dimensions, specifically 100 and 19 in this case, hinges on the mismatch between expected and provided input shapes within a tensor operation.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale deep learning models, primarily involving PyTorch and TensorFlow, has highlighted the critical need for meticulous shape verification before any tensor computation.  This error doesn't simply indicate a typo; it signals a fundamental flaw in either the data pipeline or the network architecture itself.  The resolution involves identifying the source of the dimensionality discrepancy and adjusting accordingly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `ValueError` arises when attempting an operation that requires specific tensor dimensions, for instance, matrix multiplication, element-wise addition, or tensor concatenation.  If the tensors involved don't meet these dimensional requirements, the operation fails, resulting in the error message.  In this scenario, the dimensions 100 and 19 are incompatible for numerous common operations.  For example, matrix multiplication requires the inner dimensions of the matrices to be equal; attempting to multiply a (100, X) matrix by a (19, Y) matrix will fail unless X equals 19.  Similarly, element-wise operations necessitate identically shaped tensors.  The problem is compounded by the potential for implicit broadcasting, where smaller tensors are stretched to match larger ones.  Misunderstanding or misapplication of broadcasting rules can subtly lead to these errors.

Troubleshooting this starts with pinpointing the specific operation generating the error.  Examine the code line that throws the exception. This line usually involves a tensor function like `torch.mm`, `tf.matmul`, `torch.add`, `np.concatenate`, or similar functions. Once identified, analyze the shapes of the input tensors.  Using debugging tools, print the `.shape` attribute of each tensor before the offending operation.  This crucial step isolates the dimension mismatch: which tensor has 100 elements along a specific axis, and which has 19? Identifying this disparity clarifies the nature of the problem.

The solution often involves one or more of the following:

* **Reshaping:**  Use tensor reshaping functions (e.g., `torch.reshape`, `tf.reshape`, `numpy.reshape`) to adjust the dimensions of one or both tensors to match the requirements of the operation.
* **Transposing:**  If the problem lies in matrix multiplication, transposing one of the tensors may resolve the issue.  PyTorch and TensorFlow offer simple transpose functions (`torch.transpose`, `tf.transpose`).
* **Data Pipeline Modification:**  If the dimensionality problem originates in the data loading or preprocessing steps, review the data loading code to ensure the tensors are generated with the correct shape.  This often involves correctly specifying the input dimensions to functions that read or transform data.
* **Architectural Adjustments:**  If the error surfaces within a neural network, it may indicate an architectural incompatibility.  Check the layer dimensions to confirm that the output of one layer aligns with the input requirements of the next.  You may need to adjust the number of neurons in a layer or add/remove layers to fix the problem.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Reshaping for Element-wise Addition**

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.randn(100, 1) # (100, 1) tensor
tensor2 = torch.randn(19)     # (19,) tensor

# This will raise a ValueError because of incompatible shapes.
#try:
#    result = tensor1 + tensor2
#except ValueError as e:
#    print(f"Caught ValueError: {e}")

# Correct approach: Reshape tensor2 to (100, 1) before addition.  This is a risky solution if data values are meaningful.
tensor2_reshaped = tensor2.reshape(100, 1)[:100] #This takes the first 100 elements of the reshaped array to make it compatible
result = tensor1 + tensor2_reshaped
print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([100, 1])
```

This example demonstrates the `ValueError` that arises from attempting element-wise addition between tensors of different shapes. The solution involves reshaping `tensor2` to match `tensor1`'s dimensions. Note that the simple reshape would be problematic if 100 is not a multiple of 19 - in this instance data has been truncated.

**Example 2:  Transposing for Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import torch

matrix1 = torch.randn(100, 10)  # (100, 10) matrix
matrix2 = torch.randn(19, 5)   # (19, 5) matrix

# This will raise a ValueError because inner dimensions are unequal.
#try:
#    result = torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)
#except ValueError as e:
#    print(f"Caught ValueError: {e}")

# Correct approach: Transpose matrix2, ensuring inner dimensions are compatible.
matrix2_t = matrix2.t()          # Transpose matrix2 to (5, 19)
if matrix1.shape[1] == matrix2_t.shape[0]:
    result = torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2_t)
    print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([100, 5])
else:
    print("Inner dimensions are still incompatible after transpose.")
```

This example showcases the use of transposition to make matrix multiplication possible. The transpose operation alters the shape of `matrix2`, allowing for a successful matrix multiplication.  Error handling is added to prevent further issues if the transpose doesn't resolve the incompatibility.

**Example 3: Data Pipeline Adjustment**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate data loading where the shape is incorrectly handled.
data = np.random.rand(19, 10)  # Incorrect shape

# Function to process the data (replace with your actual data loading logic).
def process_data(data):
    #The issue is here - the input data is not the right shape
    if data.shape != (100, 10):
        raise ValueError("Data must have shape (100, 10)")
    return data

# Corrected data loading (replace with your actual data loading and processing).
corrected_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
processed_data = process_data(corrected_data)
print(processed_data.shape) #Output: (100,10)

```

This example illustrates how a data pipeline error can manifest as a `ValueError`.  The `process_data` function enforces a (100, 10) shape; incorrectly shaped data will trigger the error. The solution focuses on modifying the data loading stage to ensure the correct shape.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of tensor operations and shape manipulation, I highly recommend reviewing the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow).  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook will also be invaluable for grasping the mathematical principles underlying matrix operations and broadcasting.  Finally, debugging tools integrated within your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) offer critical features like breakpoints and variable inspection to help pinpoint the exact location and nature of these shape-related errors.  Thorough testing, particularly around edge cases and variable shapes, is a proactive measure.
