The core limitation preventing concurrent utilization of multiple CUDA toolkits on a single Windows system lies not in CUDA's architecture itself, but in the inherent limitations of the Windows operating system's driver management and the way CUDA interacts with the underlying hardware.  While technically feasible to install multiple CUDA versions, attempting to actively switch between them within a single session, without a significant architectural overhaul, will likely lead to system instability and application crashes. My experience working on high-performance computing clusters, specifically those managing diverse GPU configurations and software dependencies, highlights this challenge frequently.

**1. Explanation:**

Windows manages device drivers on a system-wide basis.  Each CUDA toolkit installs its own drivers, effectively registering itself as the primary interface to the NVIDIA GPUs.  Attempting to load multiple driver sets simultaneously creates a conflict. The operating system cannot reliably determine which driver should handle a given GPU operation, resulting in undefined behavior.  This is distinct from, say, managing multiple Python environments, where virtual environments isolate dependencies; CUDA’s low-level nature makes such isolation impractical.  Furthermore, CUDA libraries themselves, crucial for compilation and runtime execution of CUDA kernels, are version-specific.  Loading libraries from disparate CUDA versions simultaneously introduces severe compatibility problems at both compile time (linker errors) and runtime (crashes due to conflicting function calls or memory management).

The practical implication is this:  While you can install multiple CUDA versions, the system will only ever recognize and use *one* at a time.  Switching between them necessitates a complete system reboot, ensuring the driver and library pathways are correctly updated before launching applications relying on the newly selected CUDA version.   This restriction stems from the fundamental design choice of CUDA's close integration with the graphics card's hardware and the operating system's driver management model.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the potential issues and the workaround involving reboot:


**Example 1:  Successful Compilation and Execution with a Single CUDA Version:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  int *a, *b, *c;
  int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Allocate host memory
  a = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  b = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  c = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize host arrays
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
    b[i] = i * 2;
  }

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Verify results
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (c[i] != a[i] + b[i]) {
      printf("Error: c[%d] = %d, expected %d\n", i, c[i], a[i] + b[i]);
    }
  }

  // Free memory
  free(a);
  free(b);
  free(c);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  return 0;
}
```

This code compiles and runs successfully if the appropriate CUDA toolkit (and its associated drivers) are correctly installed and set as the system's default. This example uses a basic vector addition kernel, demonstrating fundamental CUDA programming concepts.

**Example 2:  Compilation Failure with Mismatched CUDA Versions:**

Attempting to compile code compiled against CUDA version X.Y using a compiler linked to CUDA version Z.W (where X.Y ≠ Z.W) will result in linker errors. The compiler will not be able to locate the necessary libraries or resolve symbol conflicts between different versions of the CUDA runtime. The error messages will highlight missing functions or incompatible library versions.

```bash
nvcc -o addVectors addVectors.cu
# ...results in linker errors if the CUDA version used by the compiler doesn't match the runtime libraries...
```

This illustrates the compile-time problem that arises from using different CUDA versions.


**Example 3: Runtime Crash with Inconsistent CUDA Environments:**

Even if compilation succeeds (perhaps through careful path management and library linking), attempting to run an application built against one CUDA version while another is actively loaded in the system will likely result in a runtime crash. The application may encounter errors related to GPU context management, memory allocation, or kernel execution, ultimately leading to program termination.  This problem is insidious because it might not appear consistently, depending on the specific interaction between the applications and the loaded CUDA versions.  The crash might manifest as a segmentation fault, a CUDA error code, or an application-specific error.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.  NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide.  A comprehensive textbook on parallel computing with CUDA.  A reputable online CUDA programming tutorial.  A guide to managing multiple software environments in Windows (e.g., using virtual machines or containers).


In summary, while installing multiple CUDA toolkits on Windows is technically possible, their simultaneous use within a single session is not practically feasible.  The underlying driver conflicts and library incompatibilities will almost certainly lead to system instability.  A system reboot is required to switch between different CUDA versions effectively.  The key takeaway is to carefully plan your CUDA environment and manage dependencies to avoid such issues.  Using virtual machines or containers is a strategy to mitigate some of these challenges if the need to run applications compiled against multiple CUDA versions simultaneously is unavoidable.
