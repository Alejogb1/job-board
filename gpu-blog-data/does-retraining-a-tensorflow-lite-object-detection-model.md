Incorrect inference results, even after retraining, on an Edge TPU with TensorFlow Lite models often stem from fundamental mismatches in the data pipeline or quantization steps, rather than solely an inherent flaw in the retraining process itself. I've encountered this situation multiple times while deploying custom object detection solutions on embedded devices. It’s rarely a straightforward issue of model accuracy, but rather a complex interaction of data handling and hardware limitations.

The crux of the problem lies in the transformations applied to training data versus the transformations applied during inference on the Coral Dev board. TensorFlow Lite models are highly optimized, and discrepancies arising from differing pre-processing pipelines, even seemingly minor ones, can lead to unexpected or inaccurate outputs, particularly after retraining. Furthermore, the quantization of weights, a mandatory step for utilizing the Edge TPU, is lossy and can exacerbate these existing inconsistencies. Simply retraining an existing model without addressing the full pipeline, including input normalization, data augmentation, and quantization, will likely result in consistently incorrect inferences. This is especially true for models converted to run on the Edge TPU as this process introduces a further layer of complexity.

When retraining a model for the Edge TPU, we're essentially attempting to adapt an existing model—likely pre-trained on a large dataset with its own implicit data distributions—to our specific task and dataset. If the target dataset’s distribution significantly differs from the original pre-trained data, it would necessitate rigorous retraining with corresponding data augmentation techniques. However, even with a good retrained model, discrepancies between training and inference pipelines are still the common culprit of incorrect results on the Edge TPU. Let’s delve into some practical scenarios where this could occur, which reflect real issues that I’ve had to resolve in the past.

**Scenario 1: Image Preprocessing Discrepancies**

Consider a situation where a model, during training, assumes input images are normalized to a specific range, say [-1, 1], but during inference on the Coral Dev board, the images are only scaled to [0, 1]. Even without explicit mention in documentation, this might be an implicit preprocessing step performed by the training pipeline. If the Edge TPU inference engine expects values normalized to [-1, 1], the network will not function as expected, and retraining with only the training normalization applied will not fix this inference issue.

```python
# Python snippet illustrating differing preprocessing during training vs. inference
import numpy as np

# Training preprocessing (example)
def preprocess_training(image):
    image = image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    image = (image - 0.5) / 0.5  # Normalize to [-1, 1]
    return image

# Inference preprocessing (example, incorrect)
def preprocess_inference_incorrect(image):
    image = image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    return image

# Inference preprocessing (example, correct)
def preprocess_inference_correct(image):
    image = image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    image = (image - 0.5) / 0.5  # Normalize to [-1, 1]
    return image


# Example usage
dummy_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(64, 64, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

trained_image = preprocess_training(dummy_image)
incorrect_inference_image = preprocess_inference_incorrect(dummy_image)
correct_inference_image = preprocess_inference_correct(dummy_image)


print(f"Training Image (min/max): {trained_image.min()}/{trained_image.max()}")
print(f"Incorrect Inference Image (min/max): {incorrect_inference_image.min()}/{incorrect_inference_image.max()}")
print(f"Correct Inference Image (min/max): {correct_inference_image.min()}/{correct_inference_image.max()}")
```

In this example, if the `preprocess_inference_incorrect` function is used in the Edge TPU inference pipeline, the results will be inaccurate even if the model itself was retrained with normalized images. Notice the different ranges, the training image and correct inference image will have a range of roughly [-1,1] while the incorrect inference range will have a range [0,1]. The issue stems from the mismatch between the preprocessing performed during training and inference. The corrected version `preprocess_inference_correct` aligns the inference data preprocessing with the training, making the inference process more reliable and yielding correct results.

**Scenario 2: Input Image Size and Aspect Ratio**

Another frequent problem arises from differences in the handling of input image size and aspect ratio. The Edge TPU operates optimally with fixed input sizes that match the size the model was trained on and compiled for. If resizing or padding is used differently between the training and inference phases, inconsistencies are likely to occur. A common issue is when the training script may be designed to perform resizing while the inference logic might be performing padding, or vice-versa. These discrepancies in handling aspect ratios during scaling can cause the object of interest to be distorted, causing incorrect inferences even after retraining.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Training resize (example)
def resize_training(image, target_size):
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, target_size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
    return resized_image


# Inference padding (example, incorrect match)
def pad_inference_incorrect(image, target_size):
    h, w, _ = image.shape
    new_h, new_w = target_size

    h_padding = (new_h - h) // 2
    w_padding = (new_w - w) // 2
    padded_image = cv2.copyMakeBorder(image, h_padding, new_h - h - h_padding, w_padding, new_w - w - w_padding, cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT, value=[0,0,0])
    return padded_image

# Inference resize (example, correct match)
def resize_inference_correct(image, target_size):
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, target_size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
    return resized_image

# Example usage
dummy_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(80, 120, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
target_size = (100, 100)

trained_image = resize_training(dummy_image, target_size)
incorrect_inference_image = pad_inference_incorrect(dummy_image, target_size)
correct_inference_image = resize_inference_correct(dummy_image, target_size)

print(f"Training Image Shape: {trained_image.shape}")
print(f"Incorrect Inference Image Shape: {incorrect_inference_image.shape}")
print(f"Correct Inference Image Shape: {correct_inference_image.shape}")
```

Here, the `resize_training` function resizes the image to the target dimensions, whereas the `pad_inference_incorrect` function pads the image with black pixels to fit the target size. This difference in how images are processed can lead to inaccurate inference since the model during training never saw padded images. Using `resize_inference_correct` aligns the inference processing with the training to make inferences more reliable after retraining.

**Scenario 3: Quantization Differences**

Finally, quantization, although integral to utilizing the Edge TPU, can introduce further variability. Quantization converts the floating-point weights and activations of a model to integers. While this leads to substantial performance and memory efficiency gains, it also incurs a loss of precision. If the quantization method used during model conversion differs from what the retrained model expects, it will result in degraded performance. Even seemingly minor differences in float to int conversion methods during the retrain and tflite conversion can compound across the layers.

```python
# Example illustrating quantization impact (Conceptual - not real quantization)

# Simulate quantization to 8-bit integer range

def simulate_quantize_correct(tensor, min_val=-1, max_val=1, num_bits=8):
    scale = (max_val - min_val) / (2**num_bits - 1)
    zero_point = round(min_val / scale)
    quantized_tensor = (tensor / scale + zero_point).round().astype(np.int8)
    dequantized_tensor = (quantized_tensor.astype(float) - zero_point) * scale
    return dequantized_tensor

def simulate_quantize_incorrect(tensor, min_val=-1, max_val=1, num_bits=8):
    scale = (max_val - min_val) / (2**num_bits - 1)
    quantized_tensor = (tensor / scale).round().astype(np.int8)
    dequantized_tensor = quantized_tensor.astype(float) * scale
    return dequantized_tensor


# Simulate some values between -1 and 1
dummy_tensor = np.array([-0.7, -0.3, 0.1, 0.6], dtype=float)

correctly_quantized_tensor = simulate_quantize_correct(dummy_tensor)
incorrectly_quantized_tensor = simulate_quantize_incorrect(dummy_tensor)


print(f"Original tensor: {dummy_tensor}")
print(f"Correct Quantization (after dequantizing): {correctly_quantized_tensor}")
print(f"Incorrect Quantization (after dequantizing): {incorrectly_quantized_tensor}")

```
In this simplified example, the `simulate_quantize_correct` function performs a complete quantization/dequantization with a zero point and a scale which would be more accurate than the `simulate_quantize_incorrect` function, which omits a zero point in the calculation. In practice, a more sophisticated quantization is applied, but the conceptual idea is that even small discrepancies in how quantization is performed can create large errors. Since this process is integral to tflite compilation for Edge TPU usage, inconsistencies here could drastically impact inference accuracy.
The key insight is to carefully investigate the full pipeline for any possible differences. These can arise from different libraries being used for image processing during training and on the Edge TPU. Such differences can make the retrained model not perform as expected.

**Resource Recommendations**

To mitigate these issues, it is imperative to understand the complete workflow. First, meticulously document the precise preprocessing steps applied to training data. Second, examine the Edge TPU compiler specifications for expected input sizes and quantization methods. Third, thoroughly test all stages of preprocessing during inference to mirror those of training. Finally, always consult the official TensorFlow Lite documentation and the Coral website for details on deployment and hardware-specific considerations. Specific books or articles are less crucial than a thorough understanding of the process at hand, which requires careful reading of available documentation.

In conclusion, retraining a TensorFlow Lite object detection model on a Coral Dev board might yield consistent incorrect inference results not because of the model itself, but rather due to discrepancies in data processing and quantization during training and inference. Aligning the full pipeline—from preprocessing to quantization— is paramount for success. A robust workflow coupled with precise alignment of training and inference steps is critical for achieving accurate results after retraining on the Edge TPU.
