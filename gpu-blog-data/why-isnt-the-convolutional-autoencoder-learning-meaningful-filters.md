I've encountered this issue numerous times while working with convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), specifically the challenge of them failing to learn filters that represent meaningful features of the input data. The problem isn't inherent to the CAE architecture itself, but rather a convergence issue arising from several contributing factors. Essentially, a CAE's failure to learn useful filters typically stems from the model finding a trivial solution to its optimization problem, or from training issues that inhibit its learning capacity. This usually manifests as the learned filters being noisy, resembling random patterns, or converging to a uniform, non-informative state, often appearing as blank feature maps.

The central goal of a CAE is to learn a compressed, latent representation of input data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional space, then reconstructing the input from this latent representation. Successful learning requires the encoder to discover useful features that facilitate effective reconstruction. If the encoder fails to extract relevant patterns, the decoder struggles to reproduce the input accurately, and vice versa. This interplay means a failure in one part of the network affects the other. Several common culprits are usually at play: insufficient or improper regularization, inadequate training data, suboptimal hyperparameter choices, or an architecture not suited to the data's complexity.

Let's first consider regularization. The absence of regularization allows the network to overfit the training data. For the decoder, overfitting might mean memorizing the training input directly, essentially bypassing the encoding process. This implies the encoder could output useless latent representations since the decoder can achieve low reconstruction error without requiring informative latent features. The filters in the encoder often end up random and lacking structure under these conditions because they aren't required to do any useful work. Adding explicit regularization can constrain this behavior.

Another common cause is having insufficient training data. CAEs require a large and diverse dataset to learn generalized representations. When data is sparse, the model can’t sufficiently explore the input space and is likely to converge to a suboptimal solution. Further, data quality is crucial. If the input data is excessively noisy, the model struggles to differentiate between real features and noise. In practice, the model learns to simply "pass through" a noisy version of the original image, rather than encoding its semantic content. In this state, no true feature extraction occurs, and the learned filters are just responding to noise patterns.

Furthermore, suboptimal hyperparameter choices have a pronounced effect. An excessively high learning rate can cause training instability, preventing the model from converging on a useful set of filters. Similarly, if the network's depth or complexity is poorly matched to the dataset, learning may stall. A network that is too shallow may lack the capacity to extract complex features, while an overly deep network with many parameters, especially on a small dataset, can overfit quickly. The kernel size and number of filters per layer need to be adjusted depending on the structure of the data. Too few filters limit learning, while too many may increase noise and increase overfitting potential.

Finally, the inherent nature of the chosen loss function impacts learning. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the most frequently used loss function for CAE’s. However, it isn’t optimal for all applications. For images, this can lead to blurry reconstructions, as it tends to average out pixels. As a consequence, the filters learn to encode and decode blurry approximations of data, which results in noisy or indistinct filters rather than clear and well-defined edge or texture detectors. This choice, therefore, influences the filter’s characteristics substantially.

To illustrate, consider these code examples, using Python with TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
# Example 1: A CAE with insufficient regularization, likely to yield useless filters
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Encoder
encoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoder_input)
x = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
latent = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
encoder = tf.keras.Model(encoder_input, latent)

# Decoder
decoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(7, 7, 8))
x = layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(decoder_input)
x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
reconstructed = layers.Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(x)
decoder = tf.keras.Model(decoder_input, reconstructed)

# Autoencoder
autoencoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
encoded = encoder(autoencoder_input)
decoded = decoder(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(autoencoder_input, decoded)

autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train on data
# autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

```
This first example constructs a basic CAE without explicit regularization. When trained, it will likely not converge on good filters due to the network's high capacity to simply memorize the input. I have found this sort of architecture often exhibits blurry and noisy filters, particularly if the training data is not extensive. Note that the `fit` method has been commented out to allow direct execution of the architecture.

```python
# Example 2: CAE with L2 regularization and data augmentation

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

encoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001))(encoder_input)
x = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001))(x)
latent = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
encoder = tf.keras.Model(encoder_input, latent)

decoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(7, 7, 8))
x = layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001))(decoder_input)
x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001))(x)
x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
reconstructed = layers.Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(x)
decoder = tf.keras.Model(decoder_input, reconstructed)

autoencoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
encoded = encoder(autoencoder_input)
decoded = decoder(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(autoencoder_input, decoded)

autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Data augmentation
# datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=10, width_shift_range=0.1, height_shift_range=0.1, zoom_range=0.1)
# datagen.fit(x_train)
# autoencoder.fit(datagen.flow(x_train, x_train, batch_size=32), epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

```

This second example demonstrates a simple approach to mitigating some of the previously discussed issues. Here, L2 regularization is applied to each convolutional layer, penalizing large weights and therefore encouraging the network to learn a more generalized representation and preventing it from memorizing the input. I have also included example use of data augmentation, which increases the effective training data and can help the network generalize. This setup should yield better filters than the first, provided there is suitable training. Again the fit and augmentation code has been commented out.

```python
# Example 3: CAE with a structural similarity index (SSIM) based loss

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define SSIM loss
def ssim_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return 1 - tf.reduce_mean(tf.image.ssim(y_true, y_pred, max_val=1.0))

encoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoder_input)
x = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
latent = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
encoder = tf.keras.Model(encoder_input, latent)

decoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(7, 7, 8))
x = layers.Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(decoder_input)
x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
reconstructed = layers.Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(x)
decoder = tf.keras.Model(decoder_input, reconstructed)

autoencoder_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
encoded = encoder(autoencoder_input)
decoded = decoder(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(autoencoder_input, decoded)

autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=ssim_loss)

# autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```
The third example introduces the use of SSIM as a loss function instead of MSE. As mentioned earlier, MSE often produces blurry outputs, while SSIM evaluates the structural similarity between the original and reconstructed images. Using the SSIM loss can lead to clearer, sharper features in the encoder’s filters. It's worth experimenting with different loss functions to find what works best for the specific data. Again, training using `fit` has been commented out for direct execution of the architecture.

For further investigation, I would recommend reviewing literature on deep learning optimization, particularly regarding regularization methods, such as L1, L2, dropout, and batch normalization. Books on image processing and feature engineering can also provide valuable context on what kind of features CAEs should ideally learn. Examining how various loss functions affect learning outcomes can be particularly useful. Finally, experiment with different network architectures, such as those utilizing residual connections or attention mechanisms, to see how they impact the quality of the filters.
