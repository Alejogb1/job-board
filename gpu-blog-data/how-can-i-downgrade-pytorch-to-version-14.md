Downgrading PyTorch, particularly to a version as old as 1.4, requires careful consideration of environment management.  My experience troubleshooting compatibility issues across various deep learning projects has highlighted the critical need for isolating dependencies.  Simply attempting a `pip uninstall` followed by a `pip install` of the older version often fails due to lingering dependencies or conflicts with other packages within the system's Python environment.  Therefore, the most reliable approach centers around leveraging virtual environments and potentially conda environments for superior dependency isolation.

**1.  Understanding the Challenges:**

PyTorch's ecosystem is vast.  Over time, significant architectural changes and dependency updates have occurred.  Version 1.4 predates many commonly used libraries' current versions.  Attempting a direct downgrade may result in incompatibilities with other packages, leading to runtime errors or build failures. The core issue lies in the transitive dependencies:  PyTorch 1.4 relied on specific versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and other supporting libraries. Installing a newer version of one of these might silently break the compatibility with the older PyTorch version, despite the older PyTorch version being successfully installed.

**2.  Recommended Approach: Virtual Environments**

The most robust method for downgrading PyTorch 1.4 involves utilizing virtual environments. These create isolated spaces for Python projects, preventing conflicts between different project's dependency requirements.  I've personally avoided numerous catastrophic dependency clashes by religiously employing this practice.  Python's `venv` module or `virtualenv` (a more feature-rich alternative) are effective tools for this purpose.  For larger projects or those involving CUDA, conda environments (managed by Anaconda or Miniconda) offer superior control over system-level dependencies.

**3. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using `venv`**

```bash
python3 -m venv pytorch1.4_env  # Creates a virtual environment
source pytorch1.4_env/bin/activate  # Activates the environment (Linux/macOS)
.\pytorch1.4_env\Scripts\activate  # Activates the environment (Windows)
pip install torch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 torchaudio==0.4.0  # Install PyTorch 1.4 and its compatible versions
# Verify installation: python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
deactivate # Deactivate the environment after completion
```

*Commentary:* This example showcases the standard procedure using `venv`. Note that torchvision and torchaudio versions are crucial.  Incorrect versions here can lead to failures. Always consult the PyTorch 1.4 documentation to identify precisely matched versions.  The `python -c` command verifies the installation within the environment.  Crucially, the activation and deactivation steps isolate the environmentâ€™s changes.

**Example 2: Using `virtualenv`**

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 pytorch1.4_env  # Creates a virtual environment using a specific Python version.
source pytorch1.4_env/bin/activate # Activates the environment (Linux/macOS)
.\pytorch1.4_env\Scripts\activate # Activates the environment (Windows)
pip install torch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 torchaudio==0.4.0
# Verify installation: python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
deactivate
```

*Commentary:* `virtualenv` provides additional features compared to `venv`, notably allowing specification of the Python interpreter to use, useful when managing multiple Python versions.  The rest of the process remains identical to the `venv` example, highlighting the interchangeable nature of these environment managers for the core task.

**Example 3: Using conda (for CUDA support)**

```bash
conda create -n pytorch1.4_env python=3.7  # Creates a conda environment with a specific Python version (adjust as needed)
conda activate pytorch1.4_env
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 torchaudio==0.4.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 # Install PyTorch 1.4 and CUDA toolkit (check appropriate CUDA version for 1.4)
# Verify installation: python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
conda deactivate
```

*Commentary:*  This approach is vital if you require GPU acceleration.  Specify the correct CUDA toolkit version (10.1 is an example, confirm the correct version needed for PyTorch 1.4) and associated cuDNN version.  Cuda toolkit installation can be complex, especially if there are pre-existing CUDA installations.  Conda manages these complexities more effectively.  Failure to correctly specify the CUDA version is a very frequent source of error when attempting to downgrade to older PyTorch versions.  This is why conda's robust dependency resolution becomes extremely valuable.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official PyTorch documentation for version 1.4:  This is crucial for confirming compatible versions of torchvision, torchaudio, and CUDA.
*   The documentation for `venv` and `virtualenv`: These provide detailed instructions on environment management.
*   The Anaconda/Miniconda documentation:  Understand conda environment management for optimal dependency control, especially with CUDA.


**5.  Further Considerations:**

*   **CUDA and cuDNN:**  These are crucial for GPU usage.  Ensure your CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions are compatible with PyTorch 1.4.  Incorrect versions are likely to cause installation failures or runtime errors.  This compatibility check is more critical with older PyTorch versions.
*   **Operating System:**  The installation process may vary slightly between different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  Consult the relevant documentation for precise instructions.
*   **Python Version:** PyTorch 1.4 might have specific Python version requirements.  Check the documentation for compatibility information.

Successfully downgrading PyTorch to version 1.4 necessitates a methodical approach prioritizing environment management.  Using virtual environments, carefully matching dependency versions, and potentially leveraging conda for its dependency resolution capabilities will greatly improve the likelihood of a successful and stable installation.  Ignoring these steps invariably leads to difficulties and wasted time.  My personal experience has firmly established these practices as essential for maintaining a reliable deep learning workflow.
