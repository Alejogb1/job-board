TensorFlow's GPU memory allocation behavior isn't uniform across systems due to a confluence of factors impacting the runtime environment.  The core issue stems from the interaction between TensorFlow's memory management strategy, the underlying CUDA driver and libraries, and the specific hardware configuration of the target machine.  My experience optimizing deep learning models across diverse hardware profiles has highlighted these intricacies repeatedly.  Understanding these nuances is crucial for reproducible research and efficient deployment.

**1.  Underlying Mechanisms:**

TensorFlow employs a sophisticated memory management system that attempts to optimize resource utilization.  However, this system operates within constraints imposed by the CUDA driver and the GPU's capabilities.  The driver handles the allocation and deallocation of GPU memory, while TensorFlow's runtime leverages this driver to manage its own internal data structures and the tensors used during computation.  Variations in driver versions, CUDA toolkit installations, and even operating system configurations can lead to differing memory allocation patterns.

Furthermore, the GPU itself plays a significant role. GPUs possess different amounts of memory, varying memory bandwidths, and differing architectural designs. These factors influence TensorFlow's ability to efficiently manage its memory allocation strategy.  For instance, a GPU with a larger memory pool might allow TensorFlow to retain more intermediate results in GPU memory, while a smaller GPU might trigger more frequent transfers between GPU and system RAM (page swapping), leading to increased apparent memory usage.  The impact of virtual memory and swapping further complicates the picture, as the system's overall memory pressure influences the efficiency of these page transfers.  This is particularly relevant for large models where the working set exceeds the available GPU memory.

Another critical factor is the specific TensorFlow version and its compilation flags.  Different versions might utilize different memory management techniques, and custom compilation options can significantly influence the memory footprint.  For example, using the `--config=cuda` flag during compilation influences how TensorFlow interacts with CUDA, directly affecting memory allocation.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following code examples illustrate the impact of different factors on memory usage, focusing on scenarios I encountered during the development of a large-scale image recognition system.

**Example 1: Impact of Batch Size:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Vary batch size and observe memory usage
for batch_size in [32, 64, 128, 256]:
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Ensure GPU usage
    x = tf.random.normal((batch_size, 28, 28, 1))
    y = model(x)
    print(f"Batch size: {batch_size}, Memory Usage: {tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info()}")
```

This example demonstrates how increasing the batch size directly influences GPU memory usage. Larger batch sizes require more memory to hold the input data and intermediate activation tensors.  Observing the `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info()` output across different machines will highlight the variations in memory usage owing to the underlying hardware and driver configurations.


**Example 2:  Impact of Data Type:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple tensor operation
def tensor_op(dtype):
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    x = tf.random.normal((1024, 1024), dtype=dtype)
    y = tf.matmul(x, x)
    return y

# Compare memory usage for different data types
for dtype in [tf.float32, tf.float16]:
  y = tensor_op(dtype)
  print(f"Data type: {dtype}, Memory Usage: {tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info()}")
```

This example highlights the effect of data types on memory consumption.  Using `tf.float16` (half-precision floating-point numbers) instead of `tf.float32` reduces memory usage by half, but potentially at the cost of precision.  The difference in memory usage will be especially notable on machines with limited GPU memory.  The actual memory consumption difference may depend on the CUDA driver's handling of different data types.


**Example 3: Utilizing `tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define memory growth to dynamically allocate memory
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)

# Your TensorFlow model and training code here...
# ...
```

This crucial example showcases controlling memory allocation using `set_memory_growth(gpu, True)`. This instructs TensorFlow to allocate GPU memory dynamically as needed, rather than pre-allocating a large chunk at the start. This feature is invaluable for scenarios with limited GPU memory or when dealing with models of varying sizes.  This approach, however, might introduce minor overhead due to dynamic allocation.  The efficiency of this method depends on the driver's ability to efficiently manage memory fragmentation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's memory management: Consult the official TensorFlow documentation focusing on GPU memory allocation and the `tf.config` module. Explore resources detailing CUDA programming and memory management within the CUDA framework.  Study advanced topics such as memory pooling and GPU memory profiling tools to gain further insight into optimizing memory usage.  Familiarize yourself with performance monitoring tools specifically designed for CUDA applications.


In summary, the variability in GPU memory allocation in TensorFlow programs across different computers is a multi-faceted problem.  It's influenced by interactions between the TensorFlow runtime, the underlying CUDA ecosystem, and the specific hardware configurations of each machine.  Systematic exploration of memory management techniques within TensorFlow, coupled with a thorough understanding of CUDA principles, is essential for developing robust and efficient deep learning applications.
