Copying arrays larger than the thread block's size to shared memory in CUDA requires a cooperative strategy, leveraging multiple threads within a block to collectively perform the transfer.  My experience working on high-performance computing simulations for fluid dynamics revealed this as a crucial optimization step; naive approaches frequently lead to significant performance bottlenecks.  Direct memory copies from global to shared memory are atomic only within a single thread's context.  Therefore, efficient large array transfers necessitate a coordinated, multi-threaded approach, carefully handling potential race conditions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental challenge stems from the limited capacity of shared memory relative to global memory.  A single thread cannot directly copy a large array exceeding the shared memory's size.  The solution involves partitioning the large array into smaller chunks, each manageable by a subset of threads within a block.  Each thread is responsible for copying a specific portion of the global memory array to its designated region within the shared memory.  Synchronization mechanisms are then crucial to ensure all threads complete their transfers before any thread attempts to access the data from shared memory.  The choice of synchronization primitive—atomic operations or barriers—depends on the specific access patterns and data dependencies within the kernel.

Consider a global array of size `N`, where `N` significantly exceeds the shared memory size `SM_SIZE`.  The strategy involves:

1. **Chunking:** Divide the global array into `ceil(N / SM_SIZE)` chunks.
2. **Thread Assignment:** Assign threads within a block to copy specific chunks.  A common approach uses the thread index (`threadIdx.x`) to determine the chunk and the offset within that chunk.
3. **Cooperative Copying:** Each thread copies its assigned portion of the global array to the shared memory.
4. **Synchronization:**  A barrier synchronization ensures all threads have completed their copy operations before proceeding.  This is essential to avoid accessing incomplete or inconsistent data in shared memory.
5. **Shared Memory Access:** Threads access the data from shared memory, performing necessary computations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Chunk-Based Copy with Barrier Synchronization:**

```cuda
__global__ void largeArrayCopy(const float* globalArray, float* sharedArray, int N) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[SM_SIZE]; // Assuming SM_SIZE is defined

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int chunkSize = SM_SIZE / blockDim.x; // Chunk size per thread
  int chunkStart = i * chunkSize;

  if (i < N / chunkSize) {
    for (int j = 0; j < chunkSize; ++j) {
      sharedData[threadIdx.x * chunkSize + j] = globalArray[chunkStart + j];
    }
  }

  __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads have completed copy

  // ... subsequent computations using sharedData ...
}
```

This example divides the global array into chunks based on the number of threads per block.  Each thread copies its assigned chunk. The `__syncthreads()` ensures all threads finish before accessing `sharedData`. This approach is suitable when the access pattern is independent across threads after the copy.

**Example 2:  Optimized Chunk-Based Copy with Atomic Operations (for specific scenarios):**

```cuda
__global__ void largeArrayCopyAtomic(const float* globalArray, float* sharedArray, int N) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[SM_SIZE];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
      atomicAdd((int*) &sharedData[i % SM_SIZE], __float_as_int(globalArray[i]));
  }

  __syncthreads();

  // ... process sharedData ... (Careful interpretation required due to atomicAdd)
}
```

This example utilizes `atomicAdd` for atomic updates to shared memory.  It’s beneficial if multiple threads might write to the same shared memory location, but it's considerably slower than `__syncthreads()`.  Note that this requires reinterpreting floats as integers and back.  This approach is suitable only in very specific situations where atomic operations are inherently required by the algorithm.

**Example 3: Handling Array Sizes not perfectly divisible by block size:**

```cuda
__global__ void largeArrayCopyRemainder(const float* globalArray, float* sharedArray, int N) {
    __shared__ float sharedData[SM_SIZE];

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int numThreads = blockDim.x * gridDim.x; // Total number of threads across all blocks
    int chunkSize = (N + numThreads -1) / numThreads; // Integer division ceiling


    int startIdx = i * chunkSize;
    int endIdx = min(startIdx + chunkSize, N); // Handle last block possibly having less elements.


    for (int j = startIdx; j < endIdx; ++j) {
        sharedData[j % SM_SIZE] = globalArray[j]; //Handle potential wrap around in shared memory
    }

    __syncthreads();
    // ... subsequent processing ...
}
```
This example addresses the case where `N` is not evenly divisible by the total number of threads, ensuring all elements from the global array are correctly copied. It incorporates a ceiling division to ensure all elements are handled and accounts for the possibility that the last block processes fewer elements than others.  The modulo operator ensures correct placement in shared memory even if the array size exceeds shared memory size.
