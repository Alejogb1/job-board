Efficient computation of partial derivatives is paramount in PyTorch's automatic differentiation framework, particularly when training models with numerous parameters.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks for image recognition highlighted a critical aspect: leveraging PyTorch's computational graph and its automatic gradient calculation capabilities is far more efficient than manual derivative computation.  Directly calculating partial derivatives analytically for complex models is intractable; the computational graph elegantly handles this complexity.

**1. Clear Explanation**

PyTorch's `autograd` package forms the backbone of automatic differentiation.  It constructs a dynamic computational graph, tracking operations performed on tensors.  When calculating gradients, `autograd` traverses this graph backward, applying the chain rule to compute partial derivatives with respect to each leaf node (parameters requiring gradient updates). This process, reverse-mode automatic differentiation, avoids the exponential complexity associated with forward-mode differentiation, making it ideal for training deep networks with many parameters.

The `requires_grad` attribute governs whether a tensor's gradients are tracked.  Setting `requires_grad=True` for a tensor includes it in the computational graph.  Operations on such tensors are recorded.  Calling `.backward()` on a scalar tensor (typically the loss function) initiates the backward pass, populating the `.grad` attribute of each tensor with `requires_grad=True`.

Effective utilization involves understanding computational graph construction and memory management.  Intermediate results are often not needed after gradient computation, and detaching parts of the graph using `.detach()` can significantly reduce memory usage.  Furthermore, optimizing the loss function and employing gradient accumulation techniques are crucial for handling large datasets that don't fit into memory.  Gradient accumulation simulates larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple smaller batches before performing an update.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Simple Linear Regression with Autograd**

```python
import torch

# Define parameters requiring gradients
w = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

# Sample data
x = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [5.0]])

# Forward pass
y_pred = w * x + b
loss = torch.mean((y_pred - y)**2) # MSE loss

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Print gradients
print("dw:", w.grad)
print("db:", b.grad)

# Update parameters (example using SGD)
learning_rate = 0.01
with torch.no_grad():
    w -= learning_rate * w.grad
    b -= learning_rate * b.grad
    w.grad.zero_()
    b.grad.zero_()

```

This example showcases basic autograd usage. The gradients `dw` and `db` are automatically calculated.  Note the crucial `w.grad.zero_()` and `b.grad.zero_()` calls; failing to zero gradients accumulates them across iterations, leading to incorrect updates.

**Example 2:  Implementing a Custom Layer with Autograd**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_size, output_size))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(output_size))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.mm(x, self.weight) + self.bias

# Example usage:
custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(input_size=5, output_size=3)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 5)
output = custom_layer(input_tensor)
loss = torch.mean(output**2)
loss.backward()

print("Weight gradients:", custom_layer.weight.grad)
print("Bias gradients:", custom_layer.bias.grad)
```

This illustrates creating a custom layer.  `nn.Parameter` designates tensors as parameters requiring gradient tracking. The `forward` method defines the layer's operation. `autograd` automatically handles the partial derivatives of the layer's output concerning its parameters.

**Example 3:  Efficient Gradient Accumulation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Define model, optimizer, etc.) ...

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
accumulation_steps = 4

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = loss_function(output, target)
        loss = loss / accumulation_steps # Normalize loss
        loss.backward()
        if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:  # Update parameters every accumulation_steps
            optimizer.step()
```

This example demonstrates gradient accumulation.  The loss is divided by `accumulation_steps` to normalize the gradient updates.  The optimizer steps only after accumulating gradients over multiple batches, simulating a larger effective batch size without requiring more memory.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `autograd` and `nn.Module`, are invaluable.  Deep learning textbooks covering automatic differentiation and backpropagation provide a strong theoretical foundation.  Finally, exploring optimization techniques within the context of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent is vital for practical implementation.  Examining PyTorch's source code for specific modules can offer insights into efficient gradient calculations and memory management strategies.
