TensorFlow 1.x's `tf.group(tf.local_variables_initializer(), tf.global_variables_initializer())` served as a crucial step for initializing both local and global variables before model execution.  However, this approach became obsolete with the transition to TensorFlow 2.x and its eager execution paradigm.  My experience working on large-scale distributed training systems in TensorFlow 1.10 highlighted the importance of correctly initializing variables; a misconfiguration could lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect training results.  The direct equivalent in later TensorFlow versions doesn't exist as a single function call, demanding a nuanced approach depending on the specific context.

**1. Explanation of the Change and Modern Equivalents:**

The core reason for the change lies in TensorFlow 2's shift away from explicit session management.  In TensorFlow 1.x, `tf.Session()` was fundamental, requiring explicit initialization of variables within that session using the `tf.global_variables_initializer()` and `tf.local_variables_initializer()` functions, grouped for sequential execution via `tf.group()`.  TensorFlow 2.x, by contrast, adopts eager execution where operations are executed immediately, obviating the need for explicit session management and, consequently, the explicit initialization step.

The initialization now happens automatically when the variables are first used within a computational graph.  This is often transparent to the user.  However, there are situations where more direct control is needed, such as when working with custom initialization routines or restoring models from checkpoints.

In such scenarios, the closest equivalent to the TensorFlow 1.x approach involves using the `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` and `tf.compat.v1.local_variables_initializer()` functions (within a `tf.compat.v1.Session()` context if operating in a non-eager environment)  or utilizing the variable's `initializer` property.  The latter approach is generally preferred for its conciseness and integration with the automatic initialization mechanism of TensorFlow 2.x.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  TensorFlow 1.x Style (for illustrative purposes only):**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

# Define some variables
global_var = tf.Variable(0, name="global_var")
local_var = tf.Variable(0, name="local_var", collections=[tf.compat.v1.GraphKeys.LOCAL_VARIABLES])

# TensorFlow 1.x initialization
init_op = tf.group(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer(), tf.compat.v1.local_variables_initializer())

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
    print("Global variable:", sess.run(global_var))
    print("Local variable:", sess.run(local_var))
```

This code demonstrates the original approach using the deprecated functions within a `tf.compat.v1.Session()`.  While functional, this approach is discouraged in modern TensorFlow.  The use of `tf.disable_v2_behavior()` is crucial to maintain compatibility with the old-style initialization.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.x – Implicit Initialization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define some variables
global_var = tf.Variable(0, name="global_var")
local_var = tf.Variable(0, name="local_var") # Local variable collection is handled automatically


# Variables are initialized automatically on first use
print("Global variable:", global_var.numpy())
print("Local variable:", local_var.numpy())

# Subsequent operations utilize the initialized variables
global_var.assign_add(1)
print("Global variable after assignment:", global_var.numpy())

```

This example showcases the default behavior in TensorFlow 2.x. Variables are initialized implicitly when first accessed, eliminating the need for explicit initialization calls. The `numpy()` method is used to retrieve the variable's value as a NumPy array. This is the recommended approach for most scenarios.


**Example 3: TensorFlow 2.x – Explicit Initialization with Custom Initializer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom initializer
my_initializer = tf.keras.initializers.Constant(value=5)

# Define variables with custom initializer
global_var = tf.Variable(initial_value=my_initializer(shape=()), name="global_var")
local_var = tf.Variable(initial_value=my_initializer(shape=()), name="local_var")

# Accessing the variables triggers initialization with the specified values.
print("Global variable:", global_var.numpy())
print("Local variable:", local_var.numpy())
```

This example illustrates how to explicitly initialize variables with a custom initializer in TensorFlow 2.x. This approach provides more control over the initialization process, which is particularly useful when working with specialized initialization techniques or restoring from checkpoints with non-default initializations. The `keras.initializers` module offers a variety of built-in initializers.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource for resolving such version-related discrepancies.  Pay close attention to the version-specific guides and API references.  Explore the TensorFlow API documentation for functions related to variable initialization and management within the context of your TensorFlow version. Additionally, searching for solutions on Stack Overflow, while focusing on the specific TensorFlow version involved, often reveals valuable insights and alternative approaches.  Finally, studying example code in TensorFlow tutorials and model repositories can provide context-specific illustrations.
