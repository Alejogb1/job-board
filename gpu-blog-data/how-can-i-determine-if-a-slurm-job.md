Determining GPU utilization within a SLURM job requires a multi-faceted approach, depending on the level of detail needed and the tools available within your specific cluster environment.  My experience managing high-throughput computing clusters for several years has shown that a simple check for GPU allocation isn't always sufficient; true utilization demands a deeper inspection of resource usage during runtime.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

SLURM, the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management, doesn't directly expose GPU usage as a readily available metric within the `squeue` or `sacct` commands in the same way it displays CPU or memory usage. While you can see *if* GPUs were requested in the job's allocation (`scontrol show job <jobid>`), determining *whether* those GPUs are actively being used requires examining the processes running within the job's environment. This can involve several techniques, ranging from rudimentary shell commands within the job script itself to utilizing specialized monitoring tools provided by your cluster administrator.

The key lies in understanding that simply being allocated a GPU doesn't equate to utilization.  A job might be allocated GPUs but be stuck in an idle state, waiting for other processes, or encountering a bottleneck elsewhere.  Therefore, effective monitoring demands examining the GPU's workload at the process level.  The methods I'll illustrate focus on different levels of granularity and accessibility, making them appropriate for varied monitoring needs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic `nvidia-smi` within the Job Script:**

This approach is the most straightforward and offers real-time feedback within the SLURM job itself.  This method is suitable for jobs where immediate awareness of GPU utilization is critical.  However, it only provides a snapshot; continuous monitoring requires integrating it into a loop within the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1

# ... other SLURM directives ...

# Check GPU utilization at the start of the job.
echo "Initial GPU utilization:"
nvidia-smi

# ... Your GPU-intensive code ...

# Check GPU utilization after the code execution.
echo "Final GPU utilization:"
nvidia-smi

# ... rest of your script
```

**Commentary:** The `nvidia-smi` command is fundamental for NVIDIA GPU monitoring.  This script incorporates it before and after the GPU-intensive portion of the job, providing a comparative measure of utilization.  The output provides detailed information about GPU memory usage, utilization, and temperature.  Remember that the `#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1` directive requests one GPU; adjust this based on your job's needs.  This relies on `nvidia-smi` being available in the SLURM environment.  Its absence would result in an error.  Error handling should be included in a production environment.

**Example 2:  `gpustat` Integration for Cluster-Wide Overview:**

If your cluster provides the `gpustat` utility (often installed as part of common cluster management tools), it offers a more comprehensive, cluster-wide perspective.  This is useful for administrators or users wanting to observe GPU usage across multiple jobs simultaneously.

```bash
gpustat
```

**Commentary:**  `gpustat` displays a concise overview of all GPUs on the node, including their usage status within different jobs. This provides context beyond a single job.  The output format is highly configurable and often color-coded for improved readability. Note that the output shows usage from all processes running on the node, not just the current SLURM job.  To focus on a particular job, you would need to correlate its PID with the information provided by `gpustat`.  This command's efficacy depends on its availability and configuration within the SLURM environment.

**Example 3:  Custom Scripting with `nvidia-smi` and Logging:**

For detailed, persistent monitoring, a custom script combining `nvidia-smi` with logging functionality is essential. This approach is ideal for rigorous performance analysis, allowing for subsequent examination of GPU utilization trends.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH --output=gpu_usage.log

# ... other SLURM directives ...

while true; do
  nvidia-smi >> gpu_usage.log
  sleep 60
done
```


**Commentary:** This script continuously monitors and logs GPU usage to a file (`gpu_usage.log`). The `sleep 60` command sets the sampling interval to one minute. This provides a time-series data set reflecting GPU usage throughout the job's runtime.  The output log file can later be analyzed using tools like `awk`, `grep`, or spreadsheet software to identify usage patterns and potential bottlenecks.  Consider adding error handling and mechanisms to terminate the loop gracefully when the job finishes.  This is particularly important for long-running jobs to prevent indefinite logging.  The `>>` operator appends to the log file; using `>` would overwrite it each time.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For more advanced GPU monitoring and analysis, consider exploring the documentation for your specific cluster's monitoring tools.  These often provide web interfaces or command-line utilities designed specifically for tracking resource consumption.  The `nvidia-smi` manual page is highly recommended for understanding the command's various options and output formats. Familiarize yourself with shell scripting techniques for data manipulation and analysis.  Investigate tools specifically designed for analyzing log files and creating visualizations from time-series data.  Depending on the complexity of your applications, exploring profiler tools tailored for parallel computing frameworks like CUDA or OpenCL could provide invaluable insight into performance bottlenecks beyond basic GPU utilization. Finally, engage with your cluster's support staff; they are often invaluable for navigating cluster-specific tools and troubleshooting any difficulties you encounter.
