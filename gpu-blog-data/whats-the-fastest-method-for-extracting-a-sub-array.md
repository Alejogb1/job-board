The performance bottleneck in NumPy sub-array extraction often stems from unnecessary data copying.  Direct view slicing, leveraging NumPy's broadcasting capabilities, minimizes this overhead, yielding significantly faster extraction compared to methods involving explicit copying.  My experience optimizing high-throughput image processing pipelines has underscored this repeatedly.  Failing to utilize views results in substantial performance degradation, particularly with large arrays.

**1.  Explanation:**

NumPy's core strength lies in its memory-efficient handling of arrays.  When slicing a NumPy array, the default behavior is to create a *view* of the original array.  This view shares the same underlying data memory as the original, merely offering a different perspective – a window into the existing data.  Crucially, this avoids the costly operation of allocating new memory and copying data elements.  Conversely, using methods like `array.copy()` or list comprehensions necessitates data duplication, dramatically slowing down extraction, especially for large arrays.  Understanding the distinction between views and copies is paramount for optimizing NumPy array manipulations.

The speed difference becomes more pronounced when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays.  Incorrect slicing techniques can unintentionally trigger the creation of copies, concealing the underlying inefficiency.  Furthermore, the choice of slicing syntax impacts performance.  Using advanced indexing (boolean or integer arrays) often involves more computation than basic slicing, especially if the indices are not contiguous.  Therefore, basic slicing, when applicable, always remains the preferred method for extracting sub-arrays in terms of speed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Slicing (Fastest)**

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a large 2D array
large_array = np.random.rand(10000, 10000)

start_time = time.time()
# Extract a sub-array using basic slicing – a view is created
sub_array_view = large_array[1000:2000, 1000:2000] 
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Basic slicing time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Verify it's a view, not a copy
print(f"Data shares memory with original: {np.shares_memory(large_array, sub_array_view)}")


```

This example demonstrates the fastest approach.  `sub_array_view` is a view, not a copy, therefore it's very fast.  The `np.shares_memory` function confirms this.


**Example 2:  Advanced Indexing (Slower)**

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a large 2D array
large_array = np.random.rand(10000, 10000)

start_time = time.time()
# Extract using advanced indexing – more computationally expensive due to index generation
rows = np.arange(1000, 2000)
cols = np.arange(1000, 2000)
sub_array_adv = large_array[rows[:, np.newaxis], cols]
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Advanced indexing time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Verify it's a copy or view.  It will often be a copy in this approach unless the rows and cols were pre-calculated
print(f"Data shares memory with original: {np.shares_memory(large_array, sub_array_adv)}")
```

Advanced indexing, while flexible, can be slower than basic slicing because it necessitates generating and processing index arrays.  The memory sharing check here will often be `False`.


**Example 3: Copying (Slowest)**

```python
import numpy as np
import time
import copy

# Create a large 2D array
large_array = np.random.rand(10000, 10000)

start_time = time.time()
# Explicit copying – very slow for large arrays
sub_array_copy = copy.deepcopy(large_array[1000:2000, 1000:2000])
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Copying time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")


# Verify it's a copy
print(f"Data shares memory with original: {np.shares_memory(large_array, sub_array_copy)}")

```

This example explicitly creates a copy of the sub-array using `copy.deepcopy()`, demonstrating the slowest approach.  `np.shares_memory` will confirm that it does not share memory with the original.  This should clearly highlight the performance difference when compared to view based extraction.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more profound understanding of NumPy's internal workings, I recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation and the book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney.  Exploring the source code for NumPy's array manipulation functions provides invaluable insight.  Furthermore, profiling your code using tools like cProfile can pinpoint performance bottlenecks.  Finally, understanding memory management in Python is crucial for optimizing large array operations.  These resources, combined with practical experience, will enable you to master efficient NumPy array handling.
