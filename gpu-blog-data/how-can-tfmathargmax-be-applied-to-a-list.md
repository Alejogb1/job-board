The core challenge in applying `tf.math.argmax` to a list of tensors lies in handling the inherently variable dimensionality of the input.  `tf.math.argmax` expects a single tensor as input; directly applying it to a list will result in an error.  Over the years, working on large-scale TensorFlow projects involving sequential data processing and multi-modal analysis, I've encountered this issue frequently.  The solution hinges on understanding the desired output and leveraging TensorFlow's higher-order functions to efficiently process the list of tensors.  The approach will differ depending on whether you want the argmax for each tensor individually or the argmax across all tensors concatenated.


**1.  Explanation:**

The most straightforward approach is to iterate through the list of tensors and apply `tf.math.argmax` individually to each.  This is ideal when the argmax is needed for each tensor independently, reflecting a per-tensor maximum value index.  For example, in a scenario with multiple image inputs, each represented by a tensor, this would give the location of the maximum activation for each image separately.

Alternatively, if you need the argmax across the entire dataset represented by the concatenated tensors, a different strategy must be employed.  This would necessitate stacking the tensors into a single, higher-dimensional tensor before applying `tf.math.argmax`. The appropriate axis along which the argmax is computed must be specified.  This second scenario might apply to finding the index of the globally maximum activation across all images in the previous example.

Choosing between these two approaches depends fundamentally on the problem's nature.  The per-tensor approach is computationally less demanding for large datasets and offers more granular results.  The global approach provides a single, overarching maximum index, but at the cost of computational expense and potential loss of fine-grained information.

Further considerations include the potential for the tensors to have different shapes.  If this is the case, padding or other preprocessing steps become crucial before concatenation.  For instance, variable-length sequences may require padding to a uniform length before they can be stacked effectively.  Ignoring these disparities will lead to errors.  Shape consistency before global argmax calculation is paramount.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Per-tensor argmax**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def per_tensor_argmax(tensor_list):
  """Computes the argmax for each tensor in a list.

  Args:
    tensor_list: A list of TensorFlow tensors.  All tensors must have the same
                 number of dimensions, though the dimension sizes can differ.

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor containing the argmax for each input tensor.  The shape
    will be (len(tensor_list),).
  """
  argmax_list = [tf.math.argmax(tensor) for tensor in tensor_list]
  return tf.stack(argmax_list)

# Example usage:
tensor1 = tf.constant([1, 5, 2, 8, 3])
tensor2 = tf.constant([9, 1, 7, 2, 4])
tensor3 = tf.constant([3, 6, 0, 2, 9])

tensor_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]
result = per_tensor_argmax(tensor_list)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([3 0 4], shape=(3,), dtype=int64)

```

This example demonstrates a concise application of list comprehension to efficiently determine the argmax for each tensor within the list.  The resulting tensor neatly packages the individual argmax values, facilitating further processing.  Error handling for inconsistent tensor dimensions is omitted for brevity, but in a production environment, explicit checks are essential.

**Example 2: Global argmax after concatenation (same shape tensors)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def global_argmax_after_concatenation(tensor_list):
  """Computes the global argmax across a list of tensors of the same shape.

  Args:
    tensor_list: A list of TensorFlow tensors. All tensors must have the same shape.

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor containing the global argmax index.  Returns -1 if 
    tensor_list is empty.
  """
  if not tensor_list:
    return tf.constant(-1, dtype=tf.int64)
  stacked_tensor = tf.stack(tensor_list)
  global_argmax = tf.math.argmax(tf.reshape(stacked_tensor, [-1]))
  return global_argmax

# Example usage:
tensor1 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor2 = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
tensor_list = [tensor1, tensor2]
result = global_argmax_after_concatenation(tensor_list)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor(7, shape=(), dtype=int64)

```

This example highlights the importance of stacking and reshaping before applying `tf.math.argmax`.  The `tf.reshape` function flattens the stacked tensor, allowing a single argmax operation to identify the global maximum.  The check for an empty list enhances robustness.


**Example 3: Global argmax after concatenation and padding (variable shape tensors)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def global_argmax_with_padding(tensor_list, max_length):
  """Computes the global argmax across a list of tensors with variable lengths,
     padding to a consistent length before concatenation.

  Args:
    tensor_list: A list of TensorFlow tensors. Tensors can have different lengths
                  in the first dimension.
    max_length: The maximum length to pad the tensors to.

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor containing the global argmax index. Returns -1 if the
    input list is empty.
  """
  if not tensor_list:
    return tf.constant(-1, dtype=tf.int64)
  padded_tensors = [tf.pad(tensor, [[0, max_length - tf.shape(tensor)[0]], [0, 0]]) for tensor in tensor_list]
  stacked_tensor = tf.concat(padded_tensors, axis=0)
  global_argmax = tf.math.argmax(stacked_tensor)
  return global_argmax


# Example Usage:
tensor1 = tf.constant([[1,2],[3,4]])
tensor2 = tf.constant([[5,6]])
tensor_list = [tensor1, tensor2]
result = global_argmax_with_padding(tensor_list, 2)
print(result) # Output:  tf.Tensor(3, shape=(), dtype=int64)


```

This example tackles the realistic scenario of tensors with varying shapes.  Padding ensures uniform dimensions before concatenation, preventing errors.  The `tf.concat` function efficiently joins the padded tensors.  Again, error handling for empty inputs is included.  The choice of padding method (e.g., pre-padding, post-padding, value used for padding) depends on the specific application and its impact on the final result.
