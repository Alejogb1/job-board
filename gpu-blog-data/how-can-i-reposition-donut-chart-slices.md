Donut charts, while visually appealing, present challenges when precise slice positioning is required.  My experience developing data visualization tools for financial reporting highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  Standard charting libraries often lack fine-grained control over individual slice placement beyond simple angular ordering.  Therefore, achieving custom repositioning requires a deeper understanding of the underlying geometry and a willingness to depart from the convenience of readily available functions.

The core issue lies in the polar coordinate system used to represent donut charts.  Slices are defined by their start and end angles, along with their inner and outer radii.  Repositioning involves manipulating these parameters, often requiring trigonometric calculations to ensure consistent spacing and avoid overlapping segments.  A naive approach of simply altering the angles can lead to distorted spacing and visually unappealing results.  Instead, we must consider the arc length of each slice and the desired spatial relationships between them.


**1.  Understanding the Geometry**

Each slice's position is determined by its central angle, θ.  Given a starting angle θ<sub>start</sub> and a slice's arc length, s, the ending angle, θ<sub>end</sub>, is calculated as follows:

θ<sub>end</sub> = θ<sub>start</sub> + (s / r)

where:

* θ<sub>start</sub> and θ<sub>end</sub> are in radians.
* s is the arc length of the slice.
* r is the average radius of the donut chart ( (outerRadius + innerRadius) / 2).

This formula forms the foundation of our repositioning strategy.  We can't directly manipulate the position in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) because the chart is inherently polar. We must work with angles and radii.


**2.  Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate techniques to reposition donut chart slices, using Python with the Matplotlib library.  I've chosen Matplotlib due to its widespread use and readily available documentation, but the principles apply to other libraries like Plotly or D3.js with suitable adaptations.

**Example 1:  Simple Angular Shift**

This example demonstrates the simplest approach: shifting slices by a fixed angle.  While straightforward, it’s susceptible to overlaps and uneven spacing, particularly with slices of varying sizes.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]
explode = (0, 0.1, 0, 0)  # explode the 2nd slice

# Introduce angular shift
shift = np.pi / 6  # 30 degrees

fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.pie(sizes, explode=explode, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%',
        shadow=True, startangle=90 + np.degrees(shift)) #Apply shift to startangle

ax1.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.
plt.show()

```

This code shifts all slices by 30 degrees (π/6 radians).  Note that this approach does not account for individual slice sizes and can lead to uneven distribution.


**Example 2:  Proportionate Spacing based on Arc Length**

This example calculates the arc length of each slice and uses it to determine its position.  This leads to more even spacing but still relies on angular manipulation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]
radius = 1

#Calculate arc lengths
total = sum(sizes)
arc_lengths = [size / total * 2 * np.pi for size in sizes]

#Cumulative angles
angles = np.cumsum(arc_lengths)
angles = np.concatenate(([0],angles[:-1]))

#Position adjustments (example: push slice 'B' outwards)
adjustments = [0,0.1,0,0] #Adjust radius for each slice

fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
for i in range(len(labels)):
    ax1.add_patch(plt.Circle((0,0), angles[i]+adjustments[i], fill=False, linewidth=2))
    ax1.add_patch(plt.Wedge((0,0), angles[i+1]+adjustments[i], np.degrees(angles[i]), np.degrees(angles[i+1])))
ax1.set_aspect('equal')
plt.show()
```

Here, we calculate the arc length for each slice and use it to determine its position. The `adjustments` array allows for individual radius modification, effectively repositioning slices radially.

**Example 3:  Custom Positioning with Cartesian Coordinates (Advanced)**

This approach involves abandoning the direct use of Matplotlib's pie chart function. We calculate the Cartesian coordinates of each slice's vertices and plot them individually using polygons.  This grants complete control over positioning, but requires more manual calculation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]
inner_radius = 0.5
outer_radius = 1

total = sum(sizes)
angles = np.cumsum([size / total * 2 * np.pi for size in sizes])
angles = np.concatenate(([0], angles[:-1]))


#Manually adjusting positions
x_pos = [0.2, -0.1, 0.5, -0.3] #x offsets
y_pos = [0.1, -0.2, 0, 0.4]  # y offsets

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

for i in range(len(labels)):
    theta1 = angles[i]
    theta2 = angles[i+1]
    x1 = inner_radius * np.cos(theta1) + x_pos[i]
    y1 = inner_radius * np.sin(theta1) + y_pos[i]
    x2 = inner_radius * np.cos(theta2) + x_pos[i]
    y2 = inner_radius * np.sin(theta2) + y_pos[i]
    x3 = outer_radius * np.cos(theta2) + x_pos[i]
    y3 = outer_radius * np.sin(theta2) + y_pos[i]
    x4 = outer_radius * np.cos(theta1) + x_pos[i]
    y4 = outer_radius * np.sin(theta1) + y_pos[i]
    polygon = [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4)]
    ax.fill(*zip(*polygon), label=labels[i])
ax.set_aspect('equal')
plt.show()

```

This example provides the most control, letting you manually adjust the (x, y) position of each slice's center. However, it demands a significant increase in coding complexity.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of polar coordinates and their application in data visualization, I recommend reviewing standard trigonometry textbooks and comprehensive guides on data visualization techniques.  Exploring the documentation of your chosen charting library will be essential for understanding its specific capabilities and limitations concerning custom chart element placement.  Furthermore, studying the source code of open-source charting libraries can provide valuable insight into their internal workings and implementation strategies.
