The core issue with applying `tf.strided_slice` to a rank-2 tensor when expecting a rank-1 output lies in the specification of the `begin`, `end`, and `strides` parameters.  Incorrectly defining these parameters will result in a rank-2 tensor being returned, even if only a single row or column is ostensibly selected.  My experience implementing complex data pipelines for image recognition in TensorFlow, particularly those involving custom loss functions and highly optimized data preprocessing, frequently encountered this precise problem.  Successfully resolving it necessitates a precise understanding of how `tf.strided_slice` interacts with multi-dimensional arrays.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.strided_slice` operates on tensors by specifying the starting index (`begin`), ending index (`end`), and step size (`strides`) for each dimension.  For a rank-2 tensor (a matrix), this means you have separate `begin`, `end`, and `strides` for the rows and columns.  To obtain a rank-1 tensor (a vector), you must carefully select a single row or column.  The critical aspect often overlooked is that while you might conceptually select a single row or column, the resulting slice retains the dimensionality of the selected row or column unless explicitly reshaped.  Thus, slicing a single row from a 10x5 matrix results in a 1x5 tensor, not a rank-1 tensor of length 5.  The solution is to explicitly reshape the resulting tensor using `tf.reshape` to reduce its rank.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Extracting a Row**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a rank-2 tensor (3x4 matrix)
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                       [5, 6, 7, 8],
                       [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Extract the second row (index 1)
row_index = 1
row_slice = tf.strided_slice(tensor_2d, [row_index, 0], [row_index + 1, 4], [1, 1])

# Reshape to a rank-1 tensor
row_vector = tf.reshape(row_slice, [-1])

# Verify the result
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(row_slice)) #Output: [[5 6 7 8]] - Still rank 2
    print(sess.run(row_vector)) #Output: [5 6 7 8] - Rank 1
```

Here, we first extract the second row. Notice that `tf.strided_slice` returns a rank-2 tensor, even though only one row is selected.  `tf.reshape([-1])` dynamically infers the necessary dimension, effectively flattening the tensor into a rank-1 vector.  I found using `-1` to be significantly more efficient and maintainable than explicitly calculating the length of the row within complex pipelines.


**Example 2: Extracting a Column**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                       [5, 6, 7, 8],
                       [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Extract the third column (index 2)
col_index = 2
col_slice = tf.strided_slice(tensor_2d, [0, col_index], [3, col_index + 1], [1, 1])

# Reshape to rank-1
col_vector = tf.reshape(col_slice, [-1])

#Verify the result
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(col_slice)) # Output: [[3] [7] [11]] - Still rank 2
    print(sess.run(col_vector)) # Output: [3 7 11] - Rank 1
```

This example demonstrates extracting a column.  The principle remains the same: `tf.strided_slice` returns a rank-2 tensor, necessitating a `tf.reshape` operation to reduce the rank to 1.  The use of `[0, col_index]` and `[3, col_index + 1]` correctly specifies the starting and ending points for the slice along both dimensions, accounting for the columnar extraction. This technique proved crucial in my work processing feature vectors derived from image patches.


**Example 3: Handling Variable-Sized Tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder for a variable-sized rank-2 tensor
tensor_2d = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None])

# Extract the first row (assuming at least one row exists)
row_slice = tf.strided_slice(tensor_2d, [0, 0], [1, tf.shape(tensor_2d)[1]], [1, 1])

#Reshape to rank-1
row_vector = tf.reshape(row_slice, [-1])

# Example usage with a specific tensor (replace with your data)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    input_tensor = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    result = sess.run(row_vector, feed_dict={tensor_2d: input_tensor})
    print(result) # Output: [1. 2. 3.]
```

This example uses placeholders, which are crucial for handling variable-sized inputs, a common scenario in machine learning.  Here, the second dimension's size (`tf.shape(tensor_2d)[1]`) is dynamically determined during runtime, ensuring the slice correctly captures the entire first row regardless of the tensor's width.  The subsequent reshape guarantees a rank-1 tensor. This approach was essential for my projects that processed batches of variable-sized input data.  I particularly valued the flexibility of placeholders in managing data streams.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on TensorFlow or deep learning fundamentals.  A dedicated guide or tutorial specifically focused on tensor manipulation and slicing in TensorFlow.  The TensorFlow API reference, specifically focusing on the `tf.strided_slice` and `tf.reshape` functions.  These resources will provide a far deeper understanding of tensor operations and their nuances.  Careful study of these resources is indispensable for mastering tensor manipulation.  Understanding the underlying mechanics of tensor operations is vital for efficient code development and debugging.
