The `NotImplementedError: numpy() is only available when eager execution is enabled` arises from a fundamental mismatch between TensorFlow's execution modes and the expectation of NumPy-like immediate array operations.  My experience resolving this error stems from years of working with large-scale TensorFlow models for image processing, where efficient array manipulation is paramount.  The core issue lies in TensorFlow's ability to execute operations either eagerly (immediately) or graph-based (compiled later). NumPy's functionality expects immediate execution, a behavior not inherently available in TensorFlow's graph mode.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, by default, can operate in two distinct modes: eager execution and graph execution. Eager execution means that operations are performed immediately as they are encountered.  Graph execution, conversely, builds a computational graph which is later executed.  The `tf.numpy()` function, a convenient bridge between TensorFlow tensors and NumPy arrays, is explicitly designed for eager execution.  When TensorFlow is running in graph mode, this function is unavailable, leading to the `NotImplementedError`.  This is because graph mode necessitates building the complete computational graph before any actual computation occurs.  `tf.numpy()` attempts to perform operations directly, which conflicts with this deferred execution strategy.  Therefore, the error indicates that an attempt is being made to use NumPy-style operations within a context where immediate computation is unavailable.  The solution lies in either switching to eager execution or refactoring the code to use TensorFlow's graph-compatible operations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Switching to Eager Execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)  # Enable eager execution globally

# ... your code using tf.numpy() ...

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
numpy_array = tf.numpy(tensor)  # Now this works

print(numpy_array)
print(type(numpy_array))
```

This example demonstrates the simplest solution: globally enabling eager execution.  `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)` forces all subsequent TensorFlow operations to execute eagerly.  This bypasses the graph mode entirely.  While effective, it's generally recommended for debugging and smaller projects. For large-scale models, the overhead of eager execution can be significant, impacting performance.

**Example 2:  Using TensorFlow Operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Instead of tf.numpy(), use TensorFlow's built-in operations
squared_tensor = tf.square(tensor)
sum_tensor = tf.reduce_sum(squared_tensor)

print(squared_tensor)
print(sum_tensor)
```

This example avoids the `tf.numpy()` function altogether. Instead, it leverages TensorFlow's built-in operations (`tf.square`, `tf.reduce_sum`).  These operations are designed to function seamlessly within both eager and graph modes. This approach is generally preferred for production-ready code due to its optimization potential within the TensorFlow graph.  It requires a shift in mindset, replacing NumPy-style operations with their TensorFlow equivalents.


**Example 3:  Contextual Eager Execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function  # This function will run in graph mode
def my_graph_function(tensor):
    #  Attempting to use tf.numpy() here would raise the error
    #  Instead use tf.convert_to_tensor to ensure compatibility
    numpy_compatible_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(tensor)
    result = tf.reduce_mean(numpy_compatible_tensor)
    return result

@tf.function
def my_eager_function(tensor):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape: # Needs eager execution internally
        result = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(tensor))
    gradients = tape.gradient(result, tensor)
    return gradients

tensor = tf.constant([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])

result1 = my_graph_function(tensor) #This runs in graph mode
print(result1)
result2 = my_eager_function(tensor) #This internally uses eager execution
print(result2)


```

This more advanced example highlights how to manage eager and graph execution within a larger program.  The `@tf.function` decorator compiles a function into a TensorFlow graph, allowing for optimization. Note the use of `tf.convert_to_tensor()` within the graph function to handle potential type mismatches.  However, the calculation of gradients in `my_eager_function` requires eager execution within the `tf.GradientTape()` context. This demonstrates a nuanced approach where specific sections of the code might necessitate different execution modes.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on eager execution and graph execution, are indispensable.  Understanding the core concepts of TensorFlow's execution modes is crucial.  Additionally, reviewing the documentation for `tf.function`, `tf.config`, and `tf.convert_to_tensor` will provide a deeper understanding of these key functions.  Exploring example code from the TensorFlow tutorials that incorporate complex computations will demonstrate effective strategies for managing execution modes within larger projects.  Furthermore, mastering the equivalents of common NumPy operations within the TensorFlow API is essential for efficient and robust code.  Finally, consider exploring specialized TensorFlow documentation for your specific task (e.g., image processing, natural language processing), as optimal practices can vary depending on the application.
