Jupyter Notebook's ability to import TensorFlow and Keras, even when they are correctly installed within the operating system's environment, is contingent upon the specific environment within which Jupyter itself is running. The core issue lies not in the installation of the libraries themselves, but rather the Python interpreter and its associated package location known to Jupyter's kernel. This distinction is crucial. If the Jupyter kernel is utilizing a different Python environment than the one where TensorFlow and Keras were installed, an `ImportError` will occur.

Let’s examine this with reference to my experience working on several machine learning projects over the past few years. Initially, I managed all project dependencies within a base Python installation. This worked well enough for simple scripting, but resulted in conflicts as projects grew. I quickly learned to leverage virtual environments for isolating project-specific dependencies. The situation regarding Jupyter and library imports then became clearer.

The heart of the matter is this: Jupyter's kernel must be pointed to the same Python interpreter where TensorFlow and Keras reside. The `jupyter kernelspec list` command is invaluable here. It displays available kernels and their associated Python executables. If the path shown by this command differs from the Python executable where the TensorFlow/Keras installation lives, then import errors are guaranteed.

To diagnose this further, consider an scenario where one installs TensorFlow and Keras using pip. Let's say we create a virtual environment named "ml_env" using a common command like `python -m venv ml_env`. After activating the environment and installing TensorFlow and Keras via `pip install tensorflow keras`, the libraries are available *within that environment*. But if the current kernel in Jupyter points to the system-wide Python install or another virtual environment, they will not be accessible.

Let’s explore three code examples that highlight this problem, along with methods for resolution.

**Example 1: The Unsuccessful Import**

The following notebook cell would fail to import TensorFlow if the kernel is pointing to the incorrect Python environment:

```python
# Example 1: Unsuccessful import attempt
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print("TensorFlow successfully imported.")
except ImportError:
    print("TensorFlow could not be imported. Check the kernel environment.")
```

*Commentary:* This first example is meant to fail under specific conditions. Here, if the associated Python environment for the Jupyter kernel *does not* have TensorFlow installed, the `import` statement will raise an `ImportError`, triggering the except block. Crucially, the message "TensorFlow could not be imported" does not imply that TensorFlow is not present on the system; rather, it means the *specific kernel environment* lacks the library. This is typically due to an active kernel that points to a base or different virtual environment. The code itself is valid; it is a diagnostic, meant to illustrate a potential failure mode. It's a starting point for debugging dependency issues.

**Example 2: Identifying the Kernel Environment**

The next cell uses `sys` module to display the executable path of the current python interpreter. This path needs to be compared with path where TensorFlow is installed.

```python
# Example 2: Inspecting the current Python executable
import sys

print(f"Python executable path: {sys.executable}")

#This line to be run in shell/terminal and not within the notebook cell
#pip show tensorflow
```
*Commentary:* This second example is designed to surface information about the Python environment that the Jupyter notebook kernel is actively using. Specifically, `sys.executable` provides the full path of the Python interpreter. It is crucial to compare this path with the path where TensorFlow and Keras are actually installed. One can obtain path where TensorFlow is installed by running the `pip show tensorflow` command in terminal while the virtual environment where TensorFlow is installed is active. If the two paths do not match, it unequivocally pinpoints the root cause of the `ImportError` from Example 1. The `pip show` command must be executed outside the notebook environment, as it is a terminal command for querying the pip package manager. Understanding the difference between these two environments – the notebook's Python and the environment where the libraries are installed – is the first step toward resolution. This example is about visibility, and it provides diagnostic data.

**Example 3: Successful Import with Correct Kernel**

If, for example, I had created a kernel within the `ml_env` virtual environment using `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ml_env` command, then the following cell *would* successfully import TensorFlow after selecting the “ml_env” kernel within Jupyter.

```python
# Example 3: Successful import
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    import keras
    print(f"Keras version: {keras.__version__}")
    print("TensorFlow and Keras successfully imported.")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Import Error: {e}")

```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the desired state, where both TensorFlow and Keras import successfully. Assuming the Jupyter notebook is using a kernel that corresponds to a virtual environment (such as the one demonstrated in Example 2), that has both TensorFlow and Keras installed, the `import` statements will execute without any issues. This shows the resolution of the initial issue described in the beginning of this response. The `try...except` block is still present, not because an error is expected, but as a good practice in exception handling. The successful import results in printing the versions of the imported libraries and confirms that the correct kernel is being used. This example shows the expected outcome when all dependencies are aligned.

In summary, the import failure is nearly always a consequence of the kernel using a different Python interpreter than the one where the libraries were installed. This discrepancy is not a fault of either Jupyter or the libraries; it simply illustrates the need for careful environment management.

To avoid confusion, consider these general strategies in future projects:

1.  **Virtual Environments:** Always isolate project dependencies using virtual environments (or equivalent, like conda environments).
2.  **Kernel Creation:** When working with virtual environments, create specific Jupyter kernels for each environment as demonstrated.
3.  **Kernel Verification:** Double-check the associated Python executable of your kernels using `jupyter kernelspec list` to ensure alignment with your virtual environment.
4.  **Pip Show Command:** In your terminal while the virtual environment is activated, use `pip show tensorflow` (or `pip show keras`) to verify installation location. Compare this with the path shown in your Jupyter notebook.

For more in depth information, I recommend consulting documentation on Python virtual environments, Jupyter Kernels and the `ipykernel` package. Documentation related to `pip` and the `sys` module in Python is also very useful for environment debugging. These resources collectively will give you a solid understanding of how environments are structured and the debugging practices that are necessary.
