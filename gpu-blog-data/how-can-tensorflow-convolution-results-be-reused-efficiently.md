In convolutional neural networks, the computation of feature maps often presents a bottleneck, particularly in scenarios with overlapping receptive fields or shared convolutional layers. Reusing pre-computed convolution results, rather than recalculating them repeatedly, can substantially improve performance, especially in applications involving video processing, recurrent networks, or hierarchical feature extraction. I've leveraged such strategies extensively in my work optimizing real-time image analysis pipelines.

The primary methods for efficiently reusing TensorFlow convolution results revolve around the concept of **memoization** and mindful graph construction. Instead of executing the convolution operation directly on the input data every time it's needed, one can store the resulting feature map and retrieve it when the same convolution parameters and input (or a portion thereof) are encountered again. The key is structuring the TensorFlow graph in a way that promotes this reuse.

**Explicit Memoization:**

The most direct approach involves storing the output of a convolutional layer in a Python variable or a TensorFlow variable, checking if the result is already computed, and returning the stored value if available. This method requires careful management of the stored values and is particularly effective when dealing with static input data within a fixed computational sequence, or when different parts of the graph depend on shared convolutions. For example, suppose we have a convolutional layer whose output is needed for both a primary processing pathway and an auxiliary task:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cached_conv_layer(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding, strides, cached_output=None):
  """Applies convolution and caches the result."""
  if cached_output is None:
    output_tensor = tf.layers.conv2d(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding=padding, strides=strides)
    return output_tensor, output_tensor  # Return both result and cached result
  else:
    return cached_output, cached_output # Return cached result twice
```
In this `cached_conv_layer` function, the `cached_output` acts as a memo. On the first call with a particular input, the convolution is performed, and both the result and a copy to serve as the cached output are returned. Subsequent calls with the same `cached_output` will simply return the stored result without recomputation.

To illustrate its use:
```python
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([1, 64, 64, 3])
filters = 32
kernel_size = 3
padding = 'same'
strides = 1

cached_output = None

# First invocation
conv_output1, cached_output = cached_conv_layer(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding, strides, cached_output)


# Later in graph or iteration
conv_output2, _ = cached_conv_layer(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding, strides, cached_output)


# conv_output2 is a reused copy of conv_output1
print(conv_output1)
print(conv_output2)

```
This demonstrates basic memoization. The `cached_output` variable is passed between calls. If the inputs are the same (or a cached output is provided) the computation is skipped. This is not ideal as this caching requires the user to manage state explicitly and isn't ideal with larger, more complex graphs.

**Shared Weights and Intermediate Operations:**

Another method focuses on leveraging the shared nature of convolutional layer weights. If multiple inputs are to be processed by the same convolutional layer, the layer itself should be defined once, and its output used for all relevant computations. This is TensorFlow's default behavior when defining layers through `tf.layers` or `tf.keras.layers`. However, explicit care must be taken to ensure the layer instantiation occurs only once and that its reference is then used multiple times.

Here’s an example where a single convolutional layer operates on distinct input tensors:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def define_shared_conv_layer(filters, kernel_size, padding, strides):
  """Defines a convolutional layer."""
  conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding=padding, strides=strides)
  return conv_layer

def apply_shared_conv_layer(conv_layer, input_tensor):
    """Applies the layer to input."""
    output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)
    return output_tensor

filters = 32
kernel_size = 3
padding = 'same'
strides = 1

# Define the shared layer once
shared_conv_layer = define_shared_conv_layer(filters, kernel_size, padding, strides)

# Two different input tensors

input_tensor_1 = tf.random.normal([1, 64, 64, 3])
input_tensor_2 = tf.random.normal([1, 64, 64, 3])


# Apply same layer to both inputs

conv_output_1 = apply_shared_conv_layer(shared_conv_layer, input_tensor_1)
conv_output_2 = apply_shared_conv_layer(shared_conv_layer, input_tensor_2)


print(conv_output_1)
print(conv_output_2)

```

In this code, we create the convolutional layer once using `define_shared_conv_layer` and then pass the instantiated layer into `apply_shared_conv_layer` multiple times to process the different input data. Internally, TensorFlow tracks that the same layer instance is being used and will share the learned kernels. It is not storing the *result* of a specific application to a tensor. However, it will reuse the layer's state (the kernels and biases).

**TensorFlow Graph Optimization and Automatic Reuse:**

TensorFlow's computational graph optimization also contributes implicitly to result reuse, although this is often opaque to the user. During graph construction and optimization, the framework identifies identical or redundant subgraphs. This is particularly noticeable when working with multiple calls to the same function that generates a similar subgraph. If multiple branches of the graph rely on the same convolutional operations performed on the same inputs, TensorFlow can avoid repeated calculations of the same result.
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def generate_conv_branch(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding, strides):
    """Defines a reusable conv layer branch."""
    conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding=padding, strides=strides)
    output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)
    return output_tensor


filters = 32
kernel_size = 3
padding = 'same'
strides = 1

input_tensor = tf.random.normal([1, 64, 64, 3])


# Two branches that do the same
conv_output_branch1 = generate_conv_branch(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding, strides)
conv_output_branch2 = generate_conv_branch(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, padding, strides)


# TensorFlow can identify identical branches when running.
print(conv_output_branch1)
print(conv_output_branch2)


```
In this code snippet the same computational branch is repeated, and under the hood, TensorFlow will attempt to optimize and eliminate the redundancy. This is the simplest example and the gains will not be as clear as with the earlier examples as the graph can identify this with relative ease.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of these concepts, consult materials on computational graph optimization, memoization techniques in functional programming, and TensorFlow's specific documentation on layer sharing and variable scope management. Furthermore, research papers focusing on efficient CNN implementations, particularly for real-time applications, will reveal numerous practical techniques for minimizing redundant computation. In my experience, the TensorFlow API documentation itself is very clear on how to declare and use layers that share weights. Understanding the mechanics of TensorFlow’s variable scopes helps understand the underlying mechanics. Finally, understanding how optimizers like graph fusion function can help with these optimization strategies as they can lead to implicit reuse of intermediates. Finally, studying the design patterns of complex neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, ResNet) reveals the application of these principles in practice.
