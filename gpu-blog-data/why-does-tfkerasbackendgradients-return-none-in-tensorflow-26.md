`tf.keras.backend.gradients()` returning `None` in TensorFlow 2.6 often stems from a mismatch between the computation graph's construction and the variables involved in the gradient calculation.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects, particularly involving complex custom layers and loss functions within TensorFlow 2.x, pinpoints this as the primary cause.  The function fundamentally relies on the ability to trace back through the computational graph to determine the dependencies and calculate partial derivatives.  If this trace is broken – for example, due to eager execution being improperly managed or incompatible variable usage – the function will fail to identify the gradient path and consequently return `None`.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in how TensorFlow constructs and manages its computational graph.  In eager execution mode (the default in TensorFlow 2.x), operations are executed immediately rather than being compiled into a graph.  While this offers flexibility, it can disrupt the gradient calculation process if not carefully managed.  `tf.keras.backend.gradients()` inherently expects a defined computational graph.  If a tensor used in the gradient calculation isn't part of a traceable graph – for instance, it's created outside the `tf.function` scope or originates from a non-differentiable operation – the gradient calculation will fail.

Furthermore, the variables involved must be properly defined and tracked.  Simply declaring a `tf.Variable` is insufficient; the variable must be actively participating in the computation graph that leads to the output tensor for which gradients are being computed.  Variables created outside this scope, or variables whose values are overwritten in a way that breaks the dependency chain, will result in a `None` return.  Another potential cause is the use of control flow operations (like `tf.cond` or loops) without proper handling within `tf.function`.  These can introduce complexities in the graph that interfere with automatic differentiation if not meticulously defined.  Finally, ensure the target tensor for which gradients are computed is actually differentiable.  Constants, for example, do not have gradients.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Usage:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = x * 2.0
z = tf.constant(5.0)  # Constant; cannot have a gradient
gradients = tf.keras.backend.gradients(y, [x,z])
print(gradients)  # Output: [<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>, None]

x2 = tf.Variable(2.0, name = "x2")
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y2 = x2**2
dy_dx2 = tape.gradient(y2, x2)
print(dy_dx2) #Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=4.0>
```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates the difference between a `tf.Variable` correctly used within a computation and a `tf.constant`.  The gradient with respect to `x` is calculated correctly, but the gradient with respect to `z` (a constant) is `None`.  The second part illustrates the use of `tf.GradientTape`, a more modern and recommended approach.


**Example 2:  Eager Execution Issues:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_function(x):
  y = x * x
  return y

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = my_function(x)
gradients = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(gradients) #Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>


x_eager = tf.Variable(3.0)
y_eager = x_eager * x_eager
gradients_eager = tf.keras.backend.gradients(y_eager, x_eager)
print(gradients_eager)  # Output: [None]
```

**Commentary:**  This showcases the impact of eager execution.  Inside `tf.function`, the gradient calculation works as expected.  However, outside `tf.function` (eager execution), the gradient calculation using `tf.keras.backend.gradients()` fails, returning `None`.  This highlights the need to ensure computations are within the `tf.function` context when using `tf.keras.backend.gradients()`.


**Example 3: Control Flow without `tf.function`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
if x > 1.0:
    y = x * x
else:
    y = x
gradients = tf.keras.backend.gradients(y, x)
print(gradients) # Output: [None]

@tf.function
def controlled_computation(x):
    if x > 1.0:
        y = x * x
    else:
        y = x
    return y

x2 = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y2 = controlled_computation(x2)
gradients2 = tape.gradient(y2, x2)
print(gradients2) #Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=4.0>
```

**Commentary:**  This demonstrates the importance of incorporating control flow within a `tf.function`.  Without it, the gradient calculation fails.  The second part shows the successful gradient calculation when control flow is properly managed within a `tf.function`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on automatic differentiation and `tf.GradientTape`, are invaluable.  Thoroughly reviewing examples and tutorials focused on custom layers and loss functions within Keras will greatly aid in understanding the intricacies of graph construction and gradient computation.  Consult the documentation for `tf.function` and its implications for eager execution.  Finally, a strong grasp of calculus, specifically partial derivatives, is essential for understanding the underlying mechanics of gradient-based optimization.  Understanding these concepts helps prevent issues caused by incorrect mathematical assumptions.
