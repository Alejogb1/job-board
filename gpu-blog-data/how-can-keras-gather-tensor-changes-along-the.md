Tracking tensor modifications across the batch dimension in Keras necessitates a nuanced understanding of the framework's underlying mechanisms and the limitations imposed by its computational graph.  My experience optimizing large-scale image classification models highlighted the crucial role of custom layers and callbacks for achieving this.  Directly accessing and monitoring changes within the batch during forward and backward passes isn't readily available through standard Keras functionalities. Instead, we must leverage custom components to achieve this level of granular control.

The core challenge lies in the inherent nature of Keras's operations.  Keras primarily operates on tensors representing batches, not individual samples. Standard layer outputs only reveal the aggregated results across the entire batch.  Therefore, observing changes *within* the batch demands a departure from this default behavior.  To effectively monitor these changes, I've found three principal approaches, each with specific strengths and weaknesses depending on the application.

**1. Custom Layer with Internal State:** This approach utilizes a custom layer to track changes by storing intermediate activations.  The layer maintains internal state variables, updated during each forward pass.  This state can then be accessed later, either directly or through callbacks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class BatchChangeTracker(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(BatchChangeTracker, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.previous_activations = None

    def call(self, inputs):
        if self.previous_activations is None:
            self.previous_activations = inputs
            return inputs
        else:
            changes = inputs - self.previous_activations
            self.previous_activations = inputs #Update for the next batch
            return changes #Return the difference

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config()
        return config

# Example usage:
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    BatchChangeTracker(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# During training or inference, the BatchChangeTracker layer will compute and return the differences between consecutive batches.
# Accessing self.previous_activations directly is possible but generally not recommended outside this specific layer.
```

This code demonstrates a custom layer (`BatchChangeTracker`) that computes the difference between consecutive batch activations.  The `previous_activations` attribute acts as memory, storing the previous batch's output.  The layer returns the difference, representing the change within the batch.  Note the inclusion of `get_config`, crucial for model serialization and loading.  The limitations of this method include potential memory consumption with large batch sizes and an inherent dependency on sequential batch processing; it may not directly translate to parallel processing scenarios.


**2.  Callback-Based Monitoring:** A more flexible approach involves using a custom Keras callback to monitor the model's output during training.  This avoids modifying the model's architecture directly, offering greater modularity.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class BatchChangeCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, batch_size):
        super(BatchChangeCallback, self).__init__()
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.previous_output = None

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        output = self.model.predict_on_batch(self.model.input) #This assumes your model input is directly accessible within the callback.
        if self.previous_output is not None:
            changes = np.abs(output - self.previous_output) #Compute absolute changes for comparison.
            #Analyze changes here, e.g., compute statistics, write to log file, etc.
            print(f"Batch {batch+1} Change Statistics: Mean={np.mean(changes)}, Max={np.max(changes)}")
        self.previous_output = output


# Example Usage:
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu')])
callback = BatchChangeCallback(batch_size=32)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[callback])
```

This callback monitors changes between consecutive batches. The `on_batch_end` method is invoked after each batch. It predicts the model's output and compares it to the previous batch's output, calculating and reporting statistical information about the changes.  This approach offers greater flexibility compared to the custom layer approach, but it relies on prediction within the callback, potentially incurring a performance penalty.  The code explicitly calculates the absolute difference to handle both positive and negative changes.   Note: Adapting this to access internal layer activations may require adjustments based on the model's specific architecture.


**3. TensorBoard Integration:**  For visualization and analysis, integrating with TensorBoard provides a powerful alternative.  By logging relevant tensors during training, we can visualize batch-wise changes over time.  This requires modification to the model's definition or the use of summary writers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Define summary writer
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir="./logs", histogram_freq=1)

#Log intermediate activations
def log_layer_activations(layer, inputs, outputs, training):
    tf.summary.histogram('layer_activations', outputs, step=tf.summary.experimental.get_step())
    return outputs

model.layers[0].call = lambda *args, **kwargs: log_layer_activations(model.layers[0], *args, **kwargs)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```


This example leverages TensorBoard to monitor layer activations.  The `log_layer_activations` function, wrapping the layer's `call` method, uses `tf.summary.histogram` to log the layer's activations as histograms.  These histograms can then be visualized in TensorBoard, allowing for the examination of activation distribution changes across batches during training.  This provides a visual representation of the dynamic behavior within the batches, allowing for analysis without directly manipulating numerical output.  The drawback here is the dependence on the TensorBoard environment for analysis.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official Keras documentation, focusing on custom layers, callbacks, and the usage of TensorFlow's summary operations.  Furthermore, a deep understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and tensor manipulation is essential. Consulting advanced deep learning texts focusing on model customization and debugging will provide valuable context for these techniques.  Finally, understanding the limitations of Keras concerning low-level tensor manipulation is crucial for realistic expectations and avoiding performance pitfalls.


These three methods provide distinct ways to observe tensor changes along the batch dimension within Keras. The choice depends on the specific needs of the application, balancing the need for detailed information, implementation complexity, and performance considerations. Remember to carefully consider potential memory issues and computational overhead when dealing with large datasets and complex model architectures.  My past experience with various production-level deployments underscores the importance of choosing the appropriate method based on these factors.
