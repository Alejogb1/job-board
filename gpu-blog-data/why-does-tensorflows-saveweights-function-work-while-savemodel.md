The discrepancy between TensorFlow's `save_weights` and `save_model` functionalities often stems from how each method serializes and persists model data. Having spent considerable time debugging model deployment pipelines, I've observed firsthand how nuances in these saving methods can lead to unexpected behavior. `save_weights` primarily concerns itself with the numerical parameters—the weights and biases—of the neural network’s layers, offering a relatively straightforward persistence of these values. Conversely, `save_model` aims to encapsulate a more complete representation of the model, including the network architecture, the computation graph, and its associated metadata. This difference in scope and intent explains many of the observed issues.

The `save_weights` method operates on the principle that the model structure is predefined elsewhere, either in code or a separate configuration. It effectively snapshots the state of the numerical parameters at a specific point. This approach allows for a relatively simple serialization process, typically involving the writing of numerical data to a format like HDF5. When loading weights, this data is then applied to a model object already instantiated with the same architecture. This method is exceptionally useful when you have a model definition stored in your version control, and you just want to populate the weights after training. It is fast and efficient for this specific use case.

The `save_model` method, on the other hand, adopts a more comprehensive approach, aiming to save the entire model structure, including layer definitions, activation functions, and optimizer states, along with the numerical parameters. This involves the creation of a SavedModel format which is essentially a directory containing protocol buffer files (`.pb`), variables (containing the numerical weights), and metadata. This comprehensive format allows for model deployment across different environments without needing to redefine the model architecture again in the target location. It's designed for portability and enables features such as serving with TensorFlow Serving. However, this comprehensive nature adds a layer of complexity that can be the cause of many problems during usage, especially if dependencies, versions, or environments are inconsistent during the save and load operations.

The reason `save_model` might fail while `save_weights` succeeds is frequently related to the robustness of the underlying serialization processes and the consistency of the execution environment. For instance, differences in Python library versions between the saving and loading environments can cause subtle incompatibilities in how the SavedModel format is interpreted. A layer defined in a particular version of TensorFlow might not be perfectly reconstructed by an older, or even newer, version if there are API changes. This is rarely a problem when you save just the weights. Another common cause for failure with `save_model` is related to the implementation of custom layers, custom losses, or other custom parts of the training pipeline. These user-defined components can cause serialization failures if the necessary support functions or code dependencies are not consistently included in the save and load environment.

Here's a set of code examples to illustrate these differences and the potential failure points:

**Example 1: Saving and Loading Weights**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Create random initial weights
model.build(input_shape=(None,784))

# Save the weights
model.save_weights('my_weights')

# Create a new instance of the SAME model
new_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Load the saved weights (must call .build before .load_weights)
new_model.build(input_shape=(None,784))
new_model.load_weights('my_weights')

# Now the new_model has the same parameters as the initial model
print("Weights loaded successfully.")
```

This example demonstrates a scenario where the `save_weights` method is reliably employed. The key requirement is that the model architecture in both the saving and loading phases is identical. The code loads the weights into an identically configured, newly created model. Note that, we must call `.build` on both models prior to saving and loading. Also note, that this will not load training-related parameters like the optimizer state.

**Example 2: Attempting to Save and Load a Model (Potential Failure Scenario)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_addons as tfa  # Example of a potential version dependency issue


# Define a model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tfa.layers.SpectralNormalization(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10))
])

# Save the full model
try:
  model.save('my_model')
  print("Model saved successfully")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error saving model: {e}")

# Attempt to load the model in a separate environment
try:
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model')
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

```

In this example, the model incorporates `SpectralNormalization` from `tensorflow_addons`. The `save_model` call might fail if the `tensorflow_addons` version in the loading environment doesn't exactly match the one used during the saving process. Even minor version differences or missing dependency can break the compatibility between the saved model files and the loading environment. This shows how dependencies can lead to `save_model` failures, as `save_weights` would likely have succeeded in the same situation.

**Example 3: A Model with a custom layer (Potential Failure Scenario)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                 initializer='random_normal',
                                 trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                 initializer='zeros',
                                 trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
      return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Define model that contains the custom layer
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    CustomDense(10)
])

try:
    model.save('custom_model')
    print("Model saved successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error saving model: {e}")

try:
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('custom_model')
    print("Model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

```
In this example we have implemented a simplified custom `Dense` layer that can be used in the model. Although the `save_model` call will work in many cases if the model definition can be found at the time of the loading, it is still possible that the loading could fail, especially if the model is loaded in a different environment with a different module resolution strategy. The key point is that `save_weights` will succeed in this case if we can redefine the model structure in the target environment.

In essence, `save_weights` provides a granular way to handle just model parameters, leaving responsibility for model construction to the user, while `save_model` attempts to provide a more encapsulated, comprehensive way to save and load models which can be problematic because of versioning, dependency or environmental inconsistencies. To mitigate `save_model` failures, ensure that Python packages, especially those related to TensorFlow, are version-matched across the saving and loading environments. For custom layers or complex model components, make sure that all required code is also available in the loading environment, or consider saving weights and re-building the model structure manually.

For further exploration and in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation regarding SavedModel formats and serialization. Additionally, practical examples from TensorFlow tutorials, especially those covering deployment workflows, can offer further context. Finally, the community resources provided by TensorFlow’s official channels contain helpful guidelines and examples that illuminate best practices.
