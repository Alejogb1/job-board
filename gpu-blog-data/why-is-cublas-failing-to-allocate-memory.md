The observed failure of CUBLAS to allocate memory, specifically within a CUDA environment, often stems from insufficient device memory or improper management of that memory. Over my years working with high-performance computing and CUDA, I've encountered this issue numerous times, and it almost always boils down to a few key areas that are not immediately obvious. It's not necessarily CUBLAS itself that is failing to allocate; rather, it's the request for memory either exceeding available resources or being made in a way that the CUDA runtime cannot service effectively.

Primarily, the error indicates the absence of sufficient device memory on the GPU to accommodate the data structures required by CUBLAS routines. This can happen even when the reported available memory on the GPU seems adequate because memory is often fragmented or pre-allocated by other processes or parts of the code. It's also crucial to distinguish between host memory (RAM) and device memory (VRAM on the GPU). Operations performed by CUBLAS require data to be present within the GPU's memory space. The transfer of data from host to device adds another layer of complexity, requiring sufficient device memory to perform both the transfer and the subsequent calculations.

The problem manifests typically when attempting to allocate buffers using functions like `cudaMalloc` or implicitly through CUBLAS functions that require workspace. For instance, functions like `cublasSgemm` or `cublasDgemm` for matrix multiplication may require auxiliary workspace for optimal performance. If the user attempts these operations without either pre-allocating this workspace or allocating insufficient workspace, an out-of-memory error can occur, even if the input and output matrices themselves fit within the device memory space.

Moreover, the order in which memory is allocated can influence the outcome. Consider a scenario where a large amount of memory is allocated at the beginning of the program's execution. If that memory isn't deallocated properly, and further allocations are requested, the runtime may be unable to satisfy these subsequent memory demands, even if the aggregated memory requested remains within the total available on the device.

Another factor which compounds this problem is a lack of careful memory management of allocations, particularly if other libraries or CUDA functions are being used concurrently. Without proper deallocation, even seemingly small allocations can accumulate, leading to memory exhaustion over time, and a subsequent allocation failure when invoking a CUBLAS function.

Let's examine a series of scenarios with code examples to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Insufficient Device Memory**

In this example, I attempt to allocate more device memory than is available, leading to a failed allocation.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cublas_v2.h>

int main() {
  float *d_A;
  size_t size = 1024ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 5; // 5 GB - Likely exceeding available GPU memory.

  cudaError_t cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size * sizeof(float));
  if(cudaStatus != cudaSuccess){
    std::cerr << "Error during device memory allocation: " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);
    float alpha = 1.0f;
    float *d_B, *d_C;
     cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size * sizeof(float));
     cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size * sizeof(float));
      
    cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, 1024, 1024, 1024, &alpha, d_A, 1024, d_B, 1024, &alpha, d_C, 1024);
      
  cudaFree(d_A);
  cudaFree(d_B);
  cudaFree(d_C);
    cublasDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
```
*Commentary:*
This demonstrates a simple allocation using `cudaMalloc`. The size requested (`5GB * sizeof(float)`) is likely larger than the available device memory on most GPUs. The `cudaMalloc` function will return a non-success status, and the program will print the error message indicating that memory allocation failed. While the `cublasSgemm` may appear to be the source of the error in a more complicated program, it's actually the underlying allocation which is triggering the failure. Notice also that I attempt to deallocate the memory as a matter of good practice. This is critical. In this case the program doesn't fail on the allocation itself but on the subsequent `cublasSgemm`. This is typical of situations where it appears `cublasSgemm` is the source of failure when in reality it's insufficient memory which has already been taken.

**Example 2: Insufficient Workspace Allocation for CUBLAS Operation**

Here, the matrix multiplication operation requires workspace which has not been allocated, causing the CUBLAS call to fail.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cublas_v2.h>

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);

    int m = 1024;
    int n = 1024;
    int k = 1024;

    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, m * n * sizeof(float));

    float alpha = 1.0f;
    float beta = 0.0f;

  // No explicit workspace allocated.

    cublasStatus_t status = cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, m, n, k, &alpha, d_A, m, d_B, k, &beta, d_C, m);

  if(status != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS)
  {
    std::cerr << "Error from CUBLAS: " << status << std::endl;
  }

  cudaFree(d_A);
  cudaFree(d_B);
  cudaFree(d_C);
  cublasDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
```
*Commentary:*
This example showcases a scenario where the input matrices have been allocated, but the required workspace for CUBLAS, while usually managed internally by CUBLAS, isn't available because the runtime cannot fulfill the memory requirement internally, leading to a failed `cublasSgemm` operation. In some circumstances, CUBLAS might require a workspace. While it can usually manage it internally, sometimes it's still necessary to provide it ourselves. The message returned might suggest a generic failure rather than an explicit out-of-memory error, making the root cause harder to identify immediately.

**Example 3: Accumulating Memory Allocations Without Deallocation**

This final example shows the detrimental effects of continuously allocating memory without freeing it, leading to eventual exhaustion.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cublas_v2.h>

int main() {
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  cublasCreate(&handle);
  int m = 1024;
  int n = 1024;
  int k = 1024;
  float alpha = 1.0f;
  float beta = 0.0f;

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  {
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, m * n * sizeof(float));

    //No deallocation here.
    cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, m, n, k, &alpha, d_A, m, d_B, k, &beta, d_C, m);
  }
    cublasDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:*
In this loop, I repeatedly allocate device memory within each iteration but fail to free the previously allocated memory, resulting in an accumulation of used memory on the device. Even if the individual allocations are small, the repeated allocation will eventually lead to an out-of-memory error from `cudaMalloc` and subsequently, possibly from CUBLAS routines attempting to use the unavailable memory. This highlights that while we might think our allocations are within the bounds of device memory, this is still problematic if it accumulates without being released.

To effectively troubleshoot CUBLAS memory allocation errors, several steps are essential. Start by accurately determining the available device memory using `cudaGetDeviceProperties`. Then, meticulously review the allocation sizes for all buffers, including input, output, and any required workspace. Employ memory tracking tools, if available, to monitor usage throughout the program's execution. Finally, strictly adhere to the practice of deallocating device memory with `cudaFree` when it is no longer required to prevent memory leaks or exhaustion.

For deeper understanding, the following resources are recommended:
- The CUDA Toolkit Documentation provides detailed information about CUDA runtime functions.
- The CUBLAS Library Documentation from NVIDIA offers specifics about required memory usage within its routines.
- Books on high-performance computing and parallel programming often include specific sections on memory management in GPU environments.
- NVIDIA Developer forums are good for common use cases and to see what other users have encountered.
- GPU profiler tools such as Nsight, which gives a much more fine-grained view of GPU activity.

By careful management, understanding the nuances of memory allocation on the GPU, and proper use of debug tools, many CUBLAS memory allocation issues can be effectively diagnosed and resolved.
