Efficiently extracting data from tensors based on indices obtained from an `argmax` operation is a common task in deep learning, specifically when handling classification results or selecting specific elements according to a computed maximum. Direct indexing using a simple scalar obtained from `argmax` works, but the situation becomes more complex when one requires to apply this selection across multiple dimensions or batch entries. This necessity requires an understanding of how NumPy and PyTorch manage indexing using arrays, including those derived from an `argmax` operation.

A common misunderstanding involves thinking that `argmax` always returns a single scalar value, ready for immediate indexing. While it does when applied to a single dimension, applying it to higher dimensions returns indices *per* the dimension the argmax operation is performed on. The returned structure retains the dimensionality of the input tensor excluding the reduction dimension, necessitating specific techniques to use it for advanced slicing. In essence, we're using the `argmax` output to 'point to' specific locations within the original tensor.

Let’s assume, for demonstration, that I'm developing a model for semantic segmentation where the output of a network is a tensor representing class scores for every pixel, `(batch_size, num_classes, height, width)`. The `argmax` operation, taken across `num_classes`, would then give us, for each pixel in a batch, the *index* of the predicted class. This index array, shape `(batch_size, height, width)`, is used to extract the prediction result which we map to pixel-wise segmentation masks.

Here's how you can accomplish this with NumPy, handling the multi-dimensional indexing effectively:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example: batch_size = 2, num_classes = 3, height=4, width=5
batch_size, num_classes, height, width = 2, 3, 4, 5
scores = np.random.rand(batch_size, num_classes, height, width)

# Find the class index with the highest score for each pixel
predicted_classes = np.argmax(scores, axis=1) # shape: (batch_size, height, width)

# Now, use these indices to select from a hypothetical feature map
feature_map = np.random.rand(batch_size, 10, height, width) # Example: 10 features per pixel

# The key trick here: create a meshgrid to handle indexing along the other dimensions
b, h, w = np.indices(predicted_classes.shape)

# Select using the created indices; now 'selected_features' will be shape (batch_size, height, width), one feature per location
selected_features = feature_map[b, predicted_classes, h, w]


# Demonstrating a simple result check:
print("Shape of predicted_classes:", predicted_classes.shape)
print("Shape of selected_features:", selected_features.shape)
```

In the first example, a meshgrid using `np.indices` ensures each dimension of the feature map is indexed correctly. Without this meshgrid, incorrect indexing would occur, resulting in errors or meaningless data. It’s crucial for avoiding errors in multi-dimensional indexing. The `predicted_classes` array serves as the index for the feature dimension (index 1) of the feature map.

Next, let's move to a similar task using PyTorch, which operates very similarly:

```python
import torch

# Example: batch_size = 2, num_classes = 3, height=4, width=5
batch_size, num_classes, height, width = 2, 3, 4, 5
scores = torch.rand(batch_size, num_classes, height, width)

# Find the class index with the highest score for each pixel
predicted_classes = torch.argmax(scores, dim=1) # shape: (batch_size, height, width)

# Now, use these indices to select from a hypothetical feature map
feature_map = torch.rand(batch_size, 10, height, width) # Example: 10 features per pixel

# Pytorch also requires specific techniques for indexing
b, h, w = torch.meshgrid(torch.arange(batch_size),
                        torch.arange(height),
                        torch.arange(width),
                        indexing='ij')

# Select using the created indices
selected_features = feature_map[b, predicted_classes, h, w]

# Demonstration of the output shapes
print("Shape of predicted_classes:", predicted_classes.shape)
print("Shape of selected_features:", selected_features.shape)
```

The PyTorch example follows the same logic as the NumPy example. However, instead of `np.indices`, we utilize `torch.meshgrid` to generate the index tensors necessary for batch, height, and width dimensions. As with NumPy, this explicit construction of index tensors is critical for correct selection across dimensions. `indexing='ij'` ensures index ordering matches NumPy behavior.

Finally, let’s examine an example where one needs to use the `argmax` result not to extract specific values but to perform operations across the *same* dimensions as in the output array from argmax. This is a pattern common with one-hot encoding operations.

```python
import torch

batch_size, num_classes, height, width = 2, 3, 4, 5
scores = torch.rand(batch_size, num_classes, height, width)

# Get predicted class indices - same as the above examples
predicted_classes = torch.argmax(scores, dim=1) # shape: (batch_size, height, width)

# Create a one-hot encoding for the predicted classes
one_hot_encoded = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(predicted_classes, num_classes)
# One_hot_encoded now has the shape (batch_size, height, width, num_classes)
# For many applications, we need it to be transposed (batch_size, num_classes, height, width)


# Correctly transpose the one-hot encoded results
one_hot_encoded = one_hot_encoded.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)

# Check the shape.
print("Shape of predicted_classes:", predicted_classes.shape)
print("Shape of one_hot_encoded:", one_hot_encoded.shape)
```

In this case, while not directly used for slicing an existing tensor with `argmax` results, it demonstrates an alternate use-case that is critical for using argmax results.  Here, `torch.nn.functional.one_hot` takes the index tensor and transforms it into one-hot encoded representation which allows for calculations that require class data to be represented as numerical vectors, like calculating the mean class confidence from raw score tensors. Subsequently, we adjust dimensions for consistency.

Several crucial concepts emerge from these examples. First, when `argmax` operates over an axis of a multi-dimensional tensor, the result retains the shape of the tensor with the reduction axis removed. Second, this result cannot be used directly as a single index; instead, it must be used in concert with indices that identify batch, height, and width. Libraries like NumPy and PyTorch provide utilities like `indices` and `meshgrid` to facilitate this process. Finally, the `argmax` is often used not just for selecting elements but for transforming data into a suitable format, such as one-hot encoding for further operations.

To further understand these concepts, I would recommend studying the official documentation of NumPy and PyTorch concerning tensor indexing and manipulation; specifically, sections on advanced indexing, `np.indices`, `torch.meshgrid`, `torch.gather`, and the documentation around the various manipulation operations such as `.permute()`. In addition, searching through relevant research papers, specifically in the field of deep learning models and operations, would provide additional context. Open-source code bases of common deep learning architectures also contain numerous relevant examples demonstrating the practical usage of the described techniques. Studying these resources should provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced tensor slicing using arrays of indices derived from `argmax` operations.
