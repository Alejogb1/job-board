The core issue often stems from a mismatch between the statistical data held within MySQL's `information_schema` and the actual distribution of data in your tables.  My experience troubleshooting performance bottlenecks across numerous high-traffic applications points consistently to this discrepancy as a primary culprit.  The optimizer relies heavily on these statistics to create efficient execution plans, and outdated or inaccurate statistics lead to suboptimal choices, manifesting as slow query execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The MySQL optimizer employs a cost-based approach. It analyzes the query, estimates the cost of different execution plans (e.g., using index scans versus full table scans), and selects the plan it deems most efficient based on its statistical estimations. These estimations originate from the table statistics maintained within the `information_schema`.  Key statistics include table cardinality (number of rows), key distributions (how data is spread across indexed columns), and column statistics (like minimum, maximum, and average values).

When these statistics are outdated or inaccurate—a frequent occurrence in dynamic environments with frequent data modifications—the optimizer makes flawed cost estimations. For instance, if the optimizer believes a table contains far fewer rows than it actually does, it might choose an index scan that proves inefficient because the index has to be traversed extensively. Conversely, it might opt for a full table scan when an index scan would be superior because the statistics underestimated the selectivity of the index.

Another significant factor is the lack of or inadequate indexes.  Even with accurate statistics, if critical columns aren't indexed appropriately, the optimizer might still choose a less efficient plan due to a lack of alternative execution paths.  Finally, poorly written queries themselves contribute.  For example, queries with complex joins or subqueries might confuse the optimizer, leading to poor plan selection, even with perfectly up-to-date statistics.

The solution, therefore, isn't simply "fixing the optimizer," but rather refining the interaction between your data, your schema, and the optimizer's ability to understand them. This involves ensuring the accuracy of table statistics, carefully designing indexes to support common queries, and writing SQL queries that are easily optimizable.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Demonstrating the impact of outdated statistics:**

```sql
-- Before running this, let's say we have a table 'products' with 1 million rows.
-- We haven't updated statistics recently.  The optimizer thinks we have 100,000 rows.

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 1000;

-- The output might show an index scan, which is considered efficient given the low row count the optimizer believes exists.
-- However, because the actual row count is ten times higher, this plan will likely be slow.
-- After updating statistics (using ANALYZE TABLE products;) and re-running EXPLAIN, we might get a different, better plan.
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the crucial role of up-to-date statistics. The `EXPLAIN` statement provides valuable insight into the query execution plan, allowing you to verify if the optimizer's assumptions match reality.  The `ANALYZE TABLE` command forces a recalculation of the table statistics.  In my experience, routinely scheduling this operation, especially after significant data modifications, has proven invaluable.


**Example 2: Illustrating the importance of appropriate indexing:**

```sql
-- We have a table 'orders' with columns order_id (primary key), customer_id, and order_date.
-- Frequently, we query orders based on customer_id and order_date.

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Without an index on (customer_id, order_date), the optimizer might choose a full table scan.
-- Adding a composite index: CREATE INDEX idx_customer_date ON orders (customer_id, order_date);
-- and re-running EXPLAIN should show an index scan utilizing this composite index.

```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how well-chosen indexes significantly impact the optimizer's choice of execution plan.  The order of columns in the composite index is crucial; putting `customer_id` first enhances performance for queries frequently filtering on that column.  I've seen substantial performance gains from careful index design, requiring a thorough understanding of common query patterns.


**Example 3: Highlighting the effect of poorly written queries:**

```sql
-- Let's consider a poorly structured query with nested subqueries.
-- Suppose we want to find products that have a high average rating from customers within a specific region.

SELECT p.product_name
FROM products p
WHERE p.product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM reviews WHERE rating >= 4.5)
  AND p.region_id IN (SELECT region_id FROM regions WHERE region_name = 'North America');

-- This query could be optimized significantly using JOINs.
-- The revised query is more efficient and easier for the optimizer to analyze:

SELECT p.product_name
FROM products p
JOIN reviews r ON p.product_id = r.product_id
JOIN regions rg ON p.region_id = rg.region_id
WHERE r.rating >= 4.5 AND rg.region_name = 'North America';
```

**Commentary:** The first example showcases a less efficient approach, prone to performance issues.  Nested subqueries often cause the optimizer difficulties.  The second example, using `JOIN` clauses, is much cleaner and allows the optimizer to generate a more efficient plan.  This highlights the importance of writing clear, well-structured SQL queries to assist the optimizer.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official MySQL documentation is paramount; it provides comprehensive details on query optimization and the inner workings of the optimizer.  Furthermore, several books dedicated to advanced MySQL administration delve deeply into performance tuning strategies.  Finally, reputable online communities and forums dedicated to MySQL offer valuable support and insights from experienced professionals.  Studying query execution plans using `EXPLAIN` is essential; mastery of this tool is indispensable for tackling optimizer-related problems.  Learning to interpret its output accurately is a crucial skill for any MySQL developer.
