Device-to-device (D2D) memory copies in CUDA programs are not inherently necessary but frequently represent a crucial optimization technique, particularly in scenarios involving data dependencies between kernels or irregular memory access patterns.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for geophysical simulations has highlighted the critical role D2D copies play in achieving optimal throughput.  While direct kernel-to-kernel data sharing might seem preferable, understanding memory coalescing and the limitations of shared memory necessitates a nuanced approach to data movement.

**1. Explanation:**

CUDA's architecture hinges on the efficient utilization of its many parallel processing cores.  These cores operate on data residing in the global memory, a large but comparatively slow memory space.  Achieving high performance requires minimizing global memory accesses.  Shared memory, a much faster on-chip memory, can alleviate this bottleneck for data shared amongst a thread block. However, shared memory's limited capacity restricts its use to data relevant within a single block.

When data needs to be processed by multiple kernel launches, direct data transfer between kernels is generally not possible. Each kernel operates on its allocated portion of global memory.  Therefore, to transfer data processed by one kernel to another, a D2D copy using `cudaMemcpy` is required.  This operation moves data from one area of the device's global memory to another.

Ignoring D2D copies when necessary can lead to significant performance degradation.  Consider a scenario where kernel A produces intermediate results which kernel B needs to consume.  If kernel B directly accesses the output memory of kernel A, it may encounter significant latency due to potential memory bank conflicts or non-coalesced memory accesses.  A D2D copy into a suitably arranged memory layout, optimized for kernel B's access pattern, resolves this.  This optimization is particularly relevant when dealing with large datasets where memory access patterns significantly impact overall performance.

Furthermore, D2D copies can enable the use of asynchronous operations. By initiating a D2D copy concurrently with kernel execution, the GPU can perform both tasks simultaneously, maximizing utilization and reducing overall execution time.  This overlapping computation with data transfers is a central tenet of optimizing CUDA applications for maximal throughput.  I've often employed this strategy to overlap data preparation with computationally intensive kernels.  Effective use requires careful timing and understanding of potential synchronization points.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple D2D Copy:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int size = 1024 * 1024;
  float *h_data, *d_data1, *d_data2;

  // Allocate host and device memory
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_data, size * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data1, size * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data2, size * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize host data
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) h_data[i] = (float)i;

  // Copy data from host to device 1
  cudaMemcpy(d_data1, h_data, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Perform some kernel operation on d_data1 (omitted for brevity)

  // Copy data from device 1 to device 2
  cudaMemcpy(d_data2, d_data1, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);

  // Perform another kernel operation on d_data2 (omitted for brevity)

  // Copy data back to host (for verification)
  cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data2, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);


  cudaFree(d_data1);
  cudaFree(d_data2);
  cudaFreeHost(h_data);
  return 0;
}
```

This example showcases the fundamental D2D copy using `cudaMemcpy`.  The data is transferred from one device memory location (`d_data1`) to another (`d_data2`). The `cudaMemcpy` function's last parameter specifies the direction of the copy.  Error checking (omitted here for brevity) is crucial in production code.


**Example 2: Asynchronous D2D Copy:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation as in Example 1) ...

  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  // Copy data asynchronously
  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data2, d_data1, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice, stream);

  // Launch kernel 1 on d_data1
  // ... (kernel launch) ...

  // Synchronize with the asynchronous copy (optional, depending on dependency)
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

  // Launch kernel 2 on d_data2
  // ... (kernel launch) ...

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
  // ... (memory deallocation) ...
  return 0;
}

```

This example demonstrates an asynchronous D2D copy using a CUDA stream. The `cudaMemcpyAsync` function initiates the copy without blocking the CPU.  Kernel 1 and Kernel 2 can execute concurrently with the copy operation.  `cudaStreamSynchronize` ensures that the copy completes before Kernel 2 starts if strict ordering is required.


**Example 3: Pinned Memory for Optimized Transfers:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... (size definition) ...

  float *h_data, *d_data;
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_data, size * sizeof(float), cudaHostAllocMapped); // Pinned memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize h_data ...

  // Direct access and copy without explicit cudaMemcpy in some cases
  float* mapped_d_data = (float*)cudaHostGetDevicePointer(h_data, 0); //Get Device pointer


  // ...Operations on mapped_d_data...

  cudaFree(d_data);
  cudaFreeHost(h_data); //Note that cudaFreeHost is still required
  return 0;
}
```

This example illustrates the use of pinned memory (`cudaHostAllocMapped`). Pinned memory is allocated on the host but is accessible by the device without explicit `cudaMemcpy` calls, significantly speeding up data transfers, especially for smaller datasets where the overhead of `cudaMemcpy` becomes noticeable.  However, the amount of pinned memory is limited and should be used judiciously.  Direct access through pointers must be managed carefully to ensure data consistency.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and the NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide provide comprehensive information on memory management and optimization techniques.  Furthermore, a strong understanding of parallel programming concepts and modern computer architecture is crucial for effective CUDA development.  Studying relevant literature on memory coalescing, shared memory optimization, and asynchronous operations will further enhance one's ability to optimize CUDA applications.  Practical experience through coding and benchmarking is indispensable.
