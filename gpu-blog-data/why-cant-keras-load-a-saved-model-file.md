The inability to load a saved Keras model often stems from inconsistencies between the model's saving environment and the loading environment, specifically concerning the TensorFlow/Theano backend, custom objects, and even minor version discrepancies in Keras itself.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, and the debugging process invariably involves meticulous examination of these three aspects.

1. **Backend Inconsistency:** Keras, particularly in earlier versions, relied heavily on the chosen backend (TensorFlow or Theano).  Saving a model trained with TensorFlow and attempting to load it with Theano (or vice-versa) will almost certainly fail. This is because the internal representations of layers and weights are backend-specific.  The solution is straightforward but often overlooked: ensure the backend is consistently defined during both model saving and loading.  If your project utilizes virtual environments, meticulous management of these environments is critical. A mismatch can manifest in cryptic error messages relating to incompatible layer types or missing attributes.

2. **Custom Objects:** The inclusion of custom layers, metrics, or losses within the model introduces another potential point of failure. When saving a model, Keras serializes its structure and weights.  However, custom objects are not automatically serialized. If you defined a custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`) during model training, and this layer is not available (e.g., the definition is not in the script loading the model), the loading process will fail. Keras provides a mechanism to address this: the `custom_objects` argument in the `load_model` function.

3. **Version Mismatches:** Though less common in recent Keras versions, subtle differences in Keras, TensorFlow, or even Python versions can cause loading failures.  The exact error message may vary but might point to a lack of compatibility or an inability to find required methods or attributes. Maintaining consistent versions across environments—ideally using a virtual environment or containerization—is paramount to avoid these issues.  A common source of these problems stems from relying on system-wide installations of libraries, rather than dedicated environment management.

Let's illustrate these points with code examples.

**Example 1: Backend Inconsistency**

```python
# Save model (TensorFlow backend)
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential([Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)), Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save('my_model_tf.h5')

# Attempt to load with Theano (will likely fail)
import theano  # Assuming Theano is installed
# ... (Code to load model with theano backend) ...
# This will fail as the internal representation of the model is TensorFlow-specific.

# Correct approach: explicitly set TensorFlow backend during loading
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.models import load_model
keras.backend.set_backend('tensorflow') #Explicitly set the backend here
loaded_model = load_model('my_model_tf.h5')

```

This example demonstrates the importance of setting the correct backend.  The commented-out section highlights the failure scenario, while the subsequent lines illustrate the correct method to avoid the issue.  The error, if Theano was used without setting the backend, would likely involve a `TypeError` or a `NotImplementedError`, depending on the specific Keras and Theano versions.

**Example 2: Custom Objects**

```python
# Define a custom layer
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.layers import Layer
from keras import backend as K

class MyCustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, output_dim, **kwargs):
        self.output_dim = output_dim
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(name='kernel',
                                      shape=(input_shape[1], self.output_dim),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      trainable=True)
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, x):
        return K.dot(x, self.kernel)

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return (input_shape[0], self.output_dim)


# Create a model with the custom layer
model = Sequential([MyCustomLayer(10, input_shape=(100,)), Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Save the model
model.save('my_model_custom.h5')


# Load the model, specifying custom objects
from keras.models import load_model
loaded_model = load_model('my_model_custom.h5', custom_objects={'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer})

```

Here, the `MyCustomLayer` is defined and used in the model.  Crucially, when loading, `custom_objects` is used to provide the definition of `MyCustomLayer` to Keras, preventing the loading error.  Failure to include `{'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer}` would result in a `ValueError` indicating that the custom layer is not found.

**Example 3: Version Mismatch (Illustrative)**

This scenario is harder to illustrate directly with code.  The problem arises from underlying library incompatibilities.  Let's say the saved model relied on a specific optimization algorithm implemented differently in a different TensorFlow version.  The error could be something like an `AttributeError`, indicating that a method used during saving is not present in the loaded TensorFlow version.

```python
# Example of potential version incompatibility (conceptual)
# Assume model saved with TensorFlow 2.7.0, loaded with TensorFlow 2.10.0, 
# and a specific optimization technique changed between versions

#Saving with TF 2.7.0
# ... (Code to train and save model with TF 2.7.0) ...
model.save('model_tf2.7.h5')

#Loading with TF 2.10.0
# ... (Code to load model with TF 2.10.0) ...
# This might fail due to incompatibility, even if the model architecture is identical.

# Mitigation: Use environment management (conda, virtualenv, docker) to ensure version consistency.
```


This example showcases the potential for failure.  The actual error messages would be more specific to the exact incompatibility.  The resolution lies in careful environment management to ensure consistent versions of all relevant libraries.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation.  The TensorFlow documentation.  Advanced Python for Data Science (a book focusing on effective environment management).  Debugging Python (a book focusing on troubleshooting strategies).  Effective Python (a book emphasizing best practices).


By carefully addressing backend consistency, handling custom objects, and managing version compatibility, the common problems encountered when loading saved Keras models can be effectively resolved.  Remember that diligent version control and the use of virtual environments are essential components of robust and reproducible machine learning workflows.
