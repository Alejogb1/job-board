The `pooler_output` often becomes a point of contention when working with ELECTRA models in PyTorch Lightning, particularly during classification tasks. This arises because the model's output structure doesn't directly conform to the classification head's input expectations without explicit handling. Specifically, the base ELECTRA model, unlike some other Transformers, doesn't provide a single, consolidated, pooled representation as its primary output. Instead, it yields a tuple containing, at minimum, the last hidden state and optionally the hidden states from all layers. The `pooler_output`, as named by the original BERT architecture, is absent. Failure to recognize this discrepancy will lead to shape mismatches and subsequent errors during the classification process.

The core of the problem resides in understanding ELECTRA's output behavior. Upon passing a sequence through the model, the default return is a tuple where the first element is a tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]`. This represents the hidden states corresponding to each token in the input sequence across the final layer. The second element, if available, contains the hidden states for each layer in the model. Therefore, the expected consolidated `pooler_output`, suitable for feeding a classification layer, is not readily available and needs to be derived from this output. This contrasts with BERT, which explicitly generates and returns a pooled output derived from the CLS token, leading to many users expecting a similar structure from ELECTRA.

The resolution involves adapting the model's output for compatibility with the classifier. Typically, this requires selecting an appropriate representation from the model's output and transforming it into a feature vector. There are several common strategies one might employ.

The first method involves simply extracting the hidden state associated with the `[CLS]` token (the first token in the sequence after encoding). This is a straightforward approach and has been shown to work effectively for many text classification scenarios. The assumption is that the `[CLS]` token aggregates information about the entire sequence during the pre-training phase. We can implement this extraction using PyTorch indexing.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import ElectraModel, ElectraTokenizer
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from torch.optim import AdamW

class ElectraClassifier(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self, num_labels, model_name="google/electra-small-discriminator", lr=2e-5):
        super().__init__()
        self.electra = ElectraModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.num_labels = num_labels
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(self.electra.config.hidden_size, num_labels)
        self.lr = lr
        self.loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, labels=None):
        outputs = self.electra(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        # Extract CLS token representation
        cls_representation = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]  # Shape: [batch_size, hidden_size]
        logits = self.classifier(cls_representation)

        loss = None
        if labels is not None:
            loss = self.loss_fn(logits, labels)
        return loss, logits

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        input_ids, attention_mask, labels = batch
        loss, logits = self(input_ids, attention_mask, labels)
        self.log("train_loss", loss)
        return loss

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        input_ids, attention_mask, labels = batch
        loss, logits = self(input_ids, attention_mask, labels)
        self.log("val_loss", loss)
        preds = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1)
        accuracy = (preds == labels).float().mean()
        self.log("val_accuracy", accuracy)

        return {"val_loss": loss, "val_accuracy": accuracy}

    def configure_optimizers(self):
        optimizer = AdamW(self.parameters(), lr=self.lr)
        return optimizer
```

In this first code snippet, I directly extract the first element along the second dimension of the `last_hidden_state` tensor. This corresponds to the representation of the `[CLS]` token, effectively treating it as our `pooler_output`.  The result of this slicing is then directly fed into the linear classification layer. This strategy requires the input sequences to include the CLS token which the tokenizer will automatically handle if specified during tokenization.

A second strategy involves averaging the hidden states across the sequence dimension. This method provides a pooled representation by considering all tokens in the sequence. This can be advantageous when the `[CLS]` token may not fully represent the sequence, especially in longer texts.

```python
class ElectraClassifierAvgPool(ElectraClassifier):

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, labels=None):
       outputs = self.electra(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
       # Average hidden states across sequence length
       pooled_output = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1) # Shape: [batch_size, hidden_size]
       logits = self.classifier(pooled_output)

       loss = None
       if labels is not None:
           loss = self.loss_fn(logits, labels)
       return loss, logits
```
Here, we're computing the mean across the sequence dimension (dimension 1) of the final layer's hidden state using `torch.mean`.  This pooled representation is then used as the input to the classification layer. This approach is less sensitive to the position of specific tokens in the text.

A more sophisticated approach is to introduce an explicit pooling layer to select features and create the pooled output. One way of achieving this is by adding a Max Pooling layer over sequence length, capturing the most salient features in the output.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch

class ElectraClassifierMaxPool(ElectraClassifier):
    def __init__(self, num_labels, model_name="google/electra-small-discriminator", lr=2e-5):
        super().__init__(num_labels, model_name, lr)
        self.pooler = nn.MaxPool1d(kernel_size=self.electra.config.max_position_embeddings)

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, labels=None):
        outputs = self.electra(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        #  Shape: [batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]
        hidden_state_transposed = outputs.last_hidden_state.transpose(1,2) #Shape: [batch_size, hidden_size, sequence_length]
        pooled_output = self.pooler(hidden_state_transposed).squeeze(dim=2) # Shape: [batch_size, hidden_size]
        logits = self.classifier(pooled_output)

        loss = None
        if labels is not None:
            loss = self.loss_fn(logits, labels)
        return loss, logits
```
In this third method, we add a `MaxPool1d` layer within our classifier.  Before feeding the final hidden state to the pooling layer, we transpose its dimensions to `[batch_size, hidden_size, sequence_length]` to match MaxPool1D's input convention. After pooling we use squeeze to remove the single dimension created from the pooling operation. The result is the pooled output which is fed to the linear classifier. This Max Pooling layer automatically selects the most important features along the sequence length for use in classification.

To further solidify understanding, I would suggest exploring the documentation for Transformers, specifically the outputs of various model types. Examining the implementations of downstream tasks within the Transformers library itself can offer insight into best practices when creating custom classifiers. Moreover, the PyTorch documentation on working with tensors is invaluable for understanding how to manipulate output shapes correctly. The research papers detailing ELECTRA and its architecture will provide additional context regarding its behavior which will give insight as to why the pooling approach is necessary. Reviewing other community-provided code examples utilizing ELECTRA will expose various potential approaches. Finally, careful evaluation using metrics appropriate for classification is crucial to determining which pooling strategy is most effective for a specific task and dataset.  The optimal method may vary depending on the nature of the task being undertaken and might require empirical validation.  By understanding ELECTRA's outputs and applying appropriate transformations, the issue of the missing `pooler_output` can be readily overcome when using PyTorch Lightning for ELECTRA-based text classification.
