The reported FLOPS (Floating Point Operations per Second) consistency in TensorFlow Profiler despite varying input shapes often stems from a misunderstanding of how the profiler measures computational complexity.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has shown that the profiler primarily reports the theoretical FLOPS based on the model's architecture, not the actual number of operations performed for a given input. This is a crucial distinction.  The reported number reflects the computational cost inherent in the model's layers and connections, independent of the specific data processed.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow Profiler, by default, uses a static analysis approach to estimate FLOPS.  This means it examines the computational graph – the defined structure of operations in your model – and calculates the number of floating-point operations required for each layer based on its defined parameters and output shapes.  Crucially, it does *not* dynamically trace the execution for each input shape to count the actual operations performed.  The model's structure remains constant, regardless of input size; therefore, the static analysis will yield a consistent FLOPS count.  The variation in input size impacts the *runtime* and *memory usage*, but not the inherent computational complexity as assessed by this default profiling method.

The profiler can infer the potential FLOPS for different input sizes *if* the model's architecture is dynamic, meaning its shape adapts to the input.  However, this is usually not the default behavior for standard convolutional or fully connected layers where the weights are fixed.  Dynamic architectures, common in some attention mechanisms or certain graph neural networks, are exceptions to this rule.

To illustrate, consider a simple convolutional layer.  The number of multiplications and additions required for a single convolution operation is determined by the kernel size, number of channels, and the number of output channels.  Changing the input image size (height and width) affects the number of times this operation is performed spatially, increasing the total number of calculations.  However, the profiler's static analysis, unless specifically configured to track the dynamic graph execution, only looks at the single convolution operation itself and not its repeated application across the input space. The total FLOPS is then reported as a product of the operations per single convolution and the number of convolutions performed (which is a function of the kernel size and stride, but not the input size directly in the static analysis).

This behavior is by design. The static analysis offers a quick, and relatively inexpensive way to get a general estimate of the computational requirements of a model, facilitating model comparisons and architecture choices before resource-intensive training.  However, this approach does not provide a precise measure of runtime FLOPS for different input dimensions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Convolutional Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Profile with different input shapes
profiler = tf.profiler.Profiler(model)

# Input shape 1
input_shape1 = (1, 28, 28, 1)
dummy_input1 = tf.random.normal(input_shape1)
profiler.profile(dummy_input1)
report1 = profiler.profile_statistics('flops')
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape1}: {report1}")

# Input shape 2
input_shape2 = (10, 28, 28, 1)
dummy_input2 = tf.random.normal(input_shape2)
profiler.profile(dummy_input2)
report2 = profiler.profile_statistics('flops')
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape2}: {report2}")

# Input shape 3 (Different Image size)
input_shape3 = (1, 56, 56, 1)
dummy_input3 = tf.random.normal(input_shape3)
profiler.profile(dummy_input3)
report3 = profiler.profile_statistics('flops')
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape3}: {report3}")

```
This code demonstrates the default behavior.  Even though the batch size and input image size vary, the reported FLOPS will likely remain identical because the profiler’s default method doesn't account for the increased number of computations arising from larger input.  The reported values represent the inherent FLOPS of the convolutional layer itself, not the total FLOPS executed due to varying input.


**Example 2:  Enabling Tracing for Dynamic Measurement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(None, None, 1)), # Note: input_shape is now flexible
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Requires tf.function for accurate tracing
@tf.function
def model_fn(x):
  return model(x)

profiler = tf.profiler.Profiler(model)

# Define inputs
input_shape1 = (1, 28, 28, 1)
input_shape2 = (10, 28, 28, 1)
input_shape3 = (1, 56, 56, 1)

# Profile with tracing
profiler.add_profile(model_fn(tf.random.normal(input_shape1)))
report1 = profiler.profile_statistics('flops')
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape1}: {report1}")

profiler.add_profile(model_fn(tf.random.normal(input_shape2)))
report2 = profiler.profile_statistics('flops')
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape2}: {report2}")

profiler.add_profile(model_fn(tf.random.normal(input_shape3)))
report3 = profiler.profile_statistics('flops')
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape3}: {report3}")

```

Here, the use of `@tf.function` and dynamic `input_shape` allows the profiler to trace the execution path, giving a more accurate representation of FLOPS, which will *likely* vary with input shape. However, even with this approach, small discrepancies might arise due to optimization techniques employed by the TensorFlow runtime.


**Example 3: Using the `tf.profiler.experimental.flops_v2` API:**

This newer API allows for a more granular and potentially accurate FLOPS calculation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

@tf.function
def model_fn(x):
  return model(x)

input_shape1 = (1, 28, 28, 1)
input_shape2 = (10, 28, 28, 1)
input_shape3 = (1, 56, 56, 1)

profiler = tf.profiler.Profiler(model)

flops_v2_result1 = tf.profiler.experimental.flops_v2(model, input_shape1)
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape1} (experimental): {flops_v2_result1}")

flops_v2_result2 = tf.profiler.experimental.flops_v2(model, input_shape2)
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape2} (experimental): {flops_v2_result2}")

flops_v2_result3 = tf.profiler.experimental.flops_v2(model, input_shape3)
print(f"FLOPS for input shape {input_shape3} (experimental): {flops_v2_result3}")

```

The `flops_v2` function will likely provide more accurate results than the default profiling method, especially when the input shapes significantly alter the computational path within the model.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on profiling, the TensorFlow Profiler API reference, and advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on performance optimization.  Consider exploring publications on efficient deep learning model design and optimization for a deeper understanding of the underlying computational aspects.  Familiarizing yourself with different profiling techniques and their strengths and limitations is also crucial for accurately interpreting the results.
