The core inefficiency of `UNION` and `UNION ALL` operations, particularly in large datasets, stems from their inherent reliance on intermediate result sets and the subsequent merging process.  My experience optimizing complex SQL queries across diverse relational database systems (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL) has shown that avoiding these operations often leads to substantial performance gains by leveraging the database engine's internal optimization capabilities more effectively.  Instead of concatenating results post-processing,  strategic query restructuring using joins, subqueries, or common table expressions (CTEs) generally produces superior results.  This response details these alternative approaches.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Optimization Strategies**

The fundamental principle behind optimizing queries that might otherwise use `UNION` or `UNION ALL` is to identify the underlying data relationships.  `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are typically employed when retrieving data from multiple tables with overlapping or distinct column sets but a common underlying theme.  Instead of performing separate `SELECT` statements and merging the results, the goal is to express the desired outcome within a single, more efficient query.

This can be achieved through several techniques:

* **Joining Related Tables:** If the data originates from tables linked by a foreign key or other relational constraint, a `JOIN` operation (inner, left, right, or full outer) is often the most efficient method.  `JOIN`s allow the database engine to perform the selection and combination of data in a single step, leveraging indexing and other optimization techniques.  The choice of join type depends on whether you need all matching rows from both tables (inner join), or all rows from one table regardless of matching rows in the other (left/right join).

* **Using Subqueries:** Subqueries can effectively replace `UNION` or `UNION ALL` by embedding one query within another.  This is particularly useful when one part of the query is dependent on the result of another.  A correlated subquery, where the inner query depends on the outer query, can simulate a `UNION`'s behavior in a more optimized manner.

* **Employing Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**  CTEs enhance readability and performance by allowing you to define reusable named result sets.  This is especially beneficial for complex queries involving multiple `UNION`s, as it breaks down the process into smaller, more manageable parts, thereby improving the overall query plan.  The database engine can optimize the CTE individually before integrating it into the main query.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate these concepts with three examples, showcasing the inefficient `UNION ALL` approach and its optimized alternatives:

**Example 1:  Retrieving Customer Data from Multiple Tables**

Let's assume we have two tables: `Customers_US` and `Customers_EU` with identical structures.  A naive approach using `UNION ALL` might look like this:

```sql
-- Inefficient UNION ALL approach
SELECT customer_id, name, address
FROM Customers_US
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, name, address
FROM Customers_EU;
```

This approach forces the database to execute two separate queries and then merge the results.  A more efficient approach uses a `UNION ALL`  with the WHERE clause based on a common identifier to avoid needing to combine data and then filter. A far superior alternative is to create a view of the two customer tables for future reference, as it combines the tables for simple and efficient usage in other queries:

```sql
--Optimized Approach
CREATE VIEW AllCustomers AS
SELECT customer_id, name, address, 'US' as region
FROM Customers_US
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, name, address, 'EU' as region
FROM Customers_EU;

SELECT * FROM AllCustomers;
```

This approach is still inefficient, but it creates a view that can be utilized by the rest of the application and the query planning is done one time.


```sql
-- Optimized approach using a UNION with a where clause
SELECT customer_id, name, address
FROM (SELECT customer_id, name, address, 'US' as region
FROM Customers_US
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, name, address, 'EU' as region
FROM Customers_EU) as combined_customers
WHERE region = 'EU';
```

This combines the result set first, and then applies the filter. This is usually faster than separate queries.

**Example 2: Retrieving Order Data with Related Customer Information**

Consider an `Orders` table and a `Customers` table, linked by `customer_id`. We want to retrieve order details along with customer name and address.  A `UNION ALL` approach would be cumbersome.  Instead, a `JOIN` is more efficient:

```sql
-- Inefficient approach (hypothetical, avoids UNION but still inefficient)
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.name, c.address
FROM Orders o
WHERE o.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers WHERE country = 'US')
UNION ALL
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.name, c.address
FROM Orders o
WHERE o.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers WHERE country = 'EU');

-- Efficient approach using JOIN
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.name, c.address
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

The `JOIN` operation directly combines data from both tables based on the `customer_id` relationship, avoiding the overhead of separate queries and merging.

**Example 3:  Conditional Aggregation Requiring UNION ALL**

Sometimes, `UNION ALL` might seem unavoidable, particularly in scenarios involving conditional aggregation across multiple tables with distinct structures. However, even in these cases, strategic restructuring often yields improvements.  Consider:

```sql
-- Inefficient UNION ALL approach (conditional aggregation)
SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales_us FROM Sales_US
UNION ALL
SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales_eu FROM Sales_EU;

-- Efficient approach using a CTE
WITH CombinedSales AS (
    SELECT sales, 'US' AS region FROM Sales_US
    UNION ALL
    SELECT sales, 'EU' AS region FROM Sales_EU
)
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'US' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_us,
       SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'EU' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_eu
FROM CombinedSales;
```

While a `UNION ALL` is still used within the CTE, this approach allows the database to optimize the combined sales data first before applying the conditional aggregation.  This is usually superior to two separate aggregation queries.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult your specific database system's documentation for advanced optimization techniques.  Focus on understanding query execution plans, indexing strategies, and the capabilities of your specific database engine's query optimizer.  Thorough testing and performance analysis are crucial for verifying the effectiveness of any optimization strategy.  Advanced books on SQL optimization and database tuning provide invaluable guidance on advanced topics.  Pay close attention to the specifics of your data and the structure of your tables to determine the most suitable method.
