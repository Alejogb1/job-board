Batch normalization, while offering significant advantages in training deep neural networks, presents unique challenges when implemented strictly on a batch-wise basis.  My experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models highlighted a crucial detail often overlooked: the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and the precise adherence to the batch-wise normalization definition.  The strict per-batch calculation can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, particularly when dealing with large batch sizes or limited computational resources.  This necessitates a careful consideration of the algorithm's implementation details and strategic optimizations.

**1. Explanation of Batch-Wise Normalization in TensorFlow**

Batch normalization aims to standardize the activations of a layer by normalizing each feature across the batch dimension.  The classic approach involves calculating the mean and variance of each feature within a batch, then normalizing the activations using these statistics. This process typically includes learned scaling and shifting parameters (γ and β) to retain representational power not lost through normalization.  Implementing this strictly on a per-batch basis implies that the normalization statistics are computed and applied *only* to the activations present in that specific batch.  This differs from the more common approach where running statistics (exponentially weighted moving averages of the mean and variance) are maintained across multiple batches to provide a more stable estimate, especially during inference.

The TensorFlow implementation of batch normalization, particularly `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`, defaults to using these running statistics.  To enforce a purely batch-wise computation, we must explicitly disable the use of running statistics and ensure that the normalization parameters are recalculated for each batch. This can be achieved by manipulating the layer's configuration parameters and potentially using custom training loops.  The crucial difference lies in how the moments (mean and variance) are computed: a strict per-batch approach excludes the accumulated statistics used in the default implementation.  This directly impacts the stability of training, especially during early epochs where batch statistics can be highly variable.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Standard Batch Normalization (Using Running Statistics)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(), # Default behavior: uses running statistics
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This is the standard, efficient implementation utilizing running statistics for both training and inference.  This is generally preferred for its stability and efficiency, but it deviates from a purely batch-wise approach.

**Example 2: Batch-Wise Normalization with Custom Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(moving_mean_initializer='zeros', moving_variance_initializer='ones', momentum=0.0), #Disable running statistics
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

for epoch in range(10):
  for batch in dataset: # Assume dataset is a tf.data.Dataset
    images, labels = batch
    train_step(images, labels)
```

Here, we explicitly disable the running statistics by initializing them to zeros and ones, and setting `momentum` to 0. The custom training loop ensures that normalization happens purely on a per-batch level. This approach sacrifices some efficiency for strict batch-wise behavior.  Note that this method may require significant adjustments depending on the complexity of the model and the dataset.

**Example 3:  Using `tf.nn.batch_normalization` for Fine-Grained Control**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition excluding BatchNormalization layer) ...

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
  # ... (Forward pass up to the point before normalization) ...
  batch_mean, batch_variance = tf.nn.moments(activations, axes=[0]) # Calculate batch statistics
  normalized = tf.nn.batch_normalization(activations, batch_mean, batch_variance, beta, gamma, variance_epsilon)
  # ... (Rest of the forward pass and backpropagation) ...
```

This example leverages `tf.nn.batch_normalization` directly, providing maximum control. We explicitly compute the batch mean and variance using `tf.nn.moments`.  `beta` and `gamma` need to be learned parameters, initialized appropriately.  This demonstrates the most direct, yet most manual, way to achieve per-batch normalization.  It is the least efficient but offers the highest level of control over the normalization process. This implementation requires careful handling of the learned scaling and shifting parameters (γ and β).


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` and `tf.nn.batch_normalization`.  Further exploration into custom training loops within TensorFlow would be beneficial for implementing more complex normalization strategies.  A solid understanding of gradient-based optimization algorithms within the context of deep learning is crucial for effectively implementing and debugging these custom training approaches. Consulting academic papers on batch normalization and its variants will offer a deeper theoretical understanding of the technique.  Finally, careful study of TensorFlow's graph execution and automatic differentiation mechanisms will be valuable for optimizing the computational performance of customized solutions.  The intricacies of TensorFlow's internal workings, especially regarding tensor operations and automatic differentiation, will be instrumental in addressing potential performance issues arising from per-batch implementations.
