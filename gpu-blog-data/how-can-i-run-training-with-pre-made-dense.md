The core challenge in utilizing pre-trained dense layers within TensorFlow 2.0 for further training hinges on effectively managing the layer's weights and biases during the transfer learning process.  Simply loading a pre-trained layer isn't sufficient;  one must carefully control which parameters are trainable and how the new layers interact with the existing architecture.  My experience building and deploying large-scale recommendation systems highlighted this nuance repeatedly.  Incorrectly managing trainability leads to either ineffective learning or unintended weight overwriting, hindering performance.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Employing pre-trained dense layers in TensorFlow 2.0 involves a multi-step process. First, you load the pre-trained weights.  Importantly, this involves loading the layer itself, not just its weights.  This preserves the layer's internal structure and associated metadata, crucial for proper integration into the new model.  Then, you decide which parameters should be trainable.  This decision rests on the nature of the pre-trained model and the target task.  If the pre-trained model's task is closely related to the new task, freezing (setting `trainable=False`) the pre-trained layer's weights can be beneficial, leveraging existing knowledge while preventing catastrophic forgetting.  Conversely, if the tasks differ significantly, allowing partial or full training of the pre-trained layers might prove necessary.  Finally, the pre-trained layer is integrated into the new model architecture, followed by the addition of new layers tailored to the specific task, and training commences using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Freezing Pre-trained Dense Layer**

This example showcases a scenario where the pre-trained dense layer is entirely frozen.  This approach is suitable when the pre-trained model's task is similar to the new task. The existing feature representations are assumed valuable, hence preventing them from being altered during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained model (replace with your actual loading mechanism)
pre_trained_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("pretrained_dense_layer.h5")
pre_trained_dense_layer = pre_trained_model.layers[-1] # Assumes dense layer is the last layer

# Freeze the pre-trained layer
pre_trained_dense_layer.trainable = False

# Create a new sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    pre_trained_dense_layer,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Add a new dense layer for the new task
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**Example 2: Partial Training of Pre-trained Dense Layer**

In this scenario, some of the pre-trained layers' weights are trainable, while others remain frozen.  This approach is useful when the pre-trained model and the new task share some, but not all, aspects.  For instance, only the final dense layer might need adjustment for a slightly different output space.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained model
pre_trained_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("pretrained_dense_layer.h5")
pre_trained_dense_layer = pre_trained_model.layers[-1]

# Partially train the pre-trained layer (e.g., only the weights)
pre_trained_dense_layer.trainable = True
for layer in pre_trained_dense_layer.layers[:-1]: #assuming last layer is bias-only
    layer.trainable = False


# Create a new model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    pre_trained_dense_layer,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**Example 3: Fine-tuning the Entire Pre-trained Layer**

Here, the entire pre-trained dense layer is fine-tuned.  This is appropriate when the pre-trained model's task is significantly different from the new task or when the pre-trained model is considered a feature extractor, with its internal representations potentially beneficial but requiring adaptation.  However, this carries a higher risk of overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.  Careful consideration of learning rate scheduling is recommended.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained model
pre_trained_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("pretrained_dense_layer.h5")
pre_trained_dense_layer = pre_trained_model.layers[-1]

# Fine-tune the entire pre-trained layer
pre_trained_dense_layer.trainable = True

# Create a new model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    pre_trained_dense_layer,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model with a reduced learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-5), # Reduced learning rate
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow 2.0 documentation offers comprehensive information on model building, layer manipulation, and training strategies.  Consult the official guides on model subclassing and the Keras API for deeper understanding of layer customization.  Furthermore, textbooks on deep learning and transfer learning provide a strong theoretical foundation for effective implementation.  Reviewing research papers on transfer learning in the context of dense layers will provide valuable insights into best practices and common pitfalls.  Finally, exploring open-source code repositories focusing on similar tasks can illuminate effective coding patterns.  Consider reviewing materials on regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting during fine-tuning.
