The `None` return from TensorFlow's `GradientTape` almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the tape's recorded operations and the variables you subsequently attempt to differentiate with respect to.  My experience debugging this, across numerous projects involving complex neural network architectures and custom training loops, points to this as the primary culprit.  It's not necessarily an error in the `GradientTape` itself, but rather a consequence of how the computational graph is constructed and the variables involved in the computation.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`GradientTape` in TensorFlow 2 functions by recording operations performed within its context manager.  Crucially, it only records operations involving *trainable* variables.  If your computation depends on non-trainable variables, constants, or values not explicitly generated within the tape's scope using trainable variables, the gradient calculation for those variables will be undefined, resulting in a `None` return.  This is often masked by seemingly innocuous code snippets, as the error isn't immediately apparent from the variable declaration alone. The problem lies in the *flow* of computation.  The tape essentially builds a computational graph.  If there's a branch of that graph that doesn't originate from a trainable variable within the tape's context, the gradient calculation for the final output with respect to the trainable variables will be incomplete, manifesting as `None`.

Further, the issue can arise if you attempt to differentiate with respect to variables that were not created within the tape's context, or if the operations leading to the target tensor for differentiation involve operations not recorded by the tape.  This frequently occurs with pre-computed tensors or tensors passed directly into the tape's context without having their calculations recorded by the tape itself.  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation relies on this meticulously recorded history of operations.  Any break in this chain leads to the `None` result.

Finally,  subtle errors in variable sharing or improper usage of `tf.stop_gradient()` can also lead to this issue. Incorrectly applying `tf.stop_gradient()` prevents the gradient from propagating backward through a specific part of the graph, potentially leading to `None` for variables that are downstream of that operation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Variable not within the tape's context:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)
z = x + y # computation occurs outside the GradientTape context

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = z * 3

grad = tape.gradient(result, x) # grad will be None
print(grad) # Output: None
```

In this example, the crucial addition `z = x + y` occurs *before* the `GradientTape` context.  The `GradientTape` only sees the multiplication `result = z * 3`, and since it lacks the computational history of `z`, it cannot compute the gradient with respect to `x`.


**Example 2: Non-trainable variable:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.constant(2.0)  # y is a constant, not a trainable variable

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = x * y

grad = tape.gradient(result, x) # grad will be 2.0, even if y is not trainable
print(grad) #Output: 2.0

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = x * y
    grad_y = tape.gradient(result, y) # grad_y will be None
    print(grad_y) #Output: None
```

While the gradient with respect to `x` (a trainable variable) can be computed, attempting to compute the gradient with respect to `y` (a constant) will return `None`. The tape doesn't track gradients for non-trainable variables, although it uses them in the computation.



**Example 3: Incorrect use of `tf.stop_gradient()`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    intermediate = x * y
    result = tf.stop_gradient(intermediate) + x

grad = tape.gradient(result, x) # grad will be 1.0, not 2.0
print(grad) # Output: 1.0
```

Here, `tf.stop_gradient(intermediate)` prevents the gradient from flowing back through the `x * y` operation.  Therefore, the gradient of `result` with respect to `x` only considers the final `+ x` operation, resulting in a gradient of 1.0, not the expected 2.0. If you were to instead calculate `tape.gradient(result, y)`, this would also return `None` as the gradient from the intermediate result is stopped before reaching y.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on `GradientTape`, including advanced usage scenarios. Carefully reviewing the sections on automatic differentiation and the nuances of `tf.stop_gradient()` is crucial.  Furthermore, understanding the concept of the computational graph and how TensorFlow constructs it is fundamentally important for debugging gradient-related issues.  Finally, consult textbooks and online courses specializing in deep learning and automatic differentiation; many offer in-depth explanations of how backpropagation algorithms function, which directly relates to `GradientTape`'s behavior.  Mastering these concepts significantly improves your ability to diagnose and resolve issues like the `None` return from `GradientTape`.
