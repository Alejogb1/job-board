A `_keras_shape` attribute error during output splitting in Keras, specifically after a layer has been passed as an input to a custom layer or function, signals an incompatibility between the Keras symbolic tensor infrastructure and how the operation is attempting to infer tensor dimensions. This error arises when Keras loses track of the tensor's shape information after it exits a traditional Keras layer, crucial for subsequent operations reliant on that shape for proper computation.

Specifically, Keras relies on a hidden `_keras_shape` attribute, attached to Keras tensors (a symbolic representation of TensorFlow tensors), to perform automatic shape inference during model building. This attribute gets generated and managed implicitly by standard Keras layers. However, operations outside the pre-defined Keras layer structure, such as slicing or splitting tensor outputs within custom functions or using lambda layers that don’t preserve this information, can disrupt this mechanism. When subsequent layers attempt to utilize the tensor's shape (e.g., during concatenation or when creating weights specific to the tensor's size), the lack of `_keras_shape` triggers the error. The crux of the problem is that the initial layer's output is no longer treated as a valid Keras tensor after the splitting occurs, as Keras's tracking system fails to automatically update the shape metadata.

My initial encounter with this occurred during a complex convolutional network I was developing for hyperspectral image classification. I extracted features with a series of CNN layers, then designed a custom 'attention' mechanism. This attention layer received the output of one of these CNN feature extraction layers and needed to split that output along the feature dimension before applying independent operations, ultimately concatenating it back into a single tensor. Initially, I used simple slicing along the final dimension within a `Lambda` layer. This was a naive approach and, predictably, led to the dreaded `AttributeError`. Here’s a simplified example illustrating the initial failed attempt:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def split_and_process(x):
    # Attempt to split the tensor, causing the error
    split1, split2 = tf.split(x, num_or_size_splits=2, axis=-1)
    # Arbitrary processing (can be any operation)
    split1 = tf.nn.relu(split1)
    split2 = tf.nn.sigmoid(split2)
    return tf.concat([split1, split2], axis=-1)

input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 16))
conv = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Using a Lambda layer to perform splitting and processing, causing error
processed_output = layers.Lambda(split_and_process)(conv)

# Example of using the split data
final_output = layers.Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu')(processed_output)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=final_output)

try:
    model(tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 16)))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This catches the AttributeError
```

The primary issue with the preceding code is the function `split_and_process`. It operates directly on the TensorFlow tensor `x` and uses TensorFlow operations (`tf.split`, `tf.nn.relu`, `tf.nn.sigmoid`, `tf.concat`), but without proper interaction with Keras's shape tracking mechanisms. The `Lambda` layer effectively acts as a bridge between the Keras symbolic world and the raw TensorFlow domain, but doesn’t preserve the vital `_keras_shape`. The error occurs later when Keras is asked to build the subsequent `Conv2D` layer, which attempts to determine the input shape and fails because `processed_output` lacks the necessary `_keras_shape`.

The solution lies in using Keras' functional API combined with Keras layers whenever possible, which preserves the shape information via symbolic tensor operations within the Keras framework or utilizing custom Keras layers. Custom layers correctly maintain and update the `_keras_shape` during transformations, allowing for smooth downstream processing. I refactored the prior implementation using a custom layer to demonstrate the correct method.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class SplitProcessLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(SplitProcessLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, x):
        split1, split2 = tf.split(x, num_or_size_splits=2, axis=-1)
        split1 = tf.nn.relu(split1)
        split2 = tf.nn.sigmoid(split2)
        return tf.concat([split1, split2], axis=-1)

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
         # Dynamically compute the output shape, keeping Keras in the loop.
        if len(input_shape) != 4: # Assuming NHWC shape, i.e., 4 elements in the shape tuple
            raise ValueError("Input shape must have 4 dimensions (Batch, Height, Width, Channels).")

        # Calculate new number of channels
        channels = input_shape[-1]
        new_channels = channels
        return (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], input_shape[2], new_channels)

input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 16))
conv = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
processed_output = SplitProcessLayer()(conv) # Using the Custom Layer
final_output = layers.Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu')(processed_output)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=final_output)

model(tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 16)))
print("Model executed successfully")
```

In this refined version, the `split_and_process` logic is encapsulated within a custom `SplitProcessLayer` inheriting from `keras.layers.Layer`. Most critically, the `compute_output_shape` method has been added. This function instructs Keras on how the output tensor shape changes after processing. Crucially, because `compute_output_shape` is correctly implemented and invoked by the layer during Keras model building, the `_keras_shape` attribute is managed automatically, allowing the subsequent `Conv2D` layer to be initialized without error. The key here is not just executing the processing but also properly informing Keras of shape changes, ensuring Keras' shape tracking remains consistent. The output is now correctly passed to subsequent layers, maintaining the symbolic tensor's shape meta-data. This approach is superior because it is fully compatible with Keras's internal mechanisms.

Another scenario that can trigger this error is when using more complex tensor manipulations within custom functions that are not explicitly associated with layers. In my early work I was experimenting with a spatial attention mechanism which required complex pixel-wise manipulations. While I was still developing, I did something similar to below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def attention_mechanism(x):
    h = tf.shape(x)[1]  # Extract height
    w = tf.shape(x)[2]  # Extract width

    attention_map = tf.random.normal(shape=(h,w,1)) #create an arbitrary attention map
    x_attention = x * attention_map
    return x_attention

input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 16))
conv = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_tensor)

attention_output = layers.Lambda(attention_mechanism)(conv) #this causes an issue

final_output = layers.Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu')(attention_output)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=final_output)

try:
    model(tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 16)))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here, `attention_mechanism` uses `tf.shape` directly, which results in the loss of  `_keras_shape` again. While it may seem simple to derive the shape here, the abstraction layer of Keras does not automatically recognize this, leading to errors. This is a classic case where using basic operations outside the context of Keras's graph construction causes problems. The fix is to use the same custom layer approach:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class AttentionLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(AttentionLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, x):
        h = tf.shape(x)[1]  # Extract height
        w = tf.shape(x)[2]  # Extract width

        attention_map = tf.random.normal(shape=(h,w,1)) #create an arbitrary attention map
        x_attention = x * attention_map
        return x_attention

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
      # Correctly calculates the new shape for attention layer
        if len(input_shape) != 4: # Assuming NHWC shape
            raise ValueError("Input shape must have 4 dimensions (Batch, Height, Width, Channels).")

        return (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], input_shape[2], input_shape[3])


input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 16))
conv = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
attention_output = AttentionLayer()(conv) # Using the custom layer
final_output = layers.Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu')(attention_output)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=final_output)

model(tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 16)))
print("Model executed successfully")
```

By creating a custom `AttentionLayer` that extends `keras.layers.Layer` and defines `compute_output_shape` appropriately, the shape information is managed, resolving the error and allowing the model to execute.

For further study, I would recommend focusing on the Keras documentation related to custom layers and model subclassing. Reviewing advanced TensorFlow tutorials on symbolic tensor manipulation would also be beneficial. Additionally, analyzing open source implementations of complex neural networks can offer insights into how shape management is implemented in practice. Experimenting with the functional API and investigating the specific limitations of Lambda layers is a valuable learning experience. Understanding the implicit shape tracking in Keras and the implications of breaking that chain is crucial for building robust models.
