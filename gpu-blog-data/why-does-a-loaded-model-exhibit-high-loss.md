The abrupt increase in loss after loading a previously trained machine learning model, even when the initial training loss was low, often points towards a discontinuity introduced during the model saving and loading process or an environmental mismatch. The state of the optimizer and any associated learning rate schedules are crucial, and their incorrect restoration is a frequent culprit.

When we save a model, we typically serialize the network’s architecture and its learned parameters (weights and biases). However, most optimizers, such as Adam or SGD with momentum, maintain internal state, such as momentum buffers or adaptive learning rate parameters. These are not weights, but influence how those weights are updated during training. If this optimizer state is not saved along with the model's weights and then correctly reloaded, the model resumes training with the optimizer effectively initialized randomly. This leads to an abrupt, and often disastrous, change in the gradients, and hence the loss increases.

The problem isn't just that the optimizer is reset. It’s that it’s reset to *random* values, which are inconsistent with the previously learned parameter values. Optimizers are usually configured to step the weights along the gradient of the loss function, but doing so effectively in the early training stages depends on their internal state. A randomly reinitialized optimizer is unlikely to immediately generate effective updates, and might even push parameters into regions of high loss. This means that continuing training from this state becomes very problematic and ineffective, and the model struggles to recover from this shock.

Furthermore, there are other factors to consider. The loaded model might also inherit data transformations from the training environment. Differences in scaling or normalization between the saved training data environment and the current data environment can also cause drastic changes to model performance. Although the network's parameters may be correct, the input might be presented in a format the model was not trained for. This leads the model to output poor, high-loss predictions.

Finally, the loading process itself can be problematic. Data corruption when saving or retrieving the saved files can result in incorrect model parameters and erratic performance. Less frequently, but worth considering, is the version mismatch between libraries used for training and loading. Subtle differences can cause unexpected behavior.

To address these issues, I typically follow a few best practices. Saving and loading both the model’s parameters and the optimizer state is paramount. The code below demonstrates this with PyTorch, including data preprocessing.

```python
# Example 1: Saving and loading model and optimizer state (PyTorch)

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Dummy model and data
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
data = torch.randn(100, 10)
labels = torch.randn(100, 1)
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(2):
  for inputs, targets in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save checkpoint
checkpoint = {
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict()
}
torch.save(checkpoint, 'model.pth')

# Load checkpoint
loaded_model = SimpleModel()
loaded_optimizer = optim.Adam(loaded_model.parameters(), lr = 0.001)
loaded_checkpoint = torch.load('model.pth')
loaded_model.load_state_dict(loaded_checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
loaded_optimizer.load_state_dict(loaded_checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])


# Now continue training with loaded_model and loaded_optimizer
# ...
```

This code segment showcases that to correctly restore a training process from a saved checkpoint, it’s imperative to save and load not just the `model.state_dict()` but also the `optimizer.state_dict()`. Otherwise, the optimizer will be reset, thus destroying any learned progress. The code also serves as a mini test environment to ensure the basic structure works, a common approach I find valuable when debugging.

In practice, data preprocessing is a vital part of maintaining model performance consistency when loading models. The code below demonstrates how to save and reload data processing parameters alongside the model.

```python
# Example 2: Saving and loading data preprocessors

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pickle

# Dummy model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Dummy data
data = torch.randn(100, 10).numpy()
labels = torch.randn(100, 1).numpy()


# Data scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
scaled_data = torch.tensor(scaled_data, dtype=torch.float32)
labels = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.float32)

dataset = TensorDataset(scaled_data, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(2):
  for inputs, targets in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save model and scaler
checkpoint = {
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict()
}
torch.save(checkpoint, 'model.pth')
with open('scaler.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(scaler, file)


# Load model and scaler
loaded_model = SimpleModel()
loaded_optimizer = optim.Adam(loaded_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loaded_checkpoint = torch.load('model.pth')
loaded_model.load_state_dict(loaded_checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
loaded_optimizer.load_state_dict(loaded_checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
with open('scaler.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    loaded_scaler = pickle.load(file)

# Apply loaded scaler to new data
new_data = torch.randn(50, 10).numpy()
new_scaled_data = loaded_scaler.transform(new_data)
new_scaled_data = torch.tensor(new_scaled_data, dtype=torch.float32)
# Use loaded_model on new_scaled_data
# ...
```
This example highlights the necessity of saving not only the trained model, but also any data preprocessing steps applied during training, demonstrated here with a `StandardScaler`. Failure to do so will result in inconsistent inputs, leading to poor predictions and high loss after loading. I prefer using `pickle` for saving these parameters due to its straightforward implementation and compatibility across different machine-learning environments, though other serialization formats work equally well.

Finally, I want to demonstrate an example of how version mismatches can lead to issues, with TensorFlow, although this applies equally to other frameworks. It's important to use the same library versions for both training and loading to prevent incompatibility issues. This can lead to errors, but often just results in silent bugs in model behavior.

```python
# Example 3: Demonstrating potential version issues (TensorFlow)

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Dummy model and data
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Training loop
for _ in range(2):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

# Save the complete model
model.save('saved_model')

# Later, a user with a different version loads the model:
#Assume we are using tf version 2.10 for training
#A person loads this with tf version 2.14

#loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('saved_model') # This might load, but
#there will be inconsistencies, often only visible as poor performance
#This is very difficult to track

# Instead we should always ensure that we have the correct version:
# tf.__version__ is 2.10
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('saved_model')

#Now use loaded model
#...
```

This example, even though it functions, demonstrates the core issue: differences in underlying library versions, while not necessarily throwing errors, can silently lead to changes in model loading, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior such as an immediate spike in loss. To mitigate these issues, I recommend using a virtual environment to carefully manage dependencies and consistently use the same library version when training and loading models.  The key takeaway is not that a failure will occur but that the failure can be silent and only manifest as reduced model performance.

In summary, the key to avoiding a sudden increase in loss after loading a model is careful management of all the saved state and environment. Saving and loading both the model parameters and the optimizer state, ensuring data preprocessing consistency, and maintaining version control are all essential steps I’ve learned the hard way. For further study, I recommend publications focusing on deep learning practices, such as those from research groups that frequently publish open-source models and those on reproducible machine learning. Texts on good software engineering practices can also provide helpful guidelines on model tracking and version management. Understanding the fine-grained behavior of different optimizers can also prove invaluable, and technical publications on this topic abound.
