The determination of whether an allocation request of 86,973,087,744 bytes exceeds a system's 10% memory limit hinges critically on the system's total available memory.  The raw allocation size alone is insufficient; we must incorporate the system's total capacity into the calculation.  In my experience debugging memory-intensive applications, overlooking this fundamental aspect has frequently led to misinterpretations and unpredictable behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem involves a simple percentage calculation. We need to determine the total system memory and compare the requested allocation to 10% of that total.  The formula is straightforward:

`Allocation Limit = Total System Memory * 0.1`

If the allocation request (86,973,087,744 bytes) is greater than the calculated allocation limit, then it exceeds the 10% threshold.  It's vital to express both the allocation request and the system memory in the same units (bytes in this case) to avoid errors.  Furthermore,  consideration should be given to the operating system's overhead and memory fragmentation.  The available memory to applications is typically less than the raw physical memory reported by `free -m` or equivalent system commands.  Therefore, obtaining an accurate representation of the memory truly available for allocation requires careful examination of system metrics and memory usage patterns.  In scenarios where memory management is dynamically adjusted (e.g., using swap space), an instantaneous reading might not reflect the sustained allocation capability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to determining whether the allocation request exceeds the limit, incorporating error handling and consideration for different programming paradigms.

**Example 1: C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits> // for numeric_limits

bool exceedsMemoryLimit(long long totalSystemMemoryInBytes, long long allocationRequestInBytes) {
  if (totalSystemMemoryInBytes <= 0) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Total system memory must be positive.");
  }
  if (allocationRequestInBytes <=0) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Allocation request must be positive.");
  }

  long long limit = totalSystemMemoryInBytes * 0.1;

  // Check for potential overflow during multiplication.
  if (limit < 0 || (totalSystemMemoryInBytes > 0 && limit/totalSystemMemoryInBytes != 0.1)) {
     throw std::overflow_error("Overflow during limit calculation");
  }

  return allocationRequestInBytes > limit;
}

int main() {
  long long totalSystemMemory = 1000000000000; // 1 TB Example - replace with actual system memory in bytes
  long long allocationRequest = 86973087744;

  try {
    bool exceeds = exceedsMemoryLimit(totalSystemMemory, allocationRequest);
    std::cout << "Allocation exceeds limit: " << (exceeds ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
  } catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This C++ example demonstrates robust error handling. It checks for invalid input (non-positive values) and potential integer overflow during the limit calculation, which is crucial when dealing with large numbers.  The `try-catch` block ensures graceful error handling.  Replacing `totalSystemMemory` with the actual system memory in bytes is paramount for accurate results.

**Example 2: Python**

```python
def exceeds_memory_limit(total_system_memory_bytes, allocation_request_bytes):
    """Checks if allocation exceeds 10% of total system memory."""

    if total_system_memory_bytes <= 0 or allocation_request_bytes <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Memory values must be positive.")

    limit = total_system_memory_bytes * 0.1
    return allocation_request_bytes > limit

try:
  total_system_memory = 1000000000000  # 1 TB - Replace with actual system memory in bytes
  allocation_request = 86973087744
  exceeds = exceeds_memory_limit(total_system_memory, allocation_request)
  print(f"Allocation exceeds limit: {exceeds}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

The Python example provides a concise and readable solution.  It leverages Python's exception handling mechanism for error management. Similar to the C++ example, remember to replace the placeholder value for `total_system_memory` with the actual system memory size.

**Example 3: PowerShell**

```powershell
function Test-MemoryAllocation {
  param(
    [long]$TotalSystemMemoryInBytes,
    [long]$AllocationRequestInBytes
  )

  if ($TotalSystemMemoryInBytes -le 0 -or $AllocationRequestInBytes -le 0) {
    throw "Memory values must be positive."
  }

  $limit = $TotalSystemMemoryInBytes * 0.1
  return ($AllocationRequestInBytes -gt $limit)
}

try {
  $totalSystemMemory = 1000000000000 #1TB - Replace with actual value
  $allocationRequest = 86973087744
  $exceeds = Test-MemoryAllocation -TotalSystemMemoryInBytes $totalSystemMemory -AllocationRequestInBytes $allocationRequest
  Write-Host "Allocation exceeds limit: $($exceeds)"
}
catch {
  Write-Error $_.Exception.Message
}
```

This PowerShell script uses a function to encapsulate the logic. Error handling is integrated using the `try-catch` block.  The output is clearly displayed using `Write-Host`. As before, the placeholder for `$totalSystemMemory` needs to be replaced with the accurate system memory size.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For gaining a deeper understanding of memory management, I suggest consulting operating system documentation specific to your environment, advanced programming texts covering memory allocation and deallocation, and resources dedicated to system performance tuning.  Studying memory profiling tools and techniques will enhance your ability to monitor and optimize memory usage effectively.  Furthermore, research into virtual memory and paging mechanisms will prove invaluable in complex memory management scenarios.  Finally, reviewing documentation on your chosen programming language's memory management features will significantly improve your coding practices.
