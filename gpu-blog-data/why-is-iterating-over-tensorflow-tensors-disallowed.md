TensorFlow's core design principle revolves around graph construction and execution, a key difference from traditional numerical computation libraries. Direct iteration over a TensorFlow tensor, while seemingly intuitive, violates this principle because tensors represent symbolic placeholders within the computation graph, not concrete numerical values. They represent operations to be performed, not the results themselves. Allowing direct iteration would force TensorFlow to prematurely evaluate the graph, undermining its deferred execution model and significantly hindering optimizations.

The core of TensorFlow’s efficiency and scalability lies in its ability to construct a computational graph, representing the sequence of operations, and then execute that graph efficiently on the available hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU). Tensors are the edges connecting nodes representing operations; they don't inherently contain data until the graph is executed within a session or via an eager execution context. When a loop attempts to iterate over a tensor, it expects a concrete sequence of values, not a symbolic operation. This forces a premature materialization of the tensor's content at each iteration, destroying opportunities for graph-level optimizations like kernel fusion and parallel execution. Iteration requires knowing the size of the tensor, which is not always immediately available within the graph construction phase. The sizes may be symbolic or depend on input data. Therefore, an explicit call to an evaluation routine (like `tf.Session.run` or in eager mode, the return of a result from a TensorFlow operation), is needed to obtain concrete numerical content.

This might seem less intuitive than standard programming where a list or array can be directly iterated. However, this design allows TensorFlow to perform optimizations at the graph level. For instance, consider a tensor that's the result of a complex series of operations. If we directly iterate over it, the entire series of operations would be performed each time we need a single element, repeating a lot of computation unnecessarily. With the graph representation and deferred execution, the entire series of operations is computed only once when we request the final output or a subset of it after the graph is built.

My personal experience dealing with image processing pipelines in TensorFlow brought this limitation to the forefront very quickly. I initially attempted to loop through the individual pixel rows of a decoded image tensor after decoding a series of JPG images, expecting to operate on each row individually, much like one would with a NumPy array. This resulted in a runtime error, highlighting the fundamental disconnect between eager evaluation as in traditional programming, and TensorFlow's deferred computation style.

Let's examine some examples. First, consider the following simple case:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

try:
    for row in a:
        print(row)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here, the error message will clearly state that a tensor cannot be directly converted into an iterator.  The loop expects to iterate over a concrete sequence, like a Python list, but `a` is a TensorFlow tensor. The loop attempts a conversion which TensorFlow refuses. This is because, during graph construction, we only record the symbolic operation of creating a tensor, not the values directly.

To correctly operate on elements of a tensor, we need to use TensorFlow operations and often need to map them using `tf.map_fn` or similar constructs. Here's an example of how to sum the elements within each row of a tensor:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

row_sums = tf.reduce_sum(a, axis=1)

# In eager mode or within a session:
if tf.executing_eagerly():
   print(row_sums)
else:
  with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(row_sums))
```

In this example, `tf.reduce_sum` is used to aggregate over a given axis. `axis=1` specifies that we want to sum across the rows (axis one). This operation returns another tensor representing the sums. The actual summation occurs only during the `sess.run` call, or within eager mode where the result is readily available. This is a correct TensorFlow approach because it operates symbolically on tensors, constructing a computation graph without immediately evaluating intermediate values.

For more complex iterative tasks, consider mapping a function across a tensor. Here, we'll square each element of a tensor by mapping a TensorFlow operation over it.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

def square(x):
  return x * x

squared = tf.map_fn(square, a)

# In eager mode or within a session:
if tf.executing_eagerly():
   print(squared)
else:
  with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      print(sess.run(squared))
```

Here, `tf.map_fn` applies the `square` function to each element of the tensor. Again, the squaring operation is defined within the TensorFlow graph context, and the actual evaluation occurs later. This approach enables the graph to be optimized, with operations potentially running in parallel on a GPU or TPU. `tf.map_fn` is often preferred over manual loop-like operations in many situations because its implementation within TensorFlow is optimized for efficient execution, taking advantage of the computational graph.

Directly iterating over a tensor would severely hamper TensorFlow’s ability to optimize code for hardware acceleration. The computational graph design allows for operations to be reordered, fused, and distributed across multiple devices – all of which become difficult, if not impossible, if direct iteration was allowed. The symbolic graph structure ensures that operations are evaluated only when needed and in the most efficient manner possible.

Therefore, the inability to directly iterate over a tensor is a deliberate design choice. It forces developers to think within the paradigm of graph construction and execution. This approach, while initially cumbersome, is crucial for building scalable and performant machine learning models with TensorFlow.

For further reading and practice, the official TensorFlow documentation is paramount. Exploring the concepts of graph construction, lazy evaluation, and the functionalities of operations such as `tf.map_fn`, `tf.reduce_sum`, and `tf.scan` are essential.  Additionally, studying examples of image or text processing pipelines in TensorFlow can illuminate this design aspect and its importance. Finally, familiarity with TensorBoard for visualizing the constructed computation graphs provides invaluable insights into the underlying computation flow and how TensorFlow executes operations. These are necessary resources to truly understand the limitations of direct iteration and how to work effectively within the TensorFlow framework.
