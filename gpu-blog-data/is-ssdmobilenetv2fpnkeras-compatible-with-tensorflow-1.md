The compatibility of `ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpn_keras` with TensorFlow 1 hinges on the specific implementation and dependencies within that particular model architecture.  My experience working with object detection models across various TensorFlow versions indicates that direct compatibility is unlikely without significant modifications.  While the core MobileNet V2 architecture is compatible with TensorFlow 1, the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) framework and the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) integration often rely on newer TensorFlow APIs and Keras functionalities introduced after TensorFlow 1's release.

**1. Explanation of Incompatibility and Migration Strategies:**

TensorFlow 1, based on its static computational graph paradigm, differs substantially from the eager execution model adopted in TensorFlow 2 and beyond. `ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpn_keras` models, especially those pre-trained using TensorFlow 2-era tools, heavily leverage functionalities like custom layers,  `tf.keras` APIs (introduced post-TensorFlow 1), and potentially, TensorFlow Lite conversion methodologies.  These features either didn't exist or were drastically different in TensorFlow 1. Attempting to load such a model directly would result in errors related to unsupported Keras functions, incompatible layer definitions, and the absence of necessary ops (operations).

Therefore, direct compatibility is improbable.  The primary migration strategies involve either: a) finding a TensorFlow 1-compatible pre-trained model of similar architecture (unlikely given the prevalence of newer versions), or b) re-implementing the model from scratch using TensorFlow 1-compatible libraries and constructs.  The latter is significantly more involved but ensures functionality within the desired environment.  It requires a thorough understanding of the SSD architecture, FPN integration, and MobileNet V2 specifics.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the challenges and potential solutions. I will focus on key differences to highlight the incompatibility and illustrate the necessary refactoring.

**Example 1:  Illustrating an Incompatible Keras Layer:**

```python
# Hypothetical snippet from ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpn_keras (TensorFlow 2+)
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Activation

def my_custom_layer(x):
  x = Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(x)
  x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x) # Axis=-1 is a TF2+ convention
  x = Activation('relu')(x)
  return x

# ... rest of the model definition ...
```

This example shows a custom layer incorporating `BatchNormalization` with `axis=-1`. TensorFlow 1's `BatchNormalization` doesn't inherently support this `axis` parameter.  The fix involves either finding an equivalent way to specify normalization axis (potentially using different arguments or manual manipulation of tensor dimensions) or using a different normalization layer compatible with TensorFlow 1.


**Example 2:  Addressing Eager Execution Differences:**

```python
# Hypothetical TensorFlow 2+ training snippet
import tensorflow as tf

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10)
```

TensorFlow 1 requires defining the computational graph before execution, using `tf.Session()`. The above code directly uses eager execution, which wasn't the default in TensorFlow 1.  To make it TensorFlow 1 compatible, the graph needs to be constructed explicitly, the training process managed within a session, and data feeding handled accordingly.

```python
# TensorFlow 1 equivalent (simplified)
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(10):
        for batch in train_data:
            _, loss_value = sess.run([train_op, loss], feed_dict={input_placeholder: batch})
#...train_op and loss would need to be defined using TensorFlow 1 constructs...
```

This demonstrates the crucial difference: explicit graph construction and session management in TensorFlow 1 versus the more implicit approach in TensorFlow 2+.


**Example 3:  Handling Custom Loss Functions:**

Suppose the `ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpn_keras` model uses a custom loss function employing TensorFlow 2 features like `tf.function`.  This needs to be rewritten using TensorFlow 1's computational graph paradigm.

```python
# Hypothetical TensorFlow 2+ custom loss
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  # ... complex loss calculation using TensorFlow 2 ops ...
  return loss

# ... within the model's compile statement in TF2+ ...
```

A TensorFlow 1 equivalent would remove the `@tf.function` decorator and explicitly define the loss calculation within the graph, potentially using `tf.placeholder` for inputs and leveraging TensorFlow 1 operations for the calculations.  This would require a thorough understanding of TensorFlow 1's graph construction methods.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow 1 documentation (now archived), TensorFlow white papers on the transition from TensorFlow 1 to 2, and comprehensive guides on object detection architectures such as SSD and FPN would be invaluable resources.   Specifically seeking out tutorials and examples of implementing SSD or FPN architectures purely within TensorFlow 1 is also crucial.  Understanding the underlying mathematical operations and carefully reviewing the differences between TensorFlow versions would be vital in undertaking this conversion task.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of Keras's functionality within TensorFlow 1 (as opposed to TF 2's `tf.keras`) is required for successful migration.
