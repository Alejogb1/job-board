The discrepancy between high training accuracy and low evaluation accuracy in Keras models is almost invariably attributable to overfitting.  In my experience working on large-scale image classification projects, I've observed this phenomenon countless times.  It's a fundamental issue stemming from the model learning the training data too well, including its noise and idiosyncrasies, at the expense of generalizing to unseen data.  This leads to a model that performs exceptionally well on the data it has seen but poorly on new, independent data.

The core issue lies in the model's capacity to memorize the training set rather than learn its underlying patterns.  High model complexity, insufficient regularization, and a limited training dataset all contribute to this problem. Let's explore these contributing factors and address them through code examples and strategic adjustments.

**1. High Model Complexity:** A model with too many parameters, like a deep neural network with many layers and neurons, has the capacity to learn extremely complex relationships, including spurious correlations within the training data.  This leads to high training accuracy because the model can perfectly (or almost perfectly) fit the training data. However, this complex model is likely to overfit, failing to generalize to new, unseen data.

**2. Insufficient Regularization:**  Regularization techniques constrain the model's complexity, preventing it from learning overly specific features from the training data.  Common regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization (weight decay), dropout, and early stopping.  Without sufficient regularization, the model is free to memorize the training data, leading to the observed discrepancy.

**3. Limited Training Dataset:** A small training dataset provides the model with limited exposure to the variability and patterns present in the true data distribution.  If the training data is not sufficiently representative of the entire data population, the model may learn features specific to the limited sample, again resulting in overfitting and poor generalization.

Let's examine these issues through concrete code examples using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend.  I'll assume familiarity with basic Keras concepts.

**Code Example 1: Demonstrating Overfitting and the Impact of L2 Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2

# Define a simple model with and without L2 regularization
model_no_reg = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_with_reg = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01), input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01))
])


# Compile and train both models (using a placeholder dataset for brevity)
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)


model_no_reg.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_with_reg.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_no_reg.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
model_with_reg.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Evaluate both models â€“ Observe the difference in validation accuracy.
loss, accuracy = model_no_reg.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Model without regularization: Test Accuracy = {accuracy}")

loss, accuracy = model_with_reg.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Model with regularization: Test Accuracy = {accuracy}")
```

This code demonstrates a simple model trained on the MNIST dataset.  The key difference is the inclusion of L2 regularization (`kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)`) in `model_with_reg`.  Running this code will typically reveal a higher validation accuracy (generalization) for the model with regularization.  The `l2(0.01)` parameter controls the strength of the regularization.

**Code Example 2:  Utilizing Dropout for Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

model_dropout = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dropout(0.5), #Adding dropout layer
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_dropout.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_dropout.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

loss, accuracy = model_dropout.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Model with dropout: Test Accuracy = {accuracy}")
```

This example incorporates a dropout layer with a rate of 0.5.  Dropout randomly ignores half of the neurons during each training iteration, preventing the model from over-relying on any single neuron or set of neurons and thereby improving generalization.

**Code Example 3: Early Stopping to Prevent Overtraining**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

model_early_stopping = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)

model_early_stopping.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_early_stopping.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), callbacks=[early_stopping])

loss, accuracy = model_early_stopping.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Model with early stopping: Test Accuracy = {accuracy}")
```

This demonstrates the use of `EarlyStopping`.  The `patience=3` parameter means training stops if the validation loss doesn't improve for 3 epochs.  `restore_best_weights=True` ensures that the weights from the epoch with the lowest validation loss are restored, preventing further overfitting.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of these concepts, I would recommend exploring texts on machine learning and deep learning, specifically those focusing on model regularization and overfitting.  Look for sections covering L1 and L2 regularization, dropout techniques, and various methods for early stopping.  Furthermore, studying the Keras documentation thoroughly is essential for practical application.  Finally, exploring research papers on deep learning architectures and regularization strategies can provide invaluable insight.  By carefully considering model complexity, employing suitable regularization strategies, and using techniques like early stopping, one can effectively address the problem of overfitting and bridge the gap between training and evaluation accuracy.
