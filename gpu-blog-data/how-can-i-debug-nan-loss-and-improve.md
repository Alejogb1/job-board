NaN loss during neural network training, particularly with custom loss functions, often signals an issue of numerical instability arising from operations within the loss calculation. This instability can lead to extremely large, or infinitesimally small, numbers that then propagate through subsequent computations, resulting in NaN (Not a Number) outputs. Careful analysis of the custom loss function's implementation and gradient calculation is essential to identify and resolve the issue.

One primary culprit for NaN values is division by zero or near-zero numbers, especially within the logarithm or square root functions. When the model’s output or target values are exceptionally small, or even zero, they can result in undefined results during gradient calculations. This problem intensifies as training progresses and weights are updated to further push values towards or away from unstable zones. Another potential source of NaN is the use of exponential functions without proper handling of large input values. Very large exponent inputs can saturate float types, causing them to become infinite and eventually lead to NaN if used in subsequent calculations. These can be avoided with techniques like log-sum-exp or numerically stable versions of activation functions.

Debugging this issue requires a systematic approach. I've found these steps to be effective based on my experience developing various custom loss functions for research. First, I verify that all operations within the loss are mathematically sound, particularly identifying potential divisions by zero, logarithms of non-positive numbers, and square roots of negative numbers. Second, I use PyTorch’s debugging tools to monitor the values of intermediate tensors within the loss calculation. This enables pinpointing where NaN values first appear. This often requires running the model with a smaller batch size or specific data input to isolate the problematic calculation. Third, I check the range of values involved in the loss calculation and adjust them by scaling factors or using clipping operations to prevent values from becoming too large or small. Finally, I thoroughly examine the backpropagation (gradient calculation) to ensure all derivatives are calculated correctly, especially when defining custom gradient operations using the `torch.autograd.Function` API.

Let's consider a few concrete examples of how this debugging process is employed. The first code block illustrates a naïve implementation of a loss that involves taking the logarithm of predicted probabilities. Here, the unclipped predicted probabilities could be zero.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class NaiveLogProbLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NaiveLogProbLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, predicted_probs, target_labels):
        # Naive implementation: potential for log(0) leading to NaN
        loss = -torch.mean(target_labels * torch.log(predicted_probs) +
                            (1-target_labels) * torch.log(1 - predicted_probs))
        return loss

# Example Usage (unstable)
predicted_probs = torch.tensor([[0.0, 1.0], [0.0001, 0.9999]], requires_grad=True)
target_labels = torch.tensor([[0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0]])
loss_fn = NaiveLogProbLoss()
loss = loss_fn(predicted_probs, target_labels) # Likely to result in NaN or very large loss value.
print(loss)
```

In the provided `NaiveLogProbLoss`, applying the logarithm directly to predicted probabilities without constraints could lead to NaN values when `predicted_probs` contains values equal to or close to zero. This directly violates the mathematical assumptions for logarithms. To address this, one can employ an epsilon value to avoid evaluating the log at zero or near zero, or utilize PyTorch's built in binary cross entropy with logits function.

The following revised code example demonstrates incorporating a small constant (epsilon) to ensure the argument of the logarithm function is never zero. We also use `clamp` which is a better alternative for preventing extreme values from propagating within the calculation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ImprovedLogProbLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, epsilon=1e-8):
        super(ImprovedLogProbLoss, self).__init__()
        self.epsilon = epsilon

    def forward(self, predicted_probs, target_labels):
        # Clamp to avoid log(0) and log(1) issues, ensuring numerical stability
        predicted_probs = torch.clamp(predicted_probs, self.epsilon, 1 - self.epsilon)
        loss = -torch.mean(target_labels * torch.log(predicted_probs) +
                             (1-target_labels) * torch.log(1 - predicted_probs))
        return loss
    
# Example Usage (stable)
predicted_probs = torch.tensor([[0.0, 1.0], [0.0001, 0.9999]], requires_grad=True)
target_labels = torch.tensor([[0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0]])
loss_fn = ImprovedLogProbLoss()
loss = loss_fn(predicted_probs, target_labels)
print(loss)

```

By clamping the predicted probabilities, we ensure that the input to the logarithm function is always within the range of (epsilon, 1-epsilon). This prevents undefined results, leading to a much more stable loss function. Furthermore, using `torch.clamp` is more computationally efficient in backpropagation compared to using an if-else statement to handle these extreme cases.

A further example arises when implementing a hinge loss where the gradient involves the sign function. Consider the following initial implementation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class NaiveHingeLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NaiveHingeLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, predicted, target):
        loss = torch.mean(torch.max(torch.zeros_like(target), 1 - target * predicted))
        return loss
    
# Example Usage (potential for instability with large values)
predicted = torch.tensor([10.0, -20.0], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([1.0, -1.0])
loss_fn = NaiveHingeLoss()
loss = loss_fn(predicted, target)
print(loss)
loss.backward()

```

The `NaiveHingeLoss` works well when `target * predicted` is close to 1. However, if `target * predicted` becomes very large, the gradient becomes either zero or explodes, creating numerical instabilities. While the initial loss value might not be NaN, the gradients could be problematic. A more robust implementation would consider a modified hinge that bounds or smoothly decreases the influence of extremely large values of (1 - target * predicted).

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ImprovedHingeLoss(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
    super(ImprovedHingeLoss, self).__init__()
    self.margin = margin

  def forward(self, predicted, target):
        loss = torch.mean(torch.relu(self.margin - target * predicted))
        return loss

# Example Usage (more stable)
predicted = torch.tensor([10.0, -20.0], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([1.0, -1.0])
loss_fn = ImprovedHingeLoss(margin=1.0)
loss = loss_fn(predicted, target)
print(loss)
loss.backward()
```
In this enhanced implementation, we use `torch.relu`, which acts similar to `torch.max(torch.zeros_like(target), ...)` but provides a smoother gradient. This helps mitigate the gradient issues at extremely large values of the prediction. `torch.relu` handles the zero case, where if the `target * predicted` is large, `relu` will saturate the gradient to zero and prevents large gradients.

These examples demonstrate the type of checks that one needs to perform during the debug of NaNs in a custom loss function. The important idea is that careful analysis of mathematical operations, together with numerical stability techniques will help you identify the location of NaN and develop a better solution.

For additional learning, I would recommend studying the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the pages on `torch.autograd` and the various loss functions, which often provide insights on numerically stable implementations. Textbooks on numerical methods, such as "Numerical Recipes," offer a deeper theoretical understanding of floating point arithmetic and sources of numerical instability. Finally, exploring open source implementations of custom loss functions, such as those in the segmentation models pytorch library, can reveal practical approaches to avoid NaN issues.
