The correct choice between `tensorflow_examples.tutorials.mnist` and `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist` for accessing the MNIST dataset in TensorFlow hinges on your specific project goals and familiarity with TensorFlow's evolution. I've encountered both in numerous projects, and while both technically provide MNIST digits, they differ significantly in their intended purpose and, consequently, how data is accessed and structured.

The primary distinction lies in the intended use case. `tensorflow_examples.tutorials.mnist` was designed as a pedagogical tool, bundled within the TensorFlow examples repository. It’s structured to accompany the initial TensorFlow tutorials and often emphasizes simplicity and immediate usability. In practice, this means a relatively straightforward download process that directly gives you NumPy arrays. This direct availability of pre-processed arrays can be appealing for quick experimentation and understanding core TensorFlow operations.

On the other hand, `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist` is integrated within Keras, a high-level API for building and training neural networks, which is now fully integrated into TensorFlow. It is the preferred method for dataset loading within modern TensorFlow workflows and is aligned with Keras' philosophy of streamlined, user-friendly deep learning practices. Data obtained here is often already configured for feeding directly into Keras model training pipelines, using objects like iterators, not just raw NumPy arrays. This aligns more seamlessly with standard deep learning model construction and can save significant data preprocessing overhead in many instances.

My own project history has reinforced this. Initially, when the TensorFlow API was more fragmented, I heavily relied on the tutorial-based `tensorflow_examples.tutorials.mnist`. I remember working on a quick proof of concept for digit recognition using simple dense networks. The direct availability of pre-processed data meant I could focus immediately on defining the network architecture and experimenting with loss functions and optimizers. However, as my projects grew in scale and complexity, I transitioned toward the Keras API and naturally began utilizing `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist`, streamlining my data intake pipelines. This shift is not about one method being “better” but rather about selecting the appropriate tool for the specific context and the developer’s comfort level with a particular API style.

The difference manifests further in data loading behavior. `tensorflow_examples.tutorials.mnist` typically uses a `tf.Session` to download the data and returns the training and test data as distinct NumPy arrays. It's imperative to remember that TensorFlow sessions are deprecated for most modern TensorFlow implementations, making it an unsuitable approach for production-grade models. While `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist` also downloads the same dataset, it returns it as a tuple of NumPy arrays, but the emphasis is on usability with Keras' built-in training mechanisms.

Here are three code examples that demonstrate these differences:

**Example 1: Using `tensorflow_examples.tutorials.mnist` (with modification for modern TensorFlow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow_examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data

# Download and prepare MNIST data from tensorflow examples
mnist_data = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data", one_hot=True)

# Access data as NumPy arrays
X_train = mnist_data.train.images
Y_train = mnist_data.train.labels
X_test = mnist_data.test.images
Y_test = mnist_data.test.labels

print(f"Train Images Shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Train Labels Shape: {Y_train.shape}")

# Example usage: creating a tf.data.Dataset, which would be
# necessary to feed this data into a modern TF model.

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_train, Y_train)).batch(32)

# Demonstrating accessing single batches to verify content
for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset.take(1):
    print(f"Batch of Images Shape:{x_batch.shape}")
    print(f"Batch of Labels Shape:{y_batch.shape}")

# This dataset is ready for model consumption
```

In this example, the `read_data_sets` function from the tutorial package provides the MNIST data. Note that, while originally intended to be used within a `tf.Session`, modern TensorFlow forces the manual construction of a `tf.data.Dataset` object for actual use in training procedures. You obtain NumPy arrays directly, which is useful for quick checks, but these are not readily usable for a high-performance, modern workflow.

**Example 2: Using `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load MNIST data using keras datasets
(X_train, Y_train), (X_test, Y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

print(f"Train Images Shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Train Labels Shape: {Y_train.shape}")

# Example usage with Keras and Dataset API

X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_train, Y_train)).batch(32)
test_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_test, Y_test)).batch(32)

# Demonstrating accessing single batches to verify content
for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset.take(1):
  print(f"Batch of Images Shape:{x_batch.shape}")
  print(f"Batch of Labels Shape:{y_batch.shape}")

# This dataset is ready for Keras model consumption
```
The significant distinction here is the `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()` function call, which returns the data, also as NumPy arrays, but pre-processed for ease of use with a standard `tf.data.Dataset`. The crucial thing to note is that scaling is performed, a critical step for neural network training not provided by default in the tutorial version.

**Example 3: Illustrating data format difference for image display**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load MNIST data using keras datasets
(X_train_keras, Y_train_keras), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Load MNIST data from tensorflow examples
mnist_data = tf.keras.utils.get_file("mnist.npz",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz")
with np.load(mnist_data, allow_pickle=True) as f:
    X_train_examples, Y_train_examples = f['x_train'], f['y_train']

# Display a digit from keras data
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(X_train_keras[0], cmap='gray')
plt.title('Keras Dataset')
plt.axis('off')

# Reshape mnist examples data for display
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(X_train_examples[0].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
plt.title('Examples Dataset')
plt.axis('off')

plt.show()
```
This example clarifies the structure difference between the two data formats for image visualization. The Keras dataset's images are already in a 28x28 pixel format, whereas the tutorial dataset is provided as a flat 784 vector. Note that, for display purposes, the tutorial dataset needs to be reshaped to match the structure of the Keras dataset.

To summarize, for practical applications, particularly when building neural networks, I always advocate for `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist`. Its integration with Keras simplifies data handling and aligns with best practices in the modern TensorFlow ecosystem. For further learning, I would suggest referring to the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the Keras API sections, as well as tutorials and guides on effective data pipeline management within TensorFlow, often focusing on the `tf.data` module. Additionally, explore examples within the TensorFlow official GitHub repository, and study comprehensive deep learning books, paying attention to recommended data loading strategies. These resources will provide further context and practical guidance on effective data handling practices within TensorFlow projects.
