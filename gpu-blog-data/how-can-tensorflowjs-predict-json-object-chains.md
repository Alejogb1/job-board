TensorFlow.js, operating within the JavaScript environment, presents a unique challenge when it comes to handling sequential data represented as JSON object chains. Unlike NumPy arrays or tensors natively understood by deep learning models, these chains require specific pre-processing to be ingested effectively for predictive purposes. My experience deploying machine learning models to web applications has highlighted the need for careful data transformation, often involving encoding these complex structures into a more computationally palatable form before they can be used to predict subsequent JSON objects within a chain.

The core issue is that TensorFlow models fundamentally operate on numerical data. A JSON object, even if structured sequentially, is inherently symbolic. It's a collection of key-value pairs; the values may be primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans) or other JSON objects, but they are not directly usable as input features to a neural network.  Therefore, the process of predicting JSON object chains in TensorFlow.js involves two primary stages: data preparation and model building/training.

The data preparation phase is the most critical. First, we must decide how to represent the JSON object's attributes numerically. If our JSON objects have a fixed structure and consistent types, we can perform a flat encoding, where each key becomes a numerical feature. This means creating a mapping from key names to integer indices, and then for each object, constructing a numerical vector based on the present keys and their values converted to numbers. For text attributes, we might use techniques like one-hot encoding or embedding layers within the model. The key is to convert each JSON object in the sequence into a standardized, numerical vector.  If the JSON object structure varies, preprocessing becomes more involved requiring consideration of graph-based approaches or a standardized schema.

Second, after the transformation of each object, we transform the sequence of encoded JSON objects. Each individual object has become a vector. Our goal now is to provide the network with a sequence of such vectors that it can process to predict the next object's representation within the chain. This is often achieved using a sliding window approach; we construct sequences of fixed length (n) from our data and then attempt to predict the encoded numerical representation of the (n+1)th object. The model can then be trained to perform time series or sequence prediction.  The approach of using sliding windows is applicable to both variable and fixed-length JSON chains. If dealing with chains of significantly variable length, padding to a standard size will be necessary.

Finally, the time dimension of these sequences can be handled by the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs.  These models are designed to process sequential data and capture dependencies across time steps. Alternatively, transformer architectures are becoming more common for sequence prediction and are capable of capturing long-range dependencies within longer chains. The selection will depend on the trade-off between complexity, training time, and the desired prediction accuracy.

Here are three code examples to illustrate these concepts using TensorFlow.js.

**Example 1: Flat Encoding with Fixed Structure**

Suppose each JSON object has the same structure: `{ x: number, y: number, category: string }`. The goal here is to convert each JSON object into a fixed-length numerical vector. We will also one-hot encode category.

```javascript
function encodeObject(obj, categoryMap) {
  const encoded = [];
  encoded.push(obj.x);
  encoded.push(obj.y);
  const catIndex = categoryMap[obj.category] || -1; // Assign -1 if category unknown
  if(catIndex >= 0) {
      encoded[2] = 0; // Initialize to zeros
      encoded[2 + catIndex] = 1; // One-hot encode the category
      return encoded;
  } else {
      console.warn("Unknown category found: " + obj.category)
      return encoded;
  }

}


function prepareData(jsonChain, categoryMap) {
    const encodedData = jsonChain.map(obj => encodeObject(obj, categoryMap));
    const X = [];
    const Y = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < encodedData.length-1; i++){
        X.push(encodedData[i]);
        Y.push(encodedData[i+1]);
    }
    return {
        X : tf.tensor2d(X),
        Y : tf.tensor2d(Y)
    }

}

const categoryMap = { 'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2 };

const jsonChain = [
  { x: 1, y: 2, category: 'A' },
  { x: 3, y: 4, category: 'B' },
  { x: 5, y: 6, category: 'C' },
  { x: 7, y: 8, category: 'A' }
];

const {X,Y} = prepareData(jsonChain, categoryMap)

X.print();
Y.print();
```
This code snippet shows the flat encoding approach. `encodeObject` maps the object values to a numerical array. `prepareData` constructs our input (X) and target (Y) from a JSON object chain. The data is ready for input into a model that learns to predict the next encoded JSON object.  It should be noted that category is one-hot encoded. In practice, we would scale the numeric features. Also, in practice, we would also split the data into train/test sets. Also, the code does not handle a previously unseen category which will cause indexing problems.

**Example 2: Sequence Data Preparation with Sliding Window**

Here, we use a fixed window to create sequences.  We assume that our input JSON objects are already encoded as numerical vectors.

```javascript
function createSlidingWindow(encodedData, seqLength) {
  const X = [];
  const Y = [];

  for (let i = 0; i <= encodedData.length - seqLength - 1; i++) {
    const seq = encodedData.slice(i, i + seqLength);
    const label = encodedData[i + seqLength];
    X.push(seq);
    Y.push(label);
  }

  return {
    X : tf.tensor3d(X),
    Y : tf.tensor2d(Y)
  }
}


const encodedData = [
  [1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [3, 4, 0, 1, 0],
  [5, 6, 0, 0, 1],
  [7, 8, 1, 0, 0],
  [9, 10, 0, 1, 0],
  [11, 12, 0, 0, 1]

];
const seqLength = 2;

const {X,Y} = createSlidingWindow(encodedData, seqLength);

X.print()
Y.print()
```

This example illustrates a sliding window approach. Given encoded numerical data, it creates sequential inputs (X) of length 'seqLength'. It prepares data for a recurrent model, with `X` having the shape `[num_sequences, seq_length, feature_size]` and `Y` having `[num_sequences, feature_size]`.  The sequence length is a hyper-parameter that should be tuned for performance.

**Example 3: Simple LSTM Model**

This code demonstrates the usage of an LSTM layer to predict a single next encoded JSON object in a sequence.  We build upon the output of the previous example.

```javascript
async function trainModel(X, Y, featureSize) {
  const model = tf.sequential();
  model.add(tf.layers.lstm({ units: 64, inputShape: [null, featureSize] }));
  model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: featureSize }));

  model.compile({ optimizer: 'adam', loss: 'meanSquaredError' });

    await model.fit(X, Y, {epochs: 100});

    return model
}


async function predictNext(model, lastSequence) {
    const inputTensor = tf.tensor3d([lastSequence]);
    const prediction = model.predict(inputTensor).arraySync()[0];
    return prediction;
}

const encodedData = [
  [1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [3, 4, 0, 1, 0],
  [5, 6, 0, 0, 1],
  [7, 8, 1, 0, 0],
  [9, 10, 0, 1, 0],
  [11, 12, 0, 0, 1]
];

const seqLength = 2;
const {X,Y} = createSlidingWindow(encodedData, seqLength);
const featureSize = 5;

async function main(){
    const model = await trainModel(X, Y, featureSize);

    const lastSequence = encodedData.slice(encodedData.length- seqLength, encodedData.length);
    const next = await predictNext(model, lastSequence)
    console.log("Predicted Next:", next)
}

main()


```

This example showcases a simple LSTM model for time series prediction. The model is trained using the data generated in Example 2, predicting the next encoded JSON object in a sequence. After the model is trained, we demonstrate prediction using the last sequence of encoded JSON objects in our data as input. In practical scenarios, you would not train and predict on the same data; split the data into train/test sets. Moreover, model architecture, hyperparameters, and training epochs would need to be tuned. A better loss function may also be appropriate depending on the problem.

In addition to the previously demonstrated methods, several resources and advanced techniques can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of JSON object chain prediction. For instance, the book "Deep Learning with JavaScript" provides extensive practical guidance on using TensorFlow.js for a variety of tasks including time series. Furthermore, many online tutorials demonstrate working with LSTMs for sequence prediction in TensorFlow.js using different types of data than JSON chains, however the principles are extensible. More advanced approaches using transformer architectures should be explored if the data exhibits long range dependencies. For more complex JSON schema, consider methods of treating the data as graphs rather than simple numeric vectors.

Finally, while the presented code segments offer clear illustrations of the data preprocessing and modelling process, they are simplified for clarity. Real-world scenarios involve significant data cleansing, feature scaling, careful hyperparameter tuning, thorough evaluation, and consideration of the specific characteristics of the JSON chain data. I have found this iterative process is necessary to build robust machine learning models using this technology.
