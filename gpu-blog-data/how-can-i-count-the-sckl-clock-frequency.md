In SPI communication, directly measuring the SCK clock frequency at the slave end, without relying on external test equipment, presents a challenge. The SPI protocol itself does not inherently transmit or embed clock frequency information. My experience designing custom SPI peripherals has shown that a workaround involves utilizing a timer/counter mechanism embedded within the slave device’s logic to derive the frequency. This method relies on counting the number of SCK rising (or falling) edges within a defined time interval.

Fundamentally, the slave must contain a counter that increments on every active edge of the SCK signal. Concurrently, a separate timer or counter must generate a precisely timed gate signal. The value accumulated in the SCK edge counter during the gate signal's active period represents the number of clock cycles, which can then be used to determine the frequency. This measurement is not instantaneous; it's a calculation based on a sampling window. The accuracy of this frequency determination is directly correlated with the precision of the gating timer and the duration of the gate.

Here's how this can be implemented using VHDL:

**Code Example 1: SCK Edge Counter**

This module counts the rising edges of the SCK signal.

```vhdl
entity sck_edge_counter is
  Port (
    clk       : in  std_logic;  -- System clock for synchronous operation
    sck       : in  std_logic;  -- SPI Clock signal
    reset_n   : in  std_logic;  -- Asynchronous reset, active low
    count_out : out unsigned(31 downto 0) -- 32-bit counter output
    );
end entity sck_edge_counter;

architecture behavioral of sck_edge_counter is
  signal sck_prev : std_logic := '0';
  signal count : unsigned(31 downto 0) := (others => '0');
begin
  process (clk, reset_n)
    begin
      if (reset_n = '0') then
        count <= (others => '0');
        sck_prev <= '0';
      elsif rising_edge(clk) then
        if (sck = '1' and sck_prev = '0') then -- Detect rising edge
          count <= count + 1;
        end if;
        sck_prev <= sck; -- Store current value for next edge detection
      end if;
    end process;
  count_out <= count;
end architecture behavioral;
```

**Commentary:**

The `sck_edge_counter` module is a synchronous counter, meaning it operates on the rising edge of the system clock (`clk`).  It utilizes a register (`sck_prev`) to store the previous state of the SCK signal.  By comparing the current and previous states of SCK, it can reliably detect rising edges. The counter (`count`) is a 32-bit unsigned integer, allowing for a large count range.  The asynchronous reset (`reset_n`) ensures the counter is cleared on a low pulse. The core logic resides in the `if (sck = '1' and sck_prev = '0')` condition, which increments the counter only on a rising edge of SCK. This prevents multiple counting during transitions or on a constant high signal.

**Code Example 2: Gate Timer**

This module generates a precisely timed gate signal.

```vhdl
entity gate_timer is
  Generic (
    gate_time_cycles : natural := 50000  -- Duration of the gate signal in system clock cycles
    );
  Port (
    clk     : in  std_logic;  -- System clock
    reset_n : in  std_logic;  -- Asynchronous reset, active low
    gate    : out std_logic  -- Gate signal output
    );
end entity gate_timer;

architecture behavioral of gate_timer is
  signal counter : natural := 0;
  signal gate_internal : std_logic := '0';
begin
  process (clk, reset_n)
    begin
      if (reset_n = '0') then
        counter <= 0;
        gate_internal <= '0';
      elsif rising_edge(clk) then
        if (counter < gate_time_cycles) then
          counter <= counter + 1;
          gate_internal <= '1';
        else
          counter <= 0;
          gate_internal <= '0';
        end if;
      end if;
    end process;
  gate <= gate_internal;
end architecture behavioral;
```

**Commentary:**

The `gate_timer` module utilizes a generic parameter, `gate_time_cycles`, which defines the duration of the gate signal in system clock cycles. When instantiated, this parameter allows the user to specify different measurement timeframes. This design provides the flexibility for various frequency detection resolutions. The timer increments a counter on each rising edge of the system clock. When the `counter` reaches `gate_time_cycles`, the counter resets, and the gate signal returns to ‘0’.  The `gate_internal` signal is set to ‘1’ while the counter is below the specified limit and goes low once the counter has reached the limit. The asynchronous reset clears the counter and gate signal. In essence, this generates a pulsed signal for a specific number of clock cycles, essential for the time window.

**Code Example 3: Top-Level Frequency Calculation Module**

This module integrates the counter and timer to calculate the SCK frequency.

```vhdl
entity spi_sck_freq_calc is
  Port (
    clk        : in  std_logic;     -- System clock
    reset_n    : in  std_logic;     -- Asynchronous Reset
    sck        : in  std_logic;     -- SPI Clock input
    freq_out   : out unsigned(31 downto 0)  -- Calculated Frequency
    );
end entity spi_sck_freq_calc;

architecture behavioral of spi_sck_freq_calc is
  component sck_edge_counter is
    Port (
      clk       : in  std_logic;
      sck       : in  std_logic;
      reset_n   : in  std_logic;
      count_out : out unsigned(31 downto 0)
      );
  end component;
  component gate_timer is
   Generic (
      gate_time_cycles : natural
    );
    Port (
      clk     : in  std_logic;
      reset_n : in  std_logic;
      gate    : out std_logic
      );
  end component;
  signal sck_count     : unsigned(31 downto 0) := (others => '0');
  signal gate_signal   : std_logic := '0';
  constant gate_cycles : natural := 50000; -- Example value; adjust for desired sample rate.
  signal calculated_freq : unsigned(31 downto 0) := (others => '0');
begin
  sck_counter_inst : sck_edge_counter
  port map (
    clk       => clk,
    sck       => sck,
    reset_n   => reset_n,
    count_out => sck_count
    );

  gate_timer_inst : gate_timer
  Generic map (
    gate_time_cycles => gate_cycles
  )
  port map (
    clk     => clk,
    reset_n => reset_n,
    gate    => gate_signal
    );

  process (clk, reset_n)
    begin
      if (reset_n = '0') then
         calculated_freq <= (others => '0');
      elsif rising_edge(clk) then
         if(gate_signal = '0') then
           calculated_freq <= sck_count; -- Capture the final counter value at the end of the gate.
           sck_count <= (others => '0'); -- reset sck counter after frequency capture
         end if;
       end if;
    end process;
    freq_out <= calculated_freq; -- Output the captured frequency
end architecture behavioral;
```

**Commentary:**

This `spi_sck_freq_calc` module instantiates both `sck_edge_counter` and `gate_timer`.  It reads the `count_out` from the counter and captures this value when the `gate_signal` transitions to low (indicating the end of a timing period).  The captured value represents the number of SCK clock cycles that occurred during `gate_cycles`. This value is then output to `freq_out`.  Crucially, the SCK counter is reset after each frequency capture, preparing it for the next measurement.  The `calculated_freq` is derived simply by counting the number of edges within the gated timeframe, hence directly giving the equivalent frequency with the appropriate gate time. Note that the actual frequency is calculated by dividing the number of counted SCK edges by the gate timer's duration, this implementation avoids dividing by using a gate signal to time the duration based on the same clock as the counter.

**Important Considerations:**

The accuracy of this frequency measurement is heavily dependent on the stability of the system clock and the gate timer's accuracy. The gate time needs to be sufficiently long to obtain a meaningful count and short enough to track frequency changes. Furthermore, since we are utilizing a sample window, this method will produce a discrete approximation of the clock frequency, not a continuous real-time measurement. This approach also assumes the clock signal is relatively stable and consistent within the gate period.  Variations during the capture gate window, such as bursts of frequency changes, will average out, meaning the measured frequency will represent the average clock during the gate period. You will also need to ensure that the `gate_time_cycles` parameter is adjusted appropriately for the expected range of SCK frequencies. Finally, this setup can be modified to accumulate a rolling average of the frequency for further stability.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To further investigate this topic, consider consulting standard digital design textbooks that focus on hardware description languages. Look for chapters detailing counter and timer implementations using VHDL, specifically examining synchronous designs and clock domain crossing considerations. Additionally, studying application notes relating to FPGA-based SPI controllers and peripherals can provide deeper insights into real-world design trade-offs and challenges. Finally, examination of open-source VHDL projects dealing with digital signal processing techniques can give you alternative design patterns and measurement approaches.
