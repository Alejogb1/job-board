Specifically, I'm finding the annotation font to default to something different from my axis labels.

The consistent alignment of stylistic elements, particularly fonts, across diverse components within a visualization is crucial for effective communication.  In ggplot2, text labels (like axis labels) and correlation annotations often exhibit differing default font properties, leading to an aesthetically inconsistent figure. This discrepancy arises from how ggplot2 handles text aesthetics within different geoms, primarily `geom_text` (often used for annotations) and the underlying text rendering of axis labels.

The primary distinction lies in the inheritance and application of theme elements.  Axis labels, for example, are defined and modified through theme elements such as `axis.title.x`, `axis.title.y`, and `axis.text`. Conversely, `geom_text` relies on aesthetic mappings provided within the geom itself, or inherited from layer defaults.  The default theme often sets different starting font properties for these components, and unless manually modified, these differences will persist, resulting in the visual inconsistency you observe. Simply attempting to change one aspect (say, the `axis.title`) will not impact text added by `geom_text`.

My typical approach involves systematically setting the `family`, `size`, `face`, and `color` font properties within the theme and `geom_text` specification to ensure complete alignment. I have found it beneficial to establish a base theme setting for consistent application across all plots generated within a project or analysis.

Let's explore this with a couple of practical examples.

**Example 1: Basic Misalignment**

Initially, consider a standard correlation plot without any specific font modification:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(42) # for reproducibility
data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100) + 0.5*rnorm(100))
correlation <- cor(data$x, data$y)
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Variable X", y = "Variable Y") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 1, label = paste("Correlation:", round(correlation, 2))),
            hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 4)
```

Here, the x and y axis labels utilize the default theme font. In contrast, the correlation annotation added via `geom_text` employs the default text font, resulting in a different appearance.  This highlights the default difference and the need for explicit styling to achieve consistency.  Note the manual `hjust` and `vjust` adjustments as well to position the text appropriately. These are not strictly related to font alignment but form an integral part of proper annotation.

**Example 2: Theme-Based Font Consistency**

To address the difference, we explicitly define a base theme containing common font settings and apply it to all elements:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(42) # for reproducibility
data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100) + 0.5*rnorm(100))
correlation <- cor(data$x, data$y)

base_theme <- theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 10, color = "gray30"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "gray50"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "gray50"))


ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Variable X", y = "Variable Y") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 1, label = paste("Correlation:", round(correlation, 2))),
            hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 4,
            family = "Helvetica", color="gray30") +
    base_theme
```

In this example, the `base_theme` variable defines a `theme_minimal` base and then explicitly modifies the `text` element, `axis.title`, and `axis.text` elements to a specific `family`, `size`, `color` and `face`.  Crucially, we also explicitly define the `family` and `color` within the `geom_text` specification to match the theme settings. The annotation now uses the same "Helvetica" font family and grey color as the axis text, contributing to improved visual coherence. The sizes are set to be consistent after the theme size changes are applied.  My common practice is to define one theme like `base_theme` for the whole project, modifying the `text` and `axis.*` elements as needed.

**Example 3: Utilizing `theme()` Directly within the Plot**

It is also possible to apply theme changes directly within the `ggplot()` call, this can be useful for situations where only that plot should receive the modification:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(42) # for reproducibility
data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100) + 0.5*rnorm(100))
correlation <- cor(data$x, data$y)

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Variable X", y = "Variable Y") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 1, label = paste("Correlation:", round(correlation, 2))),
            hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 4,
            family = "Times New Roman", color="darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", size = 10, color = "darkgreen"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "darkgreen"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen"))
```

This example mirrors example 2, except that we apply a specific theme using `theme()` rather than a pre-defined base theme object.  The same result is achieved where the annotation, axis title, and axis text are all aligned. Note that the specification of `family`, `size`, and `color` in `geom_text` is still essential. Using this method, theme changes can be targeted on a plot-by-plot basis.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen your understanding of these concepts, I recommend exploring the documentation for the `ggplot2` package itself. The sections detailing the `theme()` function, `element_text()` function, and `geom_text()` function are particularly valuable.  Specific resources within this documentation that I frequently consult include the discussion of theme components, and the aesthetic properties that can be modified within geoms.  Additionally, exploring examples of theme customizations provided within various online tutorials and books that focus on data visualization with ggplot2 has proven incredibly helpful. Consider examining any publication that uses ggplot2 that highlights complex plot customization; paying attention to the `theme` object modification will help solidify the techniques I have mentioned.

My experience indicates that while the default font settings may differ across plot elements, explicitly specifying the desired font properties within your theme and `geom_text` calls consistently provides the most reliable solution for achieving font alignment in ggplot2.  Adopting a project-wide, consistent theme ensures that all visualizations share a unified visual aesthetic, contributing to overall data clarity and presentation.
