The `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)` error encountered during `tfds.load` typically stems from an incorrect assumption about the structure of the dataset's output.  My experience debugging this, particularly during a project involving multi-modal data fusion – specifically integrating textual descriptions with corresponding image datasets – highlighted the need for meticulous attention to the `split` argument and the return type of `tfds.load`.  The error manifests when the code attempts to unpack a tuple expecting two elements (often, a features dictionary and a dataset) but receives only one.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `tfds.load` function, from the TensorFlow Datasets library, returns a `tf.data.Dataset` object.  The structure of this object depends on several factors, most critically the dataset's configuration and the specified `split`.  Many datasets are structured to provide separate features and labels.  When loading a dataset structured this way,  `tfds.load` might return a single `tf.data.Dataset` containing both features and labels.  This structure is designed for streamlined data access. However, some users mistakenly anticipate a separate return for features and labels, attempting to unpack the result into two variables when only one is available.  This misconception leads to the "not enough values to unpack" error.

Another potential source of this error lies in misinterpreting the `split` parameter.  If the specified `split` is not correctly defined within the dataset's metadata, `tfds.load` might return a single element or an unexpected structure, resulting in the unpacking error.  For instance, attempting to access a `'test'` split when only a `'train'` split exists would lead to this problem. Finally, using an incorrect `as_supervised=True` parameter (as demonstrated in Example 3 below) can also contribute to the error by creating an unexpected return structure.

Correctly handling the return value requires understanding the specific dataset's structure.  This is readily accessible through the dataset's info object, obtained using `tfds.load(..., with_info=True)`. The `info` object provides detailed information about the dataset, including the features and their types, the available splits, and the overall structure. Analyzing this information is paramount to avoiding unpacking errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct handling of a dataset with features and labels within a single dataset:**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load the dataset.  Note that we are not expecting a separate feature and label output.
dataset, info = tfds.load('mnist', split='train', with_info=True, as_supervised=False)

# Iterate through the dataset and access features and labels.  The structure depends on the dataset.
# Check the info object to understand the exact structure.  For MNIST, we expect 'image' and 'label'.
for example in dataset:
    image = example['image']
    label = example['label']
    # Process image and label
    print(f"Image shape: {image.shape}, Label: {label}")
```

This example demonstrates correct processing of a dataset where features and labels are bundled together.  The `as_supervised=False` ensures the dataset returns a dictionary with all features, preventing unnecessary unpacking attempts. Examination of the `info` object prior to data processing is strongly encouraged to accurately understand the internal structure.

**Example 2: Handling a dataset with a single feature:**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

dataset, info = tfds.load('cifar10', split='test', with_info=True, as_supervised=False)

for example in dataset:
    image = example['image']
    # Process the image, there is no label in this case
    print(f"Image shape: {image.shape}")
```

This example highlights a scenario with a dataset containing a single feature.  Attempting to unpack this into features and labels would result in the error.  This approach directly processes the single feature returned.  Reviewing the `info` object beforehand confirms this single-feature structure, avoiding incorrect unpacking attempts.

**Example 3:  Incorrect use of `as_supervised=True` and correction:**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Incorrect usage leading to the error
try:
  dataset = tfds.load('imdb_reviews', split='train', as_supervised=True)  # Incorrect!
  for example in dataset:
    text, label = example # This will fail if the dataset is not structured (features, labels)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

# Correct usage (This assumes the dataset indeed is structured as (features, labels))
dataset = tfds.load('imdb_reviews', split='train', as_supervised=True)
for example in dataset:
    text, label = example
    # Now, this should work correctly as supervised=True gives tuple structure.
    print(f"Text Length: {len(text)}, Label: {label}")

```

This example demonstrates a common pitfall where `as_supervised=True` is used incorrectly.  While `as_supervised=True` *can* return a tuple, it depends on whether the dataset provides a clear separation between features and labels. If the dataset doesn't inherently separate these two, using `as_supervised=True` will lead to the "not enough values to unpack" error.  The corrected portion shows how this can be addressed once the underlying dataset structure is confirmed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow Datasets documentation.  Pay close attention to the dataset-specific descriptions to understand the feature structure.  Thoroughly examine the output of `tfds.load(..., with_info=True)` to understand the specific structure returned before attempting any unpacking.   Consult the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset` for advanced manipulation techniques relevant to dataset processing.  Review tutorials and examples on common datasets for practical applications of `tfds.load`.  Familiarity with Python's tuple unpacking mechanics is crucial to understanding the error's root cause.  Careful error handling, including `try-except` blocks as demonstrated above, allows graceful handling of potentially unexpected dataset structures.
