The fundamental determinant of a GPU's memory capacity is the physical die size and the chosen memory technology.  My experience optimizing rendering pipelines for high-fidelity simulations across various GPU architectures has consistently highlighted this as the primary constraint.  Die size directly impacts the number of memory chips that can be integrated onto the GPU package, and the memory technology dictates the density of those chips, thus directly influencing overall capacity.

**1.  Die Size and Chip Integration:**

GPUs, unlike CPUs, are heavily reliant on parallel processing.  This necessitates a large number of processing units (cores, shaders, etc.)  The more processing units, the larger the die size required to house them.  However,  a larger die increases manufacturing complexity and cost, and inherently limits the yield (percentage of successfully manufactured chips).  This creates a trade-off between processing power and memory capacity.  A larger die might accommodate more processing units *and* more memory controllers, but at a higher production cost and risk of defects.  Conversely, a smaller die necessitates a compromise on either processing power or memory capacity, or both.  In my work on a real-time ray tracing project, we had to choose between a GPU with a larger die and higher memory bandwidth but lower CUDA core count, and a smaller die GPU with more CUDA cores but lower memory capacity.  The specific requirements of the project (balance between ray tracing and computation for physics simulation) dictated the final choice.


**2. Memory Technology:**

The memory technology itself drastically affects memory density.  GDDR6X, HBM2e, and GDDR6, for instance, offer varying bit widths, data rates, and power efficiencies.  Higher data rates, enabled by advanced memory architectures, allow for more data transfer per clock cycle, potentially reducing the need for a large capacity.  However, higher data rates often come at a cost – increased power consumption and potentially increased manufacturing complexity and cost. HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) stacks, for example, achieve high bandwidth density but are more complex to manufacture and integrate than GDDR memory.  In a project involving deep learning inference on embedded systems, I found that the power consumption of HBM2 was prohibitive, forcing us to opt for lower capacity GDDR6 memory despite the reduction in performance.  This choice significantly impacted the model size we could deploy.


**3.  Cost Optimization and Target Market:**

GPU manufacturers must balance performance, memory capacity, cost, and target market.  High-end professional GPUs (used in CAD, VFX, and scientific computing) usually prioritize both high processing power and high memory capacity.  However, this comes at a premium.  Mid-range and low-end GPUs, targeting gaming or general-purpose computing, often make compromises on either processing power or memory capacity (or both) to reduce manufacturing cost and price point for mass-market consumption.  During my time developing graphics drivers for a major vendor, I observed this principle in action consistently.  The high-end cards frequently utilized larger dies and expensive HBM stacks, while the lower-end cards utilized smaller dies and less costly GDDR memory.


**Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how memory capacity impacts GPU performance.  These are simplified examples focusing on the core concept – the direct relationship between the amount of available VRAM and the processing capacity of the GPU.  Real-world scenarios would be far more complex, involving many optimization techniques not demonstrated here.

**Example 1:  Texture Mapping with Limited Memory:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Simulate texture size (in pixels)
  int textureWidth = 4096;
  int textureHeight = 4096;
  int bytesPerPixel = 4; // RGBA

  // Simulate available VRAM (in bytes)
  long long availableVRAM = 1024LL * 1024LL * 1024LL; // 1GB

  long long requiredVRAM = (long long)textureWidth * textureHeight * bytesPerPixel;

  if (requiredVRAM <= availableVRAM) {
    std::cout << "Texture can be loaded into VRAM." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "Texture too large for available VRAM.  Paging or texture compression required." << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This simple example demonstrates how available VRAM limits texture size.  Larger textures exceeding the available VRAM necessitate paging to system RAM, which severely impacts performance.


**Example 2:  Deep Learning Inference:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate model parameters (weights and biases)
model_parameters = np.random.rand(1024, 1024, 1024)  #Large model

# Simulate available VRAM (in bytes)
availableVRAM = 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 1GB

requiredVRAM = model_parameters.nbytes

if requiredVRAM <= availableVRAM:
  print("Model can fit in VRAM.")
else:
  print("Model too large for VRAM.  Model partitioning or offloading required.")

```

This Python example simulates a deep learning scenario. Large model parameters might not fit into available GPU memory, again necessitating techniques like model partitioning, which can decrease inference speed.


**Example 3:  Geometry Processing:**

```glsl
#version 460

layout(location = 0) in vec3 inPosition;
layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;

uniform mat4 modelViewProjectionMatrix;

void main() {
  gl_Position = modelViewProjectionMatrix * vec4(inPosition, 1.0);
  outColor = vec4(1.0);
}

```

While this GLSL code snippet does not directly demonstrate VRAM limits, it illustrates that the number of vertices and associated data (normals, texture coordinates, etc.) are directly proportional to the VRAM consumption.  Processing a massive polygon count would necessitate techniques like Level of Detail (LOD) or geometry instancing to optimize VRAM usage and prevent out-of-memory errors.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU architecture and memory management, I recommend consulting relevant academic papers and textbooks on computer graphics and parallel computing.  Materials on memory hierarchies, memory bandwidth, and memory controllers will also be very beneficial.  Specific GPU architecture manuals from vendors such as NVIDIA and AMD will also provide valuable insights.  Finally, attending conferences specializing in computer graphics and high-performance computing would offer further opportunities for learning.
