PyTorch's `index_select` function offers a powerful, yet often underutilized, mechanism for indexing tensors based on another tensor's values.  Its core strength lies in efficiently selecting specific rows or columns from a source tensor using indices provided by an index tensor, crucial for tasks like data filtering, feature selection, and constructing custom loss functions. However, a nuanced understanding of its behavior, particularly regarding dimensionality and data types, is essential for successful implementation.  In my experience working on large-scale recommendation systems and natural language processing pipelines, mastering `index_select` significantly improved the efficiency and readability of my code.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`index_select` operates on a source tensor (the tensor being indexed) and an index tensor specifying which elements to select.  Crucially, the index tensor must be one-dimensional, containing integer indices referencing the dimension along which the selection is performed.  The function supports selecting along a single dimension, indicated by the `dim` argument.  If you're attempting to select based on multi-dimensional indices, `index_select` is not the appropriate function; instead, advanced indexing techniques using NumPy-style array indexing or `torch.gather` are more suitable.

The output tensor retains the dimensionality of the source tensor except for the dimension specified by `dim`, which collapses to the size of the index tensor.  This means if you select along dimension 0 (rows), the output will have a number of rows equal to the length of the index tensor, but the number of columns remains the same as in the source tensor.  The data type of the index tensor must be `torch.long`.  Failing to adhere to these requirements will lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.  In my experience debugging complex neural network architectures, misinterpreting these constraints was a frequent source of issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Selecting Rows**

```python
import torch

# Source tensor (matrix)
source_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                             [4, 5, 6],
                             [7, 8, 9],
                             [10, 11, 12]])

# Index tensor (selecting rows 0, 2, and 3)
index_tensor = torch.tensor([0, 2, 3], dtype=torch.long)

# Selecting rows using index_select
selected_rows = torch.index_select(source_tensor, dim=0, index=index_tensor)

print(selected_rows)
# Output:
# tensor([[ 1,  2,  3],
#         [ 7,  8,  9],
#         [10, 11, 12]])
```
This example demonstrates the basic functionality. We select rows 0, 2, and 3 from `source_tensor`.  Note the `dtype=torch.long` in the index tensor definition â€“ this is crucial.  Incorrect data type will result in an error.

**Example 2: Selecting Columns**

```python
import torch

# Source tensor (matrix)
source_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                             [4, 5, 6],
                             [7, 8, 9],
                             [10, 11, 12]])

# Index tensor (selecting columns 1 and 2)
index_tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2], dtype=torch.long)

# Selecting columns using index_select
selected_cols = torch.index_select(source_tensor, dim=1, index=index_tensor)

print(selected_cols)
# Output:
# tensor([[ 2,  3],
#         [ 5,  6],
#         [ 8,  9],
#         [11, 12]])
```
Here, we select columns 1 and 2.  The `dim=1` argument specifies that the selection is along the column dimension.  The resulting tensor has the same number of rows but fewer columns.

**Example 3:  Handling Higher-Dimensional Tensors**

```python
import torch

# Source tensor (3D tensor)
source_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)

# Index tensor (selecting the first and last slices along dim=0)
index_tensor = torch.tensor([0, 1], dtype=torch.long)

# Selecting slices along dimension 0
selected_slices = torch.index_select(source_tensor, dim=0, index=index_tensor)

print(selected_slices)
#Output:
# tensor([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
#          [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
#          [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],

#         [[12, 13, 14, 15],
#          [16, 17, 18, 19],
#          [20, 21, 22, 23]]])
```
This illustrates `index_select`'s application to higher-dimensional tensors.  The selection remains along a single dimension (dim=0 in this case), effectively selecting specific slices or "layers" of the 3D tensor. The output retains the dimensions beyond the selected dimension (dimensions 1 and 2).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more in-depth understanding of tensor manipulation in PyTorch, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  Explore the sections dedicated to tensor operations and indexing.  Furthermore, a good introductory text on deep learning with PyTorch would provide broader context and practical examples. Finally,  reviewing examples from well-maintained open-source projects employing PyTorch can offer valuable insights into real-world applications and best practices for using `index_select` and related functions.  These resources should be readily available through standard academic and technical channels.
