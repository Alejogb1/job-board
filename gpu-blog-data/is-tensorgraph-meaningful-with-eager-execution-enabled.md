TensorFlow's eager execution mode fundamentally alters the execution paradigm, impacting how the `tf.Graph` object behaves.  My experience optimizing large-scale graph neural networks for distributed training underscored this distinction.  While a `tf.Graph` object still exists under eager execution, its role is significantly diminished, and its meaning deviates considerably from its traditional role in graph-based execution.  Essentially, the graph isn't constructed and executed as a single, pre-compiled unit; rather, it's implicitly created and executed operation by operation.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

In graph mode, TensorFlow constructs a computational graph representing the entire computation before execution. This graph is then optimized and executed in a single batch.  The `tf.Graph` object explicitly holds this representation; operations are nodes, and tensors are edges.  Manipulating the graph directly—adding operations, controlling execution order—is central to this mode.

Eager execution, conversely, eliminates this pre-compilation step.  Operations are executed immediately upon invocation.  The `tf.Graph` object still exists, but it largely serves as a container for operations.  It doesn't represent a pre-defined execution plan; instead, it reflects the dynamically created computational flow as operations are called.  The optimization and execution happen implicitly, on a per-operation basis, rather than on the entire graph as a unit.

Therefore, the meaning of `Tensor.graph` under eager execution shifts from representing the comprehensive, pre-defined computation to reflecting the currently active default graph, which dynamically evolves as the code executes.  While you can still access the default graph using `tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()` (even under eager execution), its relevance is reduced.  You're less likely to directly manipulate it compared to graph mode.  Your interactions revolve around individual operations rather than graph structures.  Attempts to leverage graph manipulation techniques designed for graph mode will likely yield unexpected results or be altogether ineffective under eager execution.  The crucial distinction lies in the *timing* of execution: immediate versus deferred.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Graph Mode Operation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() #Crucial for Graph Mode

graph = tf.compat.v1.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(5)
    b = tf.constant(10)
    c = a + b

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    print(sess.run(c)) # Output: 15

print(a.graph is graph) #Output: True. a is part of the explicitly defined graph.
```

This example showcases the traditional graph mode.  The graph is explicitly defined, and `a.graph` correctly identifies its parent graph.  The session executes the entire graph as a unit.


**Example 2: Eager Execution with Implicit Graph**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = a + b
print(c) # Output: 15 (immediate execution)

print(a.graph is tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()) # Output: True, but the graph is implicit and dynamically generated.

```

Here, eager execution is enabled. The operations are executed immediately. `a.graph` still points to the default graph, but this graph is not pre-defined; it's constructed dynamically as operations are performed.  The crucial difference lies in the *when* the computation is executed.


**Example 3: Accessing the Default Graph (Eager)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

g = tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = a + b

print(a.graph is g) # Output: True - illustrates default graph association, but limited functionality.

#Attempting complex graph manipulation on 'g' will be largely ineffective in eager execution
#This emphasizes the passive role of the graph object
```

This demonstrates accessing the default graph in eager mode.  While `a.graph` points to this graph, directly manipulating `g`  (e.g., adding nodes, changing execution order) offers limited practical benefit due to eager execution's immediate, per-operation execution model.  My experience shows that relying on graph manipulation in this context will be far less efficient and often unnecessary.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation.  Pay close attention to sections detailing the differences between eager execution and graph mode.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on TensorFlow or similar frameworks.  Understanding the underlying computational graph concepts is vital.
*   Research papers detailing large-scale distributed training optimizations within TensorFlow.  These often explicitly address the trade-offs between graph mode and eager execution.


In summary, while the `tf.Graph` object isn't meaningless in eager execution, its role is drastically altered.  It acts primarily as a container for operations, reflecting the dynamically created computational flow rather than a pre-compiled execution plan.  The emphasis shifts from graph manipulation to direct operation invocation. Understanding this distinction is key to writing efficient and correct TensorFlow code, particularly when scaling to complex models.  My past work involved extensively comparing graph mode and eager execution for performance optimization, consistently highlighting this key operational difference.
