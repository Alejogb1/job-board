The core issue in displaying Pandas DataFrames without a vertical scrollbar in a PyCharm Jupyter Notebook lies not within Pandas itself, but in the rendering capabilities of the Jupyter Notebook environment within PyCharm and the interplay with the browser's display constraints.  Pandas provides the data structure; the Notebook's rendering engine, often interacting with a browser's CSS and HTML, determines the visual presentation.  My experience debugging similar display issues across various IDEs and Notebook environments has highlighted the critical role of configuring display options and, sometimes, resorting to alternative rendering methods.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The default behavior of Pandas' `DataFrame.to_string()` or its implicit representation within Jupyter renders the DataFrame within a fixed-width container.  If the DataFrame exceeds the width of this container, a horizontal scrollbar appears. However, exceeding the *height* triggers a vertical scrollbar. Eliminating the vertical scrollbar requires either shrinking the DataFrame's height (reducing the number of rows) or expanding the height of the rendering container.  Directly controlling the container's height through Pandas is not feasible.  Instead, we must manipulate the Jupyter Notebook's output area or employ alternative visualization techniques.  The most practical approaches involve manipulating CSS within the Notebook cell, utilizing a dedicated visualization library offering finer control over output rendering, or limiting the DataFrame's size before display.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  CSS Manipulation (Inline Styling)**

This method injects CSS directly into the Jupyter Notebook cell to style the DataFrame's output. It's a quick solution, but its effectiveness depends on the Jupyter Notebook's and browser's CSS processing. The style might be overridden by other CSS rules.


```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame (replace with your actual DataFrame)
data = {'col1': range(100), 'col2': range(100, 200), 'col3': range(200,300)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# CSS to remove vertical scrollbar, setting a fixed height and overflow: auto
style = "<style>div.output_area {height: 500px; overflow: auto;}</style>"

# Display DataFrame with inline CSS
from IPython.display import HTML
display(HTML(style + df.to_html(index=False)))
```

This code first defines the CSS style within a string, targeting the `output_area` div which encloses the DataFrame's output.  `height: 500px` sets a fixed height. `overflow: auto` ensures that content exceeding the set height will be scrollable horizontally, but not vertically (as the default scrolling behavior is now explicitly set to horizontal scrolling only).  `to_html(index=False)` removes the index column for a cleaner presentation.  The key point is the `height` value; you'll need to experiment to find a suitable value that accommodates the number of rows in your DataFrame and your screen resolution.


**Example 2:  CSS Manipulation (External Stylesheet - More Robust)**

For better organization and maintainability, especially with multiple DataFrames, it's preferable to define the CSS in a separate stylesheet and link it to your Notebook. This approach avoids inline styles which can clutter the code and be less manageable.  This requires creating a `.css` file (e.g., `dataframe_style.css`) with the relevant CSS rules.


```python
# dataframe_style.css (Create this file separately)
/* Style for Jupyter Notebook output to remove vertical scrollbar */
div.output_area {
  height: 600px; /* Adjust as needed */
  overflow-y: auto; /* Allow only horizontal scroll */
  overflow-x: auto; /* Allow horizontal scroll if needed*/
}
```

Then, in your Jupyter Notebook cell:

```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import HTML

# ... (DataFrame creation as in Example 1) ...

# Link the external CSS file
style = "<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='dataframe_style.css'>"
display(HTML(style + df.to_html(index=False)))

```

This method separates concerns, making CSS management more efficient.  Remember to place the `dataframe_style.css` file in a location accessible to the Jupyter Notebook (usually in the same directory as your notebook file).


**Example 3:  Head-Tail Display using `head()` and `tail()`**

If the DataFrame is extremely large, attempting to display it entirely might be impractical regardless of scrolling.  In such cases, a feasible solution is to display only the top and bottom sections using the `head()` and `tail()` methods. This gives a representative overview without the performance issues of rendering thousands of rows.

```python
import pandas as pd

# ... (DataFrame creation as in Example 1) ...

# Display the first 10 and last 10 rows
display(df.head(10))
display(df.tail(10))
```

This approach provides a concise summary, useful for exploration and analysis without the need to display the entire DataFrame.  Adjust the arguments of `head()` and `tail()` to control the number of rows displayed at the beginning and end respectively.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Pandas documentation; the IPython documentation; resources on CSS and HTML styling; documentation on your specific Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., the PyCharm Jupyter Notebook integration).  Exploring alternative visualization libraries like Plotly or Seaborn, which provide more control over rendering, can prove beneficial when dealing with very large or complex datasets.  Consult these resources for advanced styling techniques and troubleshooting guidance related to Jupyter Notebook output rendering.  Understanding the interaction between Pandas, the Jupyter Notebook rendering engine (typically based on IPython), and the browser's CSS engine is paramount in resolving display issues.
