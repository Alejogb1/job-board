TensorFlow 2.0's eager execution model significantly alters how compilation occurs compared to its predecessor.  The key fact to understand is that compilation in TF 2.0 isn't a monolithic process triggered at a single point; rather, it's a dynamic, often implicit process tied to the execution of `tf.function`-decorated methods and the creation of `tf.data` pipelines.  Incremental training, specifically, affects compilation through the continual updating of model variables and the potential for changes in the computation graph's structure.  My experience working on large-scale natural language processing models has highlighted the subtleties of this behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The trigger for a compilation step in TensorFlow 2.0 during incremental training is not a predefined event but a consequence of several factors working in concert.  These factors primarily revolve around changes within the `tf.function`-decorated training step.  When a `tf.function` is called, TensorFlow traces the execution path and constructs a computational graph.  This graph is then compiled into an optimized executable.

Subsequent calls to the same `tf.function` with identical inputs (including the values of model variables) will reuse the compiled graph, leading to significant performance gains. However, any change in the following aspects will trigger a recompilation:

* **Changes in model variables:**  This is the most frequent trigger during incremental training. Updating model weights, biases, or other trainable variables modifies the state of the computation graph, requiring a new compilation.  Note that small changes, such as minor weight adjustments, won't necessarily lead to a complete recompilation; TensorFlow's XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler performs optimizations to reuse parts of the existing graph whenever possible.  However, significant structural alterations will force a full recompilation.

* **Changes in the training step's structure:** Adding or removing layers, changing activation functions, modifying loss functions, or altering the optimizer all lead to structural changes within the `tf.function`'s body.  This necessitates a complete recompilation to reflect the updated computational flow.

* **Changes in input data:**  While less common during incremental training itself, alterations in the `tf.data` pipeline feeding the model (e.g., changing batch size, data augmentation techniques, or preprocessing steps) can indirectly trigger recompilation.  This is because the pipeline's output directly affects the input to the `tf.function`, thus altering the traced execution path.

* **Autograph Transformations:** TensorFlow's Autograph system automatically converts Python control flow (e.g., `if` statements, loops) into TensorFlow graph operations.  Changes to these control flow structures within the `tf.function` will naturally prompt recompilation, as the converted graph needs updating.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Recompilation Triggered by Variable Update:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def train_step(model, inputs, labels, optimizer):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(inputs)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.mse(labels, predictions))
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
inputs = tf.random.normal((10, 5))
labels = tf.random.normal((10, 10))

# First call compiles the function
loss1 = train_step(model, inputs, labels, optimizer)

# Model variables are updated; subsequent call triggers recompilation (likely a partial recompilation)
loss2 = train_step(model, inputs, labels, optimizer)

print(f"Loss 1: {loss1}, Loss 2: {loss2}")
```

This example demonstrates how updating model variables within the `train_step` function, via the optimizer, implicitly triggers a recompilation (or at least an update of the compiled graph). The `tf.function` decorator ensures this optimization.


**Example 2: Structural Change Triggering Recompilation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def train_step_v1(model, inputs, labels, optimizer):
  # ... (same as Example 1) ...

@tf.function
def train_step_v2(model, inputs, labels, optimizer):
  predictions = model(inputs)
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.mae(labels, predictions)) # Changed loss function
  gradients = tf.gradients(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# ... (model, optimizer, inputs, labels defined as in Example 1) ...

loss1 = train_step_v1(model, inputs, labels, optimizer)
# Structural change: switching to a different training step function
loss2 = train_step_v2(model, inputs, labels, optimizer)
```

Changing the loss function from MSE to MAE in `train_step_v2` necessitates a full recompilation because the computation graph has fundamentally changed.  The `@tf.function` decorator ensures a fresh compilation for the modified function.


**Example 3: Impact of `tf.data` Pipeline Changes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Dataset 1
dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((100,5)), tf.random.normal((100,10)))).batch(10)

#Dataset 2 with different batch size
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((100,5)), tf.random.normal((100,10)))).batch(20)

@tf.function
def train_step(model, dataset, optimizer):
  for inputs, labels in dataset:
    #Training step logic as in Example 1
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(inputs)
      loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.mse(labels, predictions))
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


# ... (model, optimizer defined as in Example 1) ...

train_step(model, dataset1, optimizer)
#Changing the dataset will indirectly trigger recompilation because the input to the function changed.
train_step(model, dataset2, optimizer)
```

Altering the batch size in the `tf.data` pipeline changes the input shape to the training step, influencing the graph's execution and necessitating recompilation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, especially sections on `tf.function`, Autograph, and XLA compilation, are invaluable.  Furthermore, studying the source code of well-established TensorFlow models and libraries can provide deeper insights into best practices for efficient compilation within incremental training contexts.  Finally,  exploring research papers on TensorFlow optimization and compiler techniques can offer a more advanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
