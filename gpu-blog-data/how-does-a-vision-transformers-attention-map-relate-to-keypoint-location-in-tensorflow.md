In practice, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) are primarily designed for image classification, their inherent attention mechanism offers a pathway for inferring localized feature importance, which indirectly correlates with keypoint locations. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which encode spatial information through filter operations, ViTs rely on self-attention to capture relationships between different parts of the image. The attention maps generated by ViT layers reveal where the network is "looking" when processing an image, and these areas of heightened attention can, with careful consideration, be linked to the spatial positioning of keypoints. The process requires interpreting the attention weights learned by the model to map them back onto the input image space.

The core idea rests on the fact that the attention weights, specifically those generated in the later layers of a ViT, are not uniformly distributed. Certain image patches, and hence spatial locations, will exhibit larger attention scores when correlated with the classification task or, in this modified context, with the location of a keypoint. These attention maps don't directly output keypoint coordinates; rather, they indicate which image regions contribute most to the model's internal representation. By strategically analyzing these maps, we can approximate, and in certain instances pinpoint, the location of semantically relevant features often associated with the presence of keypoints.

The typical architecture of a ViT involves first splitting an input image into patches, which are then linearly embedded and passed through multiple transformer encoder layers. These encoder layers consist of multi-headed self-attention modules followed by feed-forward networks. During the self-attention computation, each patch is compared with all other patches, and a weight matrix is produced representing the "attention" between these patches. The attention map we are interested in is typically computed by averaging the attention weights from all attention heads, as they often converge to emphasize similar spatial regions.

To understand this further, consider an example of a hypothetical facial recognition system based on a ViT. Instead of simply training the model for face identification, I've adapted it to also learn specific facial feature landmarks. The assumption is that high attention scores will correlate with the areas around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Specifically, the last transformer encoder's attention weights are analyzed, not the layer that feeds into the classifier directly. We need to reconstruct an image from the attention weights of each patch. These attention values from the self-attention blocks are applied to the embeddings that represent the patches to achieve an attention-weighted patch representation. I will demonstrate how one can retrieve such attention weights from Tensorflow, and how to visualize the keypoint localization, using a simple example.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume a trained ViT model named 'vit_model', with the last encoder layer named 'encoder_layer_n'.
# Assume a batch of images and that we are extracting attention for first image in the batch.
def get_attention_map(image, vit_model, layer_name = 'encoder_layer_n'):
    img_batch = tf.expand_dims(image, axis = 0)
    
    # Extract the attention weights from the target layer.
    target_layer = vit_model.get_layer(layer_name)
    
    # Get the attention weights. Adjust according to your ViT layer naming and structure.
    attn_weights = target_layer(vit_model.get_layer('pre_layernorm')(vit_model.get_layer('patch_embedding')(img_batch)))[1]
    
    # Sum the attention weights for all heads and take the average.
    attn_weights = tf.reduce_mean(attn_weights, axis=1)  # Average across heads.
    
    #Reshape the attention to represent each patch with the corresponding weight.
    num_patches = attn_weights.shape[-1]
    img_size = image.shape[0]
    patch_size = img_size // int(np.sqrt(num_patches))
    reshaped_attn = tf.reshape(attn_weights[:,1:], (int(np.sqrt(num_patches)), int(np.sqrt(num_patches))))
    
    # Resize the reshaped weights to get the attention map.
    attention_map = tf.image.resize(tf.expand_dims(reshaped_attn, axis=-1), (img_size, img_size))
    
    return attention_map

# Example usage with dummy model and input

  inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))
  x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=768, kernel_size=16, strides=16, use_bias = False, name = 'patch_embedding')(inputs)
  x = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6, name = 'pre_layernorm')(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Reshape(target_shape=(x.shape[1]*x.shape[2], x.shape[3]))(x)

      def call(x):
        skip = x

        x = tf.keras.layers.Add()([skip, attn_output])
        x = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon = 1e-6)(x)

        return x, attn_layer.attention_weights
      return tf.keras.layers.Lambda(call, name = name)

  model = tf.keras.Model(inputs = inputs, outputs = outputs)
  
  model.layers[-2].attention_weights = attention_weights
  return model


if __name__ == '__main__':
    image = tf.random.normal(shape=(64, 64, 3))
    vit_model = dummy_vit_model() # Replace with your actual trained model
    attention_map = get_attention_map(image, vit_model)

    plt.imshow(tf.squeeze(attention_map), cmap='jet')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.title('Attention Map')
    plt.show()
```

In the first code example, I implement the `get_attention_map` function, which extracts, averages, and resizes the attention weights from the last encoder layer to create an attention map with the dimensions of the original image. In particular, the reshaping allows for each attention weight to be associated with a patch location and the resizing uses bilinear interpolation to create an attention map. Note that, in a typical ViT model, a class token is included as part of the patch sequence. The attention map produced therefore excludes the weights associated with this class token since we are only interested in patch level attention. In the example, I also create a dummy ViT model for demonstration. In practice, you would replace the `dummy_vit_model()` with your own loaded model. This results in the attention map visualization. I employ the jet colormap as it intuitively highlights the areas with larger attention using warm colors.

However, this attention map, as it is, doesnâ€™t usually point directly to precise keypoint locations. To further refine this, one can threshold and apply a centroid calculation on areas of high attention. Consider the code below, which implements this:

```python
def refine_keypoint_locations(attention_map, threshold=0.6):
    """Refines keypoint locations by thresholding the attention map and calculating centroids."""
    
    # Threshold the attention map to isolate high attention areas.
    thresholded_map = tf.where(attention_map > threshold, attention_map, tf.zeros_like(attention_map))
    
    # Get the coordinates of the non-zero elements.
    y_indices, x_indices = tf.where(tf.squeeze(thresholded_map) > 0).numpy().T
    
    if len(y_indices) == 0:
        return []  # No keypoints found
    
    # Calculate centroid for each separate attention cluster.
    labels = measure.label(tf.squeeze(thresholded_map).numpy())
    props = measure.regionprops(labels)
    centroids = []
    
    for prop in props:
      centroids.append(prop.centroid)
      
    return centroids

if __name__ == '__main__':
  image = tf.random.normal(shape=(64, 64, 3))
  vit_model = dummy_vit_model()
  attention_map = get_attention_map(image, vit_model)
  
  centroids = refine_keypoint_locations(attention_map)

  plt.imshow(tf.squeeze(attention_map), cmap='gray')
  if centroids:
      for centroid in centroids:
          plt.scatter(centroid[1], centroid[0], color='red', marker='x', s = 50)
  plt.title('Attention Map with Refined Keypoints')
  plt.show()
```
In this code snippet, I add an extra step that performs thresholding, then uses skimage's `measure` module to compute the centroid of attention regions. A threshold value is used to filter out irrelevant parts of the attention map and to extract high attention regions. The `measure.label()` identifies the separate, connected regions in the image. By analyzing each connected region individually with `measure.regionprops()`, I compute the centroid location of each cluster. The resultant plot highlights these locations with cross markers on the attention map itself. Note that if no keypoints were found, an empty list will be returned.

It is essential to recognize that these keypoints are not explicitly trained during fine-tuning. Instead, the attention mechanism learns to "attend" to semantically relevant regions, which implicitly enables the keypoint localization. While the above examples do not use a model explicitly trained to predict a particular keypoint, it still demonstrates how the attention mechanism can be used for localization purposes.

The third example further refines the process of keypoint localization, considering that not all patches are equally informative. Certain patches, especially those corresponding to background regions, might have lower attention weights, while patches near keypoints will exhibit higher weights. The code shows how to use these weights to create a refined estimate of the keypoint position:

```python
def refine_keypoint_locations_weighted_average(attention_map, threshold=0.3):
  """Refines keypoint locations using a weighted average of patch coordinates."""
  
  #Threshold the map
  thresholded_map = tf.where(attention_map > threshold, attention_map, tf.zeros_like(attention_map))
  
  
  # Get the coordinates of non-zero elements.
  y_indices, x_indices = tf.where(tf.squeeze(thresholded_map) > 0).numpy().T
  attn_values = tf.gather_nd(tf.squeeze(thresholded_map), tf.stack([y_indices, x_indices], axis=1)).numpy()
  
  if len(y_indices) == 0:
        return None # No keypoints found

  img_size = int(np.sqrt(thresholded_map.shape[0]*thresholded_map.shape[1]))
  num_patches = int(np.sqrt(len(y_indices)))
  patch_size = img_size // num_patches
  
  #Create an array containing patch indices from non-zero elements
  patch_indices_y = y_indices // patch_size
  patch_indices_x = x_indices // patch_size
  
  #Calculate the weighted average of the patch coordinates.
  weighted_x = np.average(x_indices, weights = attn_values)
  weighted_y = np.average(y_indices, weights = attn_values)

  return (weighted_y, weighted_x)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  image = tf.random.normal(shape=(64, 64, 3))
  vit_model = dummy_vit_model()
  attention_map = get_attention_map(image, vit_model)

  weighted_keypoint = refine_keypoint_locations_weighted_average(attention_map)
  plt.imshow(tf.squeeze(attention_map), cmap='gray')
  if weighted_keypoint:
    plt.scatter(weighted_keypoint[1], weighted_keypoint[0], color='red', marker='x', s = 50)
  plt.title('Attention Map with Weighted Keypoint')
  plt.show()
```
In this last example, instead of centroid based approach, I compute the weighted average of patch coordinates, where the weights are taken from the attention map values of each patch. If no patches are selected via the threshold, then no keypoint is returned. This approach is effective when keypoint locations are not represented by separated clusters in the attention map.

In summary, I've explored how a Vision Transformerâ€™s attention maps relate to keypoint location. While the ViT architecture was not designed for direct keypoint extraction, the inherent attention mechanism provides a reasonable proxy for feature localization. The provided code and explanation demonstrates how to extract attention weights, visualize attention maps, and refine keypoint locations using thresholding, centroid analysis and weighted averaging. These techniques are foundational in utilizing ViTs for tasks requiring localized spatial awareness and are critical considerations when adapting such models for applications beyond simple image classification.

For further exploration, I would recommend examining works that focus on the application of attention mechanism in object detection and localization. Additionally, studying the details of Vision Transformer architectures, particularly the specifics of multi-head attention and transformer encoders, will provide additional insight. Finally, the skimage library offers good examples of regionprops analysis and centroid detection.
