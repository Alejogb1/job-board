The root cause of a Keras import error despite having both TensorFlow and Theano installed frequently stems from conflicting backend specifications, rather than a simple absence of either library.  My experience debugging these issues across numerous large-scale machine learning projects has shown that Keras's backend selection mechanism, while generally robust, is susceptible to inconsistencies in environment variables and package installation order.  The error usually manifests as an `ImportError` or similar, indicating that Keras cannot locate or correctly initialize the chosen backend.


**1. Clear Explanation of the Problem:**

Keras, at its core, is a high-level API that acts as an abstraction layer over various deep learning backends.  TensorFlow and Theano are two such backends.  When you install Keras, it doesn't automatically "choose" a backend; instead, it defaults to TensorFlow if found, otherwise attempting to use Theano.  The problem arises when conflicting instructions are given to Keras regarding which backend to utilize.  This can occur through multiple avenues:

* **Environment Variables:**  The `KERAS_BACKEND` environment variable explicitly dictates the backend. Setting this incorrectly (e.g., to `theano` when TensorFlow is intended, or vice versa, or to a non-existent backend) will immediately lead to import failures.  If the variable is set incorrectly, Keras will attempt to load a backend that it cannot find, resulting in the error.

* **Conflicting Package Installations:**  Installing TensorFlow and Theano simultaneously can cause conflicts, even if both appear to install correctly.  The underlying libraries that each backend relies on might overlap, creating dependency hell.  This might lead to version mismatches, particularly if one backend requires a specific version of a shared library (e.g., NumPy) that the other is not compatible with.  Keras might then load a version of a crucial library that is insufficient or incompatible for its chosen backend, causing silent failures within the backend's initialization process.

* **Incorrect Keras Installation:** Although less common, a corrupted or incomplete Keras installation can lead to these import errors.  A flawed installation might fail to correctly register the backends, leading Keras to be unable to access either TensorFlow or Theano, even if they are present on the system.

* **Multiple Keras Installations:** The presence of multiple Keras installations – perhaps through different package managers (conda, pip) or virtual environments – can trigger unexpected behaviour and mask true backend problems.  Different versions of Keras may have different dependency requirements, leading to obscure import errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples illustrate different approaches to troubleshooting and resolving the Keras import error.

**Example 1: Explicit Backend Selection:**

```python
import os
os.environ['KERAS_BACKEND'] = 'tensorflow' # or 'theano'
import keras

# Verify the backend is correctly set
print(keras.backend.backend())

# Attempt a simple Keras model creation
from keras.models import Sequential
model = Sequential()
```

This example demonstrates the direct setting of the `KERAS_BACKEND` environment variable.  By explicitly specifying the desired backend before importing Keras, you override any potential conflicts from other sources.  The `print` statement verifies that Keras has correctly recognized the selected backend. The subsequent model creation attempts to further test the validity of the setup.  Remember to replace `'tensorflow'` with `'theano'` if you intend to use Theano.


**Example 2: Checking Package Versions and Dependencies:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import theano
import keras
import numpy

print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("Theano version:", theano.__version__)
print("Keras version:", keras.__version__)
print("NumPy version:", numpy.__version__)

# Check for conflicting packages (requires a package manager like pip or conda)
# This part depends heavily on the specific setup and potentially requires investigation of the package list itself
# (e.g., pip list or conda list) for any overlapping or potentially problematic packages.
```

This code checks the versions of the key packages involved.  Version mismatches can lead to subtle incompatibilities that manifest as import errors.  The commented-out section highlights the importance of examining your installed packages for potential conflicts.  Carefully reviewing package lists can reveal dependencies that are incompatible between TensorFlow and Theano.


**Example 3: Virtual Environments for Isolation:**

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment (using virtualenv or conda)
python3 -m venv my_keras_env
source my_keras_env/bin/activate  # or activate my_keras_env on conda

# Install Keras and its dependencies within the isolated environment
pip install keras tensorflow  # or pip install keras theano

# Now try importing Keras within the activated virtual environment
python
>>> import keras
>>> print(keras.backend.backend())
>>> # ... continue with Keras code ...
```

This example advocates for using virtual environments. Virtual environments provide a clean, isolated environment to install packages, preventing conflicts between different projects' dependencies.  By installing Keras and its backend of choice within a separate environment, you avoid potential conflicts with globally installed packages. Remember to deactivate the environment when finished (`deactivate`).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official documentation for Keras, TensorFlow, and Theano.  Furthermore, a thorough examination of your system's package manager (pip, conda) output will often provide crucial information on installed packages, versions, and dependencies.  Finally, searching for specific error messages within the Keras and backend documentation or community forums can be remarkably helpful.  These resources offer detailed troubleshooting guides and solutions tailored to common issues, including import errors.  Focusing on the specific error message provided by the Python interpreter is paramount to pinpoint the root of your problems.
