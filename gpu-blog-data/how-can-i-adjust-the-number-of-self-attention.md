Self-attention mechanisms are a critical component of transformer-based models, and their performance is often heavily influenced by the configuration of self-attention layers, specifically the number of layers and attention heads. Adjusting these parameters is essential for optimizing a model's capacity, computational cost, and ability to learn complex relationships within the input data. I've spent considerable time experimenting with this while building language and sequence models, and I can share some practical insights.

The number of self-attention layers directly corresponds to the model’s depth. A deeper model, achieved by stacking multiple self-attention layers, theoretically allows for the learning of more abstract and hierarchical representations of the input sequence. However, increasing the depth comes with a higher computational cost and can lead to vanishing or exploding gradient problems during training if not managed properly. The number of attention heads within each layer, on the other hand, dictates the dimensionality of the attention space. Multiple attention heads allow the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously, potentially capturing diverse relationships and dependencies.

In PyTorch, self-attention is typically implemented using the `nn.MultiheadAttention` module. This module encapsulates the core logic of self-attention, including the linear transformations, attention score computation, and weighted value aggregation. Adjusting the number of layers and heads involves modifying the initialization parameters of this module and the overall structure of your transformer model. Specifically, the number of attention heads is specified during the `nn.MultiheadAttention` module instantiation, and the number of layers depends on how many of these modules, along with other necessary blocks such as feed-forward networks, are stacked together sequentially or in parallel.

Here’s how I generally approach this, broken down with practical examples:

**Example 1: Single Self-Attention Layer with Adjustable Heads**

This example shows a class that represents a single self-attention layer. The critical part here is the `num_heads` parameter in the `nn.MultiheadAttention` initialization. Increasing this value enables more diverse information capture.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SingleAttentionLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super(SingleAttentionLayer, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, num_heads)
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x: [sequence_length, batch_size, d_model]
        attn_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
        x = x + attn_output
        x = self.norm(x)
        return x


# Usage:
d_model = 512  # embedding dimension
num_heads = 8
seq_length = 20 # length of sequence
batch_size = 3 # number of sequences in each batch

attention_layer = SingleAttentionLayer(d_model, num_heads)
dummy_input = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, d_model)
output = attention_layer(dummy_input)

print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

In this example, `d_model` represents the embedding dimension, while `num_heads` dictates the number of parallel attention heads. The `SingleAttentionLayer` encapsulates the `nn.MultiheadAttention` followed by a residual connection and layer normalization. It is crucial to note that `d_model` must be divisible by `num_heads` since the output from each head is concatenated. I tend to start by ensuring the head dimension is divisible by 64 to avoid issues further down the line. The input to this layer `x` will be of the shape [sequence_length, batch_size, d_model] in most typical use cases.

**Example 2: Multiple Stacked Self-Attention Layers**

This example showcases how to stack multiple self-attention layers, thereby increasing the model's depth. The key here is repeatedly instantiating the `SingleAttentionLayer` and passing the output of one to the input of the next.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, num_layers):
        super(TransformerEncoder, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([SingleAttentionLayer(d_model, num_heads) for _ in range(num_layers)])

    def forward(self, x):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

# Usage:
d_model = 512
num_heads = 8
num_layers = 4  # Number of attention layers
seq_length = 20
batch_size = 3

encoder = TransformerEncoder(d_model, num_heads, num_layers)
dummy_input = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, d_model)
output = encoder(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

```

The `TransformerEncoder` class now stacks multiple `SingleAttentionLayer` instances. The `num_layers` parameter controls the model's depth. With each additional layer, the model can potentially learn more complex features, but at the cost of increased computation and parameters. I usually experiment with adding layers in powers of two or until diminishing returns are achieved in my validation metrics.

**Example 3: Combining Self-Attention with a Feedforward Network**

In practical transformer architectures, self-attention layers are almost always followed by a feed-forward network and other normalization components. This example illustrates a complete transformer block incorporating both self-attention and a feed-forward layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, d_ff):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()
        self.attention = SingleAttentionLayer(d_model, num_heads)
        self.feedforward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(d_model, d_ff),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(d_ff, d_model)
        )
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)

    def forward(self, x):
      # x: [sequence_length, batch_size, d_model]
      x = self.attention(x)
      ff_output = self.feedforward(x)
      x = x + ff_output
      x = self.norm(x)
      return x

class TransformerModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, d_ff, num_layers):
    super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
    self.layers = nn.ModuleList([TransformerBlock(d_model, num_heads, d_ff) for _ in range(num_layers)])

  def forward(self, x):
    for layer in self.layers:
      x = layer(x)
    return x

# Usage:
d_model = 512
num_heads = 8
d_ff = 2048 # dimension of feedforward network
num_layers = 4
seq_length = 20
batch_size = 3

transformer_block = TransformerModel(d_model, num_heads, d_ff, num_layers)
dummy_input = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, d_model)
output = transformer_block(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

The `TransformerBlock` now encapsulates both the self-attention layer and a feedforward network. The feedforward network typically has an intermediate dimension (`d_ff`) greater than `d_model` and is crucial for introducing non-linearity and complexity.  This pattern is repeated across multiple layers in a more complete model. The `TransformerModel` class uses it to build our deeper model. Experimenting with `d_ff` along with number of layers and heads is also part of my regular process.

In each of these examples, the number of heads is controlled by the `num_heads` argument in `nn.MultiheadAttention` and number of layers are configured via the `num_layers` parameter when creating the model. Adjusting these values allows for a fine degree of control over the model’s architecture.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding of these concepts, I would recommend focusing on learning the theoretical foundation of attention mechanisms first. There are resources available which provide detailed mathematical explanations of the attention mechanism. Further, exploring papers on the original transformer architecture and its subsequent variants can help you understand practical implications. Additionally, reviewing PyTorch official documentation for the `nn.MultiheadAttention`, `nn.LayerNorm` and `nn.Linear` modules will give you further insight into how to construct these blocks and adjust their parameters. Examining existing implementations of transformer models in open-source repositories will give you practical perspectives on how such techniques are used in real world settings.
