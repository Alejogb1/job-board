The challenge of effectively utilizing a GPU with TensorFlow C++ stems primarily from a complex interplay of environment setup, build configurations, and explicit device placement within the computational graph. I've encountered this particular issue numerous times during the development of high-performance simulation frameworks and model training pipelines. In my experience, the mere presence of an NVIDIA GPU and the installation of TensorFlow's GPU-enabled package are not sufficient to guarantee GPU utilization. Careful attention to detail is paramount.

The core issue revolves around the fact that TensorFlowâ€™s C++ API, unlike its Python counterpart, doesn't automatically detect and utilize available GPU resources. The Python API provides a higher level of abstraction, where the underlying TensorFlow runtime makes many decisions regarding device placement transparently. With C++, this level of abstraction is removed, requiring explicit control over device placement. Furthermore, the build process itself has a considerable impact. If TensorFlow was compiled without CUDA support or if the correct CUDA libraries aren't accessible at runtime, the GPU will not be leveraged. The TensorFlow library needs to be explicitly built using the correct compiler, and CUDA libraries that match the installed driver and card needs to be present when compiling the client application.

The primary reason for this necessity of explicit device placement comes down to performance considerations. TensorFlow assumes CPU execution by default. If the user wants to use a GPU, the user must tell TensorFlow what operation to run on the GPU. This is crucial because transferring data between the CPU and GPU has considerable overhead; thus, selectively executing computationally intensive operations on the GPU, and leaving smaller tasks on the CPU, can yield the best performance.

Let's consider a basic example of matrix multiplication. If you were to write the code without specifying a device, it would execute on the CPU, irrespective of GPU availability.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/cc/client/client_session.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/ops/standard_ops.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"

int main() {
  tensorflow::Scope scope = tensorflow::Scope::NewRootScope();
  auto a = tensorflow::ops::Const(scope, {{1.0f, 2.0f}, {3.0f, 4.0f}});
  auto b = tensorflow::ops::Const(scope, {{5.0f, 6.0f}, {7.0f, 8.0f}});
  auto matmul = tensorflow::ops::MatMul(scope, a, b);

  tensorflow::ClientSession session(scope);
  std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
  TF_CHECK_OK(session.Run({matmul}, &outputs));

  // Output the matrix
  auto output_matrix = outputs[0].matrix<float>();
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
      for(int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
        std::cout << output_matrix(i, j) << " ";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this initial example, the scope is created without any device specifications. Consequently, all operations, including matrix multiplication, are performed on the CPU, even when a GPU is available. To force it to use the GPU, we have to specifically declare it when creating the operations.

Now, to address the GPU utilization, we modify the code to explicitly place the `MatMul` operation on the GPU using the `WithDevice` method on the TensorFlow `Scope`.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/cc/client/client_session.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/ops/standard_ops.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"

int main() {
    tensorflow::Scope scope = tensorflow::Scope::NewRootScope();
    //Specify the device
    auto gpu_scope = scope.WithDevice("/device:GPU:0");
    auto a = tensorflow::ops::Const(gpu_scope, {{1.0f, 2.0f}, {3.0f, 4.0f}});
    auto b = tensorflow::ops::Const(gpu_scope, {{5.0f, 6.0f}, {7.0f, 8.0f}});
    auto matmul = tensorflow::ops::MatMul(gpu_scope, a, b);

    tensorflow::ClientSession session(scope);
    std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
    TF_CHECK_OK(session.Run({matmul}, &outputs));

  // Output the matrix
  auto output_matrix = outputs[0].matrix<float>();
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
      for(int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
        std::cout << output_matrix(i, j) << " ";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}

```

In this modified example, I use `scope.WithDevice("/device:GPU:0")` to create a new scope that specifies the GPU. The constant and matmul operations are created under the gpu_scope and thus use the GPU during the session run. If no GPU is present, the program would typically terminate with an error. To be resilient to cases where a GPU is not available, I might wrap this GPU scope generation in an conditional statement or use the default scope in case there is no GPU.

However, specifying `/device:GPU:0` is not always the correct course of action. In many real world scenarios, a system may have multiple GPUs. Also, due to hardware or system specific configurations, sometimes the default number 0 may not be the GPU which you want to use. Therefore it is crucial to know which device ID you are trying to target. You can get a list of the available devices on your system, including CPUs, GPUs, and their unique identifiers using the `ListDevices` function on the `ClientSession`. This information can be used to programmatically choose the desired device. Below, I demonstrate the procedure of listing available devices and then selecting one of them dynamically:

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/cc/client/client_session.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/ops/standard_ops.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/protobuf/device_attributes.pb.h"

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    tensorflow::Scope scope = tensorflow::Scope::NewRootScope();
    tensorflow::ClientSession session(scope);

    // Retrieve a list of available devices
    std::vector<tensorflow::DeviceAttributes> available_devices;
    TF_CHECK_OK(session.ListDevices(&available_devices));

    std::string device_name = "/device:CPU:0";

    // Iterate through the available devices
    for (const auto& device : available_devices) {
       if (device.device_type() == "GPU") {
          device_name = device.name();
          std::cout << "Found suitable GPU device : " << device_name << std::endl;
          break; // Select the first available GPU
        } else {
           std::cout << "Available device : " << device.name() << std::endl;
        }
    }

     //Specify the device
    auto device_scope = scope.WithDevice(device_name);

    auto a = tensorflow::ops::Const(device_scope, {{1.0f, 2.0f}, {3.0f, 4.0f}});
    auto b = tensorflow::ops::Const(device_scope, {{5.0f, 6.0f}, {7.0f, 8.0f}});
    auto matmul = tensorflow::ops::MatMul(device_scope, a, b);

    std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
    TF_CHECK_OK(session.Run({matmul}, &outputs));

  // Output the matrix
  auto output_matrix = outputs[0].matrix<float>();
  for(int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
      for(int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
        std::cout << output_matrix(i, j) << " ";
      }
      std::cout << std::endl;
  }
    return 0;
}
```

This final example dynamically selects the first available GPU, and falls back to using the CPU if no GPU is detected. The information of what device to use is extracted via the `ListDevices` function provided by the `ClientSession`. We iterate through the devices and find the first available GPU. If a GPU is found, we use it. Otherwise, the device_name variable will remain the default CPU device string. This makes it more robust in cases where there is no available GPU.

In summary, proper GPU utilization in TensorFlow C++ requires a thorough understanding of build configurations, device specification, and runtime device selection. Furthermore, data placement (i.e., data on the GPU vs CPU) must be considered in terms of its effect on performance. The simple matrix multiplication example serves to illustrate the core principles. More complex operations, when using the C++ API, still require explicit device specifications.

For further understanding, the official TensorFlow documentation on C++ API usage is highly recommended. The NVIDIA CUDA toolkit documentation will be useful for understanding the configuration of the GPU runtime environment. Also, detailed examples within the TensorFlow source code on github are very insightful regarding optimal C++ API usage. Exploring relevant StackOverflow posts might yield practical solutions to specific issues.
