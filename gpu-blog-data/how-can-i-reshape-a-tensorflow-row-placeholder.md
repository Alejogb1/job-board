TensorFlow, unlike some tensor manipulation libraries, doesn't offer a direct, in-place "transpose" operation that reconfigures a placeholder's shape during graph construction. The core of reshaping a row placeholder into a column placeholder lies in understanding that placeholders define the expected shape of input data during graph execution, not necessarily the explicit shape of the *tensor* being passed. I've often encountered this when building sequence processing models, where the input might initially be designed as a batch of row vectors but then needs to be interpreted as a series of feature columns. The solution requires redefining the placeholder's shape and then potentially using `tf.transpose` to manipulate the actual data within the graph after feeding.

The primary conceptual hurdle is that placeholders are essentially symbolic variables. You declare them with a specific structure (shape), but the actual tensors that populate them only exist during graph execution. Therefore, changing the "placeholder shape" involves declaring a new placeholder with the target shape and potentially adapting how you feed data into the model. You do *not* modify an existing placeholder. The strategy revolves around these key steps: defining an input placeholder with the intended row format, then defining a second placeholder with the target column format, and finally ensuring your data feeding mechanism and any model layers downstream are aligned with these definitions. If data input and placeholders match, you can simply use `tf.transpose` to transform the original input to act as the desired column-based data.

Here’s how I approach this problem in practice, using specific examples:

**Example 1: Direct Transpose with Matching Input**

Imagine you have an input designed as a batch of row vectors with shape `(batch_size, feature_count)` but you need to represent it as a batch of column vectors, shape `(feature_count, batch_size)`. The critical point here is that the *data* being fed to the placeholder matches the initially intended row format, and we will use `tf.transpose` after feeding to achieve the desired column representation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the original row placeholder. None represents batch size
row_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 10), name="row_input")

# Transpose to achieve column format within the computational graph
column_tensor = tf.transpose(row_placeholder, perm=[1, 0], name="column_output")

# Let's try to feed in the data for 2 batches
batch_data = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
              [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
# Create a TensorFlow session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Feed the row data into the row placeholder
    column_data = sess.run(column_tensor, feed_dict={row_placeholder: batch_data})

    print("Original row input data shape:", tf.shape(row_placeholder))
    print("Transposed column output shape:", tf.shape(column_tensor))
    print("Transposed data:\n", column_data)
```
In this example, the `row_placeholder` is initialized with a shape allowing a variable number of rows (the batch size indicated by `None`) and a fixed number of features (10).  We feed data matching the shape `(2, 10)`. The `tf.transpose` operation transforms the data inside the graph to have `(10, 2)`. The key here is not changing placeholders but using the transpose operation in the computational graph after feeding data in the initially defined row format.

**Example 2: Redefining Placeholder with Reshaped Input**

In this scenario, perhaps external data sources mandate that you receive a column-shaped input, and you’ve initially defined the system with a row-oriented placeholder. Here, you must define a new column placeholder and adapt the feeding mechanism.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the original placeholder that expects row format input (like Example 1)
row_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 10), name="row_input")

# Define a NEW placeholder, this time accepting column data
column_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(10, None), name="column_input")

# In this example, we don't need to transpose. We are providing a column-shaped data directly.
# To demonstrate, let's use the same data as before, but transpose it before feeding
batch_data = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
            [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
transposed_data = list(zip(*batch_data)) # Convert rows to columns

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Now, we feed the transposed data to column placeholder directly
    column_output = sess.run(column_placeholder, feed_dict={column_placeholder: transposed_data})

    print("Original row placeholder shape:", tf.shape(row_placeholder))
    print("Column input placeholder shape:", tf.shape(column_placeholder))
    print("Column data shape after feeding: ", tf.shape(column_output))
    print("Transposed data:", column_output)
```

This example avoids any transpose operation within the computational graph.  We create a completely separate `column_placeholder` that explicitly expects column-major input of shape `(10, None)`. We must also transpose the input data prior to the `feed_dict` so it matches the shape of `column_placeholder`.  It highlights that altering the *data* shape going into the *placeholder* allows you to match the expected format of a placeholder.

**Example 3:  Reshaping with Reshape operation**

Sometimes you are not in control of the input shape that comes from other operations in the graph. To reshape the intermediate data to the right shape before the feeding, one can use `tf.reshape` within the graph. In this scenario, data comes in as a flat row vector and will be reshaped into a column vector of shape `(feature_count, batch_size)`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the original row placeholder, for a flat array
row_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None), name="row_input")

# Define a NEW placeholder for the column shape, we will reshape to this size
column_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(10, None), name="column_input")

# We reshape the flat row data to a column shape
reshaped_row = tf.reshape(row_placeholder, shape=(10, 1))

# For sake of example, we want to add a second batch. So we are concat on batch dim
reshaped_input = tf.concat([reshaped_row, reshaped_row], axis=1)

# No direct feeding for the column placeholder is done.
# We will directly compare the reshaped intermediate variable with expected shape.
batch_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Run the reshaped intermediate value
    reshaped_values = sess.run(reshaped_input, feed_dict={row_placeholder: batch_data})

    print("Original row placeholder shape:", tf.shape(row_placeholder))
    print("Column placeholder shape:", tf.shape(column_placeholder))
    print("Reshaped column data shape:", tf.shape(reshaped_input))
    print("Reshaped values: \n", reshaped_values)

```

Here, `row_placeholder` now accepts a flattened vector. We then use `tf.reshape` to turn this flat vector into a single column representation `(10,1)`. We then perform another `tf.concat` operation to combine the reshaped vector with itself to simulate multiple batches to mimic the column placeholder's expected shape. Note here that the `column_placeholder` is never fed, but instead we compare the reshaped values to the shape of `column_placeholder`. This approach illustrates that reshaping operations *within* the graph are crucial when dealing with input from other parts of the network which may not match expected placeholder formats. This is common when one might want to treat one layer’s output as a different input in subsequent layers.

In summary, there's no in-place alteration of a TensorFlow placeholder’s shape. You define a placeholder according to the expected format of your data. When converting a row placeholder to a column placeholder, the approach involves either transposing the tensor data after feeding a correctly shaped input to the original row-oriented placeholder, defining a new placeholder altogether and reshaped input before feeding, or, reshaping inside the graph to a shape compatible with what you need as an input.

For continued learning, I would recommend studying the TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.placeholder`, `tf.transpose`, and `tf.reshape` as well as exploring examples of recurrent neural network architectures, which often involve transitioning between row and column-major representations of input sequences. The TensorFlow tutorials on sequence processing offer excellent insight on the subtleties of shape manipulations in practice. Reading code examples of pre-existing models also enhances understanding of how shape transformations are achieved. Understanding broadcasting and the underlying linear algebra involved also contributes to solving such issues.
