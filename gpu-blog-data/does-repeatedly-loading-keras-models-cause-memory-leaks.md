Repeatedly loading Keras models can indeed lead to significant memory issues, particularly in environments with limited resources.  My experience optimizing deep learning pipelines for high-throughput inference systems highlighted this problem repeatedly.  While Keras itself doesn't inherently cause leaks in the strictest sense (like a dangling pointer), the manner in which models are loaded and subsequently managed directly impacts memory consumption.  The key issue stems from the model's underlying graph structure and the persistent allocation of associated weights and biases.  Unless explicitly released, these resources remain in memory even after the model object is ostensibly deleted.  This is further exacerbated by the use of backends like TensorFlow or Theano, which manage their own internal memory pools.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem arises from several interconnected factors. First, loading a Keras model involves deserializing its architecture and weights from disk. This process creates numerous Python objects representing layers, weights, biases, optimizers, and other model components.  While the `del` keyword in Python performs garbage collection, the timing of garbage collection is non-deterministic.  Crucially, the backend libraries, like TensorFlow, may maintain internal references to these objects, preventing their immediate release even after Python's garbage collector has marked them for deletion.  This effect is amplified when loading many models sequentially, as the cumulative memory footprint of the unused model instances steadily grows.

Second, if you are using a framework like TensorFlow under the hood, its session management plays a pivotal role.  TensorFlow maintains a graph and a session, both consuming significant resources.  If sessions are not properly closed after model loading, they linger, contributing to memory bloat.  Improper management of TensorFlow variables further compounds this. Variables are not automatically deallocated; they persist within the TensorFlow session until explicitly released.

Third, the size of the model itself greatly influences the memory implications. Larger models, with many layers and numerous parameters, inherently consume more memory.  The repeated loading of such models exacerbates memory exhaustion, particularly in environments where RAM is constrained.  Moreover, the data used for prediction further contributes to memory pressure, especially if not properly managed during the inference cycle.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Model Loading**

```python
import keras
import gc

for i in range(100):
    model = keras.models.load_model("my_model.h5")
    # ... perform inference ...
    del model # relying on garbage collection, inefficient
    gc.collect() # forcing garbage collection, not guaranteed to free resources

```

This example demonstrates a common, but flawed approach. While `del model` attempts to remove the model object, the underlying TensorFlow resources may remain allocated.  Forcing garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) improves the situation slightly but is still unreliable.  TensorFlow's internal resources persist until explicitly closed.

**Example 2: Improved Model Loading with Session Management (TensorFlow backend)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
import gc

for i in range(100):
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess: #creating a session within the loop
        tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.set_session(sess) #setting session for Keras
        model = keras.models.load_model("my_model.h5")
        # ... perform inference ...
        tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.clear_session() # Clearing the session after use
        sess.close() #Explicitly closing the session

    del model
    gc.collect() # still helpful to encourage garbage collection

```

This improved example utilizes TensorFlow's session management explicitly.  Each model is loaded within a session, and crucially, `tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.clear_session()` releases the TensorFlow resources associated with the loaded model. The session is explicitly closed (`sess.close()`), ensuring that all resources are properly freed. This is vital for preventing memory leaks.  Note:  The `tf.compat.v1` prefix is necessary for compatibility with TensorFlow 2.x.  Adjust accordingly based on your TensorFlow version.

**Example 3:  Model Loading with Custom Memory Management (Illustrative)**

```python
import keras
import gc
import os

model_path = "my_model.h5"

model = None # Initialize model variable

for i in range(100):
    if model:
        del model
        gc.collect()
        
    model = keras.models.load_model(model_path)
    # ... perform inference ...
    # ... optionally save intermediate results to disk to reduce in-memory data ...

    if os.path.exists("temp_model.h5"): # optional
        os.remove("temp_model.h5") # Cleaning up temporary file if exists

```

This example shows a strategy where only one model instance is held in memory at a time.  After inference, the model is explicitly deleted.  A crucial aspect not shown here, but essential for real-world applications, would involve saving intermediate results (predictions) to disk if memory is critical.  This prevents loading all inference data into memory at once. The optional cleanup of temporary files demonstrates additional methods for freeing resources.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Consult the official documentation for Keras and your chosen backend (TensorFlow, Theano, etc.) for detailed information on memory management best practices.
* Explore memory profiling tools to identify memory leaks and their sources within your application.
* Investigate the use of lighter-weight deep learning frameworks or model quantization techniques for memory optimization.
* Familiarize yourself with advanced Python garbage collection mechanisms and their limitations.
* Study techniques for efficient tensor manipulation and data handling to minimize memory footprint during inference.


In conclusion, while Keras itself doesn't directly cause memory leaks, improper handling of model loading and backend resources can lead to significant memory issues.  By implementing explicit session management (for TensorFlow-based Keras), carefully managing model lifecycles, and employing memory profiling tools, you can effectively mitigate the risk of memory leaks and build robust, memory-efficient deep learning applications.  The key takeaway is proactive resource management and awareness of both Python's and your backend's garbage collection mechanisms.  Ignoring these crucial aspects often leads to the very memory problems described in this response.
