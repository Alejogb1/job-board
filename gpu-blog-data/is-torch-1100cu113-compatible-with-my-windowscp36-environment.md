Torch 1.10.0+cu113, specifically, denotes a PyTorch build compiled with CUDA 11.3 support; this immediately narrows the compatibility scope. My experience building and debugging PyTorch environments for various hardware configurations suggests the provided specification presents a distinct compatibility challenge for a Windows/CP36 setup. CP36, in this context, likely refers to a Python 3.6 environment. Let's break down why compatibility is unlikely, followed by practical examples, and then suggest viable alternatives.

The primary obstacle to compatibility between `torch-1.10.0+cu113` and a Windows/CP36 environment arises from a combination of Python versioning and CUDA driver requirements. PyTorch, by design, is tightly bound to the CUDA toolkit and the underlying cuDNN library version available at compile time. A PyTorch build targeting CUDA 11.3 expects corresponding CUDA drivers to be installed, which are themselves tied to specific operating system versions, and indirectly to Python builds. Furthermore, Python 3.6, while commonly used in the past, is now an unsupported version of the language by the Python Software Foundation. This means that prebuilt binaries of `torch-1.10.0+cu113` will often not be compatible.

The Python 3.6 EOL (End of Life) impacts the availability of wheels (prebuilt binaries) for this particular combination on the official PyTorch repositories. Even if a community-maintained wheel was available for this combination, the likelihood of it functioning correctly is severely reduced, due to potential discrepancies with the compiler used to produce the package and the exact hardware and driver versions. Windows is also quite sensitive to driver compatibility, which introduces another potential error vector. The underlying CUDA support within the PyTorch wheel is tied to specific GPU architectures, which the user might not even have. In this case, even though the build is for CUDA 11.3, the GPU might not be compatible with this driver version, or have the necessary compute capability.

In practical terms, attempting to install `torch-1.10.0+cu113` in a CP36 environment on Windows would very likely produce a runtime error immediately after the import statement. PyTorch relies on several dynamic libraries provided by the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN. If the libraries are not available in the system path or there's a version mismatch between the expected libraries and the actual installed ones, the module will fail to load properly.

Here is an illustrative example of what might happen.

```python
# Example 1: Attempting to import torch with incompatible dependencies
try:
    import torch
    print("PyTorch imported successfully!")
    print(torch.__version__)

except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: Could not import torch. Details:\n{e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error during import: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates a common failure point. While the install step might appear to be successful, the import step typically throws an `ImportError` or `OSError`. The traceback would point to a failure to load one of the native PyTorch libraries, which indirectly points to the version mismatch.

Let’s assume I did, against all odds, get the install to complete without an import error, which sometimes does happen. I might try to perform a simple tensor operation, like so:

```python
# Example 2:  Attempting a basic tensor operation after an incompatible import
try:
  import torch

  x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
  y = x + 2
  print(y)

except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error during tensor operation: {e}")
```

This will usually lead to the program crashing outright, or throw an error related to device usage as it tries to access the GPU. If the correct drivers are not present, or if the versions do not match, PyTorch might not be able to access the CUDA devices correctly, leading to error messages originating deep in the CUDA API. This will manifest as a CUDA runtime error.

Finally, let’s look at the attempt to explicitly move a tensor to the GPU.

```python
# Example 3: Explicitly trying to move a tensor to GPU
try:
    import torch

    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device("cuda")
        print("CUDA device found!")
        x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]).to(device)
        print(x)

    else:
        print("CUDA device is not available.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered during device assignment: {e}")

```

In this scenario, either `torch.cuda.is_available()` would return `False` due to the driver or toolkit mismatch, or if it does return `True`, the subsequent `.to(device)` operation would most likely throw a CUDA-related runtime error. The root cause is the incompatibility between the compiled PyTorch binary and the underlying drivers.  This is a very common error when mixing CUDA and PyTorch versions.

Given these issues, forcing `torch-1.10.0+cu113` onto a Windows/CP36 setup is simply not feasible in a robust production system. The time spent debugging these conflicts is disproportionate to the benefits, and the end result is unreliable. Therefore, I strongly recommend upgrading the Python environment to a newer supported version such as 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11.

Based on my extensive experience, a better strategy involves aligning your Python version with the versions officially supported by PyTorch for your given hardware configuration. Instead of trying to retrofit old software, I suggest a clean start with updated tooling and libraries. Specifically:

1.  **Upgrade Python:** Move from CP36 to a newer, supported Python version. This involves creating a new virtual environment using `venv` or `conda` and installing a Python version that PyTorch provides wheels for.
2.  **Install Appropriate PyTorch Binary:** Visit the official PyTorch website and use the installation matrix to identify the correct binary for your CUDA toolkit version and Python environment. If the installed GPU requires a different CUDA version, update the NVIDIA drivers accordingly or use a CPU-only PyTorch build.
3. **Address GPU Driver Requirements**: Ensure that the installed NVIDIA drivers are compatible with the installed CUDA toolkit version. Use the documentation on NVIDIA's website to find the appropriate driver version.
4.  **Use a Virtual Environment**:  Isolate your project dependencies within a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`. This greatly reduces environment conflicts and facilitates reproducible builds.

For resources, I advise consulting the official PyTorch website documentation, which contains detailed guides and release notes for specific PyTorch versions. Additionally, the NVIDIA developer website provides comprehensive information on CUDA toolkit compatibility and driver version requirements. Third, using a reputable source on the internet, such as a blog or a tutorial, can provide additional information. Finally, the official documentation for Python packages related to machine learning and CUDA, such as Numpy, Scipy and Numba, can provide a deeper understanding of the dependencies of PyTorch. Using a combination of these, you will be able to quickly navigate any issues.
