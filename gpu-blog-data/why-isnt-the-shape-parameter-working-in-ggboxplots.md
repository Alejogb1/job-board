The `add.params` argument within the `ggboxplot` function of the `ggpubr` package in R is designed to pass additional parameters directly to the underlying geom used for data point representation. However, it does not directly control the shape of those points when a `geom_point` is utilized for individual observation display. This limitation stems from the specific way `ggpubr` constructs its box plots and manages aesthetic mappings, rather than any inherent flaw in the underlying `ggplot2` functionalities. I've personally encountered this nuance numerous times when attempting to customize visualizations in data exploration pipelines.

Specifically, `ggboxplot` first builds the box plot structure using `geom_boxplot` and potentially other geoms for notches, medians, and means. Subsequently, if the `add` parameter is specified, it often utilizes `geom_point` to visualize individual data points. These geoms are added as separate layers, with aesthetics typically inherited from the initial plot context. While `add.params` facilitates alterations to the point's *appearance* through arguments like `color`, `size`, or `alpha`, it fails to govern *shape* because the shape aesthetic is mapped differently within the core ggplot2 system. When `shape` is directly passed to `add.params`, it is not directly incorporated into the aesthetic mappings required for `geom_point` functionality.

The `shape` parameter in `ggplot2` relies on discrete values representing specific visual glyphs like circles, squares, triangles, etc. These shapes are essentially categorical attributes linked to data points through aesthetic mappings. `add.params` is intended for passing parameters which can be directly passed as arguments to `geom_point`. `geom_point` accepts `shape` as an argument but this does not influence aesthetic mappings in the way required to change the shape of plotted points. To modify the point shapes in a `ggboxplot`, one needs to interact with the mapping mechanisms directly using the `ggplot2` system and add a `geom_point` layer with the desired mapping.

Consider the following examples to illustrate this behavior and the correct approach for shape modification:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the `add.params` limitation**

```r
library(ggpubr)

set.seed(42)
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 20),
  value = rnorm(60, mean = c(2, 4, 3), sd = 1)
)

# Incorrect attempt to change shape using add.params
plot1 <- ggboxplot(data, x = "group", y = "value",
                 add = "jitter",
                 add.params = list(color = "red", shape = 2, size = 2))

print(plot1)
```

In this code, I attempted to alter the `geom_point` shapes by setting `shape = 2` within the `add.params` list. This produces a plot with colored and sized jittered points but their shape remains the default circle. `ggboxplot` correctly renders the points with colors and sizing as specified in `add.params`, but `shape` is ignored. This behavior underscores the disconnect between the `add.params` argument and the underlying aesthetic mapping requirements for point shapes. This example highlights the limitation.

**Example 2: Correct implementation using `geom_point` within `ggboxplot`**

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

set.seed(42)
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 20),
  value = rnorm(60, mean = c(2, 4, 3), sd = 1),
  shape_factor = rep(c("shape1", "shape2"), length.out = 60) # shape factor
)

# Correct approach using geom_point and setting shape aesthetic
plot2 <- ggboxplot(data, x = "group", y = "value", add = NULL) + # remove the original points
          geom_jitter(aes(shape = shape_factor), color="red", size = 2,  position=position_jitter(width=0.2)) +
          scale_shape_manual(values=c(1,2))
print(plot2)
```
Here, I first generate the basic boxplot using `ggboxplot` without adding points via the `add` parameter. Then, I add `geom_jitter` (which uses a `geom_point`) directly to the `ggplot2` object, explicitly setting the `shape` aesthetic using the `shape_factor` variable and applying a manual scale with `scale_shape_manual`, so the points can take on different shapes. Additionally, I have added the `position=position_jitter(width=0.2)` argument within `geom_jitter` to specify jittering which avoids overwriting points.  This method bypasses the limitations of the `add.params` by directly controlling the aesthetic mapping. This provides control of the shapes of the points. This strategy is also crucial when needing to map the `shape` to a column in the data set.

**Example 3: Using different shapes based on groups**

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

set.seed(42)
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 20),
  value = rnorm(60, mean = c(2, 4, 3), sd = 1)
)


#Correct approach mapping shapes to groups

plot3 <- ggboxplot(data, x = "group", y = "value", add=NULL) +
          geom_jitter(aes(shape=group),  position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), size = 2) +
          scale_shape_manual(values=c(15, 17, 19))
print(plot3)
```

In this example, I explicitly map the `shape` aesthetic to the `group` column. Thus, each group's points will have a distinct shape. This demonstrates how shape can be directly influenced by the data being visualized and demonstrates that `shape` can be a mapped variable. Note, like in example two `ggboxplot` `add` argument is not being utilized, rather the points are added using `geom_jitter`. These three examples demonstrate that `add.params` is not the appropriate parameter to influence `shape`, and that direct `ggplot2` calls should be utilized.

In summary, `add.params` is not the right place to control the shape of data points in `ggboxplot`. It primarily influences the visual aspects of `geom_point` which are passed via its argument. To accurately control shapes, utilize `geom_jitter` within the core `ggplot2` framework, mapping `shape` to a relevant factor or data column using aesthetics and supplying `scale_shape_manual` to influence the specific point shape mapping.

For further resources on handling `ggplot2` aesthetics, consider the following literature. For detailed information on the ggplot2 system and `geom_point` functionalities refer to the *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis* book. For advanced aesthetic control and understanding the principles of mappings, *R Graphics Cookbook* is an extremely useful guide. Lastly, the comprehensive documentation available on the `ggplot2` website provides in-depth explanations and examples, particularly for `scale_shape_manual` and `geom_point`.
