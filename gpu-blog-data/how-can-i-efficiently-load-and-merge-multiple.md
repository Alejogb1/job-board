Managing large datasets from multiple text files requires careful consideration of memory usage, especially when dealing with potentially gigabyte-sized archives. Loading every file into memory simultaneously can quickly overwhelm system resources. Instead, processing files iteratively and utilizing generator expressions offers a practical solution. I've faced this precise challenge multiple times when working with log analysis pipelines, and I’ve refined a memory-efficient method that combines streaming input with Python’s built-in file handling.

The core principle is to avoid loading entire files into memory at once. Instead, we read each file line-by-line, process the line, and discard it before moving on to the next. This sequential approach, combined with the use of generator expressions, prevents large in-memory data structures from forming. It allows us to perform a merging operation without accumulating significant overhead. The process involves three main steps: First, we generate an iterator of file paths. Second, we develop a function to read a file and yield each line. Finally, we combine the files using the iterator to produce a single, combined data stream. This allows the entire merging and any further processing to proceed iteratively.

Let's illustrate this with three code examples, starting with a basic implementation. Assume we have a directory containing text files we want to merge.

```python
import os

def file_line_generator(filepath):
    """Yields lines from a file."""
    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

def merge_files_basic(directory):
    """Merges files from the given directory using basic method."""
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath) and filename.endswith('.txt'):
            for line in file_line_generator(filepath):
               print(line) # Process/merge operation. Could be writing to file, etc.

# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
  example_directory = "example_files" # Assume it exists with text files.
  os.makedirs(example_directory, exist_ok=True)

  with open(os.path.join(example_directory, 'file1.txt'), 'w') as f:
      f.write("Line 1 from file 1\nLine 2 from file 1")
  with open(os.path.join(example_directory, 'file2.txt'), 'w') as f:
      f.write("Line 1 from file 2\nLine 2 from file 2")
  merge_files_basic(example_directory)
```

In this `merge_files_basic` implementation, I iterate through the provided directory, and for each .txt file, I call the `file_line_generator` function. `file_line_generator` yields a single line from the file each time it's called. I'm using it in conjunction with `for line in file_line_generator()` inside `merge_files_basic`. This inner loop iterates through each line from the generator, effectively processing one line at a time without keeping the entire file in memory. The `line.strip()` part is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted lines. The example usage initializes a sample `example_files` directory and populates two sample text files for the code to use. The current `print(line)` is merely demonstrative; in a real-world scenario, I would be writing those lines to a new file or perform a transformation before writing them.

For better scalability and code readability, we can refactor the merging logic to use Python's `itertools` module, specifically `chain`. This removes the nested for loop and keeps the same memory efficiency.

```python
import os
from itertools import chain

def file_paths_generator(directory):
   """Yields file paths for text files in a directory."""
   for filename in os.listdir(directory):
      filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
      if os.path.isfile(filepath) and filename.endswith('.txt'):
         yield filepath

def merge_files_chain(directory):
   """Merges files from a directory using itertools.chain."""
   file_paths = file_paths_generator(directory)
   merged_lines = chain.from_iterable(file_line_generator(path) for path in file_paths)
   for line in merged_lines:
      print(line)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
  example_directory = "example_files" # Assume it exists with text files.
  os.makedirs(example_directory, exist_ok=True)

  with open(os.path.join(example_directory, 'file1.txt'), 'w') as f:
      f.write("Line 1 from file 1\nLine 2 from file 1")
  with open(os.path.join(example_directory, 'file2.txt'), 'w') as f:
      f.write("Line 1 from file 2\nLine 2 from file 2")
  merge_files_chain(example_directory)
```

Here, `file_paths_generator` generates filepaths one by one, which are then passed to the generator expression `(file_line_generator(path) for path in file_paths)`. This generator produces a series of file line iterators. The `chain.from_iterable` flattens this sequence of iterators into a single iterator, which yields all lines from all the files in a sequential manner. The advantage is increased clarity – it avoids the nested loop and makes the data flow obvious. The `merge_files_chain` function iterates through the combined output, one line at a time. The structure of the example usage remains the same as the first example and populates sample files as needed.

Finally, let’s assume that the process involves more complex parsing and needs to handle potential errors when dealing with real-world data. We can incorporate error handling and custom parsing logic while maintaining memory efficiency.

```python
import os
from itertools import chain

def parse_line(line):
    """Parses a line. Can be replaced with any custom logic."""
    try:
      # Placeholder for parsing operations.
        if not line: return None #Handle empty lines.
        parts = line.split(',') #Example split
        #Return parsed data, not just line.
        return tuple(x.strip() for x in parts)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing line: {line}. Error: {e}")
        return None

def file_line_parser_generator(filepath):
   """Parses lines from a file, ignoring errors."""
   with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
       for line in file:
         parsed_line = parse_line(line.strip())
         if parsed_line:
             yield parsed_line

def merge_files_parsed(directory):
    """Merges and parses files in directory."""
    file_paths = file_paths_generator(directory)
    merged_data = chain.from_iterable(file_line_parser_generator(path) for path in file_paths)
    for data_item in merged_data:
        print(data_item)  # Handle parsed data

# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
  example_directory = "example_files" # Assume it exists with text files.
  os.makedirs(example_directory, exist_ok=True)

  with open(os.path.join(example_directory, 'file1.txt'), 'w') as f:
      f.write("Line 1, data1\nLine 2, data2")
  with open(os.path.join(example_directory, 'file2.txt'), 'w') as f:
     f.write("Line 3, data3, extra_data\nLine 4,data4")
  merge_files_parsed(example_directory)
```

In this enhanced version, `parse_line` now has some basic parsing logic (splitting the line by commas), error handling for `ValueError` exceptions that might occur during the parsing, and a way to handle empty lines. `file_line_parser_generator` now utilizes the new `parse_line` function and yields the parsed result, filtering out any `None` values that result from unparseable lines. This makes `merge_files_parsed` able to handle files with some inconsistencies while still not loading entire files to memory. The example usage again establishes our familiar sample files and populates them with comma-separated data, one line of which will be problematic for demonstrating parsing errors. This version allows you to extend the parsing function to whatever is appropriate for your dataset.

For further development on data handling, consult resources focused on Python’s file I/O operations, the `itertools` module, and data streaming. Books discussing Python’s standard library and those covering efficient data manipulation can offer deeper insight. Also, researching design patterns related to data processing pipelines can be beneficial. Specifically, explore resources that detail the iterator pattern and its applications in data science contexts. Understanding these core concepts, along with the practical examples above, will allow efficient processing of large text data.
