Directly addressing the challenge of parallelizing a GPU function 100 times using multiprocessing reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the inherent capabilities of these two distinct parallel computing paradigms.  Multiprocessing, by definition, leverages multiple CPU cores.  GPU functions, conversely, operate within the parallel architecture of a Graphics Processing Unit, utilizing thousands of smaller, specialized cores.  Attempting to use multiprocessing to manage 100 instances of a GPU function is inefficient and fundamentally misdirected.  The optimal approach lies in harnessing the GPU's inherent parallelism directly, and only employing multiprocessing under specific circumstances, which I'll detail.

My experience developing high-performance computing applications for geophysical simulations has highlighted this distinction repeatedly.  Early attempts to parallelize GPU-bound tasks using multiprocessing led to significant performance bottlenecks.  The overhead of inter-process communication, coupled with the inherent limitations of CPU-bound multiprocessing, far outweighed any potential benefits. This underscores the need for a refined approach tailored to GPU computations.

The efficient solution hinges on the chosen GPU programming model.  CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and OpenCL (Open Computing Language) are prevalent frameworks, each providing mechanisms for maximizing parallel processing on the GPU.  Multiprocessing might have a role, but not in directly managing 100 GPU function invocations. Its utility lies primarily in orchestrating pre-processing or post-processing steps, or in handling multiple, independent GPU computations.

Let's explore three scenarios, illustrating the appropriate use of multiprocessing in conjunction with GPU parallelization.  These examples assume familiarity with CUDA and a CUDA-capable device.  Analogous examples can be constructed for OpenCL.


**Example 1: Multiprocessing for Data Preparation**

Consider a scenario where a large dataset needs to be pre-processed before being fed into a GPU function.  Multiprocessing can effectively parallelize this pre-processing stage.


```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp # Assume cupy is installed for CUDA support

def preprocess_data(data_chunk):
    """Performs some pre-processing on a chunk of data."""
    # Example pre-processing:  Apply a filter, normalize, etc.
    return np.mean(data_chunk)

def gpu_function(data):
    """Performs the GPU computation."""
    with cp.cuda.Device(0):  #Explicit device selection
        data_gpu = cp.asarray(data)
        result = cp.sum(data_gpu)  #Example GPU computation
        return cp.asnumpy(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = np.random.rand(1000000)  #Large dataset
    chunk_size = len(data) // 8  # Divide into 8 chunks

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=8) as pool:
        preprocessed_chunks = pool.map(preprocess_data, np.array_split(data, 8))

    final_data = np.concatenate(preprocessed_chunks)
    final_result = gpu_function(final_data)
    print(f"GPU computation result: {final_result}")
```


This example divides the data into eight chunks and utilizes an eight-process pool to parallelize pre-processing using `multiprocessing.Pool`. The `preprocess_data` function performs data manipulation on each chunk independently.  The processed data is then concatenated and passed to the GPU function (`gpu_function`), which uses CuPy (a NumPy-compatible array library for CUDA) for efficient GPU computation.  The core GPU computation remains single-threaded on the GPU, but the preparatory step is significantly accelerated.


**Example 2: Multiprocessing for Independent GPU Tasks**

Suppose we have 100 independent datasets, each requiring separate GPU processing. Multiprocessing can manage the launching of individual GPU jobs.


```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp

def gpu_task(data):
    with cp.cuda.Device(0):
        data_gpu = cp.asarray(data)
        result = cp.sum(data_gpu**2) #Example GPU task
        return cp.asnumpy(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    datasets = [np.random.rand(10000) for _ in range(100)] #100 datasets

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=100) as pool:  # adjust based on available cores
        results = pool.map(gpu_task, datasets)

    print(f"GPU task results: {results}")
```

Here, multiprocessing is utilized to launch 100 separate GPU tasks concurrently.  Each task processes a unique dataset.  The number of processes in the pool should reflect the available CPU cores to avoid excessive context switching overhead. The key is that each GPU task is independent, allowing for true parallel execution across multiple CPU cores each managing a GPU call.  The efficiency, however, is limited by the number of CPU cores and data transfer time.



**Example 3: Multiprocessing for Advanced Scenarios (Iterative Refinement)**

In more sophisticated applications involving iterative algorithms or requiring data exchange between GPU processes, a more intricate approach involving inter-process communication might be necessary. However, this is more complex and typically involves specialized libraries like MPI (Message Passing Interface) to manage data transfer between processes.  This level of complexity is beyond the scope of simple GPU function parallelization.  An example might involve using multiprocessing to coordinate iterations of a GPU-accelerated solver, where each iteration's output influences the subsequent iteration.

```python
# A simplified conceptual outline (details omitted for brevity)
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np

def gpu_iteration(data, iteration_num):
    # Simulate GPU-bound iteration (complex details omitted)
    result = np.mean(data) + iteration_num
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = np.random.rand(1000)
    num_iterations = 5
    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
    shared_data = manager.list([data])

    processes = []
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=gpu_iteration, args=(shared_data[0], i))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    #Note this is a simplification - actual communication would be significantly more involved

```

This illustrative example hints at more advanced parallelization strategies using shared memory.  Proper implementation would require careful management of data synchronization and race conditions.


**Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA programming guide; OpenCL programming guide;  A textbook on parallel computing;  Documentation for your specific GPU architecture;  NumPy and CuPy documentation;  MPI documentation.


In conclusion, directly parallelizing a single GPU function 100 times using multiprocessing is inefficient.  Leveraging the GPU's inherent parallelism directly is paramount.  Multiprocessing should be strategically employed for pre-processing, post-processing, managing multiple independent GPU tasks, or coordinating advanced algorithms that require inter-process communication, not for directly controlling the execution of a GPU function multiple times within the GPU's context. The choice of approach hinges on the application's specific requirements and the chosen GPU programming model.
