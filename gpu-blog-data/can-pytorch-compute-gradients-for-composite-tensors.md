PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism, while powerful, doesn't directly support gradient computation for arbitrary composite tensors in the way one might intuitively expect.  My experience working on large-scale physics simulations heavily reliant on custom tensor structures revealed this limitation. The core issue stems from the underlying computational graph PyTorch constructs:  it tracks operations on individual tensors, not composite structures defined by the user.  Therefore, while you can perform computations *with* composite tensors, obtaining gradients requires careful restructuring to leverage PyTorch's autograd capabilities.


**1.  Understanding the Limitation**

PyTorch's `autograd` system works by creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sequence of operations performed on tensors.  Each tensor with `requires_grad=True` is a node in this graph, and each operation is an edge.  Backpropagation efficiently computes gradients by traversing this graph.  However, if your "composite tensor" is simply a Python object containing several tensors, it's not directly integrated into this graph.  PyTorch doesn't automatically recognize the relationships between the constituent tensors within your custom structure.  To compute gradients, you must explicitly define these relationships using PyTorch operations.


**2. Strategies for Gradient Computation with Composite Structures**

The key is to unpack the composite tensor into individual tensors subject to PyTorch's autograd, perform the necessary operations on those tensors, and then recombine the results (if needed). This often involves creating a custom function that takes the constituent tensors as input and returns a scalar loss function whose gradient can be computed.


**3. Code Examples and Commentary**


**Example 1:  Simple Composite Tensor with Explicit Unpacking**

Let's consider a simple scenario where our composite tensor is a named tuple containing two tensors:

```python
import torch
from collections import namedtuple

CompositeTensor = namedtuple('CompositeTensor', ['tensor1', 'tensor2'])

# Create tensors requiring gradients
t1 = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
t2 = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)

# Create the composite tensor
comp_tensor = CompositeTensor(tensor1=t1, tensor2=t2)

# Define a function that takes individual tensors as input and produces a scalar loss
def compute_loss(x, y):
    return torch.sum((x + y)**2)

# Unpack the composite tensor and compute the loss
loss = compute_loss(comp_tensor.tensor1, comp_tensor.tensor2)

# Compute gradients
loss.backward()

# Access gradients
print(comp_tensor.tensor1.grad)
print(comp_tensor.tensor2.grad)
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental approach: explicitly unpack the composite structure and feed the individual tensors into a function that's differentiable within PyTorch.


**Example 2:  Composite Tensor with a Custom Class and `__call__` method**

For more complex scenarios, a custom class encapsulating the composite tensor and defining a `__call__` method for computation can enhance organization and readability.


```python
import torch

class MyCompositeTensor:
    def __init__(self, tensor1, tensor2):
        self.tensor1 = tensor1
        self.tensor2 = tensor2
        self.requires_grad = tensor1.requires_grad and tensor2.requires_grad

    def __call__(self, other_tensor):
        if not self.requires_grad:
            raise RuntimeError("Gradients cannot be computed; requires_grad=False on constituent tensors.")

        result = torch.matmul(self.tensor1, other_tensor) + self.tensor2
        return torch.sum(result)


# Create tensors requiring gradients
t1 = torch.randn(3, 3, requires_grad=True)
t2 = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)

# Create the composite tensor
comp_tensor = MyCompositeTensor(t1, t2)

# Another tensor
x = torch.randn(3, 1, requires_grad=True)

# Compute loss
loss = comp_tensor(x)

# Compute gradients
loss.backward()

# Access gradients
print(t1.grad)
print(t2.grad)
print(x.grad)

```

This approach bundles the computation directly into the class, promoting code modularity.  Note the crucial check for `requires_grad` in `__call__` to handle potential errors.


**Example 3:  Handling Nested Structures with Recursion (Advanced)**

For arbitrarily nested structures, a recursive approach might be necessary.  This would involve traversing the structure, processing individual tensors, and recursively accumulating the gradients. This example is omitted due to space constraints and its complexity; however,  the fundamental principles remain the same:  decompose the structure to tensors PyTorch understands and ensure all operations are differentiable.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

The official PyTorch documentation's sections on `autograd` and tensor operations are crucial.  Exploring examples and tutorials demonstrating custom autograd functions would be beneficial.  Additionally, a solid understanding of computational graphs and backpropagation is essential for tackling these advanced scenarios.  Understanding the implications of `requires_grad` and its impact on the computation graph is also critical.  Finally, familiarity with vectorization and efficient tensor operations will improve performance significantly in computationally intensive applications involving custom tensor structures.
