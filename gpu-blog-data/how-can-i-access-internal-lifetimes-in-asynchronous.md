The crux of the issue lies in the inherent limitations of `FnOnce` when dealing with asynchronous operations and the need to manage borrowing within potentially long-lived asynchronous contexts.  `FnOnce`'s single execution characteristic prevents reuse, which is problematic when asynchronous tasks might need to access and modify internal state across multiple stages of their execution.  My experience debugging high-performance network services, particularly those involving concurrent data processing and stateful operations, highlighted this limitation acutely. The solution involves careful consideration of ownership and lifetime management, often leveraging techniques beyond simple closures.

**1. Clarification: The Problem with `FnOnce` in Asynchronous Contexts**

The problem arises when an asynchronous operation needs to access and mutate internal data that's owned by a struct or other data structure.  If we attempt to pass this data directly into a closure using `FnOnce`, the closure consumes the data during its single execution. Subsequent attempts to access or modify that data within the same asynchronous task, or even across different stages of that task's execution (e.g., after an `await`), result in compile-time errors due to lifetime violations.  This is because the asynchronous runtime might suspend execution before the closure completes, leaving the data inaccessible or in an inconsistent state.  The compiler's lifetime analysis fails to guarantee safe access given the uncertainty of asynchronous execution flow.

**2. Solutions: Architecting for Asynchronous Lifetime Management**

The primary solution is to avoid `FnOnce` and adopt an architecture that allows for multiple accesses to the internal data. This involves carefully managing ownership and borrowing patterns. I've found three primary approaches effective:

* **a) Using `Arc<Mutex<T>>`:**  This approach leverages atomic reference counting (`Arc`) and mutual exclusion (`Mutex`) to allow safe concurrent access to shared data across multiple asynchronous tasks or stages within a single task.  The `Arc` ensures the data remains alive as long as any task holds a reference, and the `Mutex` prevents data races.

* **b) Employing Channels (`mpsc::channel`) for Inter-Task Communication:**  Instead of directly passing mutable data, communicate updates and requests using channels.  This decouples the tasks, improving performance and simplifying lifetime management.  Each task maintains its own state, and communication occurs through messages passed via channels.

* **c)  Implementing a State Machine Pattern:** For more complex scenarios, a state machine can carefully manage the access and mutation of internal data based on the current state of the asynchronous operation. This requires a more sophisticated design but allows for more fine-grained control over the data's lifetime and access.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for Shared Mutable State**

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use tokio::task;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyData {
    value: i32,
}

async fn async_operation(data: Arc<Mutex<MyData>>) {
    let mut locked_data = data.lock().await.unwrap();
    locked_data.value += 10;
    println!("Value incremented: {:?}", locked_data);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let shared_data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(MyData { value: 5 }));

    let task1 = task::spawn(async_operation(shared_data.clone()));
    let task2 = task::spawn(async_operation(shared_data.clone()));

    task1.await.unwrap();
    task2.await.unwrap();
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates how `Arc<Mutex<MyData>>` allows multiple asynchronous tasks (`task1`, `task2`) to safely access and modify the same `MyData` instance.  The `Arc` ensures shared ownership, and the `Mutex` prevents race conditions.  Each task acquires a lock before accessing the data, ensuring atomicity.  Note that cloning `shared_data` using `clone()` efficiently creates a new `Arc` pointing to the same data without duplicating the underlying data.

**Example 2: Using Channels for Inter-Task Communication**

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

async fn producer(tx: mpsc::Sender<i32>) {
    for i in 1..=5 {
        tx.send(i).await.unwrap();
    }
}

async fn consumer(mut rx: mpsc::Receiver<i32>) {
    while let Some(val) = rx.recv().await {
        println!("Received: {}", val);
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(32); // Buffered channel for improved performance

    let producer_task = tokio::spawn(producer(tx));
    let consumer_task = tokio::spawn(consumer(rx));

    producer_task.await.unwrap();
    consumer_task.await.unwrap();
}

```

**Commentary:** This showcases the use of channels to handle communication between the `producer` and `consumer` tasks.  Data is sent and received asynchronously without directly sharing mutable state.  This eliminates the lifetime issues associated with directly sharing mutable data between asynchronous tasks. The buffer size (32) helps prevent blocking in case the producer is faster than the consumer.


**Example 3: State Machine Pattern for Complex Asynchronous Flow**

```rust
use tokio::sync::oneshot;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum State {
    Idle,
    Processing(oneshot::Sender<i32>),
    Completed,
}

struct AsyncStateMachine {
    state: State,
    data: i32,
}

impl AsyncStateMachine {
    async fn process(&mut self) {
        match &mut self.state {
            State::Idle => {
                let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
                self.state = State::Processing(tx);
                // Simulate long asynchronous operation
                tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
                self.data += 10;
                self.state = State::Completed;
                let _ = tx.send(self.data);
            }
            State::Processing(_) => {
                 println!("Already processing!");
            }
            State::Completed => {
                println!("Operation completed");
            }
        }
    }
}


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut state_machine = AsyncStateMachine { state: State::Idle, data: 5 };
    state_machine.process().await;
    match state_machine.state {
        State::Completed => {
            println!("Final data: {}", state_machine.data);
        }
        _ => unreachable!(),
    }

}

```

**Commentary:**  This example employs a state machine to manage the lifecycle of an asynchronous operation.  The `state` variable controls the flow, preventing concurrent access to internal data (`data`).  The use of a `oneshot` channel allows for communication of the result after the asynchronous operation completes.  This pattern is scalable for more complex operations with multiple states and transitions.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

"The Rust Programming Language" (the book), "Rust by Example," and documentation for the `tokio` crate are invaluable resources for understanding asynchronous programming in Rust and mastering lifetime management in these contexts.  Additionally, exploring advanced topics like futures and streams within the tokio ecosystem is recommended for building robust and performant asynchronous systems.  Thorough comprehension of ownership and borrowing rules in Rust is paramount.
