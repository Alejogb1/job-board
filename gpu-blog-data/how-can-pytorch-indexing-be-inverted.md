Inverting PyTorch indexing, or more precisely, determining the original indices that were used to select a subset of a tensor, is not a built-in operation. Unlike mathematical inverses, indexing operations often lead to information loss, making a true inverse generally impossible. However, depending on the *type* of indexing used, we can frequently reconstruct the original index structure, or at least identify the positions in the original tensor from which the indexed values were taken. This is a crucial skill in debugging complex tensor manipulations and understanding the lineage of data within neural networks. I've personally encountered this challenge frequently while working on custom object detection models, where understanding how regions of interest are extracted was paramount.

The key to "inverting" indexing lies in understanding the specific indexing mechanism used: basic indexing, advanced indexing, or a combination thereof.  Basic indexing uses slices or single integer indices, and the relationship between the input and output shape is straightforward. Advanced indexing, on the other hand, utilizes tensors of integers to specify which elements are selected, and thus it is more complex to analyze.  The most common type of "inversion" we would aim for isn't a true inverse in the mathematical sense; rather, it's the recovery of the indices that were used to access the original tensor.

Let’s consider three practical cases: basic indexing, advanced indexing with one tensor, and advanced indexing with multiple tensors.

**Case 1: Basic Indexing with Slices**

Basic indexing involves slicing, which we can often reverse quite directly. For example, consider the following code:

```python
import torch

original_tensor = torch.arange(20).reshape(4, 5)
indexed_tensor = original_tensor[1:3, 2:4]

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Indexed Tensor:\n", indexed_tensor)
```

Here, `indexed_tensor` is a 2x2 sub-matrix extracted from `original_tensor`.  The slicing indices `1:3` and `2:4` directly represent the row and column boundaries of the extracted portion of the original tensor.  The information about the original positions is inherently preserved within the indexing operation. To "invert" this, we know the slice `1:3` for rows and `2:4` for columns were used. This is not a complex inverse but a reconstruction of the information embedded in the indexing operation. To retrieve the original tensor elements, one might need to reconstruct the full tensor with the knowledge of the slices, or potentially utilize this information in a reverse operation. However, since we know the original slices, the mapping is straightforward, and we do not need complex inversion logic, we know that `indexed_tensor[0,0]` comes from `original_tensor[1,2]` and so on.

**Case 2: Advanced Indexing with One Tensor**

Advanced indexing with a single tensor of indices presents a slightly more involved challenge. Consider this example:

```python
import torch

original_tensor = torch.arange(20).reshape(4, 5)
index_tensor = torch.tensor([0, 3, 1])
indexed_tensor = original_tensor[index_tensor, :]

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Indexed Tensor:\n", indexed_tensor)
```

Here, we've used `index_tensor` to pick specific rows from `original_tensor`.  The resulting `indexed_tensor` will have rows from row indices `0`, `3`, and `1` from the original tensor.  The tensor `index_tensor` is the key to reconstructing where the `indexed_tensor` elements came from in the original tensor. In other words, to know that `indexed_tensor[0]` comes from `original_tensor[0]` (with all columns),  `indexed_tensor[1]` corresponds to `original_tensor[3]` and `indexed_tensor[2]` comes from `original_tensor[1]`. We can directly access the indexing tensor `index_tensor` to retrieve the original index locations. The column indices remain unmodified, they simply represent all columns in each picked row, so that dimension is trivial. Again, there is no complex inversion logic. Instead, the `index_tensor` used for advanced indexing is the inverse information we need to understand the original elements that were picked from `original_tensor` during the operation.

**Case 3: Advanced Indexing with Multiple Tensors**

Advanced indexing with multiple tensors introduces the most complex scenario. Consider this example:

```python
import torch

original_tensor = torch.arange(20).reshape(4, 5)
row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
col_indices = torch.tensor([2, 1, 3])
indexed_tensor = original_tensor[row_indices, col_indices]

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Indexed Tensor:\n", indexed_tensor)
```

Here, `row_indices` and `col_indices` independently specify the row and column indices for the selection. The result `indexed_tensor` is a 1D tensor with elements that correspond to accessing the values `original_tensor[0,2]`, `original_tensor[1,1]` and `original_tensor[2,3]`.  In this case, the indices are not sequential, or a continuous block, but rather based on the element-wise mapping of the two index tensors.

To "invert" this, we need the original row and column index tensors. We can then directly reconstruct the locations by accessing the `row_indices[i]` and `col_indices[i]`. In this case, the information is fully captured by the input index tensors. We can determine from where each element in `indexed_tensor` originated in the original tensor. Knowing that `indexed_tensor[0]` corresponds to `original_tensor[row_indices[0], col_indices[0]]`, which translates to `original_tensor[0,2]` and so on allows one to determine the original locations of the elements of the `indexed_tensor`. Again, there is no complex inversion logic but rather a reconstruction of what we knew in the index tensors themselves.

It’s important to note that this type of "inversion" becomes significantly more difficult if the indexing tensors are computed dynamically or involve operations that destroy original location information.  For example, operations like `torch.unique()` will change indexing relationships and it becomes increasingly difficult to map backward the elements in those cases.  Similarly, if a mask is used for indexing, one needs to examine the mask itself.

**Recommendations for Further Study:**

To deepen your understanding of this subject, I recommend focusing on the following resources. Look for literature explaining the detailed operation of tensor indexing in PyTorch's backend.  Understanding how PyTorch internally executes different indexing types greatly aids in reasoning about these operations. Additionally, exploring materials covering advanced tensor manipulation techniques in PyTorch, particularly how `torch.gather` and `torch.scatter` work, is useful since they often provide ways to perform indexing-like operations in a reversible manner. Study how these operations can be reversed, which, while not a direct inversion of general indexing, can shed light on the overall problem. Finally, I would recommend a deep dive into how broadcasting works within PyTorch, as broadcasting heavily interacts with the different indexing types.  A clear understanding of these underlying mechanisms provides the necessary foundation for tackling complex scenarios involving tensor manipulations.
