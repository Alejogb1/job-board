The primary reason a TensorFlow model executes solely on the CPU, despite the presence of a compatible GPU, often boils down to a mismatch between TensorFlow's configuration and the system's hardware setup.  This mismatch can stem from several factors, ranging from incorrect environment variables to missing CUDA drivers or improperly installed TensorFlow packages.  My experience troubleshooting this issue over the years—particularly during the development of a large-scale image recognition system for a medical imaging client—highlights the importance of meticulously verifying each component in the TensorFlow ecosystem.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow leverages a flexible architecture to support different hardware backends, including CPUs and GPUs.  However, it doesn't automatically detect and utilize GPUs.  Explicit configuration is required to direct TensorFlow to allocate resources and execute computations on the GPU. This involves several steps, which frequently cause problems if even one is missed.  First, a compatible CUDA toolkit must be installed, alongside the corresponding cuDNN library. These provide the low-level interface between TensorFlow and the NVIDIA GPU hardware.  Then, TensorFlow needs to be installed correctly with GPU support enabled; this generally means installing a specific wheel file designed for your CUDA version.  Finally, during the model execution, TensorFlow must be instructed to utilize the GPU; this typically involves setting environment variables or using programmatic methods within the Python code.  Failing to correctly configure any of these elements results in the model running exclusively on the CPU, even if a powerful GPU is available.

Moreover, GPU memory limitations can inadvertently cause TensorFlow to default to CPU execution.  If the model's computational graph exceeds the available GPU memory, TensorFlow might choose to execute the entire process on the CPU to avoid out-of-memory errors.  Similarly, improperly configured batch sizes in data loading can indirectly lead to CPU-only execution.  Excessively large batches might exceed the GPU's memory capacity, forcing the model back onto the CPU.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate various approaches to ensuring GPU utilization within TensorFlow.  These examples were refined based on lessons learned during the deployment of the aforementioned medical imaging system, where optimal performance was crucial for processing large datasets.

**Example 1: Environment Variable Configuration:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Set environment variable to force GPU usage
# Note:  This method's effectiveness depends on the TensorFlow installation and CUDA setup.
# It might be superseded by programmatic configuration in some cases.
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'  # Use GPU 0; change the index as needed

# Verify GPU usage after environment variable setting
print("Num GPUs Available after setting environment variable: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# ... rest of your TensorFlow code ...
```

This code snippet first checks if any GPUs are detected. It then attempts to force TensorFlow to utilize the GPU indexed as 0 by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. A subsequent check verifies that the GPU has been successfully selected.  It's crucial to note that this approach isn't universally effective and might be overridden by programmatic configurations.  In my experience, relying solely on environment variables proved unreliable, particularly across different server environments.

**Example 2: Programmatic Device Placement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# List available devices
print("Available devices:", tf.config.list_logical_devices())

# Create a strategy for GPU usage (if available)
try:
    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpus:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True) # Allow dynamic memory growth
        strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(gpus)
    else:
        strategy = tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy("CPU")  # Fallback to CPU
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)
    strategy = tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy("CPU")

# Utilize the strategy within your model training loop
with strategy.scope():
    # ... Define your model, optimizer, and training loop here ...
```

This example provides a more robust approach. It dynamically determines available devices and creates a distribution strategy tailored to the system's hardware.  This approach handles scenarios where no GPU is present gracefully, defaulting to CPU execution. The `set_memory_growth` function allows the GPU to dynamically allocate memory as needed, mitigating out-of-memory issues.  This is a crucial aspect I learned through trial-and-error during the development of my medical imaging system, which often involved large training datasets that challenged available GPU memory.

**Example 3:  TensorFlow's `tf.device` Context Manager:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Check for GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

with tf.device('/GPU:0'): #Specify GPU device explicitly
    # ... Place specific operations on the GPU ...
    a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print("Result of matrix multiplication on GPU:", c)

#Operations outside the context will default to CPU execution.
d = tf.constant([[9.0, 10.0], [11.0, 12.0]])
e = tf.constant([[13.0, 14.0], [15.0, 16.0]])
f = tf.matmul(d, e)
print("Result of matrix multiplication on CPU:", f)

```

This snippet demonstrates the use of the `tf.device` context manager to explicitly place specific operations on the GPU.  While convenient for selectively placing computationally intensive parts of the model on the GPU, it requires a detailed understanding of the model's computational graph.  Over-reliance on this method can be cumbersome for large, complex models, hence the preference for more comprehensive strategies mentioned above.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on GPU support and distributed training, are invaluable resources.  Understanding the CUDA toolkit's documentation is critical for troubleshooting driver issues. The NVIDIA developer website offers a wealth of information regarding CUDA programming and GPU optimization.  Finally, studying best practices for large-scale machine learning model deployment will significantly aid in avoiding performance bottlenecks.
