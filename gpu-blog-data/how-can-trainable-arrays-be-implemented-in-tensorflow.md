Trainable arrays in TensorFlow Probability (TFP) necessitate a nuanced approach, diverging from the straightforward variable assignment common in TensorFlow's core API.  The key lies in leveraging TFP's probabilistic distributions and the underlying TensorFlow graph execution model to manage and update these arrays during optimization.  Simply assigning a `tf.Variable` and treating it as a probability distribution is insufficient; the inherent uncertainty and the need for gradient-based updates require careful consideration of the chosen distribution and its interaction with the optimizer. My experience optimizing Bayesian neural networks underscores this subtlety.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The challenge stems from the dual nature of trainable arrays in probabilistic contexts: they are both parameters to be optimized (like weights in a neural network) and random variables with associated probability distributions.  Directly applying standard optimization techniques to the array's values often overlooks the uncertainty inherent in the probabilistic model.  Consequently, TFP provides mechanisms to seamlessly integrate these two aspects.  The most common approach involves defining a probability distribution over the array, representing the uncertainty, and then employing variational inference or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to infer the posterior distribution of this array given observed data. This contrasts with standard TensorFlow, where you directly optimize the array's values.

The process generally involves:

a) **Defining a prior distribution:** This encodes our initial beliefs about the array's values before observing any data.  Common choices include Normal, Gamma, or other distributions appropriate for the array's nature and constraints.

b) **Defining a likelihood function:** This specifies how the observed data is generated given the array's values.  This function bridges the probabilistic model with the data.

c) **Inferring the posterior distribution:** This involves finding the probability distribution over the array given the observed data and the prior.  This is accomplished via variational inference (finding a tractable approximation to the posterior) or MCMC (sampling from the posterior).  TFP offers tools for both.

d) **Optimization:** The optimization process involves adjusting the parameters of the chosen variational distribution or MCMC sampler to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in variational inference or improve the sampling efficiency in MCMC.  This indirectly updates the array’s representation of the distribution’s parameters.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Variational Inference with a Normal Distribution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a prior distribution over a 2D array
prior = tfd.Normal(loc=tf.zeros([2, 3]), scale=tf.ones([2, 3]))

# Define a variational distribution (approximating the posterior)
q_mu = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([2, 3]), name="q_mu")
q_sigma = tf.Variable(tf.ones([2, 3]), name="q_sigma")
variational_posterior = tfd.Normal(loc=q_mu, scale=tf.nn.softplus(q_sigma)) # Ensure positive scale

# Define a simple likelihood function (replace with your actual model)
def log_likelihood(array):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tfd.Normal(loc=array, scale=0.5).log_prob(tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])))


# Optimization using Adam
optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for i in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    negative_elbo = -tfp.vi.monte_carlo_elbo(log_likelihood, variational_posterior, sample_size=100)
  gradients = tape.gradient(negative_elbo, [q_mu, q_sigma])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [q_mu, q_sigma]))
  print(f"Iteration {i}, ELBO: {negative_elbo.numpy()}")

# Access the inferred posterior parameters
print(f"Inferred mean: {q_mu.numpy()}")
print(f"Inferred standard deviation: {tf.nn.softplus(q_sigma).numpy()}")

```

This example demonstrates variational inference.  A normal distribution is used both for the prior and the variational posterior.  The ELBO is minimized (negative ELBO maximized) to approximate the true posterior.  The `tf.nn.softplus` function ensures positive standard deviation values.  This is crucial for the stability of the optimization process.


**Example 2: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a prior
prior = tfd.Normal(loc=tf.zeros([2, 2]), scale=tf.ones([2, 2]))

# Define the unnormalized log probability density (log-likelihood + log-prior)
def target_log_prob_fn(array):
    log_prior = prior.log_prob(array)
    # Replace with your actual likelihood function
    log_likelihood = tf.reduce_sum(tfd.Normal(loc=array, scale=0.1).log_prob(tf.constant([[0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 2.0]])))
    return log_prior + log_likelihood

# Initialize the HMC kernel
kernel = tfp.mcmc.HamiltonianMonteCarlo(
    target_log_prob_fn=target_log_prob_fn,
    step_size=0.1,
    num_leapfrog_steps=10)

# Initialize the state
initial_state = tf.zeros([2, 2])

# Run HMC
samples, _ = tfp.mcmc.sample_chain(
    num_results=1000,
    current_state=initial_state,
    kernel=kernel,
    num_burnin_steps=500)

# Access the samples
print(f"Samples shape: {samples.shape}") #  (1000, 2, 2)

```

This illustrates the use of HMC, a more sophisticated MCMC method. HMC directly samples from the posterior distribution, which doesn't require a simplifying approximation like variational inference.  The `target_log_prob_fn` combines the log-likelihood and log-prior for efficient sampling.


**Example 3:  Using `tfp.util.TransformedVariable` for constrained arrays**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Enforce positivity constraint on array elements
positive_array = tfp.util.TransformedVariable(
    initial_value=tf.ones([3, 3]),
    bijector=tfp.bijectors.Softplus())

# Use positive_array in your model and optimization
# ... (Your model and optimizer code here)
# ... For example:
# optimizer.apply_gradients(...)


```

This demonstrates the use of `tfp.util.TransformedVariable` to enforce constraints. Here, the `Softplus` bijector ensures all elements of the array remain positive during optimization. This avoids issues caused by unconstrained parameters impacting model stability or interpretability.
