My experience developing custom loss functions within TensorFlow for large language models has repeatedly confronted the challenges of numerical stability. The raw exponentiation involved in calculating probabilities within softmax can easily lead to overflow when input values are significantly large. However, TensorFlow’s `nn.softmax` function is specifically engineered to mitigate this precise issue, not by preventing the overflow directly, but by employing a technique known as the “max trick”. This subtle, yet crucial, implementation detail allows for reliable computations even with substantial logits.

Let’s first examine the underlying mathematics to illustrate the problem. The softmax function is defined as follows:

`softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / Σ exp(x_j)` , for all j in the input vector x.

Here, each element `x_i` in the input vector `x` is exponentiated, and then normalized by the sum of all the exponentiated elements. When `x_i` is a large positive number, `exp(x_i)` can rapidly approach or exceed the maximum representable number within the floating-point data type, leading to overflow, resulting in `inf` values and subsequently, either NaN or incorrect results due to the division. Conversely, if `x_i` is a large negative number, `exp(x_i)` will approach 0, which can sometimes cause underflow if the number goes below the smallest representable value, which would lead to zero and thereby also affect the division. Directly computing the softmax in this naive way will, therefore, quickly encounter numerical stability problems with relatively modest sized inputs.

TensorFlow's `nn.softmax` mitigates this problem by subtracting the maximum value from the input vector before exponentiation. The modified equation is:

`softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i - max(x)) / Σ exp(x_j - max(x))` , where max(x) represents the largest value in the input vector `x`.

This transformation is mathematically equivalent to the original softmax function since multiplying both numerator and denominator by `exp(-max(x))` doesn’t change the overall result. The crucial advantage is that now, at least one of the exponentiated values will equal to `exp(0) = 1`, and all other exponentiated values will be within the range of `0` and `1`. By centering the input values this way, we avoid dealing with extremely large numbers.

However, this does *not* prevent an overflow during the subtraction operation `x_i - max(x)`, if `x_i` is very close to `max(x)`, or if there is a huge difference between values in the original vector. For example, for 64-bit floats, the maximum representable value is around `10^308`. If `x_i` and `max(x)` are close to that, then their subtraction might result in a valid number, however `exp(x_i - max(x))` might still result in inf since we are still dealing with very large values in their difference, albeit smaller than `x_i`. Although extremely unlikely, in a scenario with extremely huge values, this is still a possibility, which leads to the conclusion that `nn.softmax` only *mitigates* numerical overflow risk and *not completely prevents it*.

To further illustrate this, let’s consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the 'max trick' effect.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def naive_softmax(x):
    exps = np.exp(x)
    return exps / np.sum(exps)


# Create input with large values
x_large = np.array([1000, 1001, 1002], dtype=np.float32)
x_large_tf = tf.constant(x_large, dtype=tf.float32)

# Naive softmax leads to overflow
naive_result = naive_softmax(x_large)
print(f"Naive softmax result: {naive_result}") # Results in NaNs or infs.

# TensorFlow softmax handles it correctly
tf_result = tf.nn.softmax(x_large_tf)
print(f"TensorFlow softmax result: {tf_result.numpy()}")
```

In this example, the `naive_softmax` function calculates softmax directly without the "max trick". When provided with large inputs, `exp(x)` overflows, resulting in either NaN or inf results during the division. In contrast, TensorFlow's `tf.nn.softmax` calculates a correct result, showcasing the effect of the built-in stabilization. This demonstrates how `nn.softmax` handles large positive inputs, by centering the input distribution.

**Example 2: Handling a mix of negative and large positive values.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def naive_softmax(x):
  exps = np.exp(x)
  return exps / np.sum(exps)


x_mixed = np.array([-1000, 100, 200], dtype=np.float32)
x_mixed_tf = tf.constant(x_mixed, dtype=tf.float32)

naive_result_mixed = naive_softmax(x_mixed)
print(f"Naive softmax result (mixed): {naive_result_mixed}") # Likely to produce infs or zero.

tf_result_mixed = tf.nn.softmax(x_mixed_tf)
print(f"TensorFlow softmax result (mixed): {tf_result_mixed.numpy()}")
```

Here, we explore the scenario where input values are a mixture of very large positive values and very small negative values. The `naive_softmax` implementation, due to the issues mentioned earlier, is unlikely to produce a correct result. TensorFlow’s implementation handles the input correctly, demonstrating its ability to handle this more complex case without any issues. The `max trick` also mitigates underflow, as the smallest exponentiated value will still be a reasonably sized number since we are subtracting the largest value from each entry. This also shows the fact that `nn.softmax` does not perform computation using direct exponentiation and division, but uses clever tricks that can ensure numerical stability.

**Example 3: The Limit Cases**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def naive_softmax(x):
    exps = np.exp(x)
    return exps / np.sum(exps)

# Extremely large values
x_extremely_large = np.array([1e30, 1e30 + 1, 1e30 + 2], dtype=np.float64)
x_extremely_large_tf = tf.constant(x_extremely_large, dtype=tf.float64)

naive_result_extreme = naive_softmax(x_extremely_large)
print(f"Naive softmax result (extreme): {naive_result_extreme}")

tf_result_extreme = tf.nn.softmax(x_extremely_large_tf)
print(f"TensorFlow softmax result (extreme): {tf_result_extreme.numpy()}")

# Extremely large negative values
x_extremely_small = np.array([-1e30, -1e30 - 1, -1e30 - 2], dtype=np.float64)
x_extremely_small_tf = tf.constant(x_extremely_small, dtype=tf.float64)

naive_result_extreme_neg = naive_softmax(x_extremely_small)
print(f"Naive softmax result (extreme neg): {naive_result_extreme_neg}")

tf_result_extreme_neg = tf.nn.softmax(x_extremely_small_tf)
print(f"TensorFlow softmax result (extreme neg): {tf_result_extreme_neg.numpy()}")
```

In this final example, we explicitly push the limit using extremely large positive and negative inputs to the function. As expected, our naive function struggles and produces either `nan`, zero values, or a division by zero error. TensorFlow, however, computes the correct output, albeit with limitations. In both positive and negative extreme value cases, TensorFlow's `nn.softmax` still performs reasonably well by shifting the inputs and maintaining the relative values, by subtracting the largest value in the input vector from each individual entry.

To further deepen the understanding of numerical stability issues and mitigation techniques within deep learning frameworks, I would recommend reviewing literature on the following: general numerical computing techniques, specifically for dealing with floating-point numbers, the underlying implementations of different deep learning libraries, particularly TensorFlow's operation source codes (though these can be quite complicated), and resources detailing specific numerical stability improvements within algorithms like softmax, log-softmax and cross-entropy loss. In particular, pay close attention to the effects of scaling and shifting operations, and how they are used to avoid overflowing and underflowing.

In summary, `tf.nn.softmax` leverages the “max trick” to mitigate the risk of overflow during exponentiation and to maintain acceptable numerical results; however, it is still not immune to overflowing from the subtraction operation or from exponential overflow, if the differences between input values and their maximum are extremely high. Therefore, I would suggest that one always considers input distributions and scales their input values to prevent extreme values from entering the softmax function in the first place, especially if they are working with a limited number of bits.
