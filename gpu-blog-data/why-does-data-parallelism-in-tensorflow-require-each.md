Data parallelism in TensorFlow, specifically when using distributed training strategies, relies on individual worker nodes having separate master sessions due to the inherent architecture of TensorFlow's distributed execution model and the need to manage graph construction and resource allocation independently at each node. The master session, essentially the context in which the TensorFlow graph is built and computations are initiated, acts as the central point of control for that particular process. Duplicating this control across workers, with each having its own, prevents conflicts and allows for parallel model training.

A single master session shared across multiple worker nodes would present several significant challenges. Firstly, graph construction is a sequential process, and attempting to modify it from multiple locations would lead to race conditions and inconsistent graph representations. Second, TensorFlow’s resource management, encompassing device placement (CPU/GPU), variable initialization, and data handling, is intrinsically tied to the master session. A shared session would make independent control over these resources on different machines impossible. Third, the gradient computation and application process are also session-bound; each worker needs to compute gradients locally based on the parameters it holds and apply the updates independently.

In practice, when using a distributed TensorFlow strategy like `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` or the legacy parameter server approach, each worker operates its own copy of the model and training loop. While the model architecture is generally the same across the workers, the data consumed at each node is typically a different subset of the overall training data. Each worker independently performs forward propagation, computes loss, and calculates gradients. It does not share or directly modify another worker’s operations. The synchronization of parameter updates, critical for data parallelism, happens after gradient computation. The master session, therefore, is where the local data is fed into the graph, training ops are defined, and gradients are calculated and applied, all within a scope uniquely tied to that specific worker.

The parameter server strategy, commonly used in older TensorFlow deployments, explicitly underscores the need for individual master sessions. In this approach, parameter servers manage the model variables while worker nodes perform computations. These computations are dispatched by the worker’s master session and involve requests to the parameter servers for variable values and subsequent updates after gradient calculations. Each worker’s master session interacts with the parameter servers independently, thus, each worker needs to manage its own local session, not a shared one. This independence allows each worker to process its subset of the data concurrently and asynchronously.

Let’s consider a simplified example of a linear regression model distributed over two workers to illustrate the concept.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Environment variables to distinguish workers for multi-process setup
tf_config = os.environ.get('TF_CONFIG')
if tf_config:
    cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TFConfigClusterResolver()
    strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy(cluster_resolver=cluster_resolver)
    worker_id = int(cluster_resolver.task_index)
else: # For single process local testing
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
    worker_id = 0


with strategy.scope(): # Model created within the strategy's scope
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(1,))
    ])

    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(inputs, training=True)
    loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Dummy dataset generation
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,1))
labels = 2*inputs + tf.random.normal(shape=(100,1))*0.1
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((inputs, labels)).batch(16)

dist_dataset = strategy.distribute_datasets_from_function(lambda _: dataset)

# Example of the training loop: Only shows the first few steps to be concise
EPOCHS = 2
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
  for step, data in enumerate(dist_dataset):
    loss = strategy.run(train_step, args = data)
    if worker_id == 0 and step < 5:
        print("Epoch:",epoch,",Step:", step,", Loss:",strategy.reduce(tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM, loss, axis=None))
```

In this example, although `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` is used, conceptually, each worker has its own master session when the `train_step` function runs inside `strategy.run`. Even when we're simulating a single machine setup by disabling distributed setup in the code, `MirroredStrategy` implicitly replicates model variables on the local device(s) and runs the computation in parallel in the same manner. This local parallel execution replicates some of the core behaviors of a distributed environment. Each worker, through its individual master session context, operates on its assigned data portion. The `strategy.run` call will distribute the function execution across available resources, whether these are local to a single machine or part of a multi-machine cluster.

The `cluster_resolver` is essential in a true distributed setup. It identifies the available workers (or the parameter servers) and initializes the necessary communication channels. Each worker starts a separate Python process, and thus, each of these processes has its own master session for all intents and purposes. The `TF_CONFIG` environment variable and `cluster_resolver` effectively communicate the cluster topology to each worker, enabling them to perform the right operations.

Consider another scenario where we use parameter servers. This is a more explicit way to see independent session management.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Assume we have a parameter server and one or more workers in cluster
# This is a simulation; real environment setup is more involved
task_type = os.environ.get('TASK_TYPE')
task_index = int(os.environ.get('TASK_INDEX', 0))

if task_type == "ps": # parameter server process
    cluster = {
    'cluster': {
        'worker': ["localhost:2222", "localhost:2223"],
        'ps': ["localhost:2224", "localhost:2225"]
    },
    'task': {'type': 'ps', 'index': task_index}
    }
    strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy(
        tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.SimpleClusterResolver(cluster))

    # Parameter Server simply listens, this is the core part that would be replicated in each parameter server process
    server = tf.distribute.Server(cluster, task_type=task_type, task_index=task_index)
    server.join() # Block the current thread and do not return until this parameter server is closed.
else: # worker process
    cluster = {
        'cluster': {
            'worker': ["localhost:2222", "localhost:2223"],
            'ps': ["localhost:2224", "localhost:2225"]
        },
        'task': {'type': 'worker', 'index': task_index}
    }
    cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.SimpleClusterResolver(cluster)

    strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy(cluster_resolver)

    with strategy.scope():
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(1,))
        ])
        optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
        loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

    @tf.function
    def train_step(inputs, labels):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs, training=True)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
      grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
      return loss

    inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,1))
    labels = 2*inputs + tf.random.normal(shape=(100,1))*0.1
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((inputs, labels)).batch(16)

    dist_dataset = strategy.distribute_datasets_from_function(lambda _: dataset)
    # Training loop in each worker
    for epoch in range(2):
      for step, data in enumerate(dist_dataset):
        loss = strategy.run(train_step, args = data)
        if step < 5:
           print("Worker", task_index, ",Epoch:",epoch,",Step:", step,", Loss:",strategy.reduce(tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM, loss, axis=None))
```
In this simulation, the parameter server(s) and worker(s) are started as separate processes, where each process has a completely independent master session. The cluster definition is passed to each process to enable communications to facilitate gradient synchronization from the workers to the parameter servers, and updating model variables. Note that the parameter servers just join and do not do gradient computation, while workers perform training using its own master session in `strategy.scope()`

Finally, consider the use of custom training loops where each worker still uses separate master sessions for training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Simplified setup without explicit TF_CONFIG for clarity
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # Assumed to be running with some distribution strategy
worker_id = 0 # single process simulation, in true distributed, this would be the task index

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(1,))
    ])

    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,1))
labels = 2*inputs + tf.random.normal(shape=(100,1))*0.1
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((inputs, labels)).batch(16)
# data distribution is assumed to be happening elsewhere

# Training loop (simpler example without distribution, but conceptual to each worker)
EPOCHS = 2
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for step, (batch_input, batch_label) in enumerate(dataset):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          predictions = model(batch_input, training=True)
          loss = loss_fn(batch_label, predictions)
      grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

      if worker_id == 0 and step < 5:
          print("Epoch:",epoch,",Step:", step,", Loss:", loss)

```
This custom training loop shows each worker performing training within its master session. Although we're not distributing this example, each worker would have this same code running within its own process with separate memory spaces, each having its own master session. The key aspect is that the gradient computation, update, and variable handling, is isolated within the scope of each process.

In essence, the requirement of a separate master session for each worker in distributed TensorFlow stems from the fundamental nature of the graph execution model, resource management, and the need to ensure independence and parallelism in training operations. While the specific implementation details may differ based on strategies used, having each worker with its own master session has been crucial to achieve the current level of efficient parallel training.

For further information, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation focusing on distributed training, specifically the sections on multi-worker training, parameter server strategy, and how the `tf.distribute` API is structured. Studying the implementations of strategies such as `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and `ParameterServerStrategy` directly in the TensorFlow codebase will also prove beneficial to comprehend these concepts further. Also the TensorFlow guides on custom training loops provide valuable insights on training at a lower level of abstraction. Finally, researching the underlying concepts of distributed systems in machine learning offers additional depth into why these design choices are necessary.
