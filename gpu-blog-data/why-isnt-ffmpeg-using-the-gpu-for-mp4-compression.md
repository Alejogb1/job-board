The prevalent misconception regarding FFmpeg and GPU acceleration stems from the fact that while FFmpeg *can* leverage GPUs, it doesn't *automatically* do so for every encoding task, particularly when encoding to MP4 containers. MP4, being a container format, is not the primary bottleneck; the contained video stream codec is. Therefore, the focus should be on the codec used within the MP4, such as H.264 or H.265 (HEVC). Whether or not the GPU assists is largely dictated by the codec, the codec encoder chosen (CPU-based software encoder or GPU-based hardware encoder), and the specific FFmpeg configuration employed.

Over the course of a decade working with video processing pipelines for a streaming platform, I encountered many instances where users incorrectly assumed that merely specifying an MP4 output would automatically engage GPU resources. This assumption is often incorrect, leading to sluggish encoding times despite a seemingly capable GPU being present. The crux of the matter isn't whether a GPU *exists*, but whether FFmpeg has been explicitly instructed to use the correct hardware-accelerated encoder for the desired codec.

The primary reason FFmpeg defaults to CPU-based encoding, even on systems with robust GPUs, is that its software-based encoders provide a consistent and universally supported fallback. These encoders, like libx264 and libx265, are meticulously optimized for a variety of CPU architectures, ensuring that most users can process media regardless of their specific hardware configuration. Software encoders tend to be more versatile, supporting a larger range of encoding options and quality levels. Relying entirely on GPU-based encoders would mean limiting support to specific hardware and operating system combinations. The GPU encoders are typically exposed as separate 'hwaccel' components. These are often less mature, lack feature parity with their software-based counterparts, and may introduce subtle artifacts or require specific driver versions. Choosing between performance and feature set becomes a key consideration in these situations.

To illustrate, letâ€™s consider a typical scenario where a user might expect GPU involvement but receives CPU-bound processing. Let's assume a common MP4 encode to H.264:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```
This command instructs FFmpeg to use the `libx264` software encoder for H.264 video and the `aac` software encoder for the audio, all wrapped within the MP4 container.  Even if a powerful NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel GPU is present, this command, by default, **will not use it**. The `libx264` encoder will utilize the CPU for all calculations. The user is not explicitly telling ffmpeg to use the GPU resources.

Now, to actually leverage the GPU, the encoder needs to be switched to one that is hardware-accelerated. For example, on an NVIDIA system, one might use `h264_nvenc`, if supported:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v h264_nvenc -c:a aac output.mp4
```
This command instructs FFmpeg to use the NVIDIA hardware encoder (`h264_nvenc`) specifically designed for encoding H.264 video. This encoder utilizes CUDA cores on the GPU to perform encoding tasks significantly faster than the CPU-based `libx264`. It will dramatically lower CPU usage and significantly speed up the encoding process. This assumes you have the correct NVIDIA drivers installed.

Another critical point is the configuration of hardware acceleration. For example, using Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) requires not only specifying the correct encoder but also configuring specific parameters for optimal performance. Here is an example demonstrating hardware acceleration using QSV on an Intel-based system:

```bash
ffmpeg -hwaccel qsv -i input.mov -c:v h264_qsv -c:a aac -b:v 5M output.mp4
```

Here, `-hwaccel qsv` tells FFmpeg to enable QSV hardware acceleration.  `-c:v h264_qsv` selects the Intel QSV H.264 encoder, and `-b:v 5M` is used to set the target bitrate to 5 Mbps. The appropriate QSV drivers and a compatible Intel CPU are required for this to work.

In summary, the decision on whether FFmpeg utilizes the GPU is not inherent to the MP4 container itself, but rather lies within the specific encoder that has been configured for a video stream. Default behavior leans towards the widely supported software encoders, requiring explicit configuration for hardware acceleration. Choosing the appropriate hardware encoder and supporting parameters is critical for achieving optimal GPU utilization during the encoding process.

For further guidance on optimizing hardware-accelerated video encoding with FFmpeg, I recommend consulting the official FFmpeg documentation, specifically the section on hardware acceleration. Detailed information can be found in sections pertaining to NVIDIA NVENC, Intel Quick Sync Video, and AMD AMF. Online forums and community-driven wikis offer additional examples and solutions from experienced users. The command line options and the various encoders are described in great detail there. Finally, thorough experimentation is key to fine-tuning your own pipeline. The best specific encoder, as well as the optimal configuration, is highly dependent on the exact hardware, video input, and desired output.
