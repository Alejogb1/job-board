The root cause of your Keras model outputting class predictions instead of probability distributions is almost certainly the absence of a suitable activation function in the final layer, or the application of a function that inherently converts probabilities to class labels.  My experience debugging numerous classification models has consistently highlighted this oversight as a primary point of failure.  The final layer activation function dictates the nature of the output, and a misconfiguration here directly impacts the model's interpretability and utility.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Keras, a high-level API for building neural networks, provides considerable flexibility in model architecture.  However, this flexibility necessitates a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics.  A classification model, designed to predict the probability of an input belonging to different classes, requires its final layer to output values representing these probabilities.  Crucially, these values must be bounded between 0 and 1, and sum to 1 across all classes for a multi-class problem.

The most common activation function satisfying this requirement is the *softmax* function.  Softmax transforms a vector of arbitrary real numbers into a probability distribution.  Each element in the output vector represents the probability of the corresponding class, ensuring that the probabilities are positive, sum to 1, and reflect the model's confidence in each prediction.  In contrast, other activation functions, such as *sigmoid* (for binary classification) or *linear* (often used in regression tasks), produce outputs that don't inherently represent probability distributions.  The application of a function like `argmax` after model prediction further exacerbates this issue, converting probability scores into hard class assignments.

If your model is predicting class labels directly instead of probability scores, it signifies that either no activation function (resulting in raw logits) or an inappropriate one (e.g., linear or ReLU) has been used in the output layer.  Furthermore, the presence of a post-processing step that explicitly selects the class with the highest probability (like `np.argmax`) will also yield class labels rather than probabilities.  Identifying and correcting this is paramount for effective model interpretation and calibration.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Model Configuration – Linear Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10) # Missing activation function!
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This will output raw logits, not probabilities.  Using argmax will produce class labels.
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

In this example, the final `Dense` layer lacks an activation function.  This results in the output being raw logits – unscaled values that don't represent probabilities.  Using `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function despite this still allows for training, but the prediction output is meaningless without a proper probability distribution.  Applying `np.argmax` directly will simply pick the index of the highest logit, which is not a valid probability interpretation.

**Example 2: Correct Model Configuration – Softmax Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Correct activation function
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This will correctly output probability distributions.
probabilities = model.predict(X_test)
```

Here, the addition of `softmax` in the final layer ensures that the model outputs a probability distribution over the 10 classes. Each element in `probabilities` now represents the probability of the corresponding class, correctly reflecting the model's prediction confidence.

**Example 3: Post-Processing Error – Using argmax**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

probabilities = model.predict(X_test)
# Incorrect: This converts probabilities to class labels
predicted_classes = np.argmax(probabilities, axis=1)
```

Even with the `softmax` activation, directly applying `np.argmax` results in class labels, discarding the valuable probability information.  For applications requiring probability scores (e.g., uncertainty estimation, calibration), this step should be avoided.  Only use `argmax` if you strictly need the predicted class label.  Otherwise, retain the probability distribution for more comprehensive analysis.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation provides extensive details on layer configurations and activation functions.  Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet, the creator of Keras, is an excellent resource for understanding the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications.  Additionally, numerous online tutorials and courses dedicated to deep learning and neural networks offer valuable supplementary information.  Finally, understanding linear algebra and probability is critical to grasping the mathematical basis behind neural network operations and output interpretation.  Thorough familiarity with these topics will greatly assist in model debugging and optimization.
