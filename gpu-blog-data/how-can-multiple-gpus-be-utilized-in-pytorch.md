Data parallelism across multiple GPUs in PyTorch is fundamentally achieved through the `torch.nn.DataParallel` module or, for more advanced scenarios, by employing the `torch.distributed` package.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models for image classification and natural language processing has consistently highlighted the critical difference in performance and scalability between these two approaches.  `DataParallel` offers a simpler, more convenient entry point, suitable for smaller-scale deployments and straightforward model architectures.  `torch.distributed`, on the other hand, provides fine-grained control and is essential for handling complexities associated with larger models, heterogeneous hardware, and advanced training techniques like gradient accumulation and model sharding.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge in leveraging multiple GPUs lies in efficiently distributing the computational workload.  Both `DataParallel` and `torch.distributed` address this, but with different strategies.  `DataParallel` replicates the entire model across each available GPU, then splits the input data into batches. Each GPU processes its batch independently, computes gradients, and these gradients are aggregated on the main GPU (typically GPU 0) before a collective update of model parameters. This approach is inherently simpler to implement but suffers from limitations related to communication overhead, especially for large models and extensive data.  The communication bottleneck stems from the constant synchronization required during gradient aggregation.

`torch.distributed`, conversely, allows for a more sophisticated distribution strategy.  Instead of replicating the entire model, the model itself, or parts of it, can be partitioned across GPUs.  This allows for better scaling, especially when memory constraints on individual GPUs become a limiting factor.  Furthermore, `torch.distributed` provides flexibility in defining different communication patterns, facilitating advanced training techniques like all-reduce algorithms for gradient synchronization and asynchronous updates for improved throughput.  This level of control is invaluable when dealing with extremely large models or datasets exceeding the capacity of a single GPU.  My work on a large-scale language model, for instance, necessitated using `torch.distributed` to distribute the model parameters across multiple nodes, each with multiple GPUs, mitigating memory limitations and significantly reducing training time.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Data Parallelism with `torch.nn.DataParallel`:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Assuming you have your model, optimizer, and data loaded
model = MyModel()  # Replace MyModel with your actual model
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
data = torch.randn(1000, 10)  # Example data
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))
dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
  print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
  model = nn.DataParallel(model)
  model.to('cuda') #Move model to GPU

for epoch in range(10):
    for data, labels in dataloader:
        data, labels = data.cuda(), labels.cuda()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases the straightforward implementation of `DataParallel`. The `if` condition ensures that `DataParallel` is only used if multiple GPUs are available. The `model.to('cuda')` line moves the model to the GPU (it will be replicated across all available GPUs by `DataParallel`).  Note that this assumes your loss function (`loss_fn`) is already defined.  The simplicity of this approach is apparent, but it lacks the scalability and flexibility offered by `torch.distributed`.

**Example 2:  Distributed Training with `torch.distributed` (Single Node):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler

def run_training(rank, world_size, model, optimizer, dataloader):
    dist.init_process_group("gloo", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)
    model.to(rank)
    sampler = DistributedSampler(dataloader.dataset)
    dataloader.sampler = sampler
    # ... rest of the training loop as in Example 1, but with dist.barrier() for synchronization if needed ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    model = MyModel()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    # ... define dataloader ...
    mp.spawn(run_training, args=(world_size, model, optimizer, dataloader), nprocs=world_size, join=True)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a basic setup for distributed training on a single node using `torch.distributed`. `mp.spawn` launches multiple processes, each representing a GPU.  `dist.init_process_group` initializes the distributed process group. Critically, a `DistributedSampler` is used to ensure each process receives a unique subset of the data.  The `gloo` backend is chosen for simplicity; for faster inter-GPU communication, `nccl` is usually preferred.  Synchronization points, if necessary, can be introduced using `dist.barrier()`. This approach offers significantly better scalability than `DataParallel` for larger models and datasets.


**Example 3:  Distributed Training with `torch.distributed` (Multiple Nodes):**

This example is significantly more complex and would involve setting up a cluster environment and using a suitable distributed communication backend (like `nccl` or `gloo` with appropriate configuration for inter-node communication). The core principles remain the same: initializing a distributed process group, using a `DistributedSampler`, and synchronizing gradients using collective operations.  Due to the complexity involved in detailing a complete multi-node example within this response, I will omit it. The process involves using environment variables to specify the master node's address and port and configuring the communication backend for efficient inter-node data exchange.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides exhaustive details on utilizing `torch.nn.DataParallel` and `torch.distributed`.  Furthermore, several excellent tutorials and blog posts delve into the nuances of distributed deep learning.  I highly recommend consulting advanced resources focusing on the implementation of different communication strategies and strategies for handling large-scale model training.  Deep learning textbooks often provide insights into the theoretical underpinnings of parallel and distributed computing in the context of deep learning.  In addition, research papers discussing scaling strategies for specific deep learning models often incorporate detailed explanations of GPU utilization.  Studying these materials provides a deeper understanding of the trade-offs and optimal practices involved in maximizing GPU utilization.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with common issues like deadlocks and communication bottlenecks in distributed systems is crucial for troubleshooting and developing robust and scalable training pipelines.
