TensorBoard, when visualizing image data, expects the provided tensors to conform to specific shape and data type conventions. I've encountered this mismatch multiple times in my projects, usually when preprocessing or augmenting image data before feeding it into training loops. The most frequent issue involves a discrepancy between the tensor's shape and what TensorBoard's image plugin anticipates, typically resulting in an error or an incorrect visualization. The core problem lies in the difference between how data is represented in your application, and the specific dimensions and format the `tf.summary.image` function needs.

Fundamentally, TensorBoard's image plugin assumes that a tensor passed to `tf.summary.image` represents a batch of images, where each image is a three-dimensional tensor. The expected dimensions are `[height, width, channels]` for a single image, and `[batch_size, height, width, channels]` for a batch. Common errors include feeding tensors with dimensions such as `[height, width]`, which lacks the channel dimension, or `[channels, height, width]`, where the channel dimension is in the wrong position. Further, the data type of the tensor should ideally be `tf.uint8` for display as images, though `tf.float32` in the range `[0, 1]` is also acceptable. A type mismatch can manifest as either no image appearing or an image appearing distorted. Therefore, resolving this typically involves adjusting the tensor's shape and potentially its data type before passing it to `tf.summary.image`.

Here are a few scenarios I've encountered, along with the code I used to resolve them:

**Scenario 1: Grayscale Image Tensor Lacks Channel Dimension**

I was working with a dataset where grayscale images were stored as two-dimensional tensors with dimensions `[height, width]`. I initially attempted to visualize them without adding a channel dimension, leading to no image appearing in TensorBoard. The code looked something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

height = 100
width = 100
batch_size = 4

# Generate synthetic grayscale images (example)
gray_images = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(batch_size, height, width), dtype=np.uint8)

# This is incorrect because tf.summary.image expects a channel dimension
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/gray_images')
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image('Gray Images Incorrect', gray_images, max_outputs=3, step=0)
    
```

The error occurred because the `gray_images` tensor has the shape `[batch_size, height, width]`, missing a channel dimension. TensorBoard expects a `[batch_size, height, width, channels]` shape. To fix this, I reshaped the tensor, adding a channel dimension using `tf.expand_dims`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

height = 100
width = 100
batch_size = 4

# Generate synthetic grayscale images (example)
gray_images = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(batch_size, height, width), dtype=np.uint8)

# Correct code with added channel dimension
gray_images_expanded = tf.expand_dims(gray_images, axis=-1) # Add a channel dimension at the end
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/gray_images')
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image('Gray Images Correct', gray_images_expanded, max_outputs=3, step=0)

```

By using `tf.expand_dims(gray_images, axis=-1)`, I added a channel dimension at the last axis, transforming the shape from `[batch_size, height, width]` to `[batch_size, height, width, 1]`. This makes the tensor compatible with `tf.summary.image` for grayscale images, which then correctly renders in TensorBoard.

**Scenario 2: Image Tensor with Wrong Channel Order**

In another scenario, I was working with image processing libraries that stored image data with the channels ordered as `[channels, height, width]`, instead of the expected `[height, width, channels]`. When I fed the images to TensorBoard directly, they appeared distorted because the RGB channels were not interpreted correctly. This was the initial state:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

height = 64
width = 64
batch_size = 2
channels = 3

# Generate synthetic images with wrong channel order [C, H, W] (example)
wrong_order_images = np.random.rand(batch_size, channels, height, width).astype(np.float32)

summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/channel_order')
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image('Wrong Channel Order', wrong_order_images, max_outputs=3, step=0)

```

The image produced was completely distorted as the `tf.summary.image` assumed the channel axis was at the end of the tensor, resulting in misinterpretation of color components. To resolve this, I needed to transpose the tensor dimensions such that the channels become the last axis:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

height = 64
width = 64
batch_size = 2
channels = 3

# Generate synthetic images with wrong channel order [C, H, W] (example)
wrong_order_images = np.random.rand(batch_size, channels, height, width).astype(np.float32)

# Correct the channel order using transpose
correct_order_images = tf.transpose(wrong_order_images, perm=[0, 2, 3, 1]) # Transpose to [B, H, W, C]

summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/channel_order')
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image('Correct Channel Order', correct_order_images, max_outputs=3, step=0)
```

By using `tf.transpose(wrong_order_images, perm=[0, 2, 3, 1])`, I reshaped the tensor from `[batch_size, channels, height, width]` to `[batch_size, height, width, channels]`. The `perm` argument specifies the order in which to re-arrange the axes. This ensures that the channel information is in the correct position for `tf.summary.image` to render the image correctly.

**Scenario 3: Data Type Mismatch with Images as Floats Outside [0, 1]**

Finally, I once made the mistake of passing image tensors as float values that were not scaled to the range between `[0,1]`. While `tf.summary.image` can display float tensors, it interprets the values as pixel intensities, expecting them to lie within this interval. This resulted in images that were either entirely white or entirely black, lacking any discernible detail.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

height = 32
width = 32
batch_size = 1

# Generate synthetic float images outside [0, 1] (example)
unscaled_float_images = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, size=(batch_size, height, width, 3)).astype(np.float32)

summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/float_images')
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image('Unscaled Float Images', unscaled_float_images, max_outputs=3, step=0)
```

The problem was the range of values in `unscaled_float_images`. To rectify this, I needed to scale the pixel values to be within `[0, 1]`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

height = 32
width = 32
batch_size = 1

# Generate synthetic float images outside [0, 1] (example)
unscaled_float_images = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, size=(batch_size, height, width, 3)).astype(np.float32)

# Scale the float values to be between 0 and 1
min_val = tf.reduce_min(unscaled_float_images)
max_val = tf.reduce_max(unscaled_float_images)
scaled_float_images = (unscaled_float_images - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)

summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/float_images')
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image('Scaled Float Images', scaled_float_images, max_outputs=3, step=0)
```

By using `tf.reduce_min` and `tf.reduce_max`, I calculated the minimum and maximum values within the tensor. Then, I linearly scaled the values to the `[0, 1]` range using the formula: `(x - min) / (max - min)`. This ensured the pixels were within the expected bounds for visualization.

These examples illustrate common scenarios and solutions I have used to ensure proper image visualization in TensorBoard. Beyond the examples here, understanding the specific dimension order of the image data being used is important. When working with custom datasets or external libraries, it is critical to verify their output format. Further, utilizing a consistent data pipeline that performs necessary adjustments prior to model input and summarization helps to prevent recurring issues.

I find these resources quite useful. The official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed information on the use of `tf.summary.image` and other TensorBoard related functions. Additionally, tutorials and example codes often provide specific examples that are helpful when troubleshooting similar situations. The TensorFlow official API documentation is also an invaluable resource for understanding functions used in image manipulation and type conversions. These have repeatedly aided me in debugging and resolving similar issues in my deep learning projects.
