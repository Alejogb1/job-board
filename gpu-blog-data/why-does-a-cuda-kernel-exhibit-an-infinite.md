The observed infinite loop within a CUDA kernel across varying NVIDIA GPUs almost certainly stems from inconsistent memory access patterns or synchronization issues coupled with divergent execution paths.  My experience troubleshooting similar problems over the years points to this core issue, often masked by seemingly innocuous code.  The seemingly erratic behavior across different GPU architectures highlights the importance of rigorous memory management and careful consideration of thread divergence.

**1. Explanation:**

CUDA kernels execute concurrently across numerous threads organized into blocks. The underlying hardware architecture, including the number of streaming multiprocessors (SMs), the amount of shared memory per SM, and the warp size, significantly influences performance and behavior. A seemingly correct kernel might function flawlessly on one GPU but exhibit an infinite loop on another due to subtle differences in these architectural parameters.

One critical factor contributing to infinite loops is uncontrolled memory access.  If a kernel attempts to read from or write to an invalid memory address, the behavior is undefined.  This undefined behavior can manifest as seemingly random crashes or, in some cases, an infinite loop, particularly if the errant access somehow avoids immediate failure but leads to unpredictable program flow.  The location of the invalid access might differ depending on the specific GPU architecture due to variations in memory addressing schemes and caching mechanisms.

Another prevalent cause is improper synchronization. CUDA provides mechanisms like `__syncthreads()` for synchronizing threads within a block.  However, incorrect usage or missing synchronization can lead to race conditions and data dependencies that are not consistently resolved across different GPUs.  If a thread depends on a value written by another thread within the block and the synchronization is inadequate, the kernel might enter an unexpected state resulting in an infinite loop.  The likelihood of these issues manifesting as infinite loops often depends on the memory access patterns and the degree of thread divergence.

Thread divergence occurs when different threads within a warp execute different instructions.  This can significantly reduce performance due to the serial nature of warp execution within a single SM. However, more critically, it can mask subtle bugs.  Consider a conditional branch within a kernel: if the conditions for the branch aren't handled meticulously, different threads might take different execution paths, potentially leading to unintended consequences, particularly when dealing with memory accesses that aren't correctly handled across these diverse execution paths.  The divergence's impact might differ across GPUs due to variances in the number of warps per SM and the way they handle divergent instructions.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Uncontrolled Memory Access**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    data[i + size] = i; // Potential out-of-bounds access
  }
}
```

This kernel attempts to write beyond the allocated memory if `i + size` exceeds the valid memory range.  On some GPUs, this might lead to an immediate crash, while on others, it might corrupt memory in a way that manifests as an infinite loop later in the execution.  Robust error handling and bound checking are essential to prevent such scenarios.  Adding a check such as `if (i + size < 2 * size)`  before the assignment would mitigate this risk.


**Example 2: Improper Synchronization**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    data[i] = i;
    // Missing synchronization here
    int sum = data[i + 1]; // Potential race condition
    data[i] += sum;
  }
}
```

This kernel suffers from a race condition.  If threads access and modify `data[i + 1]` concurrently without synchronization, the final value of `data[i]` is unpredictable. This unpredictable state might lead to an infinite loop, depending on the specific value calculated and the subsequent execution path.  Adding `__syncthreads()` after `data[i] = i;` ensures that all threads complete writing before reading from `data[i + 1]`, eliminating the race condition.  However, even with `__syncthreads()`, appropriate error handling should be included (check for `i+1 < size`).


**Example 3: Divergent Execution Path**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int size, int flag) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    if (flag == 1) {
      data[i] = i * 2;
    } else {
      // Complex calculation with potential for unexpected behavior depending on the flag and data values.
      // Missing handling of cases where calculation results in an infinite loop
      int j = 0;
      while (data[i] != 0) {
        j++;
        data[i]--;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates a conditional branch where the `else` block contains a potentially problematic loop that is dependent on the input data and the value of `flag`.  The loop might only exhibit infinite behavior under specific combinations of these inputs and might only appear on certain GPU architectures due to subtle differences in memory access latency or instruction scheduling.  The critical issue here lies in insufficient validation of the loop condition and the absence of a clear termination criterion.  Adding a counter to the loop or a different termination condition might solve the issue, or the `else` block needs entirely different logic to avoid an unintended infinite loop.

By carefully considering memory access patterns, ensuring proper synchronization, and meticulously handling divergent execution paths, one can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering infinite loops in CUDA kernels across different GPU architectures.  Furthermore, rigorous testing and profiling on diverse hardware configurations are crucial for robust code development.  My past experiences have consistently emphasized that thorough understanding of the underlying hardware and the diligent application of these principles are key to avoiding such pitfalls.
