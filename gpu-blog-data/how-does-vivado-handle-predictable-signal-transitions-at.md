Vivado's handling of predictable signal transitions at clock edges hinges on its ability to optimize designs based on static timing analysis and inferred logic.  My experience optimizing high-speed serial links for FPGAs has shown that understanding this behavior is crucial for accurate simulation and reliable hardware operation.  The key is that Vivado doesn't directly "handle" transitions in the sense of special processing; rather, its optimization strategies, specifically concerning register-to-register paths and combinational logic, dictate how these transitions manifest during simulation and in synthesized hardware.

**1.  Explanation:**

Vivado's synthesis engine analyzes the HDL code to determine data flow and timing relationships.  When a signal is assigned a value within a clocked process (e.g., a sequential always block in Verilog or a process with a clock sensitivity list in VHDL), the synthesis tool infers a flip-flop.  The value assigned to the signal becomes the output of that flip-flop, sampled at the positive or negative clock edge, as specified in the design.

Predictable transitions arise when the new value is deterministically derived from the previous value or from other signals that are themselves stable at the clock edge.  In such cases, Vivado can optimize the design by reducing the complexity of the circuitry implementing the assignment.  This optimization might involve:

* **Direct register-to-register connections:** If the new value of a signal directly depends on the previous value of another registered signal, the synthesis tool may simply connect the two registers, eliminating intermediate logic.  This is especially true for simple assignments such as `reg_out <= reg_in;`.

* **Logic simplification:** If the new value is a function of several registered signals, Vivado's logic optimization passes will attempt to simplify the combinational logic needed to compute the new value.  This simplification leverages Boolean algebra and various optimization techniques to minimize the gate count and reduce propagation delays.

* **Removal of redundant logic:**  In cases where the same value is assigned multiple times within a clock cycle, or where the assigned value is already available at the register input, Vivado can remove redundant logic gates, further enhancing performance and simplifying the circuit.

This optimization affects simulation in several ways.  A naive behavioral simulation will execute the HDL code line by line, potentially modeling all intermediate steps in the calculations.  However, after synthesis, the simulation uses a netlist representing the optimized hardware.  This netlist often lacks the detailed internal logic of the initial HDL description. The simulated behavior will therefore precisely reflect the synthesized hardware's behavior but might not mirror the cycle-by-cycle operation implied by the original HDL code.  This difference is crucial to understand when debugging timing-sensitive designs.  Any discrepancies between behavioral and post-synthesis simulations could indicate problems with either the HDL code, the synthesis constraints, or the simulation setup.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Register Transfer:**

```verilog
module simple_reg (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input data_in,
  output reg data_out
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst)
      data_out <= 1'b0;
    else
      data_out <= data_in;
  end

endmodule
```

In this simple example, Vivado will likely synthesize a single flip-flop connecting `data_in` to `data_out`.  The post-synthesis simulation will directly transfer the value from `data_in` to `data_out` at the positive clock edge without any intermediate steps.  Behavioral simulation would execute the `always` block explicitly, but the post-synthesis model would directly reflect the synthesized hardware behavior.


**Example 2: Combinational Logic with Predictable Transitions:**

```verilog
module combinational_logic (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input a,
  input b,
  output reg out
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst)
      out <= 1'b0;
    else
      out <= a & b;
  end

endmodule
```

Here, Vivado will synthesize an AND gate and a flip-flop.  The AND gate computes `a & b`, and the flip-flop stores the result in `out`. Post-synthesis simulation will show the direct result of the AND operation at the clock edge, reflecting the optimized hardware.  The behavioral simulation might model the AND operation explicitly, but the post-synthesis simulation will show the output after the AND gate operates, omitting internal logic states.


**Example 3:  Unpredictable Transition (Illustrative):**

```verilog
module unpredictable_transition (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input a,
  input b,
  output reg out
);

  reg internal_sig;
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      out <= 1'b0;
      internal_sig <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      internal_sig <= a ^ b; // XOR operation introduces unpredictable behavior
      out <= internal_sig;
    end
  end
endmodule
```

In this case, the XOR operation introduces unpredictability because the output depends on the instantaneous values of `a` and `b`.  Vivado will not be able to significantly optimize the logic here, and post-synthesis simulation will be closer to the behavioral simulation.  However, even here, any glitches or hazards in the combinational logic between the XOR gate and the flip-flop that might appear in the detailed behavioral simulation will be suppressed or otherwise impacted by optimization and timing analysis. The simulation will reflect the final stable state after the clock edge.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Vivado Design Suite documentation, specifically sections covering synthesis, optimization, and simulation methodologies, are invaluable.  Consult the official user guides for detailed information on timing closure, Xilinx's implementation flow, and the specifics of post-synthesis simulation.  Furthermore, textbooks on digital logic design and FPGA programming provide fundamental concepts crucial for understanding these interactions.  Finally, working through tutorial examples in the Vivado Design Suite is highly beneficial in developing practical understanding of these concepts.
