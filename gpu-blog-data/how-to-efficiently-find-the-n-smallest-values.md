The inherent structure of an NxN pairwise comparison matrix, specifically its symmetry and the redundancy of comparisons (a vs. b is the same as b vs. a, though potentially with a different metric), presents a significant optimization opportunity when searching for the N smallest values.  My experience working on large-scale similarity analysis projects has shown that naive approaches, such as flattening the array and sorting, are computationally inefficient for larger matrices.  The key is to exploit the matrix's symmetry and leverage NumPy's vectorized operations.

My approach centers around efficiently extracting the lower triangular portion of the matrix, excluding the diagonal, and then employing NumPy's `argpartition` function. This avoids redundant comparisons and offers significant speed improvements over full array sorting, especially as N grows.  This strategy is significantly more efficient than complete sorting, scaling better with increasing N.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The algorithm comprises three primary stages:

* **Triangular Extraction:** We leverage NumPy's array slicing capabilities to extract the lower triangular part of the NxN matrix.  This eliminates redundant comparisons, halving the number of elements we need to process.  The diagonal is excluded as self-comparisons are generally irrelevant in pairwise comparisons.

* **Flattening and Partitioning:** The lower triangular portion is flattened into a 1D array using the `ravel()` method.  This flattened array is then passed to `argpartition`, a highly optimized NumPy function that finds the indices of the N smallest elements *without* fully sorting the entire array.  This is a crucial step for efficiency.  `argpartition` is significantly faster than a full sort when you only need a subset of the smallest elements.

* **Index Mapping and Result Extraction:** The indices returned by `argpartition` represent the positions within the flattened array.  These indices need to be mapped back to their original row and column coordinates in the original NxN matrix.  This allows for the retrieval of the actual N smallest values and their corresponding indices within the original matrix.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np

def find_n_smallest(matrix, n):
    """
    Finds the indices and values of the n smallest elements in the lower triangular part of a square matrix.

    Args:
        matrix: A NumPy square matrix.
        n: The number of smallest elements to find.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing two arrays: indices (shape (n, 2)) and values (shape (n,)).  Returns None if n exceeds the number of elements in the lower triangular.
    """
    lower_triangular = np.tril(matrix, k=-1)  # Extract lower triangular (excluding diagonal)
    flattened = lower_triangular.ravel()

    if n > len(flattened):
        return None

    indices = np.argpartition(flattened, n)[:n]  #Indices in flattened array

    row_indices = np.floor(indices / matrix.shape[0]).astype(int)
    col_indices = indices % matrix.shape[0]

    values = flattened[indices]
    indices_2d = np.column_stack((row_indices, col_indices))
    return indices_2d, values

# Example usage
matrix = np.random.rand(5, 5)
n = 3
indices, values = find_n_smallest(matrix, n)
print("Indices:", indices)
print("Values:", values)
```

This example demonstrates the core algorithm. Error handling is included to manage cases where `n` exceeds the number of elements in the lower triangle.


**Example 2: Handling Ties**

```python
import numpy as np

def find_n_smallest_with_ties(matrix, n):
    """
    Finds n smallest values, handling potential ties, by sorting the flattened array before selecting top-n.
    """
    lower_triangular = np.tril(matrix, k=-1)
    flattened = lower_triangular.ravel()
    if n > len(flattened):
        return None

    indices = np.argsort(flattened)[:n]
    row_indices = np.floor(indices / matrix.shape[0]).astype(int)
    col_indices = indices % matrix.shape[0]
    values = flattened[indices]
    indices_2d = np.column_stack((row_indices, col_indices))
    return indices_2d, values

# Example usage:
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]])
n = 2
indices, values = find_n_smallest_with_ties(matrix, n)
print("Indices:", indices)
print("Values:", values)
```
This addresses scenarios where multiple elements share the same minimum values. By using `argsort` instead of `argpartition` we ensure the smallest `n` elements are returned even if there are ties. The tradeoff is a slight performance decrease.


**Example 3:  Large Matrix Optimization with Memory Mapping**

```python
import numpy as np
import mmap

def find_n_smallest_mmap(filename, n):
    """
    Finds n smallest values in a large matrix stored in a file, using memory mapping for efficient handling.
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'rb+') as f:
            mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
            # Assuming a known data type and shape, adjust accordingly
            matrix = np.frombuffer(mm, dtype=np.float64).reshape((1000, 1000))
            lower_triangular = np.tril(matrix, k=-1)
            flattened = lower_triangular.ravel()
            if n > len(flattened):
                return None

            indices = np.argpartition(flattened, n)[:n]
            row_indices = np.floor(indices / matrix.shape[0]).astype(int)
            col_indices = indices % matrix.shape[0]
            values = flattened[indices]
            indices_2d = np.column_stack((row_indices, col_indices))
            return indices_2d, values
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)
        return None
    finally:
        if 'mm' in locals():
            mm.close()


#Example usage (requires a file 'large_matrix.dat' with the matrix data)
filename = 'large_matrix.dat'
n = 100
indices, values = find_n_smallest_mmap(filename, n)
print("Indices:", indices)
print("Values:", values)
```

This example showcases how to handle extremely large matrices that might not fit comfortably in RAM by utilizing memory mapping. This allows us to work with the data directly from the file, avoiding loading the whole matrix into memory.  This is crucial for scalability.  The `dtype` and `reshape` need adjustment to match the specifics of the data file.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's array manipulation and optimized functions, I would suggest consulting the official NumPy documentation.  A strong grasp of linear algebra concepts, specifically matrix operations, is beneficial.  Finally, exploring advanced Python techniques for memory management and handling large datasets will prove valuable for dealing with large-scale pairwise comparisons.  Understanding the tradeoffs between `argsort` and `argpartition` will also inform decision-making in practical applications.
