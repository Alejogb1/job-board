Minimizing computational cost in Python optimization problems often hinges on the judicious selection of algorithms and data structures, coupled with an understanding of NumPy's capabilities. In my experience working on large-scale financial modeling projects, I’ve found that naive implementations frequently lead to unacceptable execution times.  The key is leveraging vectorized operations and, where appropriate, exploring specialized libraries designed for optimization.

**1. Algorithmic Selection and its Impact:**

The choice of minimization algorithm significantly impacts performance.  Gradient descent methods, while conceptually simple, can be slow to converge, particularly in high-dimensional spaces or with complex objective functions.  For smooth, convex functions, I've consistently observed superior performance from algorithms like L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) which require fewer iterations.  For non-convex problems,  methods like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, despite their higher computational overhead per iteration, may be necessary to escape local minima.  However, even these benefit significantly from optimized implementations. The trade-off always lies between the algorithm's convergence rate and the computational expense of each iteration.  Careful profiling is crucial in determining the bottleneck.

**2. NumPy Vectorization: The Cornerstone of Efficiency:**

NumPy's vectorized operations are fundamental to efficient Python optimization.  Looping over individual elements in Python lists is incredibly slow compared to NumPy's ability to perform operations on entire arrays simultaneously.  This is because NumPy leverages highly optimized C code under the hood.  The performance difference becomes dramatic as problem size increases.  Instead of iterating through your data using standard Python loops, restructure your code to utilize NumPy's array operations. This often requires a shift in thinking – from element-wise processing to array-wise processing.

**3. Specialized Libraries: SciPy's `optimize` Module and Beyond:**

SciPy's `optimize` module provides a suite of highly optimized minimization routines.  These routines are significantly faster than manually implementing algorithms like gradient descent, largely because they are written in compiled languages (Fortran, C) and benefit from years of algorithmic refinements.  The module offers functions for various optimization problems, including constrained and unconstrained minimization, and provides sophisticated options for handling different function types. Furthermore, for specific problem structures (e.g., linear programming, quadratic programming), dedicated libraries like CVXOPT and PuLP offer further performance gains by leveraging specialized algorithms and solvers.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Unconstrained Minimization using SciPy**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2 + x[0]*x[1] - 6*x[0] - 6*x[1]

# Initial guess
x0 = np.array([0, 0])

# Perform minimization
result = minimize(objective_function, x0, method='L-BFGS-B')

# Print results
print(result)
```

This example utilizes SciPy's `minimize` function with the L-BFGS-B method, a robust choice for unconstrained minimization. Note the use of a NumPy array for the initial guess `x0`, which is essential for efficient interaction with the optimization routine. The `L-BFGS-B` method is particularly well-suited to problems where the gradient is readily available, offering faster convergence than simpler methods.

**Example 2:  Gradient Descent Implementation (for Comparison):**

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(objective_function, gradient_function, x0, learning_rate, tolerance, max_iterations):
    x = x0
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        gradient = gradient_function(x)
        x = x - learning_rate * gradient
        if np.linalg.norm(gradient) < tolerance:
            break
    return x

# Objective function (same as Example 1)
def objective_function(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2 + x[0]*x[1] - 6*x[0] - 6*x[1]

# Gradient function
def gradient_function(x):
    return np.array([2*x[0] + x[1] - 6, 2*x[1] + x[0] - 6])

x0 = np.array([0, 0])
learning_rate = 0.1
tolerance = 1e-6
max_iterations = 1000

result = gradient_descent(objective_function, gradient_function, x0, learning_rate, tolerance, max_iterations)
print(result)
```

This demonstrates a manual gradient descent implementation.  While conceptually simple, it serves to illustrate the potential performance limitations of naive approaches.  Observe that this method requires the explicit calculation of the gradient.  SciPy's routines often handle gradient calculations internally, or offer options for providing approximations.  The computational overhead is significantly higher in this example compared to the SciPy example, especially for higher dimensional problems.


**Example 3:  Utilizing NumPy for Vectorized Operations:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume 'data' is a large NumPy array
data = np.random.rand(100000, 2) # Example data

# Inefficient (loop-based) calculation
def inefficient_calculation(data):
    result = []
    for row in data:
        result.append(row[0]**2 + row[1]**2)
    return np.array(result)

# Efficient (vectorized) calculation
def efficient_calculation(data):
    return data[:,0]**2 + data[:,1]**2

# Compare execution times
%timeit inefficient_calculation(data)
%timeit efficient_calculation(data)
```

This example highlights the crucial difference between loop-based and vectorized computations.  The `efficient_calculation` function leverages NumPy's broadcasting capabilities to perform the computation on the entire array simultaneously, yielding a substantial performance improvement, particularly for large datasets.  This principle is directly applicable within more sophisticated optimization routines.  Many operations within the objective function and its gradient can be vectorized to greatly reduce execution time.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of numerical optimization algorithms, I recommend consulting standard texts on numerical analysis and optimization.  For detailed explanations of NumPy's functionality and efficient array manipulations, the NumPy documentation is invaluable.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics in linear algebra will greatly enhance your ability to formulate and solve optimization problems effectively. Understanding the time and space complexity of different algorithms is essential for choosing the best approach given the problem's scale and constraints.  Finally, mastering profiling techniques will significantly aid in identifying performance bottlenecks in your code.
