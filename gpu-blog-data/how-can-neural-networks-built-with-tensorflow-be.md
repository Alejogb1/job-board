Neural network training, particularly in scenarios with numerous input features, often requires careful scrutiny of learning curves. Analyzing these curves in relation to feature sets provides valuable insight into feature importance, model convergence, and the potential for overfitting. Specifically, using a TensorFlow-based neural network, I have explored how to not only *observe* learning curves but also to *correlate* their behavior with different input feature combinations. This approach transcends simple monitoring and allows for a more data-driven feature engineering and model optimization workflow.

At its core, this process involves splitting the training data into subsets defined by particular features, then training the same neural network architecture on each subset. The resulting learning curves, typically plotting loss or accuracy over training epochs, can then be compared. This comparative analysis reveals how sensitive the model's performance is to the presence or absence of particular features or feature groups. The analysis is not performed in one single training iteration but multiple iterations on a carefully chosen set of data splits based on the specific features under investigation.

Here’s how this can be achieved using TensorFlow, with a focus on practical implementation:

1. **Data Preparation and Feature Grouping:** The process starts with a dataset that has features suitable for grouping. If categorical, features can be one-hot encoded or converted to embeddings as appropriate for the neural network. If continuous, they might be binned or scaled. Grouping is achieved using boolean masks; for example, one mask for all features, another for only numerical features, and another for only categorical features. Such masks create training subsets.

2. **Neural Network Architecture:** I typically use a sequential model composed of dense layers, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers for regularization. This structure allows for a degree of complexity while remaining relatively interpretable. The choice of activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid) and output layer depends on whether we are dealing with a classification or regression problem.

3. **Training Loop and Learning Curve Tracking:** For each feature group, I construct a TensorFlow dataset using the boolean masks, ensuring that only selected features are passed as input to the model. I keep a training loop using the .fit() API, where I monitor metrics such as loss, accuracy, or R-squared values. Instead of only storing the final model performance, I save these metrics at each epoch or a regular interval. This allows for a detailed view of the learning curve.

4. **Curve Analysis:**  Once training completes, the stored metrics (learning curves) from each feature subset are visualized and compared. For comparison, I analyze the following parameters:
    * **Convergence Rate:** How quickly the loss function decreases to a stable value.
    * **Final Performance:** The best-achieved metric (e.g., accuracy or mean squared error).
    * **Overfitting Behavior:** Whether the training performance surpasses that of the validation performance.

Here are some code examples to illustrate these steps:

**Code Example 1: Feature Grouping and Dataset Creation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assuming `data` is a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 10), columns = [f"feature_{i}" for i in range(10)] )
data['target'] = np.random.randint(0,2, 100)

# Assume the first 5 features are numerical
numerical_features = [f"feature_{i}" for i in range(5)]
# Assume the next 5 features are categorical
categorical_features = [f"feature_{i}" for i in range(5,10)]


def create_dataset(df, features, target_name):
    inputs = df[features].values
    targets = df[target_name].values
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((inputs, targets)).batch(32)

# Boolean mask creation and dataset creation
all_features_ds = create_dataset(data, numerical_features + categorical_features, 'target')
numerical_features_ds = create_dataset(data, numerical_features, 'target')
categorical_features_ds = create_dataset(data, categorical_features, 'target')

# Example usage
for features, targets in all_features_ds.take(1):
    print(f"Shape of data with all features: {features.shape}")

for features, targets in numerical_features_ds.take(1):
  print(f"Shape of data with only numerical features: {features.shape}")

for features, targets in categorical_features_ds.take(1):
  print(f"Shape of data with only categorical features: {features.shape}")
```

This snippet demonstrates how datasets are created using feature masks. `numerical_features_ds`, `categorical_features_ds`, and `all_features_ds` are TensorFlow datasets containing data from different feature groups, enabling separate training cycles. The shapes demonstrate that the input dimensions of the respective subsets are different.

**Code Example 2: Neural Network and Training Loop**

```python
def build_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification output
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def train_and_record_curve(dataset, input_shape, epochs=10):
    model = build_model(input_shape)
    history = model.fit(dataset, epochs=epochs, verbose = 0)
    return history.history

# Training for each dataset
all_features_curve = train_and_record_curve(all_features_ds, len(numerical_features + categorical_features))
numerical_features_curve = train_and_record_curve(numerical_features_ds, len(numerical_features))
categorical_features_curve = train_and_record_curve(categorical_features_ds, len(categorical_features))

print("Training done!")

# Example Output for the first 3 epoch histories
for key in all_features_curve.keys():
  print(f"all_features first 3 history for key {key}: {all_features_curve[key][:3]}")
  print(f"numerical_features first 3 history for key {key}: {numerical_features_curve[key][:3]}")
  print(f"categorical_features first 3 history for key {key}: {categorical_features_curve[key][:3]}")

```
This example defines the training loop and records the history. The `build_model` function creates a standard sequential neural network, while `train_and_record_curve` uses `.fit` to train the model on a provided dataset and returns the history which includes the metrics for each epoch. The output shows how we could access the training metrics for each of the feature sets. Note that the `verbose = 0` flag is set to suppress the epoch output.

**Code Example 3: Learning Curve Analysis (Conceptual)**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extracting metrics for visualization
def plot_learning_curves(all_features_curve, numerical_features_curve, categorical_features_curve):
    epochs = range(1, len(all_features_curve['loss']) + 1)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(epochs, all_features_curve['loss'], 'r-', label='All Features Loss')
    plt.plot(epochs, numerical_features_curve['loss'], 'g-', label='Numerical Features Loss')
    plt.plot(epochs, categorical_features_curve['loss'], 'b-', label='Categorical Features Loss')
    plt.xlabel('Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Loss')
    plt.title('Learning Curves - Loss')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(epochs, all_features_curve['accuracy'], 'r-', label='All Features Accuracy')
    plt.plot(epochs, numerical_features_curve['accuracy'], 'g-', label='Numerical Features Accuracy')
    plt.plot(epochs, categorical_features_curve['accuracy'], 'b-', label='Categorical Features Accuracy')
    plt.xlabel('Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
    plt.title('Learning Curves - Accuracy')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_learning_curves(all_features_curve, numerical_features_curve, categorical_features_curve)


```
This snippet shows the visualization part of the analysis.  The `plot_learning_curves` takes the metric history dictionaries from the training functions, extracts loss and accuracy values, and plots these to provide a visual comparison. Although this is simple visualization, it provides a basic template for the kind of analysis I normally conduct.

In practice, the visual analysis is often combined with further quantitative analysis. For instance, calculating the area under the curve (AUC) for different training curves or comparing the final performance metrics can yield further insights.  A slower convergence rate or a lower performance metric for a particular subset suggests that the model struggles to learn from it effectively.

**Resource Recommendations**
For those seeking to further understand feature engineering, 'Feature Engineering for Machine Learning' by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari provides a comprehensive background.  Regarding neural network architecture and training, the TensorFlow documentation is invaluable and is accessible online. It provides comprehensive tutorials and API references for TensorFlow usage. Additionally, general machine learning books such as "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron offer a broader conceptual foundation and practical applications.

By analyzing learning curves in the context of feature subsets, one can go beyond mere monitoring and gain a deeper understanding of model behavior, leading to better model design and feature selection strategies. This iterative process is crucial for developing robust and effective machine learning solutions.
