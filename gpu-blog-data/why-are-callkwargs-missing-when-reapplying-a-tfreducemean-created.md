The issue of missing `call_kwargs` when reapplying a `tf.reduce_mean`-created layer stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how TensorFlow layers operate, specifically concerning the handling of keyword arguments during the `call` method invocation.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale TensorFlow models, particularly those involving custom layers and complex data pipelines, highlights this point. The `tf.reduce_mean` function, when used directly within a layer's `call` method, doesn't inherently preserve or propagate arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the layer.  This is because `tf.reduce_mean` is a low-level tensor operation, not a layer itself, and lacks the internal mechanisms to manage this information.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow layers are designed as modular units with a defined `call` method that processes input tensors and produces output tensors.  Keyword arguments (`kwargs`) passed to a layer's `call` method are intended to control the behavior of the layer itself – parameters that might influence the computation within the layer.  When you create a layer using `tf.reduce_mean` directly (without encapsulating it within a custom layer class), you’re essentially creating a functional component, not a proper layer.  Functional components lack the sophisticated internal architecture to handle the maintenance and propagation of `call_kwargs`.  The `tf.reduce_mean` function itself only accepts the tensor to be averaged and optional arguments like `axis` and `keepdims`.  It's not designed to be a container for user-defined keyword arguments.

Therefore, when you subsequently attempt to re-apply this implicitly defined layer (for example, within a model's `call` method), TensorFlow cannot automatically forward these missing `call_kwargs` because the underlying function doesn't have a mechanism to store or retrieve them.  This results in the observed behavior: `call_kwargs` are effectively lost.

The solution lies in explicitly defining a custom layer class that encapsulates the `tf.reduce_mean` operation and handles keyword argument management within its `call` method.  This allows for proper control over the behavior and the preservation of `call_kwargs` through the layer's computational pipeline.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation (Missing `call_kwargs`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect approach: directly using tf.reduce_mean
def my_layer(inputs, **kwargs):
  return tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=1)

# Model using the incorrect layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    my_layer
])

# Applying the model, kwargs are ignored
outputs = model(tf.random.normal((1, 10)), some_arg=10)
print(outputs.shape) # Output shape will be correct, but 'some_arg' is lost.
```

This example showcases the problem. The `my_layer` function doesn't store or use `kwargs`, leading to their disappearance.  The model runs without errors, but the crucial information in `kwargs` is lost.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation (Using a Custom Layer)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct approach: custom layer encapsulating tf.reduce_mean
class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs, **kwargs):
    # Access and utilize kwargs (e.g., for conditional logic)
    if 'some_arg' in kwargs and kwargs['some_arg'] > 5:
      return tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=1) * 2  # Example conditional operation
    else:
      return tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=1)


# Model using the custom layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer()
])

# Applying the model, kwargs are preserved and used
outputs = model(tf.random.normal((1, 10)), some_arg=10)
print(outputs.shape) # Output is modified based on 'some_arg' value
```

This example demonstrates the correct approach. By creating a `tf.keras.layers.Layer` subclass, we encapsulate `tf.reduce_mean` within a proper layer, enabling us to manage and utilize `kwargs` within the `call` method.


**Example 3: Custom Layer with Multiple Input Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightedMeanLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs, weights=None, **kwargs):
    if weights is None:
      return tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=1)
    else:
      # Check for shape compatibility.  Error handling omitted for brevity.
      weighted_sum = tf.reduce_sum(inputs * weights, axis=1)
      return weighted_sum / tf.reduce_sum(weights, axis=1)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    WeightedMeanLayer()
])

# Example usage with and without weights.
outputs_unweighted = model(tf.random.normal((1, 10)))
weights = tf.random.uniform((1, 10))
outputs_weighted = model(tf.random.normal((1, 10)), weights=weights)

print(outputs_unweighted.shape)
print(outputs_weighted.shape)
```

This advanced example illustrates handling additional arguments like weights within the custom layer.  It demonstrates how to design robust layers that adapt to different input scenarios, showcasing a better understanding of TensorFlow's layer API.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  Extensive resources on object-oriented programming in Python.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with TensorFlow.  Furthermore, focusing on the TensorFlow 2.x API documentation provides targeted, up-to-date information.  Deeply exploring the source code of existing Keras layers can prove invaluable for learning best practices.  Finally,  seeking examples in established TensorFlow model repositories will reveal common patterns and solutions.
