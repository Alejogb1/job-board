Many-to-many associations in Sails.js often present initial challenges due to a common misunderstanding regarding their underlying implementation using join tables, rather than magical ORM-driven relationships. Specifically, the lack of automatic model updates across both sides of the association when the association is manipulated on just one side, is a frequent source of confusion for developers.

Sails, when configured to have a many-to-many association, does not, under the covers, maintain automatic bi-directional updates. It does not assume a specific relational behavior. Instead, it relies on defining a join table that contains foreign keys referencing both tables being related. The join table model is the crux of managing many-to-many relationships in Sails. Consider a scenario where we have two models: `User` and `Group`. A user can belong to multiple groups, and a group can contain multiple users.  This necessitates a join table, which might be represented by the `Membership` model. When a `User` is added to a `Group` or removed, the programmer must explicitly manipulate this `Membership` model, not directly modify the `User` or `Group` models. This lack of built-in synchronous bi-directional update, unlike in some ORMs, is often the source of the perceived problem.

The typical issue I've seen involves developers creating the relationship definition in the `User` and `Group` models, expecting that changes made via, say, `User.addGroups()` will automatically update the list of users within the corresponding `Group` instances and vice-versa. This isn't the case. The `addGroups` method, or similar, creates new records in the join table, but it does *not* automatically propagate these changes to the `groups` attribute in loaded `User` models, nor the `users` attribute in loaded `Group` models. The developer must either perform a subsequent query or update the loaded data manually based on the changes made to the join table. This is not an error of the framework, but instead an intentional design decision to provide fine-grained control and to avoid implicit behavior that can be difficult to debug or modify later.

Let's explore several code examples demonstrating how to correctly implement many-to-many relationships in Sails.js.

**Example 1: Creating the Models and Basic Association**

Here we define the `User`, `Group` and the all-important `Membership` models.

```javascript
// api/models/User.js
module.exports = {
    attributes: {
        name: { type: 'string', required: true },
        groups: {
          collection: 'group',
          via: 'users',
          through: 'membership'
        },
    },
};

// api/models/Group.js
module.exports = {
    attributes: {
        name: { type: 'string', required: true },
        users: {
            collection: 'user',
            via: 'groups',
            through: 'membership'
        },
    },
};


// api/models/Membership.js
module.exports = {
    attributes: {
        user: {
            model: 'user',
            required: true,
        },
        group: {
            model: 'group',
            required: true,
        },
    },
};
```

This code sets up the necessary model definitions, linking `User` and `Group` via the `Membership` join table. Note that 'through' specifically references our join table model name. We are not dealing with implicit tables here. The `via` properties on the many sides of the association point back to the attribute representing the other side of the relationship, while the `through` property indicates the join table that manages the connection. This is essential to Sails properly recognizing the association structure. Without `through`, the association will not correctly create the join table for these relations.

**Example 2: Populating a Many-to-Many Association**

This example demonstrates how to correctly populate the association and then load it.

```javascript
// Sample Controller action:
async function addUserToGroup(req, res) {
    try {
        const user = await User.findOne({name: 'Bob'});
        const group = await Group.findOne({name: 'Admins'});

        if (!user || !group) {
            return res.notFound();
        }

      await Membership.create({user: user.id, group: group.id});

      const populatedUser = await User.findOne({ id: user.id })
      .populate('groups');

      return res.ok(populatedUser);

    } catch (error) {
      return res.serverError(error);
    }
}

```

Here, we first retrieve a user and group. We then create a `Membership` record that associates them. After this we perform a query that reloads the User record, including the `groups` association. Notice, we explicitly populate the relationship with `populate`.  If I only created the record, and then reloaded the user it would not contain the update, since the changes are made to the join table itself, rather than the user directly. I would have to reload the user with `populate` to see the changes on the relationship side. This demonstrates that, though the data is linked, updates on one side of the association are not automatically reflected in loaded entities.

**Example 3: Removing a Many-to-Many Association**

Demonstrates deletion of a many-to-many relationship.

```javascript
// Sample Controller action:
async function removeUserFromGroup(req, res) {
    try {
        const user = await User.findOne({name: 'Bob'});
        const group = await Group.findOne({name: 'Admins'});

         if (!user || !group) {
            return res.notFound();
        }
      const membership = await Membership.findOne({user: user.id, group: group.id});

      if(!membership){
        return res.notFound();
      }

      await Membership.destroy({id: membership.id});

        const populatedUser = await User.findOne({ id: user.id })
      .populate('groups');
       return res.ok(populatedUser);

    } catch (error) {
        return res.serverError(error);
    }
}
```

Similar to the previous example, here we locate both the user and group and subsequently find the specific `Membership` record that connects them.  Once located, we destroy the record from the `Membership` model using the id of the record itself. Notice that, as before, to be confident that the User model's `groups` association is updated, I must reload it with populate. The critical element is the explicit manipulation of the join table (`Membership`). The association would not be removed by making a request to the user model directly, since it is not the source of the association.

In summary, many-to-many relationships in Sails.js require careful handling of the join table. Developers should not expect that creating or destroying a relationship on one side will automatically update the other. The system is designed this way to provide maximum flexibility and control.  The key is to always remember to explicitly manage the join table model (e.g., `Membership` in our examples) when dealing with many-to-many relationships and to reload the data including relations using `.populate()` to access the related entities after a change.

To further expand your understanding of this topic, I recommend reviewing the official Sails.js documentation concerning associations, particularly focusing on many-to-many relationships and the associated `through` key word.  In addition, explore resources covering relational database design best practices specifically about the use of join tables. These documents should clarify the underlying principles of many-to-many relationships within relational databases, and how Sails.js implements them. Finally reviewing community-driven forums, such as StackOverflow, to find additional examples of implementation of these types of models, can also prove invaluable.
