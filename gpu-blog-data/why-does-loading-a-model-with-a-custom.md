The `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'` when loading a custom Keras layer stems from a mismatch between the layer's definition and its serialized representation during saving and loading.  This typically arises when the custom layer's `__init__` method accepts a `name` argument inconsistently with how the Keras serialization process handles layer naming.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale NLP projects highlighted the importance of strictly adhering to Keras's internal naming conventions for consistent model persistence.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, at its core, manages layers through a naming system essential for tracking dependencies and reconstructing the model graph during loading. When a model containing custom layers is saved (e.g., using `model.save()`), Keras serializes the model architecture, including layer configurations. This serialization process implicitly assigns names to layers based on their position in the graph if not explicitly provided. However, if your custom layer's `__init__` method explicitly defines a `name` parameter, it creates a conflict.  During loading, Keras attempts to instantiate your custom layer using the serialized data, but the loaded data doesn't contain an explicit `name` argument, leading to the `TypeError`. The error essentially signifies that the loading mechanism is attempting to initialize your custom layer using parameters not present in the stored configuration. This discrepancy arises because Keras's internal naming mechanisms handle the assignment of names, making an explicit `name` argument in the `__init__` redundant and conflicting.

The problem isn't inherently about the `name` argument itself; rather, it's about the interaction between your custom layer's constructor and Keras's internal layer instantiation. The key to resolving this lies in removing the `name` argument from your custom layer's `__init__` method. Keras handles layer naming internally, eliminating the need for explicit specification in the constructor.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Custom Layer Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyIncorrectLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, name=None, **kwargs): # Incorrect: Explicit name argument
        super(MyIncorrectLayer, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs) # Redundant name assignment
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.activations.relu(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyIncorrectLayer(10), tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)])
model.save('incorrect_model') # This will work, but loading will fail

# Attempting to reload leads to TypeError
reloaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('incorrect_model') # Raises TypeError
```
This example demonstrates the erroneous approach. The `name` parameter in `__init__` along with its assignment in the `super()` call creates the conflict.  During loading, Keras attempts to pass a `name` parameter which is absent in the serialized data, hence the error.


**Example 2: Correct Custom Layer Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCorrectLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs): # Correct: No explicit name argument
        super(MyCorrectLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.activations.relu(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyCorrectLayer(10), tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)])
model.save('correct_model')

# Reloading works without errors
reloaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('correct_model')
```
This corrected version removes the `name` parameter from `__init__`. Keras handles naming internally, resolving the conflict.  Loading the model will now proceed without errors.


**Example 3: Handling Layer Parameters During Initialization**

This example demonstrates safely handling potentially conflicting keyword arguments while maintaining a clean `__init__` method:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyParamLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation='relu', **kwargs):
        super(MyParamLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.activation(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyParamLayer(10, activation='sigmoid'), tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)])
model.save('param_model')

reloaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('param_model')
```

This demonstrates how to handle additional parameters within your custom layer without the `name` conflict.  The `activation` parameter is safely processed.  The core principle remains: avoid explicitly managing the `name` attribute within the `__init__` method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation on custom layers and model saving/loading.  A comprehensive guide to TensorFlow's object-oriented programming aspects is crucial for understanding the inheritance structure within Keras layers.  Finally, review TensorFlow's serialization mechanisms for understanding how model architectures are converted into storable formats.  Studying these resources will provide a deeper understanding of how to build robust and easily persistent custom Keras layers.
