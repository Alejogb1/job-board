The core challenge in constructing a risk-budget portfolio lies in explicitly defining and optimizing the contribution of each asset to the overall portfolio risk.  Unlike mean-variance optimization which focuses solely on return and variance, risk budgeting allocates a target risk contribution to each asset, leading to a more controlled and potentially more robust portfolio.  My experience implementing this using cvxpy has shown that the key is a careful formulation of the constraints to represent these risk budget targets.

**1.  Mathematical Formulation and CVXPY Implementation**

The risk budget constraint can be expressed as:

`w' * Σ * eᵢ =  bᵢ * √(w' * Σ * w)`

Where:

* `w` is the vector of portfolio weights.
* `Σ` is the covariance matrix of asset returns.
* `eᵢ` is a unit vector with a 1 in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere, selecting the i-th asset's contribution.
* `bᵢ` is the target risk contribution of asset i (summing to 1 across all assets).
* `√(w' * Σ * w)` is the portfolio standard deviation (portfolio risk).

This equation states that the contribution of asset *i* to the portfolio's risk (left-hand side) should equal its target risk contribution (right-hand side).  Note that directly implementing this constraint is non-convex, a major hurdle in optimization. However, we can reformulate it using a trick.

First, let's define  `σ_p = √(w' * Σ * w)`. Then, our constraint becomes:


`w' * Σ * eᵢ = bᵢ * σ_p`


This is still non-convex.  We need another transformation to handle the square root, which causes the non-convexity.  To do so we introduce a new variable σ_p, representing the portfolio standard deviation, and then enforce a separate constraint involving this variable.

Then, using the following steps, we can make a convex optimization problem solvable with cvxpy:

1. **Introduce a new variable σ_p ≥ 0**: Representing the portfolio standard deviation.
2. **Constrain σ_p² ≥ w' * Σ * w**:  This constraint ensures σ_p is an upper bound on the portfolio standard deviation.
3. **Use the risk budget constraints stated above**: This ensures the risk contribution aligns with the targets.
4. **Minimize the deviation from the target standard deviation σ_p**: This serves as the optimization objective. It would be preferable to optimize for other objectives that are aligned with risk budgeting.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Basic Risk Budgeting with Equal Risk Contribution**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Define the number of assets
n_assets = 3

# Define the covariance matrix (replace with your actual data)
covariance_matrix = np.array([[0.04, 0.01, 0.02],
                              [0.01, 0.09, 0.03],
                              [0.02, 0.03, 0.16]])

# Define target risk contributions (equal contribution in this case)
risk_contributions = np.array([1/n_assets] * n_assets)

# Define the portfolio weights as a variable
weights = cp.Variable(n_assets)

# Define the portfolio standard deviation as a variable
portfolio_std = cp.Variable(1, nonneg=True)

# Define the constraints
constraints = [cp.sum(weights) == 1, # Weights sum to 1
               weights >= 0, # Non-negativity constraint
               portfolio_std**2 >= cp.quad_form(weights, covariance_matrix)]

for i in range(n_assets):
    constraints.append(weights.T @ covariance_matrix @ np.eye(n_assets)[i, :] == risk_contributions[i] * portfolio_std)


# Define the objective function (minimize deviation from a target risk level –  adjust as needed)
objective = cp.Minimize(portfolio_std)

# Define the problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Print the results
print("Optimal portfolio weights:", weights.value)
print("Portfolio standard deviation:", portfolio_std.value)
```

This example demonstrates a basic risk budgeting setup with equal risk contribution for each asset.  The key is the careful formulation of the constraints, ensuring the risk contribution of each asset matches its target. Note that a more robust solution requires explicit handling for potential issues such as infeasibility.


**Example 2:  Incorporating a Minimum Return Constraint**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# ... (covariance matrix, risk_contributions defined as in Example 1) ...

# Define expected returns (replace with your actual data)
expected_returns = np.array([0.1, 0.15, 0.2])

# Define minimum expected return
min_return = 0.12

# Define portfolio weights as a variable
weights = cp.Variable(n_assets)

# Define the portfolio standard deviation as a variable
portfolio_std = cp.Variable(1, nonneg=True)

# Define constraints (including minimum return)
constraints = [cp.sum(weights) == 1,
               weights >= 0,
               portfolio_std**2 >= cp.quad_form(weights, covariance_matrix),
               weights.T @ expected_returns >= min_return]

#Adding risk contribution constraints (same as in Example 1)
for i in range(n_assets):
    constraints.append(weights.T @ covariance_matrix @ np.eye(n_assets)[i, :] == risk_contributions[i] * portfolio_std)


# Define the objective function (minimize portfolio standard deviation)
objective = cp.Minimize(portfolio_std)

# Define and solve the problem (as in Example 1)
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

# Print the results (as in Example 1)
print("Optimal portfolio weights:", weights.value)
print("Portfolio standard deviation:", portfolio_std.value)
```

This example builds upon the previous one by adding a constraint to ensure the portfolio meets a minimum expected return target. This highlights the flexibility of cvxpy in incorporating additional constraints based on investment objectives.


**Example 3:  Handling Infeasibility**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# ... (covariance matrix, risk_contributions, expected_returns defined as before) ...

weights = cp.Variable(n_assets)
portfolio_std = cp.Variable(1, nonneg=True)

constraints = [cp.sum(weights) == 1,
               weights >= 0,
               portfolio_std**2 >= cp.quad_form(weights, covariance_matrix)]

for i in range(n_assets):
    constraints.append(weights.T @ covariance_matrix @ np.eye(n_assets)[i, :] == risk_contributions[i] * portfolio_std)

#Adding a relaxation variable to address infeasibility
slack = cp.Variable(1,nonneg=True)
for i in range(n_assets):
    constraints.append(cp.abs(weights.T @ covariance_matrix @ np.eye(n_assets)[i, :] - risk_contributions[i] * portfolio_std) <= slack)


objective = cp.Minimize(slack + portfolio_std) #Minimize deviation and slack

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()


print("Optimal portfolio weights:", weights.value)
print("Portfolio standard deviation:", portfolio_std.value)
print("Slack:", slack.value)
```

This illustrates a practical consideration:  the risk budget constraints might be infeasible given the covariance matrix and target risk contributions. This example introduces a slack variable to allow for minor deviations from the target risk contributions, providing a more robust solution when perfect adherence is not possible.  Analyzing the slack value provides valuable insights into the feasibility of the chosen risk budget targets.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding, I recommend consulting the cvxpy documentation, a comprehensive textbook on convex optimization, and research papers on risk budgeting portfolio optimization.  Specifically, studying different risk measures and their application within the framework presented here would enhance your understanding and allow for the construction of more sophisticated risk budgeting models.  Understanding duality theory in the context of convex optimization is also essential for diagnosing and mitigating issues like infeasibility.  Finally, the practical application of these techniques necessitates a firm grasp of financial econometrics and portfolio theory.
