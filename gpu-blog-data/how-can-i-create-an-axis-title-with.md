Producing an axis title with a subscript, while excluding the second square bracket, requires careful manipulation of text formatting within plotting libraries. My experience using matplotlib, primarily for scientific data visualization, has revealed a few reliable methods. The core issue lies in how these libraries interpret LaTeX-like markup, often using dollar signs or backslashes as delimiters, and how the square brackets for the subscript can interfere with the desired output.

The essential trick revolves around employing a combination of raw strings to prevent backslash interpretation, and specific LaTeX commands to create the subscript. Instead of relying on the straightforward `[]` for subscripting, one must use the LaTeX command `_{}`. Additionally, care is necessary to avoid unintended escape character behavior which might arise from libraries attempting to auto-interpret LaTeX in titles.

Let’s consider, for example, wanting an x-axis title to display "Time [s]<sub>eff</sub>" where 'eff' is subscripted. If I simply type `"Time [s]_{eff}"`, the plotting library (and specifically in my experience matplotlib) may misinterpret the opening square bracket in combination with the `_{}` part. Here is my recommended approach.

**Method 1: Raw Strings and LaTeX Commands**

This method utilizes a raw string (`r"..."`) to prevent Python from interpreting backslashes as escape sequences, which can disrupt the LaTeX interpretation. The LaTeX command `_{}` is used explicitly for creating the subscript and must be placed directly after the element that needs the subscript.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate dummy data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

plt.plot(x, y)

# Correct approach with raw strings and LaTeX subscript
plt.xlabel(r"Time [s]$_{eff}$")

plt.ylabel("Some Value")
plt.title("Example Plot")

plt.show()
```

In this example, `r"Time [s]$_{eff}$"` ensures that the backslash in `_{eff}` is correctly processed by matplotlib's LaTeX rendering engine, creating the desired subscript 'eff' following 's'. The dollar signs tell matplotlib to process the expression between them as latex. Notice I've wrapped the entire text in a raw string, further enhancing reliability and eliminating any backslash interpretation errors from within the string itself, including the ones meant for LaTeX. This strategy is applicable for most common LaTeX subscripts.

**Method 2: Combining LaTeX Commands and Regular Strings**

Alternatively, one can break up the string into parts, using a normal string for “Time [s]” and the explicit LaTeX command for only the subscripted portion. This works because matplotlib can interpret latex across string concatenations, and this prevents the accidental misinterpretation of the bracket.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate dummy data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

plt.plot(x, y)


# Alternative approach using string concatenation and LaTeX
plt.xlabel("Time [s]" + r"$\mathregular{_{eff}}$")

plt.ylabel("Some Value")
plt.title("Example Plot")

plt.show()
```

Here I've used string concatenation to combine the regular text "Time [s]" with a LaTeX snippet `r"$\mathregular{_{eff}}$"`. The `\mathregular` command ensures the text is in a normal Roman font, matching the non-italicized style used by default in axis labels. By doing this, we are not at risk of misinterpreting the square bracket, because `[s]` is outside of the LaTeX portion, yet is properly concatenated with the LaTeX subscript.

**Method 3: Using a Formatted String and a Substring**

A third alternative, though slightly more verbose, involves employing formatted strings and utilizing a separate variable to store the subscript. I've found this method to be particularly useful when generating multiple plots with varying subscripts.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate dummy data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

plt.plot(x, y)

# Using formatted string and explicit LaTeX
subscript = r"$_{eff}$"
plt.xlabel(f"Time [s]{subscript}")

plt.ylabel("Some Value")
plt.title("Example Plot")

plt.show()

```

This example leverages an f-string to incorporate the pre-defined LaTeX subscript into the overall string. This method is useful when dealing with multiple subplots using slightly different subscript variations, or when the subscript term is more elaborate and needed in multiple title elements of the same plot.

**Resource Recommendations**

For enhancing understanding and implementation of these techniques, I recommend the following resources:

1.  The official documentation of your plotting library (e.g., matplotlib documentation) – This is often the best place to understand detailed behavior of how text and LaTeX are processed in their API. Specific sections of interest often revolve around text rendering and math-text handling in plot titles.

2.  LaTeX guides on typesetting mathematical expressions – A general understanding of LaTeX, specifically its formatting commands, is crucial for using them successfully within plotting libraries. Online guides, tutorials, and cheat sheets are helpful for learning commands for subscripts, superscripts, and other mathematical symbols. Many of these resources are available via a simple internet search for "latex tutorial" or "latex math symbols".

3.  Plotting library forums and Q&A sites – Community forums often contain discussions, solutions and alternative methods for addressing similar issues, frequently providing context from real usage scenarios. This is typically the first place I’d visit when encountering a specific unexpected behavior.

In summary, generating axis titles with a subscript, while excluding the second bracket, requires a firm grasp on how your plotting library handles LaTeX commands, specifically, the `_{}` command, and careful avoidance of any accidental backslash escape interpretation. These three approaches, when combined with understanding of the plotting API, provide robust methods for achieving the desired formatting in your visualizations. Through experience, I found that raw strings, careful string concatenation, and formatted strings coupled with LaTeX specific markup are the key to solving this seemingly simple issue that frequently trips people up.
