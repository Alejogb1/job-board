Dynamically combining loss functions in TensorFlow Keras requires a nuanced understanding of how Keras handles loss calculations and the implications for backpropagation.  My experience optimizing complex multi-task learning models has shown that simply averaging or summing losses often proves insufficient, leading to suboptimal performance.  The key lies in properly weighting individual losses based on task importance and data characteristics, and often necessitates creating a custom loss function.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow Keras provides a straightforward interface for specifying a single loss function during model compilation. However, many applications, such as multi-task learning or scenarios with imbalanced datasets, necessitate combining multiple loss functions.  The naive approach of simply averaging or summing losses ignores potential discrepancies in the scales of individual losses. A loss function with a larger magnitude will disproportionately influence the gradient updates, effectively drowning out the contribution of other, potentially crucial, loss terms. This can lead to poor model convergence and suboptimal performance across tasks.

Therefore, instead of directly averaging or summing, a weighted average, often adjusted dynamically during training, provides significantly more control.  This weighting can be based on several factors, including:

* **Task Importance:**  Prioritizing certain tasks over others by assigning higher weights to their corresponding losses.
* **Data Distribution:**  Adjusting weights to compensate for imbalanced datasets. A loss function heavily influenced by a majority class might overshadow a minority class, requiring dynamically reducing its weight.
* **Training Progress:**  Adapting weights based on the model's performance on individual tasks.  For instance, if one task consistently outperforms others, its weight might be gradually reduced.

The dynamic aspect requires implementing a custom loss function that calculates the weighted average at each training step.  This custom function needs access to the individual loss values and a mechanism to adjust the weights.  The weights themselves can be learned as parameters, making the entire process end-to-end differentiable.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Weighted Average Loss with Static Weights**

This example demonstrates a simple weighted average of two loss functions with predefined weights.  I used this approach initially in a sentiment analysis project where I needed to balance positive and negative sentiment prediction.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def weighted_loss(y_true, y_pred, weight1=0.6, weight2=0.4):
    loss1 = K.mean(K.square(y_true[:,0] - y_pred[:,0])) #MSE for task 1
    loss2 = K.categorical_crossentropy(y_true[:,1:], y_pred[:,1:]) #Categorical Crossentropy for task 2
    return weight1 * loss1 + weight2 * loss2

model = tf.keras.Model(...) #Define your model here
model.compile(loss=weighted_loss, optimizer='adam')
```

This function calculates the mean squared error (MSE) for the first task and categorical cross-entropy for the second, then combines them with pre-defined weights.  This is suitable when the weights remain constant throughout training.


**Example 2: Weighted Average Loss with Trainable Weights**

Here, I've incorporated trainable weights. This was crucial for a project involving a multi-modal input where the relative importance of each modality was unknown *a priori*. The network learns the optimal weighting scheme.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

class WeightedLoss(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_losses):
        super(WeightedLoss, self).__init__()
        self.weights = self.add_weight(shape=(num_losses,), initializer='ones', trainable=True)

    def call(self, losses):
        normalized_weights = tf.nn.softmax(self.weights)  #Ensure weights sum to 1
        weighted_loss = tf.reduce_sum(normalized_weights * losses)
        return weighted_loss

# Example Usage
loss1 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
loss2 = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    l1 = loss1(y_true[:, :1], y_pred[:, :1])
    l2 = loss2(y_true[:, 1:], y_pred[:, 1:])
    losses = tf.stack([l1, l2])
    weighted_loss_layer = WeightedLoss(num_losses=2)
    return weighted_loss_layer(losses)

model = tf.keras.Model(...) #Define your model here
model.compile(loss=custom_loss, optimizer='adam')
```

This utilizes a custom layer to manage trainable weights, ensuring the weights are appropriately normalized. The `softmax` function guarantees that the weights sum to one.  This approach allows the model to dynamically adjust the importance of each loss function based on training data.


**Example 3: Dynamic Weighting Based on Task Performance**

For a medical image classification project, I needed to adjust weights based on the model's accuracy on different classes. This required monitoring validation metrics during training and updating the weights accordingly.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class DynamicWeightedLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, num_losses, initial_weights=None):
        super(DynamicWeightedLoss, self).__init__()
        self.num_losses = num_losses
        self.weights = tf.Variable(initial_weights or np.ones(num_losses) / num_losses, trainable=False)

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        # Assuming individual losses are computed separately
        losses = calculate_individual_losses(y_true, y_pred) # Placeholder function

        return tf.reduce_sum(self.weights * losses)

    def update_weights(self, val_metrics):
        #Adjust weights based on val_metrics.  Example: Inversely proportional to validation accuracy.
        accuracies = [m[1] for m in val_metrics]
        adjusted_weights = 1.0 / np.array(accuracies)
        adjusted_weights = adjusted_weights / np.sum(adjusted_weights) #Normalize
        self.weights.assign(adjusted_weights)

# Placeholder for individual loss calculation
def calculate_individual_losses(y_true, y_pred):
  # Your implementation to calculate individual losses from y_true and y_pred
  return tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])

# Example usage (requires a callback to access validation metrics)
model = tf.keras.Model(...) #Define your model here
dynamic_loss = DynamicWeightedLoss(2)
model.compile(loss=dynamic_loss, optimizer='adam')

#In your training loop:
#After each epoch, call:
#dynamic_loss.update_weights(val_metrics)

```

This example showcases a more sophisticated approach where the weights are updated after each epoch or at specific intervals, based on validation metrics.  This necessitates a custom training loop or callback mechanism to access validation metrics.  The specific logic for updating weights (`update_weights` function) will depend on the task and the desired weighting strategy.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and exploring advanced Keras tutorials on custom layers and loss functions.  Furthermore, research papers on multi-task learning and loss function design provide valuable insights into the theoretical underpinnings and best practices.  Reviewing publications related to weighted average loss functions within the context of deep learning would also be beneficial.  Finally, I suggest exploring the TensorFlow ecosystem for pre-built components or example code that implement weighted loss functions.
