The core challenge in parallelizing Keras model training across multiple GPUs lies not in Keras itself, but in the underlying TensorFlow (or Theano, if using an older version) execution engine and its interaction with CUDA.  Directly parallelizing Keras `fit()` calls with simple multiprocessing will not effectively utilize multiple GPUs due to the inherent limitations of TensorFlow's session management and data flow graphs. My experience with high-performance computing in bioinformatics, particularly with large genomic datasets, has repeatedly highlighted this limitation.  While Keras offers some built-in multi-GPU capabilities, true parallelism for independently trained models necessitates a different approach.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Effective multi-GPU training of multiple, independent Keras models requires a strategy that bypasses the limitations of directly parallelizing `model.fit()`.  The key is to create separate TensorFlow sessions for each model and GPU.  Each session manages its own graph and resources, preventing contention and allowing true parallel training. This can be achieved through the use of `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices` to explicitly assign GPUs to specific sessions.  Crucially, this differs from techniques like `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`, which are designed for distributing training across multiple GPUs *within a single model*, not for multiple, independent models.

Furthermore, effective parallelization necessitates careful management of data loading. Simply distributing the entire dataset across processes will lead to significant I/O bottlenecks.  An efficient solution involves partitioning the dataset beforehand and assigning unique data subsets to each training process, minimizing contention on storage resources.  The use of multiprocessing's `Pool` or equivalent constructs alongside appropriate data handling is key to achieving optimal parallel performance.  Ignoring data loading strategies can easily negate any performance gains from multi-GPU processing.

Finally, inter-process communication needs to be managed efficiently. If the individual models need to share information during training (e.g., for collaborative learning techniques), carefully designed communication channels, such as queues or shared memory, should be implemented. For purely independent training, this is not a concern, but it is vital to consider this aspect for more sophisticated parallel training architectures.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate a robust approach, using the `multiprocessing` library and explicit GPU allocation:


**Example 1: Basic Parallel Training with GPU Assignment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import multiprocessing as mp
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

def train_model(gpu_id, data_subset):
    """Trains a single Keras model on a specified GPU."""
    try:
        gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[gpu_id], 'GPU')
        logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")

        model = Sequential([Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), Dense(1)])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
        model.fit(data_subset[0], data_subset[1], epochs=10, verbose=1)  # Adjust epochs as needed

    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error training on GPU {gpu_id}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_gpus = len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
    if num_gpus == 0:
        print("No GPUs found. Exiting.")
        exit()

    #  Assume data is pre-partitioned into num_gpus subsets
    data_subsets = [(x_train_part_i, y_train_part_i) for i in range(num_gpus)]

    with mp.Pool(processes=num_gpus) as pool:
        pool.starmap(train_model, [(i, data_subsets[i]) for i in range(num_gpus)])
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental principle.  Each `train_model` function is executed in a separate process, assigned a specific GPU using `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices`.  Data is pre-partitioned; critical for efficiency. Error handling is essential.


**Example 2:  Enhanced Data Handling with Queues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import multiprocessing as mp
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import numpy as np

def data_generator(queue, x_train, y_train, num_subsets):
    """Generates data subsets for workers"""
    subset_size = len(x_train) // num_subsets
    for i in range(num_subsets):
        start = i * subset_size
        end = (i + 1) * subset_size if i < num_subsets - 1 else len(x_train)
        queue.put((x_train[start:end], y_train[start:end]))

def train_model(gpu_id, queue):
    # ... (same as Example 1, but receives data from queue) ...
    x, y = queue.get()
    model.fit(x, y, epochs=10, verbose=1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ... (GPU check same as Example 1) ...
    num_gpus = len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))

    #Generate Dummy Data
    x_train = np.random.rand(1000,10)
    y_train = np.random.rand(1000,1)

    queue = mp.Queue()
    data_process = mp.Process(target=data_generator, args=(queue, x_train, y_train, num_gpus))
    data_process.start()


    with mp.Pool(processes=num_gpus) as pool:
        pool.starmap(train_model, [(i, queue) for i in range(num_gpus)])

    data_process.join()
```

This example improves upon the first by using a queue to distribute data. This prevents excessive memory usage and provides a more robust method for handling data across processes. The `data_generator` function efficiently partitions the data.


**Example 3:  Model Saving and Metrics Consolidation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import multiprocessing as mp
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import numpy as np
import os

# ... (data_generator and train_model functions as before, modified to save models) ...

def train_model(gpu_id, queue, model_dir):
    # ... (GPU setup and model creation as before) ...
    x, y = queue.get()
    model.fit(x, y, epochs=10, verbose=1)
    model.save(os.path.join(model_dir, f"model_{gpu_id}.h5")) #Save model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ... (GPU check and data generation as in Example 2) ...
    model_dir = "trained_models"
    os.makedirs(model_dir, exist_ok=True)

    with mp.Pool(processes=num_gpus) as pool:
        pool.starmap(train_model, [(i, queue, model_dir) for i in range(num_gpus)])

    #Post Processing - Consolidate results or metrics here
    print("Models trained and saved to:", model_dir)
```

This example adds model saving after training, allowing for later analysis or deployment of individual models. Post-processing to aggregate metrics from each model would be added here based on specific requirements.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training and multi-GPU strategies.  Furthermore, familiarizing yourself with the intricacies of CUDA and its interaction with TensorFlow is highly beneficial.  A good grasp of Python's multiprocessing module and its nuances is also essential.  Finally, exploring materials on parallel computing concepts, including data partitioning and load balancing, will significantly enhance the efficiency of your multi-GPU training setups.
