Efficiently loading a portion of a `uint8_t` or `uint16_t` array into an `_m256i` register, padding with ones, necessitates careful consideration of data alignment and instruction selection.  My experience working on high-performance image processing pipelines has highlighted the importance of avoiding unnecessary memory accesses and leveraging intrinsic functions effectively.  Pre-AVX512, achieving this requires a combination of load operations, bitwise manipulation, and potentially masking techniques.  The most efficient approach depends crucially on the length of the portion loaded and its alignment.

**1. Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in handling the potential mismatch between the data size (8 or 16 bits) and the vector register size (256 bits).  A direct load using `_mm256_loadu_si256` will load exactly 32 bytes, potentially reading beyond the intended portion of the array. This is unacceptable, as it introduces unpredictable behavior and may cause crashes.  Therefore, a careful selection of smaller load operations and subsequent bitwise operations is essential.  If the data is not aligned to 32-byte boundaries, unaligned loads (`_mm256_loadu_si256`) will introduce performance penalties.  Aligned loads (`_mm256_load_si256`) are substantially faster, but require aligning the input data.

The "filling unused bits with ones" requirement implies that we need to perform a bitwise OR operation with a mask.  This mask should have ones in the bit positions corresponding to the unused portion of the `_m256i` register. The mask creation is dependent on the number of bytes loaded. For example, loading 16 bytes requires a mask with the upper 16 bytes set to all ones.  This process is more involved if dealing with unaligned data, as the partial load might not conveniently reside at the beginning of the register.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Loading 16 bytes of uint8_t (aligned)**

```c++
#include <immintrin.h>

__m256i load_and_fill_ones_uint8(const uint8_t* data) {
  // Assuming data is 32-byte aligned.
  __m256i loaded_data = _mm256_load_si256((const __m256i*)data);
  // Create a mask with the upper 16 bytes set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
  __m256i mask = _mm256_set_epi64x(0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, 0, 0);
  // OR the loaded data with the mask.
  return _mm256_or_si256(loaded_data, mask);
}
```

This example leverages the aligned load instruction for optimal performance. The mask is carefully constructed to fill the upper 16 bytes with ones, ensuring that unused portions are set as required.  The efficiency hinges on the prior alignment of the input data.


**Example 2: Loading 8 bytes of uint16_t (unaligned)**

```c++
#include <immintrin.h>

__m256i load_and_fill_ones_uint16_unaligned(const uint16_t* data) {
  // Load 8 bytes (4 uint16_t) using unaligned load.
  __m128i loaded_data = _mm_loadu_si128((const __m128i*)data);
  // Zero-extend to 256 bits.
  __m256i extended_data = _mm256_cvtepu16_epi32(loaded_data);
  // Create a mask with upper 24 bytes set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
  __m256i mask = _mm256_set_epi64x(0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, 0);
  // OR the extended data with the mask.
  return _mm256_or_si256(extended_data, mask);

}
```

This example demonstrates handling unaligned 16-bit data.  We use an unaligned load for `__m128i`, then zero-extend to `__m256i` using `_mm256_cvtepu16_epi32`. Note that this zero-extends only to 32-bit integers. The subsequent mask construction adjusts accordingly for the unaligned load and the subsequent zero-extension. This is less efficient than aligned loads due to the unaligned access penalty.


**Example 3:  Dynamically sized loading (aligned)**

```c++
#include <immintrin.h>

__m256i load_and_fill_ones_dynamic(const uint8_t* data, int num_bytes) {
  if (num_bytes > 32 || num_bytes <= 0) {
    //Handle error condition.  Return a default value or throw an exception.
    return _mm256_set1_epi8(0xFF);
  }

  __m256i loaded_data = _mm256_load_si256((const __m256i*)data); //Assume aligned
  __m256i mask = _mm256_setzero_si256();

  if (num_bytes < 32) {
      //Dynamic mask creation - could be improved with lookup table
      for (int i = num_bytes; i < 32; ++i) {
          mask = _mm256_insert_epi8(mask, 0xFF, i);
      }
      loaded_data = _mm256_or_si256(loaded_data, mask);
  }
  return loaded_data;
}
```

This example showcases dynamic loading capabilities.  Error handling for invalid input sizes is included.  A dynamically generated mask is created using a loop â€“ a less efficient method but avoids extensive `_mm256_set_epi64x` calls. For production environments, a lookup table for pre-computed masks would be a more efficient strategy for performance optimization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Intel Intrinsics Guide: This guide provides detailed documentation on all available intrinsic functions, including those for AVX. It is essential for understanding the capabilities and limitations of each instruction.

*  Agner Fog's Optimizing Software in C++: This book provides in-depth information on optimizing C++ code for x86 processors, covering topics such as memory alignment, loop unrolling, and instruction scheduling.  It is invaluable for low-level performance tuning.

*  Assembly Language for x86 Processors (any reputable author):  A solid grasp of x86 assembly language is extremely helpful for understanding the low-level details of instruction execution and optimization.  This facilitates the optimal utilization of intrinsics and understanding potential bottlenecks.  It provides a deeper comprehension of the underlying hardware.


These resources, coupled with thorough testing and performance profiling, should enable developers to write highly optimized code for loading and manipulating data within AVX registers. Remember to always profile your code to identify the actual performance bottlenecks before implementing complex optimization strategies.  Premature optimization is indeed the root of all evil.
