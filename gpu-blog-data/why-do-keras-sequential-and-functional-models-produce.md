The core distinction between Keras sequential and functional models, leading to potentially different results despite seemingly identical configurations, lies in their underlying graph construction and implicit layer connections, impacting how gradients are computed and applied during training. I've seen this divergence firsthand, particularly when debugging complex architectures involving shared layers or non-linear pathways.

Sequential models are fundamentally linear stacks. Each layer is directly connected to the previous one; there is a strict, one-directional flow of data. This simplifies the model creation process – you are effectively "appending" layers to each other. However, this rigidity can be limiting when building anything beyond a simple feedforward network. Gradients are calculated and propagated through this pre-defined chain, and the optimization process is quite direct.

Functional models, in contrast, construct a directed acyclic graph. Layers are not automatically linked. Instead, you explicitly specify the input tensor(s) to each layer, allowing for much greater freedom in how you design connections. This flexibility is crucial for handling multi-input/output models, residual connections, shared layers, and generally more complex network topologies. The gradient flow is thus defined by this explicit graph structure, rather than the implicit sequential connection. Critically, even when the functional model constructs an architecture that *appears* to mirror a sequential one, the internal representation of the computational graph – and how that interacts with the Keras backend – can cause the optimization dynamics to differ subtly. The exact numerical initialization of weights, and the propagation of gradients through specific functional pathways versus sequential pathways, can cause small but consequential changes in the training.

Consider a simple example: constructing a two-layer feedforward network. A sequential approach would be:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense

# Sequential Model
sequential_model = keras.Sequential([
  Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
sequential_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

Here, the layers are stacked automatically, and `input_shape` is only specified for the first layer. The data flows from the first `Dense` layer directly into the second `Dense` layer.

Now, the functional equivalent:

```python
# Functional Model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = Dense(16, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
functional_model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
functional_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

The functional model accomplishes the same architecture, but the data flow is explicitly defined using layer calls. Although both models represent the same feedforward network, the internal implementations, particularly concerning how the backpropagation algorithm interacts with the computational graph, can slightly diverge, leading to different weights and hence predictions after training. This is often not noticeable in simple cases but can become significant in more complex scenarios.

The slight variance becomes more pronounced with shared layers. Imagine, for example, that we wish to use the same feature extraction layer but then feed its output to two different classification heads. Here's how you might try to build this *incorrectly* using a sequential model. This example will fail because it's forcing a sequential output to be an input for two subsequent layers:

```python
# Incorrect sequential attempt with shared layer
shared_layer = Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))
sequential_model_shared = keras.Sequential([
  shared_layer,
  Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'),
  Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
#This code will cause a build error.
#This is due to how Keras handles Sequential outputs
```

This approach will not work. Sequential models are restricted to a single output flow.  Here, a more appropriate functional representation is required:

```python
# Correct functional implementation with a shared layer
inputs_shared = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
shared_layer_output = Dense(32, activation='relu')(inputs_shared)
output_1 = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(shared_layer_output)
output_2 = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(shared_layer_output)
functional_model_shared = keras.Model(inputs=inputs_shared, outputs=[output_1, output_2])
functional_model_shared.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```
In this functional example, `shared_layer_output` serves as input for *both* subsequent `Dense` layers, correctly expressing the desired shared-layer architecture. This is fundamentally impossible to express within a sequential model construct without workarounds that ultimately re-implement a functional like graph.  The ability to represent this type of branched structure is where the core power of a functional API arises.

Differences in results are more pronounced when batch size is relatively small, and with data with high variance, particularly when coupled with complex and/or deeper neural networks and relatively small datasets, which could be observed in complex image or audio processing tasks. The precise mechanism of backpropagation through the graph will vary because it operates on fundamentally different underlying data structures, even when superficially similar in terms of architecture. There can also be subtle differences stemming from the backend’s (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) implementation of gradient computations when exposed to distinct Keras API calls.

To mitigate any unexpected discrepancies, it's vital to:
1. **Understand your model architecture thoroughly:** If you have branching or shared layers, the functional API is mandatory.
2. **Ensure data preprocessing parity:** Make absolutely sure that the input data is identical for any comparisons between models
3. **Control randomization:** Set random seeds consistently for both models to reduce any potential variation due to initialization or shuffling of training data.
4. **Monitor intermediate outputs:** If debugging unusual discrepancies, visualizing the activations within each layer of both sequential and functional models can help determine the precise source of the differing behaviours.

For more conceptual understanding of deep learning model creation, explore resources covering graph representations of neural networks and computational graphs in general. Consider textbooks on deep learning architectures, which will often explore specific challenges and solutions in more detail. Consult Keras documentation alongside TensorFlow API documentation, because Keras is built on top of and therefore its implementation interacts with TensorFlow's computational graph. Finally, consider practical deep learning courses that emphasize debugging and advanced model design. These will invariably dive into the practical issues that this conceptual question raises.
