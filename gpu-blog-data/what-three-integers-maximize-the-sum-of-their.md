The maximal sum of cosines for three integers is not achieved through a simple analytical solution.  Intuitively, one might expect the integers to cluster around zero, where the cosine function is near its maximum value of 1. However, the discrete nature of the integers and the oscillatory behavior of the cosine function complicate matters.  My experience in developing numerical optimization algorithms for signal processing problems has shown that a brute-force approach, while computationally expensive for larger ranges, offers a reliable method for this specific problem within reasonable bounds.  More sophisticated techniques like gradient ascent are less suitable due to the discontinuous nature of the integer domain.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The problem seeks to find integers *x*, *y*, and *z* that maximize the function:

F(x, y, z) = cos(x) + cos(y) + cos(z)

where *x*, *y*, and *z* are elements of the set of integers, ℤ.  The cosine function, cos(θ), is periodic with a period of 2π.  Therefore, the range of cos(x), cos(y), and cos(z) is [-1, 1]. The maximum possible value of F(x, y, z) is 3, attainable only if cos(x) = cos(y) = cos(z) = 1. This occurs when *x*, *y*, and *z* are integer multiples of 2π, however, since *x, y, z ∈ ℤ*, this condition is only satisfied when *x* = *y* = *z* = 0.  Therefore, while the analytical maximum is 3, we need to find the *best integer approximation* to achieve this.  Searching for the global maximum within a defined range is necessary, and a brute-force search, despite its limitations, proves to be the most practical approach for modest ranges of integer values.  Beyond a certain range, more advanced optimization strategies would become necessary.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to finding the integers that maximize the sum of their cosines within a specified range.  All examples utilize Python, owing to its ease of use for numerical computations and readily available libraries.

**Example 1: Brute-force Search with a defined Range**

This approach iterates through all possible integer combinations within a pre-defined range and identifies the combination that yields the highest sum of cosines.

```python
import math

def max_cosine_sum(range_limit):
    """Finds three integers within a given range that maximize the sum of their cosines.

    Args:
        range_limit: The upper limit of the range of integers to search (inclusive).  Negative values are included.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the three integers and their corresponding maximum cosine sum.
    """
    best_sum = -3.0  # Initialize with the minimum possible sum
    best_integers = (0, 0, 0)  # Initialize with default integers

    for x in range(-range_limit, range_limit + 1):
        for y in range(-range_limit, range_limit + 1):
            for z in range(-range_limit, range_limit + 1):
                current_sum = math.cos(x) + math.cos(y) + math.cos(z)
                if current_sum > best_sum:
                    best_sum = current_sum
                    best_integers = (x, y, z)

    return best_integers, best_sum

range_limit = 10
integers, max_sum = max_cosine_sum(range_limit)
print(f"Integers: {integers}, Maximum Cosine Sum: {max_sum}")

```

This code directly implements the brute-force search. The `range_limit` parameter controls the search space.  Increasing this value dramatically increases computation time.  The output will show the three integers and their corresponding sum.


**Example 2:  Brute-force Search with Optimization (Symmetry)**

This example leverages the symmetry of the cosine function to reduce the computational cost.  Since cos(x) = cos(-x), we only need to search for positive integers and handle the negative counterparts implicitly.

```python
import math

def optimized_max_cosine_sum(range_limit):
  # ... (Similar structure to Example 1, but iterates only through positive integers and adjusts the sum accordingly)
  best_sum = -3.0
  best_integers = (0,0,0)

  for x in range(range_limit + 1):
      for y in range(range_limit + 1):
          for z in range(range_limit + 1):
              # Consider all sign combinations
              sums = [math.cos(x) + math.cos(y) + math.cos(z),
                      math.cos(-x) + math.cos(y) + math.cos(z),
                      math.cos(x) + math.cos(-y) + math.cos(z),
                      math.cos(x) + math.cos(y) + math.cos(-z),
                      math.cos(-x) + math.cos(-y) + math.cos(z),
                      math.cos(-x) + math.cos(y) + math.cos(-z),
                      math.cos(x) + math.cos(-y) + math.cos(-z),
                      math.cos(-x) + math.cos(-y) + math.cos(-z)]
              current_sum = max(sums)

              if current_sum > best_sum:
                  best_sum = current_sum
                  # Determine which combination created max_sum and set best_integers accordingly (implementation omitted for brevity).

  return best_integers, best_sum

range_limit = 10
integers, max_sum = optimized_max_cosine_sum(range_limit)
print(f"Integers: {integers}, Maximum Cosine Sum: {max_sum}")
```

This optimization significantly reduces the number of iterations, but the sign combinations still need to be considered.


**Example 3: Utilizing NumPy for Vectorization**

This approach employs NumPy's vectorization capabilities to achieve faster computations for larger ranges, albeit still using a brute-force strategy.

```python
import numpy as np

def numpy_max_cosine_sum(range_limit):
    # ... (Similar structure but uses NumPy arrays for efficient calculations)
    x = np.arange(-range_limit, range_limit+1)
    y = np.arange(-range_limit, range_limit+1)
    z = np.arange(-range_limit, range_limit+1)
    xv, yv, zv = np.meshgrid(x, y, z)
    cosine_sum = np.cos(xv) + np.cos(yv) + np.cos(zv)
    max_index = np.argmax(cosine_sum)
    best_integers = (xv.flat[max_index], yv.flat[max_index], zv.flat[max_index])
    max_sum = cosine_sum.flat[max_index]

    return best_integers, max_sum

range_limit = 10
integers, max_sum = numpy_max_cosine_sum(range_limit)
print(f"Integers: {integers}, Maximum Cosine Sum: {max_sum}")
```

NumPy's meshgrid and vectorized operations significantly speed up the calculation by avoiding explicit looping. The `argmax` function directly identifies the index of the maximum value.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration into numerical optimization, I recommend consulting texts on numerical analysis and optimization algorithms.  Specifically, studying gradient-based methods, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms will provide insights into alternative techniques suitable for problems with larger search spaces or more complex objective functions.  Furthermore, texts on computational linear algebra are valuable for understanding the linear algebra underpinnings of many optimization algorithms.  Finally, dedicated texts on Python libraries like SciPy and its optimization modules will prove beneficial for practical implementation.
