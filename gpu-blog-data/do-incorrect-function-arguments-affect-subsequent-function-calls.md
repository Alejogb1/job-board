The propagation of errors stemming from incorrect function arguments depends entirely on the function's internal design and the broader application architecture.  In my experience debugging high-performance distributed systems, I've observed that while a faulty argument might not directly impact *all* subsequent function calls, its consequences can cascade unpredictably, leading to subtle, difficult-to-trace bugs. This isn't a simple yes or no answer; it hinges on crucial factors such as state management, exception handling, and the overall programming paradigm.

1. **Explanation:**  A function's behavior in the face of incorrect arguments depends on how it handles such inputs.  Robust functions typically employ error checking mechanisms – input validation – before proceeding with their core logic. This validation might involve checking data types, ranges, or the presence of necessary fields.  If the validation fails, the function might: a) raise an exception, halting execution and potentially propagating the error to a higher level; b) return an error code or a special value signifying failure; or c) silently handle the error, potentially producing unexpected or incorrect results.  This last case is the most dangerous, as the error remains hidden, only manifesting itself later in seemingly unrelated parts of the code.

The crucial factor to consider is whether the function modifies any global state or shared resources.  If an incorrectly passed argument leads to the corruption of such a resource (e.g., writing to an incorrect memory location, altering a shared database entry), subsequent function calls that depend on that resource will inevitably be affected.  The incorrect state persists, contaminating further computations. Conversely, if a function operates solely on its local input and does not modify any global state, the error will likely be contained within that single function call.

Another pivotal aspect is the programming language and its inherent error-handling mechanisms.  Languages with strong typing and robust exception handling (like Java or C#) often provide better safeguards against the propagation of errors stemming from incorrect arguments.  In contrast, languages with weaker typing (like Python or JavaScript) might be more susceptible to silent errors.

2. **Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Python – Illustrating contained error handling:**

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle.  Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully."""
    try:
        length = float(length)
        width = float(width)
        if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
            return -1  # Error code indicating invalid input
        return length * width
    except ValueError:
        return -1


area1 = calculate_area(5, 10)  # Correct: area1 = 50.0
area2 = calculate_area("abc", 10) # Incorrect: area2 = -1
area3 = calculate_area(5, -2)  # Incorrect: area3 = -1

print(f"Area 1: {area1}, Area 2: {area2}, Area 3: {area3}")
```

This example uses a `try-except` block to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions arising from non-numeric inputs. The function returns a specific error code (-1) signaling invalid arguments, preventing the error from propagating.  Subsequent calls remain unaffected.

**Example 2: C++ – Demonstrating exception propagation:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

double calculate_average(int values[], int size) {
  if (size <= 0) {
    throw std::invalid_argument("Array size must be positive.");
  }
  double sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    sum += values[i];
  }
  return sum / size;
}

int main() {
  int data1[] = {10, 20, 30};
  int data2[] = {};

  try {
    double avg1 = calculate_average(data1, 3);
    std::cout << "Average 1: " << avg1 << std::endl;
    double avg2 = calculate_average(data2, 0);  // Throws exception
    std::cout << "Average 2: " << avg2 << std::endl;
  } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Here, an `std::invalid_argument` exception is thrown if the array size is invalid. This exception propagates up the call stack, handled in the `main` function's `try-catch` block.  If unhandled, the program would terminate.  The important point is the explicit error propagation.

**Example 3: JavaScript – Illustrating silent failure (and its dangers):**

```javascript
function processData(data) {
  // Assume data is an object with a 'value' property
  if (data && data.value) {
    globalCounter += data.value; // Modifies global state
  }
}

let globalCounter = 0;
processData({ value: 10 });     // Correct: globalCounter = 10
processData({ value: 20 });     // Correct: globalCounter = 30
processData(null);             // Incorrect: No error, but globalCounter remains 30
processData({ other: 30 });    // Incorrect: No error, but globalCounter remains 30
processData({ value: "abc" }); // Incorrect: No error, but behavior undefined

console.log(globalCounter); // Potential for unexpected behavior due to silent failures
```

This JavaScript example demonstrates a dangerous scenario.  The function silently ignores invalid inputs, leaving `globalCounter` unmodified.  Subsequent calls are impacted because the global state is not updated correctly.  This exemplifies the hidden dangers of not handling incorrect arguments meticulously.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

*   Effective C++ by Scott Meyers (for C++ error handling and resource management).
*   Code Complete by Steve McConnell (for general software construction best practices, including input validation).
*   Clean Code by Robert C. Martin (for writing robust and maintainable code).  These resources provide detailed guidance on designing functions that gracefully handle incorrect arguments, minimizing the risk of error propagation.  Focusing on exception handling, defensive programming techniques, and robust input validation will help you mitigate this issue significantly.  Thorough testing is also vital to reveal subtle errors caused by incorrect arguments.
