Kernel regularization in TensorFlow, specifically in the context of neural networks, is **not automatically included** as part of the default loss calculation in TensorFlow 2.5, or any version. It is a crucial, but user-specified, element of the training process designed to mitigate overfitting by penalizing large weight values within network layers. While TensorFlow provides tools to define and apply kernel regularization, it requires explicit instantiation and integration with the model's loss function. My experience working extensively with complex convolutional and recurrent networks has made it clear that a misunderstanding of this point is a common source of errors in training.

To elaborate, kernel regularization aims to add a penalty term to the loss function based on the weights of the network's layers. This encourages the network to use smaller weights, promoting simpler solutions less likely to overfit the training data. There are several types of regularization commonly used, such as L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights to the loss, encouraging sparsity, meaning many weights will be driven to zero, which can be beneficial for feature selection. L2 regularization adds the sum of squared weights to the loss, which encourages smaller, more evenly distributed weights.

The crucial point is that, while Keras, a high-level API integrated within TensorFlow, provides convenient hooks for these regularization techniques, they are **opt-in**, not automatic. The default loss calculation in TensorFlow only considers the model's prediction error against the true labels of the training data; regularization penalties are an entirely separate consideration that I have to explicitly define and enable.

The manner in which you integrate regularization is typically through the use of regularizers within layer definitions themselves. The Keras API lets us specify these when creating individual layers, not as a global setting, hence its non-automatic nature. This allows us to tailor the regularization strength for each layer if needed. A typical workflow involves defining a regularizer (L1 or L2 or a combination) and then, during model building, pass it into relevant layer objects. During loss computation and gradient calculation, TensorFlow, in its inner workings, includes the regularizer loss as a penalty term to the core loss defined via the `loss` argument in the model's `compile` method.

Let's illustrate with a code example of a simple feedforward neural network with L2 regularization applied to its dense layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu',
                          kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01),  # L2 regularization
                          input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax',
                          kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)) # L2 regularization
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example training data. In a real scenario this would come from a dataset.
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000).astype(np.int32)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

In this snippet, I explicitly enabled L2 regularization with a lambda value of `0.01` using `kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)` on both dense layers. Without this, only the classification loss, represented by `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`, would be considered when training. The lambda value controls the regularization strength. Smaller values correspond to weaker regularization, and larger values to stronger. The choice of regularization type (L1, L2, or a combination) and its strength is a matter of experimentation and validation during the model development.

Next, consider another instance with L1 regularization applied to only one layer in the network, while the other remains free of any regularization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu',
                          kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.005),  # L1 regularization
                          input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # No regularization applied to this layer
])


# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example training data. In a real scenario this would come from a dataset.
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000).astype(np.int32)


# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)

```

Here, the L1 regularization is applied solely to the first hidden layer, demonstrating that regularization can be applied selectively and independently to the different components of a neural network. This provides an avenue for granular control over the learning process. Note that the second layer is not penalized in any way using regularization.

Finally, consider a situation where both L1 and L2 regularization are applied jointly to the same layer. This could be beneficial in specific modeling scenarios where both sparsity and small weights are desired at the same time:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu',
                          kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1_l2(l1=0.005, l2=0.01),  # L1 and L2 regularization
                          input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example training data. In a real scenario this would come from a dataset.
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000).astype(np.int32)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

In this case, an `l1_l2` regularizer has been instantiated with both `l1` and `l2` penalty values specified. The resulting loss will be the combination of the primary training loss and penalties for both L1 and L2 norms of the first layer's weights.

In conclusion, based on my experience of building, deploying and debugging many machine learning models, kernel regularization is not automatically included in TensorFlow 2.5 or in any other version I have encountered. It is an important tool in the arsenal of preventing overfitting, however, I have to explicitly include it. There are many resources available to better understand it. The TensorFlow documentation, especially its Keras API section provides a detailed breakdown of the regularization options available within `tf.keras.regularizers`, as well as tutorials that often include practical examples. Standard machine learning textbooks, such as *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow et al., explain the theoretical foundations of different regularizations, including L1 and L2. Lastly, online courses focusing on machine learning with TensorFlow often contain practical sessions and coding assignments covering the use of these regularization techniques. Consult these resources to get a more thorough understanding of its applications.
