The core challenge in creating a custom TensorFlow loss function with filtering lies not in the TensorFlow mechanics themselves, but in efficiently and correctly implementing the filtering logic within the computational graph.  My experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models highlighted the importance of minimizing redundant computations during loss calculation, especially when dealing with substantial datasets and complex filtering criteria.  A poorly structured custom loss function can dramatically increase training time and even lead to instability.

The fundamental approach involves constructing a loss function that operates only on a subset of the predicted and true values, determined by your filter.  This subset is generated based on a condition that evaluates each element (or batch element) of your tensors.  TensorFlow's conditional operations and tensor manipulation tools are key to achieving this efficiently.  We avoid explicit looping whenever possible, leveraging TensorFlow's vectorized operations for performance.

Let's explore three scenarios demonstrating different filtering strategies within custom TensorFlow loss functions.

**Example 1:  Filtering based on a binary mask**

This is the simplest case.  Imagine you have a binary mask tensor (`mask_tensor`) of the same shape as your predictions (`predictions`) and ground truth (`ground_truth`).  The mask indicates which elements should contribute to the loss calculation (1 for inclusion, 0 for exclusion).

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def masked_mse_loss(ground_truth, predictions, mask_tensor):
  """
  Calculates the mean squared error (MSE) loss only for elements where mask_tensor is 1.
  Args:
    ground_truth: Tensor of ground truth values.
    predictions: Tensor of predicted values.
    mask_tensor: Binary mask tensor.

  Returns:
    The masked MSE loss.
  """
  masked_ground_truth = tf.boolean_mask(ground_truth, mask_tensor)
  masked_predictions = tf.boolean_mask(predictions, mask_tensor)
  mse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(masked_predictions - masked_ground_truth))
  return mse

# Example usage
ground_truth = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
predictions = tf.constant([1.2, 1.8, 3.5, 3.8])
mask_tensor = tf.constant([True, False, True, True], dtype=bool)

loss = masked_mse_loss(ground_truth, predictions, mask_tensor)
print(f"Masked MSE Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example uses `tf.boolean_mask` to efficiently select elements based on the boolean mask.  This operation directly creates new tensors containing only the relevant data, avoiding unnecessary computations on masked-out elements.  The `tf.reduce_mean` then calculates the mean squared error only for the selected elements.


**Example 2: Filtering based on a threshold**

Here, we filter based on a condition applied element-wise.  For instance, we might only consider predictions with confidence above a certain threshold.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def thresholded_mae_loss(ground_truth, predictions, threshold):
    """
    Calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) loss only for predictions above a threshold.
    Args:
      ground_truth: Tensor of ground truth values.
      predictions: Tensor of predicted values.
      threshold: The confidence threshold.

    Returns:
      The thresholded MAE loss.
    """
    mask = tf.greater(predictions, threshold)
    masked_ground_truth = tf.boolean_mask(ground_truth, mask)
    masked_predictions = tf.boolean_mask(predictions, mask)
    mae = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(masked_predictions - masked_ground_truth))
    return mae

# Example Usage
ground_truth = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
predictions = tf.constant([1.2, 1.8, 3.5, 0.5])
threshold = 1.5

loss = thresholded_mae_loss(ground_truth, predictions, threshold)
print(f"Thresholded MAE Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates filtering based on the `tf.greater` function, creating a boolean mask.  Again, `tf.boolean_mask` is utilized for efficient selection.  This method is scalable and avoids explicit loops, suitable for large tensors.


**Example 3:  Filtering based on a complex condition involving multiple tensors**

More intricate filtering might require combining multiple conditions.  Consider a scenario where we filter based on both a prediction threshold and a corresponding value in a separate tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def complex_filtered_loss(ground_truth, predictions, confidence_scores, threshold):
    """
    Calculates a custom loss function filtering based on both prediction confidence and a separate score.
    Args:
      ground_truth: Ground truth values.
      predictions: Predicted values.
      confidence_scores: Confidence scores for each prediction.
      threshold: Minimum confidence required.
    Returns:
      The filtered loss.  Returns 0.0 if no elements meet criteria to prevent errors.
    """
    mask = tf.logical_and(tf.greater(predictions, threshold), tf.greater(confidence_scores, 0.8))
    masked_ground_truth = tf.boolean_mask(ground_truth, mask)
    masked_predictions = tf.boolean_mask(predictions, mask)

    if tf.size(masked_predictions) == 0:
        return tf.constant(0.0)

    custom_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(masked_predictions - masked_ground_truth) * confidence_scores)
    return custom_loss

#Example Usage
ground_truth = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
predictions = tf.constant([1.2, 1.8, 3.5, 0.5])
confidence_scores = tf.constant([0.9, 0.7, 0.95, 0.6])
threshold = 1.5

loss = complex_filtered_loss(ground_truth, predictions, confidence_scores, threshold)
print(f"Complex Filtered Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

```

This example combines multiple conditions using `tf.logical_and`.  Crucially, it includes a check for an empty masked tensor using `tf.size`, preventing potential errors from attempting operations on empty tensors.  This robust approach is essential when dealing with dynamic filtering criteria.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops and loss functions.
* TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation and conditional operations.
* A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering advanced loss function design.  Pay close attention to sections on gradient calculations and backpropagation.


These examples illustrate constructing efficient and adaptable custom loss functions with filtering in TensorFlow.  Remember that careful consideration of the filtering logic and the use of TensorFlow's optimized operations are vital for performance and stability in training complex models. The added error handling and efficiency considerations are critical for practical application and scalability of your custom loss functions.
