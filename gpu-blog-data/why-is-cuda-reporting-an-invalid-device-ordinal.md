The "invalid device ordinal" error in CUDA when using Python 3.9 typically stems from a mismatch between the CUDA context requested by the application and the available CUDA-capable devices on the system.  This error, in my experience debugging high-performance computing applications over the past decade,  is often rooted in issues related to device enumeration, driver configuration, or inconsistencies between the CUDA toolkit version and the NVIDIA driver installed.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The CUDA runtime library manages access to NVIDIA GPUs.  Each GPU accessible to the system is assigned a unique ordinal number, starting from 0.  When a CUDA application requests a specific device using a device ordinal (e.g., `cudaSetDevice(0)`), it implicitly indicates which GPU it intends to use. The "invalid device ordinal" error arises when the requested ordinal is out of bounds; meaning either no GPU is available, or the specified ordinal exceeds the number of accessible devices.  This could be due to several factors:

* **No CUDA-capable devices detected:** The system might lack compatible NVIDIA GPUs, or the NVIDIA driver might not be properly installed or configured.  This is often manifested by the system reporting zero accessible devices.

* **Incorrect device ordinal:** The application might be attempting to access a device that does not exist. For instance, requesting device 3 when only devices 0, 1, and 2 are available will trigger this error. This is frequently an issue in multi-GPU systems where the application logic incorrectly assumes a specific device configuration.

* **Driver mismatches:** An incompatibility between the CUDA toolkit version and the NVIDIA driver can lead to inaccurate device enumeration.  The driver might report a different number of devices than the CUDA runtime expects, causing the requested ordinal to be invalid.

* **Permissions issues:** In some rarer cases, the user might lack the necessary permissions to access the requested CUDA device.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these scenarios with Python code examples using the `cupy` library (a NumPy-compatible array library for CUDA), which is often preferred for its user-friendly interface in Python.  Remember that these examples must be executed within an environment correctly configured with CUDA and the necessary libraries.

**Example 1: Handling No Available Devices:**

```python
import cupy as cp

try:
    # Attempt to get the number of devices
    num_devices = cp.cuda.runtime.getDeviceCount()
    if num_devices == 0:
        raise RuntimeError("No CUDA-capable devices found.")

    # Choose device 0 (assuming at least one device exists)
    cp.cuda.Device(0).use()
    print("Successfully selected device 0.")
    #Further CUDA operations here...
    
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except cp.cuda.runtime.CUDARuntimeError as e:
    print(f"CUDA Runtime Error: {e}")
```

This code first checks for the presence of CUDA devices.  If no devices are found, a `RuntimeError` is raised, preventing the code from attempting to access a non-existent device.  Error handling ensures robust application behaviour even in the absence of GPUs.


**Example 2:  Explicit Device Selection:**

```python
import cupy as cp
import os

try:
    os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0" #Explicitly selects device 0.  Change this as needed

    cp.cuda.Device(0).use()
    print("Successfully selected device 0.")
    # Further CUDA operations here...
    
except cp.cuda.runtime.CUDARuntimeError as e:
    print(f"CUDA Runtime Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


```

This example demonstrates explicit device selection using the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. This allows you to precisely define which GPU(s) your application should see, reducing the risk of accessing an invalid ordinal.  This approach is beneficial when dealing with multiple GPUs, particularly in server environments where device management is crucial.


**Example 3: Iterating Through Devices (Robust Approach):**


```python
import cupy as cp

try:
    num_devices = cp.cuda.runtime.getDeviceCount()
    print(f"Found {num_devices} CUDA-capable devices.")

    for i in range(num_devices):
        try:
            cp.cuda.Device(i).use()
            print(f"Successfully selected device {i}.")
            # Perform CUDA operations on device i.  Example:
            x = cp.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=cp.float32)
            print(f"Device {i}: Array x = {x}")
            #Clean up
            cp.cuda.Device(i).synchronize()
        except cp.cuda.runtime.CUDARuntimeError as e:
            print(f"Error accessing device {i}: {e}")

except cp.cuda.runtime.CUDARuntimeError as e:
    print(f"CUDA Runtime Error: {e}")

```

This robust example iterates through all available devices, attempting to access and perform a simple operation on each.  It includes comprehensive error handling for each device, allowing the application to gracefully continue even if some devices are unavailable or inaccessible. This iterative approach is essential when handling dynamic GPU configurations.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation provides comprehensive details on CUDA programming, including device management. Consult the CUDA Programming Guide and the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide for thorough information. The NVIDIA Developer website also offers many tutorials and examples to aid in troubleshooting CUDA related errors.  Examining the logs from the NVIDIA driver and system logs can provide valuable clues to diagnose driver and hardware issues. Familiarize yourself with the error codes and messages documented in the CUDA runtime library's error handling section. Understanding how to effectively use the CUDA profiler for performance analysis and debugging is valuable.  Finally, thorough testing across diverse hardware configurations is crucial for producing reliable CUDA applications.
