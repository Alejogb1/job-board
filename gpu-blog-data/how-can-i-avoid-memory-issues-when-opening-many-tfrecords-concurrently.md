Directly addressing the inherent limitation of file handle exhaustion and the overhead of maintaining numerous open file descriptors is paramount when concurrently accessing multiple TFRecord files. My experience migrating a large-scale image processing pipeline to TensorFlow taught me that naively opening numerous TFRecord files simultaneously can swiftly lead to memory pressure and system instability, specifically manifesting as "Too many open files" errors or performance degradation due to excessive context switching. The underlying issue isn't solely about memory usage, but rather the finite resources allocated by the operating system to manage open files.

The typical approach of using `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` and iterating through the dataset inherently involves opening files. If multiple such datasets are created concurrently, either in separate threads or processes, each attempting to hold open file descriptors to the corresponding TFRecord files, the operating system's limit on file descriptors can quickly be exceeded. This is because `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` does not inherently manage or pool these resources; it simply acts as an abstraction over file access. Consequently, directly opening hundreds or thousands of TFRecord datasets concurrently will almost certainly trigger problems.

To circumvent this limitation, a strategy focused on shared access and controlled resource usage is crucial. There are two primary paths for achieving this: leveraging inter-process sharing with a file access queue and constructing a more efficient dataset loading strategy within the same process using prefetching.

**Inter-Process Sharing with a File Access Queue**

When dealing with distributed processing or situations where several independent scripts might be concurrently accessing the same collection of TFRecord files, the most robust approach involves introducing a centralized file access mechanism using a message queue. This decouples the data retrieval logic from the TFRecord dataset instantiation logic, mitigating resource contention across different processes. The general idea is to create a worker process responsible for opening and streaming data from TFRecord files, using, for instance, `tf.data.TFRecordDataset.from_tensor_slices`, and a message queue where the datasets to stream are placed. This shared-resource architecture ensures that only a limited number of file descriptors are active at any given moment. Other processes communicate with the worker by adding files to the message queue.

```python
# Example: Worker process for reading TFRecords (simplified)
import tensorflow as tf
import queue
import time
import multiprocessing as mp

def worker(message_queue, output_queue):
    while True:
        try:
            file_path = message_queue.get(timeout=1) # Wait with timeout to check for exit condition
            if file_path is None:
              break

            dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_path)
            for record in dataset:
               output_queue.put(record)
            dataset = None # release tf dataset
            del dataset
            tf.keras.backend.clear_session() # Attempt to clear graph
            time.sleep(0.001)
        except queue.Empty:
            continue


def request_data(message_queue, file_path):
  message_queue.put(file_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Setup Test Files
    example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={'test': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[1,2,3]))}))
    serialized_example = example.SerializeToString()
    for i in range(3):
      with tf.io.TFRecordWriter("test_file_"+str(i)+".tfrecord") as writer:
        for _ in range(2):
          writer.write(serialized_example)


    message_queue = mp.Queue()
    output_queue = mp.Queue()

    worker_process = mp.Process(target=worker, args=(message_queue, output_queue))
    worker_process.start()

    # Example of submitting tasks from main process
    for i in range(3):
      request_data(message_queue,"test_file_"+str(i)+".tfrecord")

    # Signal worker to exit
    message_queue.put(None)

    # Retrieve all data
    while not output_queue.empty():
      print(output_queue.get())

    worker_process.join()

```

In this example, the worker process continuously checks the `message_queue` for new file paths. Upon receiving a path, it creates a `TFRecordDataset`, iterates through the records, pushes them to the `output_queue`, clears the dataset and TF Graph and then waits. The main process can submit an arbitrary number of file paths without exceeding the system limits. Important to note that the `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` is needed to prevent OOM errors in the worker process when loading many datasets. Also a small `time.sleep` delay helps with releasing resources. This code uses multiprocessing but similar principles apply with multithreading, given that Python's GIL is taken into account.

**Efficient Dataset Loading within a Single Process using Prefetching**

When concurrent access occurs within the same process, for example, during training with multiple epochs of data, the approach must be refined further. While sharing resources among threads with `Queue` as above can be useful, the same effect can be achieved by utilizing the more performant `tf.data` API, avoiding the overhead of additional processes or shared queue operations.  In this case, it is key to leverage `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` with carefully chosen `num_parallel_calls` and `cycle_length` arguments. The `interleave` method allows to load multiple TFRecord datasets in parallel without opening all of them concurrently. Each file can be read in a sequential manner, avoiding the OS limits. Prefetching is critical in this context as it ensures that the data pipeline is not throttled by the I/O bound operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_dataset_from_files(file_paths, num_parallel_calls, cycle_length, block_length):
    files = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(file_paths)
    dataset = files.interleave(
          lambda file_path: tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_path),
          cycle_length=cycle_length,
          num_parallel_calls=num_parallel_calls,
        block_length = block_length,
        deterministic=False
    )
    return dataset

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Setup Test Files
    example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={'test': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[1,2,3]))}))
    serialized_example = example.SerializeToString()
    for i in range(10):
      with tf.io.TFRecordWriter("test_file_"+str(i)+".tfrecord") as writer:
        for _ in range(20):
          writer.write(serialized_example)


    file_paths = ["test_file_"+str(i)+".tfrecord" for i in range(10)]
    num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE
    cycle_length=4
    block_length = 2


    dataset = create_dataset_from_files(file_paths, num_parallel_calls, cycle_length, block_length).batch(10)


    for batch in dataset:
        print(batch)

```

Here, `create_dataset_from_files` establishes an interleaved dataset. `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` allows TensorFlow to automatically determine the optimal number of datasets to interleave concurrently. `cycle_length` controls the number of datasets to cycle through and `block_length` defines the length of the read chunk from each dataset. Setting `deterministic=False` can also boost performance by allowing data to be read in a non-deterministic manner. Combined, these parameters regulate the degree of concurrent file opening, effectively avoiding memory exhaustion. Further performance can be achieved by adding `.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` to the dataset.

**Controlled Batch Processing with Partitioning and Shuffling**

When dealing with massive datasets spread across numerous TFRecord files, partitioning the data loading process into smaller manageable batches combined with shuffling can mitigate the memory overhead. Instead of loading all data at once, which requires all file handles to be active, a strategy involving `tf.data.Dataset.shard` and controlled shuffling can be more suitable. This technique ensures that only a fraction of the dataset is loaded at any given point, and the file handles are only open for a small batch of data at a time.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_sharded_dataset(file_paths, num_shards, shard_index, batch_size):
    files = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(file_paths)
    sharded_files = files.shard(num_shards, shard_index)
    dataset = sharded_files.interleave(
          lambda file_path: tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_path),
          cycle_length=tf.data.AUTOTUNE,
          num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE,
        deterministic=False
    )
    shuffled_dataset = dataset.shuffle(1000).batch(batch_size)
    return shuffled_dataset

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Setup Test Files
    example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={'test': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[1,2,3]))}))
    serialized_example = example.SerializeToString()
    for i in range(10):
      with tf.io.TFRecordWriter("test_file_"+str(i)+".tfrecord") as writer:
        for _ in range(20):
          writer.write(serialized_example)


    file_paths = ["test_file_"+str(i)+".tfrecord" for i in range(10)]
    num_shards = 4
    batch_size = 10

    for shard_index in range(num_shards):
        sharded_dataset = create_sharded_dataset(file_paths, num_shards, shard_index, batch_size)
        print(f"Shard {shard_index}:")
        for batch in sharded_dataset:
            print(batch)
```

In this example, the dataset is partitioned using `.shard()` into `num_shards` equal parts, with each shard processed separately. The `shuffle()` method further enhances the randomness of the data, promoting better training results. This allows us to perform distributed training or to process the data in manageable batches without exhausting file descriptors. This method assumes that the data is independent, and can be processed independently by each shard.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of data loading in TensorFlow, the official TensorFlow documentation concerning the `tf.data` API is essential. Additionally, reading resources detailing operating system limitations on file descriptors is beneficial. Exploration of the TensorFlow code base itself, specifically the implementation of `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` and related functions can reveal inner workings that are not immediately evident from the higher-level API.  Lastly, researching the various interleave options and their implications for performance is worthwhile. These methods can be adapted based on the precise requirements, data distribution, and computational context.
