Transfer learning with Inception Resnet v2, while often a robust approach, can exhibit surprisingly poor test accuracy when misapplied. My experience working on image classification projects has highlighted several specific culprits which frequently derail the process. The core problem stems from a misalignment between the pre-trained model's knowledge and the target dataset's characteristics.

Firstly, the pre-trained weights of Inception Resnet v2 are derived from training on large datasets such as ImageNet. These datasets primarily contain images representing everyday objects and scenes with particular statistical distributions. If the target dataset significantly deviates from this distribution – in terms of image style, texture, color, or the nature of the objects – then the pre-trained features will not generalize well. For example, attempting to classify medical images like retinal scans with weights trained on photographs of cats and dogs is a classic case where performance will suffer drastically. The model's lower-level features, which are primarily responsible for identifying edges, corners, and color gradients, may not be the most discriminative features for a different modality.

Secondly, the degree to which the pre-trained model's layers are frozen during transfer learning plays a crucial role. If the entire model is frozen except for a newly added classifier layer, it is highly likely that the specific nuanced features unique to the target data will not be captured. The model will primarily be using the features it was originally trained on, leading to underfitting. Conversely, if all layers are unfrozen and then trained with a small target dataset, the pre-trained weights will rapidly adapt, but there's a significant risk of overfitting. In essence, the model forgets its generalized knowledge and becomes highly specialized to noise and biases present in the new dataset. The ideal scenario typically lies somewhere in between these two extremes, involving a gradual unfreezing process or careful layer-specific learning rates.

Thirdly, insufficient data augmentation represents another frequent obstacle to effective transfer learning. The ImageNet dataset, on which Inception Resnet v2 was trained, features significant variability in the image examples. When applying the model to a smaller, less diverse dataset, this can cause the classifier to rely too heavily on incidental characteristics of training examples and fail to learn useful features. Data augmentation serves to increase the variability of the training data by generating variations of existing samples (e.g., by rotating, cropping, flipping, or changing color characteristics), thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing generalization.

Finally, the choice of the final classification layer and its training procedure impacts test performance substantially. A naive approach, such as replacing the top layer with a randomly initialized, fully connected layer and then performing a few epochs of training, will likely not produce satisfactory results. The classifier must be tailored to the specific nature of the target task. For example, depending on the classification task, a classifier with a different structure or number of neurons may be more suitable. Additionally, the selection of the appropriate loss function and optimizer for the training process has to align with the dataset size and classification problem.

Here are three examples to illustrate these pitfalls, along with code using Python with TensorFlow/Keras and accompanying commentaries:

**Example 1: Incorrect layer freezing and unfrozing strategy.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionResNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load the pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 model
base_model = InceptionResNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(299, 299, 3))

# Add a custom classifier layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x) # num_classes would be defined somewhere in the code

# Create the final model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Freeze all the layers in the base model (Problematic for transfer learning)
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
# model.fit(...) # Placeholder, should be dataset
```

In this example, the pre-trained layers are completely frozen. Although this speeds up training, the model will lack the flexibility to learn new features necessary for optimal performance on the new dataset. The pre-trained features become static and cannot adapt to the specific characteristics of the target images, leading to low test accuracy. A better approach would involve a more nuanced unfreezing strategy.

**Example 2: Insufficient data augmentation.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionResNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Define data generator without augmentation
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255) # only rescaling performed
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    train_data_dir, # Placeholder, should be path to training dataset
    target_size=(299, 299),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical')

# Load the pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 model
base_model = InceptionResNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(299, 299, 3))

# Add a custom classifier layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the final model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Unfreeze some layers
for layer in base_model.layers[:500]: #Unfreezing a significant portion, but not all
    layer.trainable = False

for layer in base_model.layers[500:]:
    layer.trainable = True

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Train the model
# model.fit(train_generator,...) # Placeholder, should be dataset and other params
```

This example showcases a situation where the data augmentation is minimal. Only rescaling is performed. Consequently, the model may overfit on the variations available in the training data and generalize poorly to unseen instances. The lack of diversity in the training dataset leads to the model learning spurious correlations. A more appropriate approach would include transformations such as rotations, shifts, zooms, or flips in the `ImageDataGenerator`, which effectively increases the size of the training dataset and improves robustness.

**Example 3: Mismatched classification layer and training settings.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionResNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Load the pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 model
base_model = InceptionResNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(299, 299, 3))

# Add a too simple custom classifier layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
predictions = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x) #Only 1 layer here

# Create the final model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Unfreeze some layers
for layer in base_model.layers[:500]:
    layer.trainable = False
for layer in base_model.layers[500:]:
    layer.trainable = True


# Compile the model (Using a learning rate which is probably too high)
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=0.01), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
# model.fit(train_generator,validation_data=validation_generator,
#           callbacks = [EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)],...) # Placeholder, training data
```

This example has only one dense classification layer and a high learning rate of 0.01. For more complex classification problems, a single layer might not be sufficient. A more complex classification head with multiple layers and perhaps even dropouts might be necessary for good results.  Furthermore, this example uses a higher learning rate. This might be beneficial for initial phases of training, but might be too high during fine-tuning and could cause unstable performance. Often a lower learning rate and techniques such as early stopping or learning rate decay are necessary for proper convergence.

In summary, consistently low test accuracy with Inception Resnet v2 after transfer learning typically indicates a mismatch between the pre-trained model's assumptions and the specific properties of the target task. Addressing these issues requires careful consideration of the data characteristics, the fine-tuning strategy, data augmentation techniques, and the final classification layer design and training procedure. Experimentation with these elements is essential to obtaining good results. For further learning, I would recommend resources that cover advanced transfer learning techniques, data augmentation methods, and model fine-tuning strategies. Consulting research papers discussing specific transfer learning scenarios for datasets similar to yours could also be helpful. Furthermore, books focusing on deep learning implementation with TensorFlow or Keras would be beneficial.
