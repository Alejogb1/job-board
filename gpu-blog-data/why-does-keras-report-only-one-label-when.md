The discrepancy between a Keras model's predicted output and the expected number of labels almost always stems from an inconsistency between the model's output layer configuration and the intended multi-label classification task.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects has shown this to be the primary source of such errors.  The model, despite being trained on data with three distinct labels, is effectively configured to predict only a single label due to an incorrectly specified output layer.  This manifests as a single prediction instead of a vector of three probabilities, one for each label.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras, a high-level API for building and training neural networks, relies on the architecture you define to determine its behavior.  For multi-label classification, where each data point can belong to multiple categories simultaneously, the output layer must explicitly reflect this.  Specifically, the output layer's activation function and the number of neurons must align with the number of labels. Using a sigmoid activation function with a number of neurons equal to the number of labels is crucial.  A single neuron with a sigmoid activation will produce a single probability score, representing the likelihood of belonging to a single class. This is the standard binary classification scenario.  However, if you are working with multi-label classification, and your model is designed using a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function, you are inherently limiting the model to predict only one label, even if your training data contains multiple labels per sample.  The model learns a single probability score, ignoring the existence of the other two classes.

Conversely, a multi-label classification task requires an output layer with as many neurons as there are labels (in this case, three), each employing a sigmoid activation function. Each neuron independently outputs a probability between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the instance belonging to the corresponding class.  These individual probabilities are then interpreted together to determine the complete label set for each input.  Failure to use this setup results in the single-label prediction you are experiencing.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the correct and incorrect ways to configure a Keras model for three-label multi-label classification.  I’ve faced this exact issue before when transitioning from binary image classification to multi-label image classification. Initially, I overlooked the output layer configuration, leading to the single-label prediction.

**Example 1: Incorrect Configuration – Single Label Prediction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... other layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Incorrect: Single neuron output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',  # Incorrect loss function for multi-label
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training ...

predictions = model.predict(test_data) # predictions will be a single probability value.
```

This code snippet showcases a typical mistake. The `Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')` layer produces a single output neuron, which is inadequate for multi-label classification with three labels. The binary cross-entropy loss function is also incorrect; it's designed for binary classification. This leads to the model learning a single probability, hence the single-label output.


**Example 2: Correct Configuration – Multi-label Prediction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... other layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='sigmoid') # Correct: Three neuron output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy', # Correct loss function for multi-label
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training ...

predictions = model.predict(test_data) # predictions will be an array of three probabilities.
```

This corrected example uses `Dense(3, activation='sigmoid')`, creating three output neurons, one for each label. Each neuron produces a probability score, allowing the model to predict multiple labels concurrently. The `binary_crossentropy` loss function remains appropriate as it computes the loss independently for each label.


**Example 3:  Alternative Loss Function**

While binary cross-entropy is suitable,  `categorical_crossentropy` is sometimes used incorrectly in a multi-label scenario. This would be incorrect because it assumes mutually exclusive labels whereas we are dealing with labels that can co-occur.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... other layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='sigmoid') # Correct number of output neurons
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',  # Incorrect loss function for multi-label
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training ...

predictions = model.predict(test_data) # predictions will be an array of three probabilities, but loss calculation is wrong
```

This example demonstrates the use of `categorical_crossentropy`, unsuitable for multi-label situations because it expects a one-hot encoded target vector, indicating one and only one label per data point.  In our multi-label scenario, a data point might have multiple labels active simultaneously.  Using `categorical_crossentropy` here will produce inaccurate loss calculations, hindering model training and possibly resulting in unexpected outputs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of multi-label classification and Keras implementation, I strongly suggest consulting the official Keras documentation, particularly the sections on model building and various loss functions.  The Tensorflow documentation also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms.  Reviewing comprehensive machine learning textbooks that cover neural network architectures and multi-label classification would be beneficial. Finally, exploring research papers focusing on multi-label classification techniques will provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic.  Careful study of these materials will help in understanding the intricate aspects of designing and training a model for this specific task.
