JavaMail's failure to deliver messages often stems from misconfigurations in either the application's mail server settings or the email itself.  My experience troubleshooting these issues over fifteen years, primarily working with large-scale enterprise applications, points consistently to a few key areas.  I've observed that seemingly minor errors, often related to authentication, SMTP server settings, and email header formatting, can lead to undeliverable messages.  This response will delineate these common problems and provide illustrative code examples to highlight best practices and debugging strategies.


**1. Authentication Failures:**

This is the single most frequent cause of delivery problems.  JavaMail requires proper authentication credentials to interact with the SMTP server.  Incorrect usernames, passwords, or an improperly configured authentication mechanism will prevent message submission.  Many SMTP servers now require secure authentication protocols like STARTTLS or SSL/TLS.  Failure to utilize these secure connections, especially in production environments, will usually result in immediate rejection by the mail server.  Furthermore, the credentials provided must have sufficient permissions to send emails. A user account might have access to read email but not send them.  This oversight often occurs during development when using a personal email account with restricted sending privileges.

**Code Example 1: Secure Email Sending with SSL/TLS**

```java
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class SecureEmailSender {
    public static void sendEmail(String recipient, String subject, String body) throws MessagingException {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.example.com"); // Replace with your SMTP server
        props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587"); // Common port for TLS; check your provider
        props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
        props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true"); // Enable STARTTLS
        props.put("mail.smtp.ssl.trust", "smtp.example.com"); // Trust the SMTP server's certificate (optional but recommended)


        Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
            protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
                return new PasswordAuthentication("your_username", "your_password"); // Replace with your credentials
            }
        });

        Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
        message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("your_email@example.com")); // Your sender email
        message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, InternetAddress.parse(recipient));
        message.setSubject(subject);
        message.setText(body);

        Transport.send(message);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            sendEmail("recipient@example.com", "Test Email", "This is a test email.");
            System.out.println("Email sent successfully.");
        } catch (MessagingException e) {
            System.err.println("Error sending email: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the crucial aspects of secure email sending.  Note the use of `mail.smtp.starttls.enable` to ensure a secure connection and the `Authenticator` class for providing credentials.  Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual SMTP server details and credentials.  Incorrect port numbers are a frequent source of errors; consult your email provider's documentation for the correct port.  The `ssl.trust` property is included for handling potential SSL certificate issues.


**2. Incorrect SMTP Server Settings:**

Even with correct authentication, using the wrong SMTP server address or port will prevent delivery. Double-check your email provider's documentation for the correct settings.  Some providers offer different SMTP servers for different purposes (e.g., sending versus receiving).  Using the wrong server can lead to delivery failures without any informative error messages.


**3. Email Header Problems:**

Invalid or missing email headers, particularly the `From` and `To` headers, can cause rejection.  Incorrectly formatted email addresses, missing domains, or improperly encoded characters are common pitfalls.  JavaMail offers robust methods for constructing email headers, but errors in their usage can lead to undeliverable messages.  Furthermore, some email providers enforce strict rules on headers, such as the length or content of certain fields.


**Code Example 2: Handling Email Header Encoding**

```java
// ... (Previous code) ...

// ... inside sendEmail method ...
message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("your_email@example.com", "Your Name")); //Adding a display name
message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, InternetAddress.parse(recipient, false)); //false prevents encoding problems

//Adding other important headers
message.setHeader("X-Mailer", "JavaMail");
message.addHeader("Return-Path", "your_email@example.com");

// ... (Rest of the code) ...

```

This snippet illustrates proper header construction, including adding a display name to the `From` address, handling potential encoding issues with `InternetAddress.parse(recipient, false)`, and setting important headers like `X-Mailer` and `Return-Path` which some mail servers might require or filter on.



**4. Content Issues:**

While less common than authentication or server configuration problems, the email content itself can sometimes lead to delivery failures.  Very large attachments, exceeding server limits, can be rejected.  Similarly, emails containing malicious or suspicious content might be flagged as spam and blocked.


**Code Example 3: Handling Large Attachments**

```java
import javax.activation.*;
import javax.mail.util.*;

// ... (Previous code) ...

//Inside sendEmail method

MimeBodyPart messageBodyPart = new MimeBodyPart();
messageBodyPart.setText(body);

MimeBodyPart attachmentBodyPart = new MimeBodyPart();
DataSource source = new FileDataSource("path/to/large/file.txt");
attachmentBodyPart.setDataHandler(new DataHandler(source));
attachmentBodyPart.setFileName(source.getName());

MimeMultipart multipart = new MimeMultipart();
multipart.addBodyPart(messageBodyPart);
multipart.addBodyPart(attachmentBodyPart);

message.setContent(multipart);

//... (rest of the code)

```

This demonstrates how to handle attachments, specifically large files, correctly.  Using `MimeMultipart` allows for managing multiple parts in the email, which is crucial for dealing with attachments. The use of `DataHandler` and `FileDataSource` ensures efficient handling of the attachment.  Consider implementing methods to split very large attachments into smaller parts for improved deliverability.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The JavaMail API documentation, a comprehensive JavaMail tutorial (search online), and a well-structured guide to SMTP server configuration are invaluable resources for resolving these issues. Understanding the nuances of email headers is also important.  Thorough examination of SMTP server logs, readily accessible through your mail provider's control panel, often provides detailed error messages essential for diagnosis.  Debugging the exact cause typically requires analyzing the error messages returned by the SMTP server, which will pinpoint the specific problem.  Always examine the server's logs for more detailed error reports. Consistent testing across different mail clients and servers also aids in diagnosing underlying issues.

In conclusion, successful email delivery using JavaMail hinges on meticulously configured settings and a firm understanding of the underlying protocols. Attention to detail in authentication, server configurations, header formatting, and content management is crucial for avoiding delivery failures.  Systematic debugging, leveraging server logs and utilizing the resources mentioned above, will significantly streamline the troubleshooting process.
