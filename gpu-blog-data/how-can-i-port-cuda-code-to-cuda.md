Porting CUDA code to CUDA 7.5 necessitates a careful consideration of both deprecated functionalities and architectural differences compared to more recent CUDA versions.  My experience working on large-scale computational fluid dynamics simulations across various CUDA toolkits highlights the importance of a methodical approach, beginning with a thorough understanding of the changes introduced since the target version.  While straightforward in some cases, significant architectural changes between versions can require substantial code restructuring.

**1. Understanding the Context and Challenges:**

CUDA 7.5, while relatively old, still represents a functional toolkit. However, several features introduced in later versions are absent, and certain programming practices have evolved for optimization and safety.  The most prominent challenge lies in identifying and mitigating the use of deprecated functions and libraries.  Furthermore, performance characteristics might differ subtly due to architectural changes between the hardware and CUDA driver versions used during the original development and CUDA 7.5's target environment.

A systematic approach involves three key steps:

* **Code Analysis:**  A comprehensive scan of the existing CUDA code is necessary to identify potential incompatibilities.  This includes analyzing the inclusion of header files, the use of specific CUDA APIs, and the utilization of compiler directives.  Static analysis tools, though not specific to CUDA 7.5, can be extremely helpful in flagging deprecated function calls.

* **Targeted Upgrades:**  The identification of deprecated functions requires a careful review of the CUDA release notes for 7.5 and its preceding versions.  This often involves replacing deprecated functions with their modern equivalents, which may necessitate changes in the code structure.  For instance, certain memory management functions saw changes in their error handling mechanisms.

* **Compatibility Testing:** After making the necessary adjustments, rigorous testing is essential to ensure that the ported code produces the expected results and functions within the performance expectations. This might involve comparing results against the original code execution on a later CUDA version, as well as profiling the performance on the target hardware.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate common porting challenges and their solutions.  These examples assume familiarity with basic CUDA programming concepts.

**Example 1:  Handling Deprecated Texture Memory Functions**

```cuda
//Original Code (using deprecated texture fetch)
texture<float, 1, cudaReadModeElementType> tex;
float value = tex1Dfetch(tex, index);

//Ported Code (using newer texture binding and access methods)
cudaChannelFormatDesc desc = cudaCreateChannelDesc<float>();
cudaTextureObject_t texObj;
cudaMalloc3DArray(&array3D, &desc, dim3(width, height, depth));
// ... data transfer to array3D ...
cudaBindTextureToArray(texObj, array3D);
float value;
cudaTextureRead(value, texObj, pos);
```

Commentary: CUDA 7.5 might require a shift from the `tex1Dfetch` function to more modern texture binding and access methods, as exemplified above.  This requires careful management of texture objects and the appropriate channel format descriptions.


**Example 2:  Addressing Changes in CUDA Streams**

```cuda
// Original Code (using potentially deprecated stream synchronization)
cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

// Ported Code (using events for more efficient synchronization)
cudaEvent_t start, stop;
cudaEventCreateWithFlags(&start, cudaEventDisableTiming);
cudaEventCreateWithFlags(&stop, cudaEventDisableTiming);
cudaEventRecord(start, stream);
// ... asynchronous kernel launch ...
cudaEventRecord(stop, stream);
cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
cudaEventDestroy(start);
cudaEventDestroy(stop);
```

Commentary: While `cudaStreamSynchronize` might function correctly, using events offers finer-grained control and potential performance improvements by avoiding unnecessary thread blocking.  This highlights a shift in best practices over time.


**Example 3:  Migrating from older memory allocation practices**

```cuda
//Original Code (potentially less robust memory allocation)
float *devPtr;
cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, size);

//Ported Code (more explicit error handling)
float *devPtr;
cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, size);
if (err != cudaSuccess) {
  fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
  exit(1);
}
```

Commentary:  While the original code might work, explicitly checking for `cudaMalloc` errors is crucial for robust error handling, a best practice that was emphasized in later CUDA versions.  This demonstrates a change in coding style to improve software reliability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Toolkit Documentation, specifically the release notes for CUDA 7.5 and immediately preceding versions, is the primary resource for identifying deprecated functionalities and their replacements. The CUDA Programming Guide provides comprehensive details on CUDA programming best practices, including memory management and kernel optimization, and will be crucial for understanding changes in API behaviors.  Finally, consulting the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, even though it might not directly address 7.5, provides valuable context for adapting modern programming styles to the older toolkit.  Thorough testing, aided by profiling tools, is the final essential ingredient for successful porting.
