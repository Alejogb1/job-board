The reproducibility of `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier`, now deprecated in favor of the Keras API, hinges critically on the management of random seed initialization across various components within the TensorFlow graph.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted the subtle ways seemingly innocuous variations in code could lead to non-deterministic results, even when explicit seed setting appeared in place.  This isn't simply a matter of setting a single global seed; the interaction between different random number generators (RNGs) within the estimator and its underlying optimizer necessitates a more nuanced approach.

**1. A Clear Explanation of Deterministic Training with `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` (or its Keras equivalent)**

Achieving repeatable results with `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier`, or its functionally equivalent Keras-based successor, necessitates controlling randomness at multiple levels.  First, the initialization of the model's weights must be deterministic. This is usually achieved by setting the `tf.random.set_seed()` function before model creation. However, this alone is insufficient.  The optimizer, often using stochastic gradient descent variations, introduces additional randomness in weight updates. Therefore, its internal RNG also requires seeding. This can be indirectly controlled by setting the global seed. However, certain optimizers might have their own internal seeding mechanisms. In TensorFlow 2 and beyond, using Keras' `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layers and a standard Keras optimizer like `Adam` or `SGD` simplifies matters considerably, but still demands careful attention.  Furthermore, data shuffling during training can introduce non-determinism. While data preprocessing often involves shuffling for optimal model training, for reproducibility, data should be deterministically sorted before feeding it to the estimator.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the transition from the older `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` approach to the preferred Keras methodology, demonstrating how reproducibility is handled in each.  Note that these examples are simplified for illustrative purposes.  Real-world applications might demand more complex data pipelines and model architectures.

**Example 1: Non-Reproducible `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# INCORRECT: Lacks proper seed management.
classifier = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=[tf.feature_column.numeric_column("x")],
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    n_classes=2
)

# ... training code ...
```

This code snippet is inherently non-reproducible due to the lack of explicit seed setting for both weight initialization and the optimizer.  Different runs will produce different model weights, leading to varying classification results.


**Example 2:  Improved Reproducibility with `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` (Illustrative and Outdated)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42) # Set global seed

classifier = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=[tf.feature_column.numeric_column("x")],
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    n_classes=2,
    optimizer=tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(seed=42) #Attempt to seed optimizer
)

# ... training code with sorted data ...
```

This example demonstrates an attempt at improvement. Setting a global seed using `tf.random.set_seed()` attempts to influence both weight initialization and the optimizer. However, this approach is not fully reliable, as the optimizer's internal random number generator might not perfectly adhere to the global seed.  Moreover, the usage of `tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer` is itself an indicator of outdated TensorFlow practices.


**Example 3:  Reproducible Keras Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.random.set_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)  # Seed NumPy for data preprocessing

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Ensure data is sorted for reproducibility
x_train = np.sort(np.random.rand(100, 1))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This code snippet provides a much more reliable approach to reproducibility. Using the Keras API simplifies seed management. Setting the global seed in TensorFlow and NumPy ensures consistent results. The sorted training data further contributes to determinism. The use of standard Keras layers and optimizers leverages TensorFlow's improved internal handling of random number generators.  Furthermore, this approach is aligned with current best practices in TensorFlow development.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on managing randomness and ensuring reproducibility.  Explore the sections detailing random seed usage within both the Estimator API (though largely deprecated) and the Keras API.  Furthermore, consult resources that cover best practices for numerical computation and reproducibility in scientific computing.  These resources will explain the subtleties of random number generation and how these impact deep learning models.  Specifically, studying the inner workings of various optimizers and their handling of random seeds is crucial for a deep understanding of the issue. Finally, carefully review any third-party libraries used in conjunction with TensorFlow, as they might introduce additional sources of non-determinism.  Scrutinize their documentation for information on seed management and potential compatibility issues.
