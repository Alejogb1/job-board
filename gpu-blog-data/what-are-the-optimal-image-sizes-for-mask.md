When deploying Mask R-CNN or Faster R-CNN using pre-trained models in Keras/Tensorflow, the often-overlooked factor significantly impacting performance is the input image size. The models are pre-trained on datasets with a specific range of image dimensions, and deviating substantially from these can result in suboptimal accuracy and slower inference. These models do not inherently "scale" well to arbitrarily large or small input dimensions without careful consideration. My experience over several projects involving object detection has shown that sticking to recommended aspect ratios and sizes, with minimal resizing, is crucial for performance.

The core issue lies in the architecture of these convolutional neural networks. Pre-trained models, particularly those using architectures like ResNet, have stride-based operations for spatial downsampling. These strides result in a fixed set of feature map sizes across the network. If the input image is significantly smaller than what the model was trained on, detail is lost prematurely due to these aggressive downsampling steps. Conversely, excessively large images may not fit in memory or may cause problems with the regions of interest (ROIs) generated later in the pipeline. The feature maps extracted from an appropriately sized image benefit from the trained spatial hierarchies which encode useful visual semantics, and therefore, are better for downstream tasks like object classification and segmentation. Therefore, the "optimal" size doesn't imply maximum or minimum but one that aligns closely with the pre-training regime.

For both Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, the core architectural components, including the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and region-based convolutional feature extractors, generally expect input images to have a minimum size. While there are slight variations depending on the specific model architecture and pre-training dataset (e.g., COCO, ImageNet), a common practice is to scale images such that the shorter side of the image is around 800 pixels, with the longer side not exceeding a predetermined maximum, often 1333 pixels, while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is to align with the COCO dataset which is the most common dataset to train such models. This configuration usually yields a reasonable balance between preserving image details and avoiding unnecessary computational cost. If an image has its shorter side below this, or its longest side above this threshold, it should be resized accordingly. This sizing consideration is done before the image is fed into the network. Resizing images which are already within this size range is not recommended, as it destroys the spatial information the network has learned from the pretraining.

Hereâ€™s a practical breakdown with code examples in Tensorflow/Keras:

**Example 1: Implementing Resizing for COCO-based Models**

This example demonstrates how to preprocess an input image before feeding it to a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model. It resizes the image while maintaining aspect ratio, ensuring the shortest side is scaled to 800 pixels, with a maximum length of 1333 pixels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def resize_image(image_tensor, min_dim=800, max_dim=1333):
    """Resizes an image while maintaining aspect ratio.

    Args:
        image_tensor: A 3D tensor representing the image (height, width, channels).
        min_dim: The target size of the smaller side of the image.
        max_dim: The maximum size of the larger side of the image.

    Returns:
        A resized image tensor.
        The scale factor that was applied
        The padding that was applied to make the image size suitable to the network
    """
    height, width = tf.shape(image_tensor)[0], tf.shape(image_tensor)[1]
    image_shape = tf.cast(tf.stack([height, width]), dtype=tf.float32)

    scale = tf.cond(
        tf.greater(tf.reduce_min(image_shape), min_dim),
        lambda: min_dim / tf.reduce_min(image_shape),
        lambda: 1.0 #no scaling if too small
    )

    new_height = tf.cast(image_shape[0] * scale, dtype=tf.int32)
    new_width = tf.cast(image_shape[1] * scale, dtype=tf.int32)
    
    image_tensor = tf.image.resize(image_tensor, [new_height,new_width], method='bilinear')

    # Padding for compatibility with downsampling layers
    pad_height = tf.maximum(0,max_dim-new_height)
    pad_width = tf.maximum(0,max_dim-new_width)

    padded_image = tf.pad(image_tensor, [[0, pad_height], [0, pad_width],[0,0]], constant_values=0)


    return padded_image, scale, (pad_height, pad_width)

#Example usage
image_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[480,640,3]) #Random image of size 480x640x3
resized_image, scale, padding = resize_image(image_tensor)
print(f"Resized image shape: {resized_image.shape.as_list()}")
print(f"Scale Factor applied: {scale}")
print(f"Padding applied (height, width): {padding}")
```

**Commentary:** This code snippet demonstrates the process of resizing. First, the shorter side of the image is resized to 800 pixels, if necessary, by calculating the ratio which needs to be applied. Bilinear interpolation is used to scale the image. It also ensures the longest side does not exceed 1333 pixels. Then padding is applied to both dimensions of the resized image, to make sure it matches the maximum length requirement. This keeps the aspect ratio consistent and gives a size compatible with the pretrained weights.

**Example 2: Handling Variations in Input Sizes**

This example showcases how to handle scenarios where your image dimensions may be different. If you know, for example, that images tend to have very large or small sizes, it's sometimes useful to have a different minimum dimension to rescale to, and a different maximum.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def resize_image_custom(image_tensor, min_dim, max_dim):
    """Resizes an image while maintaining aspect ratio, but with custom min/max."""
    height, width = tf.shape(image_tensor)[0], tf.shape(image_tensor)[1]
    image_shape = tf.cast(tf.stack([height, width]), dtype=tf.float32)

    scale = tf.cond(
        tf.greater(tf.reduce_min(image_shape), min_dim),
        lambda: min_dim / tf.reduce_min(image_shape),
        lambda: 1.0 #no scaling if too small
    )

    new_height = tf.cast(image_shape[0] * scale, dtype=tf.int32)
    new_width = tf.cast(image_shape[1] * scale, dtype=tf.int32)
    
    image_tensor = tf.image.resize(image_tensor, [new_height,new_width], method='bilinear')

    pad_height = tf.maximum(0,max_dim-new_height)
    pad_width = tf.maximum(0,max_dim-new_width)

    padded_image = tf.pad(image_tensor, [[0, pad_height], [0, pad_width],[0,0]], constant_values=0)

    return padded_image, scale, (pad_height, pad_width)


# Example usage with a different min_dim and max_dim
image_tensor_large = tf.random.normal(shape=[1200, 1600, 3])  #Large random image
resized_large, scale_large, padding_large = resize_image_custom(image_tensor_large, 600, 1000)
print(f"Large image shape: {resized_large.shape.as_list()}")
print(f"Scale Factor applied to large: {scale_large}")
print(f"Padding applied to large (height, width): {padding_large}")


image_tensor_small = tf.random.normal(shape=[200, 300, 3])  #Small random image
resized_small, scale_small, padding_small = resize_image_custom(image_tensor_small, 600, 1000)
print(f"Small image shape: {resized_small.shape.as_list()}")
print(f"Scale Factor applied to small: {scale_small}")
print(f"Padding applied to small (height, width): {padding_small}")
```

**Commentary:** This function provides additional flexibility by accepting both the target size of the smaller side of the image, and the maximum size of the longer side, as parameters. This can be adjusted depending on your needs. The main resizing and padding logic remains the same as before, as it resizes the smallest dimension to meet the given minimum, and then pads to ensure the longest dimension meets the maximum length requirement.

**Example 3: Batch Processing Images**

When processing multiple images, it is advantageous to apply batch processing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def resize_images_batch(image_tensors, min_dim=800, max_dim=1333):
    """Resizes a batch of images.

    Args:
        image_tensors: A 4D tensor of images, [batch, height, width, channels]
        min_dim: The target size of the smaller side of the image.
        max_dim: The maximum size of the larger side of the image.
    Returns:
        A resized image tensor of shape [batch, max_dim, max_dim, channels],
        a tensor of scale factors of shape [batch],
        and a tensor of padding tuples [batch, 2]
    """
    resized_images_batch = []
    scale_factors = []
    padding_tuples = []
    for image_tensor in tf.unstack(image_tensors):
        resized_image, scale, padding = resize_image(image_tensor,min_dim,max_dim)
        resized_images_batch.append(resized_image)
        scale_factors.append(scale)
        padding_tuples.append(padding)
    return tf.stack(resized_images_batch), tf.stack(scale_factors), tf.stack(padding_tuples)



# Example usage with a batch of images
image_batch = tf.random.normal(shape=[3, 480, 640, 3])  #Batch of 3 random images
resized_batch, scales_batch, paddings_batch = resize_images_batch(image_batch)
print(f"Resized batch shape: {resized_batch.shape.as_list()}")
print(f"Scale factors: {scales_batch}")
print(f"Padding applied: {paddings_batch}")
```
**Commentary:** This function efficiently processes a batch of images by calling `resize_image` for each of the images in the batch. The results are then stacked together, meaning a full batch of resized images, their respective scale factors and padding amounts are returned. This allows the same processing to be carried out on multiple images at once, which can save time and resources.

For resources, I would recommend exploring the official Tensorflow documentation, which contains detailed information about working with images in Tensorflow, and also contains the source code for several popular Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN implementations in Tensorflow. Specifically, look at the image preprocessing pipelines often used in these object detection models. Additionally, research papers describing specific architectures (e.g. ResNet, Feature Pyramid Networks) can provide insight into the inner workings of the models and how pre-trained weights were obtained, which in turn can inform the best ways to process input images. A close study of the original Mask R-CNN paper and source code can also be insightful. These sources, when combined, will give the user a deeper understanding of the proper way to prepare image data for object detection.
