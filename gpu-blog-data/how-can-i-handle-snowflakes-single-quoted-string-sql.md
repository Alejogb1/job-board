Snowflake requires string literals in SQL queries to be enclosed in single quotes. This presents a direct conflict when leveraging Airflow’s XCom mechanism, which, by default, returns string values enclosed in double quotes, especially when those values are intended for use directly within a SQL query. This mismatch necessitates careful handling to prevent SQL syntax errors when an XCom variable is passed to a SnowflakeOperator or related Snowflake interaction. Over the course of several complex Airflow implementations integrating with Snowflake, I've seen this issue crop up repeatedly, and a systematic approach is critical to avoiding runtime failures.

The core problem lies in the interpretation of string literals by Snowflake's parser. A SQL query such as `SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = "some_string"` will fail because Snowflake expects `'some_string'` instead of `"some_string"`. Airflow's XCom typically returns string data serialized as JSON, which uses double quotes. This difference is not a parsing issue in the general sense; it's a semantic requirement of the target database, Snowflake. Simple string concatenation or variable substitution within an Airflow operator will thus introduce this type of error unless addressed.

The most effective solution revolves around a process of string substitution or modification. Instead of passing the raw double-quoted string directly, the string must be transformed to use single quotes before being incorporated into the SQL query. This can be achieved using several methods within the Airflow task definition, each with its own trade-offs in readability and maintainability. The method chosen will often depend on the complexity of the string value retrieved from XCom and the degree of further manipulation required within the SQL statement.

The first technique utilizes Python’s string formatting capabilities along with the `replace` method. This is a straightforward approach suitable for simple XCom values that require minimal pre-processing. The general strategy is to access the XCom value, replace the double quotes with single quotes, and then incorporate the result into the SQL query.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake import SnowflakeOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def push_double_quoted_value(**kwargs):
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='my_value', value='"some_value_from_previous_task"')

def create_snowflake_query(**kwargs):
    my_value = kwargs['ti'].xcom_pull(key='my_value', task_ids='push_value_task')
    # Replace double quotes with single quotes
    formatted_value = my_value.replace('"', "'")
    sql_query = f"SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = {formatted_value};"
    return sql_query

with DAG(
    dag_id='snowflake_string_quotes_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    push_value_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='push_value_task',
        python_callable=push_double_quoted_value
    )

    snowflake_task_1 = SnowflakeOperator(
        task_id="snowflake_task_1",
        snowflake_conn_id="snowflake_conn",
        sql=create_snowflake_query(),
    )

    push_value_task >> snowflake_task_1
```

In this example, the `push_double_quoted_value` PythonOperator pushes a string with double quotes into XCom. The `create_snowflake_query` Python function pulls this value and then uses `replace('"', "'")` to convert the double quotes to single quotes. The resulting SQL query, which now contains single quotes around the string literal, is passed to the SnowflakeOperator. It's important to note that this method is not adequate when dealing with strings containing escaped single quotes themselves. That is, if the XCom value is, for example, `'"some\'value"'`, then this simple replace mechanism will not produce the correct result.

A more robust technique is to use Python's string formatting and explicitly include single quotes around the variable used in the SQL query. This bypasses the need for direct string replacement of quotes. We achieve this by defining the SQL query template using format strings that incorporate the appropriate quoting directly.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake import SnowflakeOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def push_double_quoted_value_with_escapes(**kwargs):
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='my_value', value='"some\'value_with_escape\'"')

def create_snowflake_query_with_format(**kwargs):
     my_value = kwargs['ti'].xcom_pull(key='my_value', task_ids='push_value_task_escapes')
     sql_query = f"SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = '{my_value}';"
     return sql_query

with DAG(
    dag_id='snowflake_string_quotes_format_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:

    push_value_task_escapes = PythonOperator(
        task_id='push_value_task_escapes',
        python_callable=push_double_quoted_value_with_escapes
    )

    snowflake_task_2 = SnowflakeOperator(
        task_id="snowflake_task_2",
        snowflake_conn_id="snowflake_conn",
        sql=create_snowflake_query_with_format(),
    )

    push_value_task_escapes >> snowflake_task_2
```

Here, the f-string directly constructs the SQL query with the necessary single quotes surrounding the extracted XCom value, regardless of the content or existence of escapes within the original value. The value retrieved from XCom is incorporated into the query between single quote literals, and thus the need to perform string replacement becomes superfluous.  This method is significantly more resilient to escaped characters within the string being passed through XCom.

Finally, the usage of Jinja templating within the SQL query parameter can also provide a clean and dynamic solution. Jinja, Airflow’s built-in templating engine, offers robust string manipulation capabilities. Within the SQL parameter of the SnowflakeOperator, Jinja can be used to apply single quotes directly, thus obviating the need for an additional Python function for simple XCom extractions.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake import SnowflakeOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def push_double_quoted_value_jinja(**kwargs):
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='my_value', value='"some\'value_jinja\'"')


with DAG(
    dag_id='snowflake_string_quotes_jinja_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    push_value_task_jinja = PythonOperator(
        task_id='push_value_task_jinja',
        python_callable=push_double_quoted_value_jinja
    )

    snowflake_task_3 = SnowflakeOperator(
        task_id="snowflake_task_3",
        snowflake_conn_id="snowflake_conn",
        sql="SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = '{{ ti.xcom_pull(key='my_value', task_ids='push_value_task_jinja') }}';",
    )

    push_value_task_jinja >> snowflake_task_3
```

In this scenario, the `sql` parameter of the `SnowflakeOperator` contains a Jinja template. When the operator executes, the expression `{{ ti.xcom_pull(key='my_value', task_ids='push_value_task_jinja') }}` is replaced by the value retrieved from XCom, and the result is also enclosed in single quotes because of the surrounding literals. Jinja essentially performs the string formatting directly within the operator declaration, improving readability by encapsulating the quote handling logic directly alongside the SQL query.

For further understanding of this topic, researching Airflow’s XCom capabilities and Jinja templating within Airflow operators is essential. Moreover, the official Snowflake documentation regarding SQL syntax and string literal handling provides a detailed understanding of the root cause. Airflow operator documentation, specifically those relating to database interactions (e.g. Snowflake, Postgres), also provide valuable insights into best practices for handling input data within SQL queries. These resources, combined with experimentation within a controlled development environment, should provide a comprehensive understanding and enable successful management of string quote disparities between XCom and Snowflake.
