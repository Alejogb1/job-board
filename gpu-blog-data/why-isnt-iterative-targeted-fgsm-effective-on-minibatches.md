The ineffectiveness of iterative targeted Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on minibatches stems fundamentally from the inherent conflict between the individual gradient updates performed during iteration and the batch-wise averaging process.  My experience debugging adversarial attacks against complex neural networks has highlighted this issue repeatedly.  While iterative FGSM effectively crafts adversarial examples against single data points by iteratively maximizing targeted misclassification,  applying this method directly to minibatches produces suboptimal results due to the averaging of gradients across diverse data points within the batch.  This averaging dilutes the targeted perturbation, preventing the effective construction of targeted adversarial examples for all or even most samples within the batch.

Let's clarify this with a breakdown of the process.  Iterative FGSM works by iteratively perturbing an input image `x` in the direction of the gradient of the loss function with respect to that image. The gradient, ∇<sub>x</sub>L(x, y<sub>target</sub>), points towards the direction of steepest ascent of the loss function, where L is the loss function, x is the input image, and y<sub>target</sub> is the target class.  The iterative process repeatedly adds a scaled version of this gradient to the input image:

x<sub>t+1</sub> = x<sub>t</sub> + α * sign(∇<sub>x</sub>L(x<sub>t</sub>, y<sub>target</sub>))

where α is the step size, and `sign` is the element-wise sign function. This process iterates for a specified number of steps.  The effectiveness relies heavily on the accurate gradient estimation for each individual image.

The issue arises when we consider minibatches.  During backpropagation, the gradients for all samples in a minibatch are computed and then *averaged* before the update step.  This averaging process fundamentally alters the direction of the gradient for *each* individual sample within the batch.  The averaged gradient represents a compromise, a direction that optimizes the loss across *all* samples simultaneously.  This can be markedly different from the direction that would optimize the loss for an individual sample within that batch. The targeted perturbation thus becomes a diluted average of perturbations suited for diverse samples, rendering it largely ineffective for individual targeting.

Consider the scenario where a minibatch contains images of cats (target class: dog) and dogs (target class: cat).  The averaged gradient will represent a compromise between perturbing cat images towards ‘dog’ and perturbing dog images towards ‘cat’.  This compromise leads to weak, inefficient perturbations for both types of images within the batch, resulting in a lower adversarial success rate compared to processing these images individually.


Now, let's illustrate this with code examples.  We'll use PyTorch for brevity.


**Example 1:  Iterative Targeted FGSM on a Single Image**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume model and loss function are defined (e.g., model = ResNet18(), loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss())

def iterative_targeted_fgsm_single(model, x, y_target, alpha, iterations):
    x.requires_grad = True
    for i in range(iterations):
        output = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(output, y_target)
        loss.backward()
        x.data = x.data + alpha * torch.sign(x.grad.data)
        x.grad.zero_()
    return x.detach()


#Example usage:
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32) #Single image
y_target = torch.tensor([1]) #Target class
adv_x = iterative_targeted_fgsm_single(model, x, y_target, 0.01, 10)
```

This function demonstrates the standard iterative targeted FGSM on a single image, effectively updating the input in the direction of the gradient computed specifically for that image.

**Example 2:  Naive Application to Minibatch (Ineffective)**

```python
def iterative_targeted_fgsm_minibatch_naive(model, x_batch, y_target_batch, alpha, iterations):
  x_batch.requires_grad = True
  for i in range(iterations):
      output = model(x_batch)
      loss = loss_fn(output, y_target_batch)
      loss.backward()
      x_batch.data = x_batch.data + alpha * torch.sign(x_batch.grad.data)
      x_batch.grad.zero_()
  return x_batch.detach()

# Example usage:
x_batch = torch.randn(32, 3, 32, 32) #Minibatch of images
y_target_batch = torch.randint(0,10,(32,)) #Target class for each image in batch.
adv_x_batch = iterative_targeted_fgsm_minibatch_naive(model, x_batch, y_target_batch, 0.01, 10)

```

This example shows a naive application of iterative FGSM to a minibatch.  The crucial flaw is that the averaged gradient is used to perturb *all* images simultaneously.


**Example 3:  Minibatch Processing with Individual Updates (More Effective)**

```python
def iterative_targeted_fgsm_minibatch_individual(model, x_batch, y_target_batch, alpha, iterations):
    adv_x_batch = x_batch.clone().detach()
    adv_x_batch.requires_grad = True
    for i in range(iterations):
      output = model(adv_x_batch)
      loss = loss_fn(output, y_target_batch)
      loss.backward()
      with torch.no_grad():
          for j in range(x_batch.shape[0]):
              adv_x_batch[j] = adv_x_batch[j] + alpha * torch.sign(adv_x_batch.grad[j])
      adv_x_batch.grad.zero_()
    return adv_x_batch.detach()


# Example usage:  Same as Example 2, but using this improved function.
adv_x_batch = iterative_targeted_fgsm_minibatch_individual(model, x_batch, y_target_batch, 0.01, 10)
```

This example demonstrates a more effective approach. It iteratively updates each image individually within the batch, leveraging the specific gradient for each input, thereby circumventing the averaging problem.


In conclusion, the problem with using iterative targeted FGSM directly on minibatches lies in the gradient averaging process during backpropagation. This averaging dilutes the targeted perturbation, leading to decreased effectiveness.  Processing each image independently within the minibatch loop, as demonstrated in Example 3, is crucial for preserving the targeted perturbation's strength and improving the adversarial attack's success rate.


For further study, I recommend reviewing research papers on adversarial attacks and defenses, specifically focusing on techniques addressing the minibatch gradient issue.  Examining the mathematical derivations of various FGSM variants and exploring the practical implications of different optimization strategies in the context of adversarial examples will provide a comprehensive understanding.  Additionally, examining the convergence properties of iterative methods in the context of high-dimensional data like images is highly beneficial.
