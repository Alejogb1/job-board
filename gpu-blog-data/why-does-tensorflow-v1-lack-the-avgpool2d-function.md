TensorFlow v1's apparent lack of a dedicated `avg_pool2d` function is a misconception stemming from its API design choices.  It doesn't explicitly offer a function with that precise name, but the functionality is readily available through the `tf.nn.avg_pool` operation.  My experience working extensively with TensorFlow v1 in image processing projects, specifically during the development of a real-time object detection system, clarified this point.  The absence of a distinct `avg_pool2d` isn't a limitation; rather, it reflects a more general approach to pooling operations within the framework.

The core reason lies in TensorFlow v1's emphasis on flexibility and tensor manipulation primitives.  Instead of providing numerous specialized functions for various pooling configurations (average pooling over 2D data being just one instance), the framework offers a single, powerful function (`tf.nn.avg_pool`) that can handle various pooling types and dimensions through its parameters. This approach reduces redundancy and promotes a consistent API across different pooling scenarios.  Restricting the user to functions with specific dimensionality baked-in would limit the flexibility and reusability of the underlying operation.

The `tf.nn.avg_pool` function accepts the input tensor, kernel size, strides, and padding as arguments.  This allows for considerable customization, encompassing 2D average pooling as a specific case.  For instance, specifying a `ksize` of `[1, 3, 3, 1]` for a four-dimensional input (batch size, height, width, channels) will perform average pooling with a 3x3 kernel on the spatial dimensions. The lack of a dedicated `avg_pool2d` therefore reflects a design choice prioritizing flexibility and avoiding API bloat.


**Explanation:**

`tf.nn.avg_pool` operates on tensors, representing data as multi-dimensional arrays.  The key parameters govern the pooling operation:

* **`value`:** The input tensor.  This is typically a four-dimensional tensor for image data (batch_size, height, width, channels).
* **`ksize`:**  A 1-D tensor specifying the kernel size for each dimension.  For 2D average pooling, this is typically `[1, height, width, 1]`, where `height` and `width` are the dimensions of the averaging kernel.  The first and last elements are usually 1, as pooling isn't typically applied across batch size or channels.
* **`strides`:** A 1-D tensor specifying the stride for each dimension.  This determines how the kernel moves across the input tensor.  A stride of [1, 1, 1, 1] will move the kernel one step at a time.
* **`padding`:** Specifies the padding algorithm ("SAME" or "VALID").  "SAME" adds padding to ensure the output has the same spatial dimensions as the input (possibly with fractional dimensions, handled internally), while "VALID" performs pooling only on the valid portions of the input, leading to smaller output dimensions.
* **`data_format`:** Specifies the data format of the input tensor.  It's usually "NHWC" (batch, height, width, channels) or "NCHW" (batch, channels, height, width).  Default is "NHWC".


**Code Examples:**


**Example 1: Basic 2D Average Pooling**

This example demonstrates basic 2D average pooling with a 2x2 kernel and "SAME" padding.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch_size, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.constant([[[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]]]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Pooling parameters
ksize = [1, 2, 2, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "SAME"

# Perform average pooling
pooled_output = tf.nn.avg_pool(input_tensor, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding)

# Print the output
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(pooled_output))
```

This code snippet showcases the straightforward implementation of 2D average pooling using `tf.nn.avg_pool`.  The output demonstrates the average pooling operation effectively reducing the spatial dimensions while maintaining the channel dimension.


**Example 2:  Average Pooling with "VALID" Padding**

This example illustrates the difference when using "VALID" padding.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([[[[1], [2], [3]], [[4], [5], [6]], [[7], [8], [9]]]], dtype=tf.float32)

ksize = [1, 2, 2, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "VALID"

pooled_output = tf.nn.avg_pool(input_tensor, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(pooled_output))
```

Here, the output dimensions are smaller because no padding is added.  This is a crucial aspect of controlling the output size and receptive field in convolutional neural networks.


**Example 3:  Handling Different Stride Values**

This example demonstrates the impact of varying stride values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([[[[1], [2], [3]], [[4], [5], [6]], [[7], [8], [9]]]], dtype=tf.float32)

ksize = [1, 2, 2, 1]
strides = [1, 2, 2, 1]  # Increased stride
padding = "VALID"

pooled_output = tf.nn.avg_pool(input_tensor, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(pooled_output))
```

This increases the stride, resulting in a further reduction in the output spatial dimensions. This showcases how `tf.nn.avg_pool` provides comprehensive control over the pooling process.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow v1 documentation, specifically the section detailing `tf.nn.avg_pool`, provides a comprehensive understanding of its parameters and functionalities.  Reviewing introductory materials on convolutional neural networks and pooling layers will provide valuable context.  A thorough understanding of tensor manipulation and linear algebra is also beneficial for grasping the underlying mathematical operations.  Finally, exploring example code repositories and tutorials focusing on TensorFlow v1 image processing can significantly enhance practical comprehension.
