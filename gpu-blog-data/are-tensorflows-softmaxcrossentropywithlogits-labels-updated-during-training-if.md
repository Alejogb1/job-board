TensorFlow's `softmax_crossentropy_with_logits` operates on the principle that its input `labels` are considered ground truth and remain unchanged during the training process. Specifically, the `labels` argument provides the *target* probability distribution that the model's output is striving to match. While the underlying calculations involve differentiable operations, the `labels` tensor itself is never updated by the gradient descent process; it is treated as a constant value for the purposes of the backpropagation algorithm. The gradient calculation focuses on adjusting the model's weights to minimize the discrepancy between the *predicted* probability distribution (derived from the logits) and the *target* distribution (the provided labels). I've encountered similar confusion within my own team, leading to debug sessions where the focus had been incorrectly placed on the `labels` tensor's state.

Here's a more in-depth explanation of why and how this works. The `softmax_crossentropy_with_logits` function, fundamentally, is composed of two operations applied in sequence: a softmax activation function followed by cross-entropy loss calculation. The `logits` input represents the raw, unnormalized predictions of the neural network. The softmax converts these logits into probabilities, ensuring all values sum to one, forming a valid probability distribution. Cross-entropy loss, then, quantifies the dissimilarity between this predicted probability distribution and the target distribution provided by the `labels` tensor. This dissimilarity measure is the value that we seek to minimize through backpropagation. During this optimization, the gradients flow backwards through the network to modify the network's internal weights (and potentially biases) but never through the labels input. The `labels` tensor remains the constant reference point.

The critical point to understand is that the derivative of the loss function with respect to the model’s weights is calculated, not the derivative of the loss with respect to the labels. If the labels themselves were updated, it would imply a system where the target goal itself is changing during training, which would undermine the learning process. This would essentially create a moving target, preventing the model from converging toward optimal performance. Therefore, the framework expects that your labels tensor contains the correct ground truth values needed for supervised learning.

To solidify this concept, let's examine a few practical code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Cross-Entropy Loss Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define logits (raw model output) and labels
logits = tf.constant([[2.0, 1.0, 0.1]], dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]], dtype=tf.float32) # One-hot encoding

# Calculate cross-entropy loss
loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits)

# Print the loss
print("Loss:", loss.numpy())

# Attempt to check if labels are differentiable (will throw an error if backpropagated)
try:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(labels)
        loss_calc = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss_calc, labels)
    print(f"Gradient of loss with respect to labels:{gradients}")
except Exception as e:
     print(f"Error: {e}")
```
In this example, I directly create `logits` and `labels` tensors. The `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function computes the loss. The first part works as expected, however, in the `try/except` block, I attempted to get a gradient of the loss with respect to labels. This will result in an error. This error highlights the crucial aspect that, while loss is differentiable in the context of optimizing neural network parameters, it is not differentiable with respect to the input `labels`. This reinforces that the framework isn't designed to change your target labels through gradient descent. The error message will be related to the fact that labels aren't a trainable variable, which is expected.

**Example 2: Training a Simple Model (Illustrating Labels as Constants)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy dataset for demonstrating training
num_samples = 100
input_size = 5
output_size = 3

inputs = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_size).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, output_size, num_samples).astype(np.int32)
labels_onehot = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=output_size) # Convert labels to one-hot encoding

# Simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_size,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_size)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

def loss_fn(logits, labels):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits))

# Training loop
@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    logits = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(logits, labels)

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    loss_value = train_step(inputs, labels_onehot)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss_value.numpy()}")
    # Debug check - ensure labels are unchanged
    print(f"Labels for epoch {epoch + 1} - first 5: {labels_onehot.numpy()[:5]}")
```

Here, I’ve constructed a simple neural network and a basic training loop. Notice that the training process only updates `model.trainable_variables` based on gradients computed with respect to the loss. In each step, we use `labels_onehot` (which is just the numerical representation of our original `labels` transformed into a one-hot encoded version) as the target, but this tensor is treated as an unchangeable constant within the scope of optimization. I've added a debug print of the first five elements of the labels after each step which confirms that they are unchanged. This demonstration clarifies how the `labels` tensor acts as a fixed reference for gradient calculation, directly impacting the weights' adjustment but not undergoing modification itself during backpropagation.

**Example 3: Effect of Incorrectly Shaping Labels (illustrating the need for proper labels)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrectly Shaped Labels
logits = tf.constant([[2.0, 1.0, 0.1]], dtype=tf.float32)
incorrect_labels = tf.constant([1], dtype=tf.int32) # Intended to represent class 1 - but of wrong shape


try:
    loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=incorrect_labels, logits=logits)
    print("Loss:", loss.numpy())
except Exception as e:
     print(f"Error: {e}")


# Correctly Shaped Labels
correct_labels = tf.constant([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]], dtype=tf.float32) # One-hot encoding of label 1
loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=correct_labels, logits=logits)
print("Loss:", loss.numpy())


```
This final example demonstrates that providing improperly formatted `labels` to the `softmax_crossentropy_with_logits` function can cause errors or incorrect training behavior. The tensor needs to be in the correct shape. In the first part of the code, the `labels` tensor is provided in the wrong shape. The cross-entropy calculation requires `labels` tensor to either have the same shape as the logit or in a one-hot encoded format when logits are provided in more than one dimension. The second part of the example shows the correct usage, where a one-hot encoded representation of the label is provided, resulting in the expected loss calculation. This highlights the importance of preprocessing the `labels` tensor correctly prior to passing it into the loss function.

In summary, the `labels` argument in TensorFlow's `softmax_crossentropy_with_logits` should be treated as constant, ground-truth values, which the training process attempts to match using the model’s output. I've personally found myself repeatedly going back to the core understanding of supervised training when I have run into issues, and focusing on the constant nature of these labels is something I rely upon to prevent these errors.

For continued study, I would recommend referring to TensorFlow's official documentation which provides a detailed explanation of the various loss functions (particularly cross-entropy). Furthermore, "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville offers a comprehensive theoretical foundation on the optimization principles behind gradient descent, and how it applies in backpropagation, as well as the constant nature of targets in supervised learning. Finally, various online courses on platforms like Coursera and edX that cover deep learning frequently present concrete examples of using these functions in real-world scenarios. Careful review of these materials will help further clarify the principles at play.
