The most frequent cause of `OSError` during TensorFlow 2 model loading stems from discrepancies between the environment used for model saving and the environment used for model loading. This isn't simply a matter of Python version compatibility; it extends to the precise versions of TensorFlow, its dependencies (including CUDA and cuDNN if using GPU acceleration), and even the operating system's underlying libraries.  In my experience troubleshooting model deployment issues across diverse platforms—from embedded systems to cloud-based servers—this environmental mismatch is the primary culprit.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow models, upon saving, embed metadata within their file structure. This metadata acts as a blueprint, detailing the model's architecture, weights, and the specific TensorFlow environment it was created within.  When loading a model, TensorFlow attempts to reconstruct the original environment based on this embedded information.  If significant discrepancies exist—for instance, a different TensorFlow version, a missing dependency like a specific CUDA toolkit version or a mismatch in the operating system's underlying libraries—TensorFlow is unable to correctly instantiate the model's components, resulting in an `OSError`.  These errors manifest in various ways, sometimes pointing directly to a missing library, other times presenting as less-specific errors indicating a failure in tensor shape inference or variable initialization.

Furthermore, the issue isn't limited to discrepancies between different major TensorFlow versions. Even minor version updates can introduce incompatible changes in the internal structure or APIs used by the model's saving mechanism. A model saved using TensorFlow 2.9 might fail to load in TensorFlow 2.10, even though it seems like a small jump.  This is because internal optimizations or changes in how TensorFlow manages its internal components can render the saved metadata incompatible with the new version.

Finally, the problem can be aggravated by virtual environments. If the model was saved within a specific virtual environment containing precisely configured dependencies, loading it in a different, even seemingly identical, virtual environment may lead to failure if package versions subtly differ.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect TensorFlow Version**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    print(f"TensorFlow Version: {tf.__version__}") #Check TF version at runtime
```

This demonstrates the basic model loading procedure.  The `try-except` block is crucial for handling the `OSError`.  Adding a print statement to display the current TensorFlow version helps in debugging. If the loaded model was saved with a different TensorFlow version, a mismatch will likely manifest.


**Example 2: Missing CUDA/cuDNN (GPU-Accelerated Model)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('gpu_model.h5')
    print("GPU Model loaded successfully.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    print(f"CUDA Available: {tf.test.is_gpu_available()}")  # Check for GPU availability
    print(f"TensorFlow Version: {tf.__version__}")
```

This example is relevant if the model was trained and saved using a GPU.  The `tf.test.is_gpu_available()` check helps verify whether CUDA is properly installed and configured within the loading environment. If the model was trained with a specific CUDA toolkit version (e.g., CUDA 11.7), attempting to load it with a different version (e.g., CUDA 11.2) will almost certainly fail.


**Example 3: Virtual Environment Discrepancies**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Assuming 'my_env' is a previously created virtual environment
# with the correct TensorFlow version and dependencies

# Activate the correct virtual environment (replace with your activation method)
os.system("source my_env/bin/activate")

try:
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
    print("Model loaded successfully from the correct environment.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    print(f"TensorFlow Version: {tf.__version__}")

# Deactivate the virtual environment
os.system("deactivate")
```

This emphasizes the importance of virtual environments.  Managing dependencies correctly within a virtual environment and loading the model from within that *same* environment is critical. Using `os.system` here is for illustrative purposes and should be adapted to your specific virtual environment management system (e.g., `conda activate`, `venv`).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's saving and loading mechanisms, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Pay close attention to the sections on model saving, loading, and best practices for deployment.  Familiarity with virtual environment management tools (like `venv` or `conda`) is essential.  Additionally, if using GPU acceleration, carefully review the CUDA and cuDNN documentation to ensure compatibility. Understanding dependency management is crucial to avoid these issues, and mastering this skill is pivotal for model deployment success.  Finally, a robust logging strategy during both model saving and loading will considerably assist debugging such errors.
