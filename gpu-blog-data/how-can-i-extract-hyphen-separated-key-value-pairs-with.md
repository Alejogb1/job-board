The core challenge in extracting hyphen-separated key-value pairs with multiline values lies in reliably delimiting the key-value pairs themselves, especially when dealing with values containing embedded hyphens or newline characters.  My experience working on large-scale data processing pipelines, specifically dealing with log files containing similar structures, highlights the need for robust, context-aware parsing techniques rather than relying on simple string splitting.  Incorrect handling of newline characters within values frequently leads to data corruption or incomplete extraction.

My approach centers on leveraging regular expressions, specifically designed to account for the complexities of multiline values and potential variations in the input format.  This provides flexibility and avoids the limitations of simpler techniques prone to errors when encountering unexpected input.

**1.  Explanation of the Parsing Strategy**

The strategy involves a two-stage process. The first stage uses a regular expression to identify and capture individual key-value pairs.  The expression must account for multiple lines within a value. The second stage processes each captured key-value pair to extract the key and value separately.  This division is essential to prevent erroneous splitting if a value contains hyphens.

The regular expression used needs to be carefully crafted. A crucial aspect is the use of the `(?s)` flag (or equivalent, depending on the regex engine), which modifies the dot (`.`) character to match any character, including newline characters.  This allows the value to span multiple lines without interruption.  We also need to consider the potential presence of escaped hyphens within the value itself. For this, we assume a backslash-escaped hyphen (`\-`) signifies a literal hyphen within the value. This is a common escape mechanism.  The lack of escaping will result in different outcomes.

The overall structure of the regular expression will follow this pattern:

`^(\w+)-((?:\\-|[^-]|\n)*)$(?m)`

* `^`: Matches the beginning of a line.  The `(?m)` flag ensures `^` and `$` match the beginning and end of each line respectively.
* `(\w+)`: Captures one or more alphanumeric characters as the key.
* `-`: Matches the hyphen separating the key and value.
* `((?:\\-|[^-]|\n)*)`: This is the core of the expression. It captures the value:
    * `(?:\\-|[^-]|\n)`: This is a non-capturing group that matches either a backslash-escaped hyphen (`\\-`), any character except a hyphen (`[^-]`), or a newline character (`\n`).
    * `*`: This quantifier indicates that the non-capturing group can appear zero or more times. This allows for multiline values.
* `$`: Matches the end of a line.
* `(?m)`: The multiline flag ensures that `^` and `$` match the beginning and end of each line.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Python**

```python
import re

def extract_key_value_pairs(input_string):
    """Extracts key-value pairs from a multiline string using regular expressions."""
    key_value_pairs = {}
    pattern = r'^(\w+)-((?:\\-|[^-]|\n)*)$(?m)'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, input_string)
    for key, value in matches:
        key_value_pairs[key] = value.replace('\\-', '-')  #unescape hyphen
    return key_value_pairs

input_text = """
name-John Doe
age-30
address-123 Main St,\nAnytown, CA 91234
notes-This is a multiline \n- note with an escaped hyphen \\- in it.
"""

extracted_pairs = extract_key_value_pairs(input_text)
print(extracted_pairs)

```

This Python example utilizes the `re` module for regular expression matching. The `(?m)` flag is crucial for handling multiline input correctly. The `replace` function handles unescaping the hyphens.

**Example 2:  Perl**

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input_string = <<'INPUT';
name-John Doe
age-30
address-123 Main St,
Anytown, CA 91234
notes-This is a multiline 
- note with an escaped hyphen \- in it.
INPUT

my %key_value_pairs;
while ($input_string =~ m/^(\w+)-((?:\\-|[^-]|\n)*)$/mg) {
    $key_value_pairs{$1} = $2;
    $key_value_pairs{$1} =~ s/\\-//g; #unescape hyphen
}

print %key_value_pairs;
```

This Perl example shows a similar approach.  The `m//mg` modifier is used for multiline matching. The `s///g` substitution handles the unescaping of the hyphens. The `while` loop iterates through all matches.

**Example 3:  JavaScript**

```javascript
function extractKeyValuePairs(inputString) {
  const keyValuePairs = {};
  const pattern = /^(\w+)-((?:\\-|[^-]|\n)*)$/gm; // 'g' and 'm' flags are important
  let match;
  while ((match = pattern.exec(inputString)) !== null) {
    let value = match[2].replace(/\\-/g, '-'); //unescape hyphen
    keyValuePairs[match[1]] = value;
  }
  return keyValuePairs;
}


const inputText = `
name-John Doe
age-30
address-123 Main St,
Anytown, CA 91234
notes-This is a multiline 
- note with an escaped hyphen \\- in it.
`;

const extractedPairs = extractKeyValuePairs(inputText);
console.log(extractedPairs);

```

This JavaScript example leverages the `exec` method to iteratively retrieve all matches from the regular expression.  The `g` and `m` flags are set to enable global and multiline matching.  Similar to the previous examples, hyphen unescaping is handled.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of regular expressions, I recommend consulting resources on regular expression syntax and advanced techniques.  Specific regex engine documentation (for Python's `re`, Perl's regex engine, or JavaScript's regular expression API) will be invaluable for handling nuances and optimizing performance.   Finally, exploring the documentation for your chosen programming language regarding string manipulation and input/output handling will prove beneficial for refining the code and adapting it to your specific data format and requirements.  Comprehensive texts on data parsing and data processing are excellent for solidifying theoretical knowledge.
