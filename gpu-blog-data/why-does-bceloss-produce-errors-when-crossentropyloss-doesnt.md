Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss) and Cross-Entropy Loss (CrossEntropyLoss) operate on fundamentally different input assumptions, causing errors when these assumptions are violated. Specifically, BCELoss expects probabilities as inputs, while CrossEntropyLoss anticipates unnormalized logits. This disparity in input expectations is the primary driver behind the errors you're encountering.

My experience developing a medical image segmentation system using PyTorch revealed this distinction acutely. We initially trained a model with sigmoid activation, as we desired probability-like outputs, and inadvertently used CrossEntropyLoss which resulted in convergence problems.  Switching to BCELoss, coupled with proper sigmoid activation, resolved our issue. This illustrates the necessity of understanding each loss function's input requirements.

BCELoss, representing binary cross-entropy, is designed for binary classification tasks â€“ situations where each data point belongs to one of two classes. It evaluates the performance of a model that predicts the probability of the positive class.  Internally, BCELoss uses the following formula for a single data point:

`- (y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p))`

Where `y` is the ground truth label (0 or 1), and `p` is the predicted probability output of the model (between 0 and 1). BCELoss, therefore, relies heavily on the assumption that `p` is in the [0, 1] range. Inputs outside this range lead to undefined log computations (log(0) and log(negative number)) or unstable gradients, causing NaN errors and halting model training. Further, it requires that you have a prediction for each instance, each represented by a single value as it deals with the binary aspect of the loss.

CrossEntropyLoss, in contrast, is intended for multi-class classification scenarios. It does not operate directly on probabilities; instead, it accepts unnormalized outputs, known as logits. Logits are raw, pre-softmax or sigmoid activation values from the model's final linear layer. The formula for calculating the cross-entropy for a single data point is slightly complex but essentially boils down to a probability calculation after an application of the softmax function. PyTorch implements it efficiently by combining the log-softmax and Negative Log Likelihood (NLLLoss) calculations. 

CrossEntropyLoss expects inputs of shape (N, C), where N is the number of samples and C is the number of classes. The ground truth input should be a LongTensor of shape (N) containing class indices (from 0 to C-1). The benefit here is that the network handles probability calculations, which improves stability. Further, this design enables the loss function to incorporate a softmax computation and therefore is applicable to multi-class classification problems. Applying it on binary classification outputs does not cause an error but rather produces meaningless results.

Here are some practical examples illustrating the difference using PyTorch:

**Example 1: BCELoss with Correct Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize BCELoss
bce_loss = nn.BCELoss()

# Assume a model outputs probabilities (after sigmoid).
# For batch size 2
predicted_probabilities = torch.tensor([[0.8], [0.2]], dtype=torch.float) 
ground_truth = torch.tensor([[1.0], [0.0]], dtype=torch.float) # labels 0 or 1

# Calculate loss. This will execute without errors
loss = bce_loss(predicted_probabilities, ground_truth)
print("BCELoss (Correct):", loss)
```
In this example, the predicted probabilities are within [0,1] due to sigmoid activation and the input shape is correct for BCELoss, leading to the loss calculation without errors. The ground truth must be a float tensor, matching the predicted input type.

**Example 2: BCELoss with Incorrect Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize BCELoss
bce_loss = nn.BCELoss()

# Assume a model outputs logits (pre-sigmoid).
# For batch size 2
predicted_logits = torch.tensor([[2.0], [-1.0]], dtype=torch.float)
ground_truth = torch.tensor([[1.0], [0.0]], dtype=torch.float)

# Calculate loss - this will throw a warning and generate NaN Loss if logits are outside the proper range.
try:
    loss = bce_loss(predicted_logits, ground_truth)
    print("BCELoss (Incorrect):", loss)
except Exception as e:
    print("BCELoss (Incorrect): Error:", e) # Will likely throw some form of NaNError

```

Here, the `predicted_logits` are not between 0 and 1. This is likely due to not performing a sigmoid operation on the model's output, violating the input expectation of BCELoss, therefore generating a NaN loss and likely a RuntimeWarning. This clearly highlights the danger of mismatching the expected output from the model with the input needs of BCELoss.

**Example 3: CrossEntropyLoss with Correct Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize CrossEntropyLoss
cross_entropy_loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Assume model output is logits (pre-softmax) for 2 classes
predicted_logits = torch.tensor([[2.0, -1.0], [0.5, 1.0]], dtype=torch.float) # batch size 2, class size 2
ground_truth = torch.tensor([0, 1], dtype=torch.long) # class indices

# Calculate loss - this will execute without errors
loss = cross_entropy_loss(predicted_logits, ground_truth)
print("CrossEntropyLoss (Correct):", loss)

```

In this third example, `predicted_logits` are unnormalized, and the ground truth tensor contains class indices (0 or 1). The model's output reflects two classes and the ground truth reflects which of the two classes a given input sample belongs to. CrossEntropyLoss operates correctly, as its expectations are satisfied. If you were to input probability values into this function it would similarly produce an error, or meaningless results.

The core issue, therefore, is that BCELoss requires probabilities obtained via a sigmoid operation on the network outputs, while CrossEntropyLoss requires logits as input, and automatically applies the softmax function. Using the wrong loss function for a specific output type will result in computational instabilities, errors, and ultimately, a failure to properly train a model.

For further clarity, research related documentation available from the PyTorch official website. Also look at resources that discuss the mathematical foundations of these loss functions such as books on Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al. and other materials discussing probability theory.

Finally, always remember to ensure that the output of your model's final layer aligns with the input expectations of your chosen loss function. If your task involves binary classification and you are using sigmoid activation to predict probabilities, BCELoss is the appropriate choice. If you are performing multi-class classification, CrossEntropyLoss is usually the most convenient and effective loss function. This fundamental difference underpins the errors you're observing when using the two functions interchangeably.
