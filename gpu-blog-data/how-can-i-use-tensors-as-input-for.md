Tensors, when used as arguments for `torch.arange` or `torch.linspace`, do not directly specify the sequence of values to be generated. Instead, they provide the *shape* or *size* of the output tensor. Understanding this distinction is crucial for avoiding common errors and leveraging these functions effectively within PyTorch workflows.

I've personally encountered this issue countless times while building custom neural network layers, particularly when needing to create coordinate grids or index sequences dynamically based on intermediate tensor sizes. The core misunderstanding often lies in confusing a tensor's data contents with its dimensional structure. `torch.arange` and `torch.linspace`, fundamentally, produce evenly spaced numerical sequences. They rely on integer or floating-point start, end, and step parameters (for `arange`) or start, end, and number of points parameters (for `linspace`). Using a tensor as an argument only works to derive the size of the output tensor along one or more dimensions.

Specifically, when providing a tensor as the size parameter, PyTorch uses the shape of the tensor, not its numerical values. This means that if I pass a tensor `x` of shape `(a, b, c)` to `torch.arange`, I won't create a sequence with values taken from `x`, but rather a tensor of shape `(a, b, c)` filled with sequences that are derived from other parameter inputs.

Here’s a breakdown of how it operates, along with clarifying code examples:

**Explanation of `torch.arange` Behavior**

`torch.arange` is used to create a sequence of numbers, generally taking the form `torch.arange(start, end, step)`. The output is a one-dimensional tensor containing a sequence. When we introduce tensors as size arguments, we're not altering the sequence creation itself, but rather dictating how this sequence is arranged into higher dimensions.

The key aspect to remember is that the *first* argument to `torch.arange`, when using a tensor for sizing, must be a scalar integer; a tensor won't work directly as an end or step parameter. If only a tensor is provided to `torch.arange`, it's interpreted as the *end* parameter, where the sequence starts from 0. The size of the output tensor takes the shape of the input tensor argument with the sequence itself added to the last dimension.

**Explanation of `torch.linspace` Behavior**

`torch.linspace`, similar to `torch.arange`, creates a sequence, but it focuses on generating a specified number of evenly spaced points between a given start and end. Its basic use is `torch.linspace(start, end, steps)`, producing a one-dimensional sequence tensor of length `steps`. Again, when using a tensor as size parameters, it does not alter the sequence generation itself but dictates the resulting tensor’s structure.

The primary difference here lies in how the `steps` parameter is handled when specified by a tensor. In such instances, we only provide the start and end arguments as the first two scalar values, and the number of steps is *inferred* by the input tensor's number of elements. The output tensor will take the shape of the input tensor for its last dimensions.

Let's delve into some code examples to illustrate these points:

**Code Example 1: `torch.arange` with Tensor Sizing**

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Generating a 2D Tensor with arange, with tensors for size
size_tensor = torch.tensor([2, 3])
sequence_tensor = torch.arange(10, out=torch.empty(*size_tensor))
print("Example 1:", sequence_tensor)
print("Shape of Example 1:", sequence_tensor.shape)


# Example 2: Generating a 3D Tensor with arange with tensors for size
size_tensor = torch.tensor([3, 2, 2])
sequence_tensor = torch.arange(10, out=torch.empty(*size_tensor))
print("Example 2:", sequence_tensor)
print("Shape of Example 2:", sequence_tensor.shape)
```

**Commentary on Example 1:**

In Example 1, I initially created a tensor, `size_tensor`, of shape `(2, 3)`. Then I created a sequence with `torch.arange` where the `out` parameter takes an empty tensor with size taken from `size_tensor`. The resulting tensor, `sequence_tensor`, is therefore shaped `(2, 3)`, and the numbers are sequenced within the last dimension.  Here, the range goes from 0 to 9, and is distributed across the last dimension, then repeated through the higher dimension.

**Commentary on Example 2:**

Example 2 extends the approach to three dimensions. I use a `size_tensor` of shape `(3, 2, 2)`. The resulting `sequence_tensor` mirrors this shape. The underlying sequence from `torch.arange` is now distributed across three dimensions.

**Code Example 2: Using Tensor Size with `torch.arange` and other parameters**

```python
import torch

# Example 3: Generating a Tensor with arange, specifying start and end, but size as tensor
size_tensor = torch.tensor([2, 3])
sequence_tensor = torch.arange(start=5, end=11, out=torch.empty(*size_tensor))
print("Example 3:", sequence_tensor)
print("Shape of Example 3:", sequence_tensor.shape)

# Example 4: Generating a Tensor with arange, specifying start and end, but size as tensor
size_tensor = torch.tensor([3, 2, 2])
sequence_tensor = torch.arange(start=5, end=17, out=torch.empty(*size_tensor))
print("Example 4:", sequence_tensor)
print("Shape of Example 4:", sequence_tensor.shape)
```

**Commentary on Example 3:**

Example 3 demonstrates how other parameters can be utilized. This time I use `start` and `end` and the output has a shape based on the `size_tensor`. The last dimension is based on the sequence of numbers from 5 to 10.

**Commentary on Example 4:**

In Example 4, I use a three-dimensional tensor for sizing. The sequence goes from 5 to 16 and are allocated to the output tensor with the last dimension incrementing in the sequence.

**Code Example 3: `torch.linspace` with Tensor Sizing**

```python
import torch

# Example 5: Linspace with tensor size.
size_tensor = torch.tensor([2, 3])
sequence_tensor = torch.linspace(start=0, end=1, steps=6, out=torch.empty(*size_tensor))
print("Example 5:", sequence_tensor)
print("Shape of Example 5:", sequence_tensor.shape)

# Example 6: Linspace with tensor size.
size_tensor = torch.tensor([3, 2, 2])
sequence_tensor = torch.linspace(start=0, end=1, steps=12, out=torch.empty(*size_tensor))
print("Example 6:", sequence_tensor)
print("Shape of Example 6:", sequence_tensor.shape)
```

**Commentary on Example 5:**

In Example 5, a tensor `size_tensor` of shape `(2, 3)` is provided to the `out` parameter of `torch.linspace`, determining the shape of the output. The start and end are set to 0 and 1 respectively, and the number of steps to 6. The output therefore is shaped to be (2, 3) where the sequence is placed into the last dimension first.

**Commentary on Example 6:**

Example 6 is structured similarly to Example 5, this time with a three dimensional tensor for sizing. It shows that the size of the tensor controls the shape of the final tensor, with the sequence placed along the last dimension.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding of PyTorch tensors and their manipulation, I recommend consulting several official and community-developed resources. The official PyTorch documentation is paramount, providing the most accurate and detailed information on every function, including `torch.arange` and `torch.linspace`. Specifically, pay close attention to the parameter descriptions and the examples provided. Furthermore, online tutorials and courses specializing in deep learning using PyTorch often cover tensor handling in depth, providing valuable insights. Also, practice with tensor operations using different sizes and parameter combinations is crucial for solidifying practical understanding. Experimenting with different tensor dimensions, including higher dimensions and larger tensor sizes, will reinforce these principles. Additionally, exploring the source code of PyTorch's tensor operations within GitHub can provide an even greater level of insight into implementation details.
