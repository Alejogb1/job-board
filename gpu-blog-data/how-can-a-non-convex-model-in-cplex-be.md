Non-convexity in optimization models, particularly those aiming to minimize production cost per period, frequently arises from the interaction of discrete decision variables, non-linear cost functions, or both.  My experience working on large-scale production scheduling problems for a major petrochemical company highlighted the challenges inherent in tackling these non-convex formulations within the CPLEX framework.  Directly solving such models using CPLEX's default MIP solver is often impractical due to the potential for the solver to get trapped in local optima, resulting in suboptimal solutions and potentially significant economic losses.

The core challenge stems from the absence of a globally optimal solution guarantee in non-convex problems.  Convex optimization problems, characterized by a convex objective function and feasible region, possess a single global optimum readily attainable by standard algorithms.  Non-convex problems, however, can contain multiple local optima, some considerably inferior to the global optimum.  Therefore, a strategic approach is required, moving beyond simple application of the default MIP solver.

One effective strategy involves reformulating the problem to exploit CPLEXâ€™s capabilities.  This might involve linearization techniques, decomposition methods, or the use of specialized algorithms.  The specific approach depends heavily on the nature of the non-convexity.

**1.  Linearization Techniques:**

If the non-convexity arises from non-linear cost functions, piecewise linear approximations offer a viable solution.  This involves approximating the non-linear function using a series of linear segments.  The accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of segments used; more segments provide greater accuracy but increase the problem size and computational burden.

**Code Example 1: Piecewise Linear Approximation**

```c++
#include <ilcplex/ilocplex.h>

int main() {
  IloEnv env;
  IloModel model(env);
  IloNumVar x(env, 0, 100, ILOFLOAT); // Production quantity
  IloNumVar y(env, 0, 100, ILOINT); // Integer variable for segment selection

  // Non-linear cost function approximated with 2 segments
  IloExpr cost(env);
  cost += 10 * x; // Cost for x <= 50
  cost += 20 * (x - 50); // Additional cost for x > 50, slope increased to simulate non-linearity.
  model.add(IloMinimize(env,cost)); // Minimize cost

  // Constraint to enforce piecewise linear approximation (simplified example)
  model.add(x <= 50 + 50*y); // If y = 0, x <= 50; If y = 1, x <= 100
  model.add(y <= 1); // y is a binary decision variable


  IloCplex cplex(model);
  cplex.solve();

  env.end();
  return 0;
}

```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple piecewise linear approximation of a non-linear cost function.  The `y` variable acts as a selector for the different segments.  More sophisticated piecewise linear approximations involve more segments and binary variables to manage the transitions between them.  The key is to maintain the feasibility of the approximated model while capturing the essential characteristics of the original non-linear function.  Note that this code is a simplified illustration and requires appropriate error handling and more detailed constraints for realistic applications.


**2.  Decomposition Methods:**

For large-scale problems exhibiting complex non-convexities, decomposition methods can be highly effective.  These methods break down the original problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems that can be solved individually and then coordinated to find a solution to the overall problem.  Benders decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation are two common approaches.


**Code Example 2: Benders Decomposition (Conceptual Outline)**

```c++
// This example only provides a conceptual outline.  Full implementation is significantly more complex
#include <ilcplex/ilocplex.h>

// ... (Master problem definition) ...
// ... (Subproblem definition) ...

int main() {
  IloEnv env;
  IloModel master(env);
  IloModel sub(env);

  // ... (Iterative solution process) ...

  // Solve master problem
  // Generate cuts from subproblem solution
  // Add cuts to master problem
  // Repeat until convergence

  env.end();
  return 0;
}
```

This conceptual outline highlights the iterative nature of Benders decomposition. The master problem provides initial solutions, which are then evaluated by the subproblem.  The subproblem generates optimality cuts (or feasibility cuts if infeasible) which are added to the master problem, refining the solution iteratively.  The implementation complexity is considerably higher than the previous example, requiring significant code to handle the iterative solution process and cut generation.


**3.  Global Optimization Solvers:**

While CPLEX's default MIP solver is not designed for global optimization in non-convex problems, alternative solvers specifically designed for this purpose can be integrated.  These solvers often employ techniques like branch-and-bound with specialized branching rules and heuristics to explore the solution space more efficiently and identify near-global optima.


**Code Example 3: Using a Different Solver (Conceptual)**

```c++
// Requires integrating a different solver library (e.g., BARON, ANTIGONE)
#include <other_solver_library.h> // Replace with actual library

int main() {
  // Model definition using the other solver's API
  // ...

  // Solve the model using the global solver
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

This example simply illustrates that alternative solvers might be more appropriate for solving this class of problems. Integrating a global solver usually necessitates using a different solver API and data structures.  It's crucial to understand the licensing and integration complexities before adopting this approach.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*  The CPLEX documentation. This provides detailed information on all aspects of the CPLEX solver, including advanced features and techniques for handling non-convex problems.
*  Texts on mathematical optimization.  These provide theoretical foundations and practical guidance on formulating and solving various optimization problems.
*  Research papers on global optimization. These will explore advanced algorithms and techniques for tackling non-convex problems.  Focus on papers discussing Benders decomposition, Lagrangian relaxation, and other relevant methods.



In conclusion, addressing non-convex models in CPLEX for production cost minimization requires a carefully chosen strategy tailored to the specific nature of the non-convexity.  Piecewise linearization, decomposition methods, and employing dedicated global optimization solvers are key approaches to consider.  The choice depends on the problem size, the complexity of the non-convexity, and the desired level of solution accuracy.  The code examples provided serve as starting points, requiring significant adaptation and extension for deployment in a realistic production environment.  Remember to thoroughly validate the chosen approach through rigorous testing and sensitivity analysis.
