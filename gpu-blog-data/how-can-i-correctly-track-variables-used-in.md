In Keras, subclassing layers and incorporating Lambda layers introduces a specific challenge: maintaining accurate track of the variables involved within the functional processing defined by the Lambda layer, especially when these variables are meant to be trainable parameters. Mismanagement often results in unoptimized layers, silent failures, or unexpected behavior during training. I've personally spent many late nights debugging this exact issue while developing complex architectures involving dynamic routing, so I've seen firsthand the importance of adhering to proper variable tracking mechanisms.

The core problem arises from the fact that Lambda layers, by their design, encapsulate arbitrary TensorFlow functions. While powerful, they don't inherently participate in the Keras layer's variable lifecycle. Consequently, if you create variables within a Lambda layer's function without explicitly linking them to the parent subclassed layer, Keras's automatic training mechanisms, such as those enabled by `model.fit()`, will fail to recognize and optimize those variables. These are then treated as constants by the optimizer.

To solve this, the correct methodology involves registering all trainable variables within the subclassed layer's `build()` method and then explicitly using those registered variables within the `call()` method, including when passed into the Lambda layer. The `build()` method is the appropriate place to allocate and register weights; this occurs only once, when the layer is first created and the input shape is known. The `call()` method defines the forward pass and is responsible for actually using these created weights to perform the computation. This establishes a relationship between the created parameters and the layer, allowing the Keras training process to identify, track, and optimize these variables as necessary. It's analogous to how built-in layers handle their variables internally.

Here’s a detailed breakdown: You need to define your variables in the `build()` function of your custom layer as `tf.Variable` objects and then access them through `self`. You are responsible for their initial value and their shape. This is important because these must be tensors. Then, the call method, or the internal function passed into the lambda layer, must use these variables for calculations. It is essential to understand that anything computed in the lambda layer's function that is not an attribute of the custom layer will not participate in back propagation.

Let's illustrate this with several code examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Approach**

This example demonstrates the common pitfall of defining a variable within the lambda function, failing to track it within the layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class IncorrectLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(IncorrectLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        def lambda_function(x):
            # Incorrect: Creates an unmanaged variable
            weight = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal(shape=(x.shape[-1], self.units)), trainable=True)
            return tf.matmul(x, weight)

        return keras.layers.Lambda(lambda_function)(inputs)


# Creating a model
model_incorrect = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    IncorrectLayer(units=5),
    keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# Demonstrating the issue by printing the trainable weights, it will be empty.
print("Trainable weights in incorrect layer:", model_incorrect.trainable_weights)
```

In this first example, the weight matrix used inside the lambda function is declared as a `tf.Variable` within lambda_function. This makes it look like a trainable weight, but Keras does not register it. Therefore, this weight will not be modified during training and will not participate in gradient calculations. The model created contains no trainable variables. This will result in the training process not optimizing the lambda's operation. If we were to train this, it would likely not converge on a reasonable solution, and we would see issues with either the training loss not decreasing, or the model not generalizing.

**Example 2: Correct Approach**

The following example shows the proper way to track the variable.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CorrectLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CorrectLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
      # Correct: Creates and registers a weight in the build method.
      self.weight = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                    initializer="random_normal",
                                    trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        def lambda_function(x, weight):
            return tf.matmul(x, weight)
        return keras.layers.Lambda(lambda_function, arguments={"weight": self.weight})(inputs)


# Creating a model using the correct layer
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CorrectLayer(units=5),
    keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# Demonstrating the success by printing the trainable weights
print("Trainable weights in correct layer:", model_correct.trainable_weights)
```

In this second example, the weight is declared in the `build` method as a `self.add_weight`. This explicitly registers the weight with the layer, making it a trainable parameter. Subsequently, in the `call` method, the weight is passed into the lambda function as an argument. Because it has been registered in the `build` method, Keras now tracks it correctly and the gradient calculations and updates will work correctly. Crucially, the Lambda layer receives the registered weight via the `arguments` parameter. This is the key aspect that establishes the connection between the layer’s and the lambda’s variables. The printed `trainable_weights` will now show our newly registered variable.

**Example 3: More Complex Application**

Finally, this example illustrates a more involved case, where the lambda encapsulates multiple operations with a trainable variable.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ComplexLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
    super(ComplexLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.units = units

  def build(self, input_shape):
    self.weight = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer="random_normal",
                                  trainable=True)
    self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer="zeros", trainable=True)

  def call(self, inputs):
    def complex_lambda(x, weight, bias):
      matmul_result = tf.matmul(x, weight)
      return tf.nn.relu(matmul_result + bias)
    return keras.layers.Lambda(complex_lambda, arguments={"weight": self.weight, "bias": self.bias})(inputs)


# Creating a model using the complex layer
model_complex = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    ComplexLayer(units=5),
    keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# Demonstrating that the model has trainable weights.
print("Trainable weights in the complex layer:", model_complex.trainable_weights)
```

Here, we see that multiple weights are registered with the custom layer and passed into the lambda function. We registered `weight` and `bias` as layer attributes using `self.add_weight` in the `build` method. Then they are passed to the lambda function using the `arguments` parameter. This ensures that any operations performed with these parameters are properly tracked by Keras’s training mechanism. We correctly see both trainable weights in `trainable_weights`. This illustrates a common pattern of using a lambda as an activation function that requires a trainable weight and bias.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen your understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on custom layers and how Keras handles training. In addition, review the examples of Keras Lambda layer use. It is also useful to explore the source code of pre-built Keras layers and observe how they construct and use `add_weight` and their `build` and `call` methods. This provides practical examples of how to appropriately manage and track trainable variables. Furthermore, research the concept of variable scope in TensorFlow, as this is closely related to how Keras manages its layer variables. Understanding variable scope can provide a more conceptual understanding of what is happening behind the scenes. Studying research papers dealing with custom layer implementations may give further insight to these core concepts. I have personally found that repeatedly implementing custom layers to solve increasingly complex problems is the best approach to gaining a fundamental and pragmatic understanding of the underlying processes.
