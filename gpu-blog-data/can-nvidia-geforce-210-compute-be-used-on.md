The Nvidia GeForce 210, while an older generation card, possesses compute capabilities that *can* be utilized within the Ubuntu 18.04 environment, but with crucial caveats.  My experience working with legacy hardware on various Linux distributions, including extensive troubleshooting on Ubuntu LTS releases, highlights the importance of understanding the limitations and necessary driver configurations.  DirectCompute support, for instance, is absent; the primary route for leveraging its compute power resides in CUDA.  However, the availability of CUDA drivers for such an aged card is restricted and requires careful attention to driver version compatibility.

**1.  Explanation:**

The GeForce 210 utilizes the Fermi architecture, a generation that enjoys relatively broad CUDA support, though not necessarily across all driver versions.  Ubuntu 18.04, while now past its official support lifecycle, maintains a large repository of packages.  However, the Nvidia drivers available via apt might not encompass the specific versions required for optimal GeForce 210 performance.  This often leads to installation issues, performance bottlenecks, or complete driver failure.  Therefore, employing the official Nvidia drivers downloaded directly from the Nvidia website is paramount.  Successful utilization hinges on selecting a CUDA-compatible driver version that's known to function with the GeForce 210's hardware capabilities and the kernel version used by Ubuntu 18.04 (typically 4.15).  Furthermore, the compute capability of the GeForce 210 is relatively low (2.1), significantly limiting its suitability for modern, computationally intensive tasks. Its performance should be anticipated to be considerably lower compared to more contemporary GPUs.

The installation process necessitates several key steps:  removal of any pre-existing Nvidia drivers (to avoid conflicts), installation of the appropriate build-essential packages (required for compiling certain driver components), and finally, the installation of the downloaded driver package, carefully following Nvidia's installation guide for Linux.  Post-installation, verifying the driver installation via `nvidia-smi` is crucial to confirm that the GPU is detected and its compute capabilities are accessible.  Further validation can be achieved through running simple CUDA programs, as illustrated below.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Verification of CUDA Installation and Device Properties:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int deviceCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

  if (deviceCount == 0) {
    printf("Error: No CUDA devices found.\n");
    return 1;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; ++i) {
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, i);
    printf("Device %d: %s\n", i, prop.name);
    printf("Compute Capability: %d.%d\n", prop.major, prop.minor);
    printf("Total Global Memory: %lu bytes\n", prop.totalGlobalMem);
    // ... other relevant properties can be printed here ...
  }

  return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:*  This simple program utilizes the CUDA runtime API to retrieve information about the available CUDA-capable devices.  The output will confirm the presence of the GeForce 210 and its compute capability (expected to be 2.1).  Errors during execution might indicate driver installation issues or CUDA library path problems.  Compilation requires the CUDA compiler (`nvcc`).

**Example 2:  Simple Vector Addition on GPU:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024 * 1024; // Example size
  int *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
  int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Allocate host memory
  h_a = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  h_b = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  h_c = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize host data
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    h_a[i] = i;
    h_b[i] = i * 2;
  }

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Verify results (optional)
  // ...

  // Free memory
  free(h_a);
  free(h_b);
  free(h_c);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a fundamental CUDA kernel performing vector addition.  It showcases data transfer between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory, kernel launch configuration, and basic CUDA operations.  Performance will be modest due to the GeForce 210's limitations.  Successful execution confirms CUDA's functionality on the system.

**Example 3:  Utilizing cuBLAS for Matrix Multiplication:**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... (Error handling omitted for brevity) ...
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  cublasCreate(&handle);

  const int m = 1024;
  const int n = 1024;
  const int k = 1024;

  float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
  float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;

  // Allocate memory on host and device
  // ...

  // Initialize matrices A and B on host
  // ...

  // Copy matrices A and B to device
  // ...

  // Perform matrix multiplication using cuBLAS
  cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, m, n, k, &onef, d_A, m, d_B, k, &zerof, d_C, m);

  // Copy result from device to host
  // ...

  // Free memory and handle
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This example leverages cuBLAS, a CUDA library for performing highly optimized linear algebra operations.  Matrix multiplication is a computationally intensive task, highlighting the GeForce 210's limitations. This example would require significantly more lines to handle error checks, memory allocation/deallocation, and initialization steps, but is presented in a shortened format for brevity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Nvidia CUDA Toolkit Documentation.  Nvidia cuBLAS Library Guide.  Official Nvidia Driver Download Page.  A comprehensive guide to CUDA programming.  A reference manual for the CUDA runtime API.  The Ubuntu 18.04 documentation pertaining to driver management.  These resources will provide the necessary information and guidance for successful implementation and troubleshooting.  Remember to always consult the most up-to-date documentation from Nvidia, as driver support and CUDA API details may change over time.
