The prevalent observation that TensorFlow GPU training time escalates significantly after initial iterations, despite a constant dataset and model configuration, often stems from inefficient memory management within the CUDA environment, particularly when dealing with dynamic tensor allocation and deallocation. This behavior, which I've frequently encountered during model prototyping, isn’t inherent to TensorFlow itself but rather a consequence of how GPU resources are handled. The initial iterations often benefit from relatively small memory footprints, allowing efficient allocation. However, as the training progresses and new operations are encountered, a gradual increase in memory fragmentation and allocation overhead emerges.

At the heart of this issue lies CUDA's memory management. Unlike CPU memory, GPU memory is constrained and requires explicit allocation and deallocation via the CUDA runtime API. TensorFlow abstracts much of this complexity, but the underlying CUDA mechanics still govern performance. When a TensorFlow operation requires a new tensor, the framework requests memory from the CUDA driver. If previously allocated memory of the appropriate size is readily available, that memory is reused. However, if sufficient contiguous free memory doesn't exist, CUDA must allocate a new block. Subsequent deallocation can lead to fragmentation, where smaller pockets of free memory are dispersed across the GPU’s address space.

This fragmentation introduces performance penalties in two primary ways. First, the CUDA driver has to spend more time searching for suitable free memory blocks, thus slowing allocation operations. Second, even when a suitable block is found, its physical location may be suboptimal for subsequent data access patterns, leading to increased latency during data transfer and computation. This effect becomes more pronounced as the network deepens or batch sizes increase, placing greater demands on GPU memory.

Furthermore, the interaction between TensorFlow's memory management and Python's garbage collection can exacerbate this issue. While TensorFlow strives to minimize object creation, Python's dynamic nature means that many temporary objects are produced during training, some of which may hold references to GPU tensors. If these objects aren't collected quickly enough by Python, they prevent TensorFlow from reclaiming the associated GPU memory even when those tensors are no longer in use. This can result in persistent memory consumption, contributing to both increased allocation time and out-of-memory errors, especially when using complex or large models.

To illustrate how this impacts TensorFlow training, consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: Simple Model Training with Naive Allocation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# Assume a simple model (e.g., a single dense layer) and data are defined elsewhere

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

x_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 100))
y_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 1))
batch_size = 32
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(batch_size)

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

num_epochs = 10

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    start = time.time()
    for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        loss = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Time: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

This basic training loop, while functionally correct, doesn’t optimize for memory management. Each epoch involves repeated allocations within the `train_step` function. If these allocations become fragmented over time, each epoch will take increasingly longer to execute. The `tf.function` decorator aims to optimize the computation graph, but it cannot entirely eliminate the overhead of fragmented memory.

**Example 2: Introducing Memory Growth Configuration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# Assume model, data, and training loop are as in Example 1

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

x_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 100))
y_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 1))
batch_size = 32
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(batch_size)

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

num_epochs = 10

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    start = time.time()
    for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        loss = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Time: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Here, the addition of `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)` instructs TensorFlow to allocate memory only as it is needed, rather than pre-allocating a large chunk upfront. This “memory growth” strategy can help to reduce fragmentation, particularly in situations where memory usage fluctuates frequently during training.  The program now starts using a minimal amount of GPU memory and progressively increases it as needed. This change typically reduces the steep increase in training time over epochs.

**Example 3: Explicit Garbage Collection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import gc

# Assume model, data, and training loop are as in Example 1

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

x_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 100))
y_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 1))
batch_size = 32
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(batch_size)

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

num_epochs = 10

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    start = time.time()
    for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        loss = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
        if step % 10 == 0:  # Invoke garbage collection periodically
            gc.collect()
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Time: {end - start:.2f} seconds")

```

In this example, I've added explicit garbage collection using `gc.collect()`. By invoking garbage collection periodically, especially within the inner loop, the Python interpreter can reclaim memory occupied by objects holding tensor references, which might otherwise persist and prevent memory reuse within CUDA. This helps in maintaining a more consistent training time, although it can also introduce small overhead. This is done here to illustrate the point but not typically best practice for production code.

In summary, the observed increase in training time isn't an issue with the TensorFlow API itself. Instead, it's primarily a symptom of suboptimal CUDA memory management leading to fragmentation and increased allocation overhead. Employing strategies such as enabling memory growth, carefully managing object lifetimes, and judiciously employing garbage collection can mitigate the problem.

For further exploration into this area, I recommend consulting resources on CUDA memory management practices, TensorFlow performance optimization guides, and articles on Python garbage collection's interaction with scientific computing libraries. Investigating TensorFlow’s memory profiler, available via TensorBoard, is also invaluable. Understanding the internals of CUDA’s memory allocator through NVIDIA's documentation can shed further light on the causes of this behavior.
