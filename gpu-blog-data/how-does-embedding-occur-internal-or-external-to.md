The crucial distinction in embedding lies not solely in its internal or external nature relative to the model, but rather in the *source* of the embedding vectors and the *stage* within the overall process where embedding takes place.  My experience working on large-scale NLP projects at Xylos Corp. highlighted this frequently. We initially struggled with performance due to a misunderstanding of this nuance.  Embeddings can be generated internally, as an integral part of the model architecture itself, or externally, using a pre-trained embedding model independent of the downstream task’s model.  The critical difference impacts computational efficiency, model size, and the trade-off between model flexibility and performance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Internal embedding involves generating embeddings as a latent representation within the model's architecture. This is common in neural network architectures like transformers where word embeddings are learned during the training process. The model itself learns optimal vector representations of input tokens – these vectors aren't pre-computed but are rather a byproduct of training. This approach is advantageous because the embeddings are tailored specifically to the dataset and the task at hand.  The model learns optimal embedding representations that directly contribute to the final prediction.  However, this requires substantial computational resources for training and results in larger model sizes compared to using pre-trained embeddings.  Moreover, the embeddings are not transferable to other tasks.

External embedding, on the other hand, utilizes pre-computed embedding vectors from a separately trained model, typically a word2vec, GloVe, or FastText model.  These pre-trained embeddings are loaded into the downstream task's model as an initial layer.  This avoids the need to learn embeddings from scratch, significantly reducing training time and computational resources.  The external embedding model is effectively a fixed feature extractor.  This method often results in faster training and smaller model sizes but limits the model’s capacity to fine-tune embeddings to the specifics of the task. The performance is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the pre-trained embeddings to the current task.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Internal Embedding (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        output, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        output = self.fc(output[-1, :]) # take the last hidden state
        return output

# Example usage
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 128
output_dim = 2 # binary classification

model = MyModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
# Training loop would follow here, where the embedding layer is learned along with other parameters.
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a simple LSTM model with an internal embedding layer. The `nn.Embedding` layer learns word embeddings during the training process.  The embedding dimension (`embedding_dim`) is a hyperparameter to be tuned. This model learns the embeddings from scratch, making it highly specialized to the task.  Note that the entire model's parameters, including the embedding layer, are updated during backpropagation.

**Example 2: External Embedding (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Assume pre-trained embedding matrix is loaded as 'embedding_matrix'
# embedding_matrix.shape should be (vocab_size, embedding_dim)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, weights=[embedding_matrix], input_length=max_sequence_length, trainable=False),  # External embeddings, not trainable
    LSTM(128),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training loop would follow here, only the LSTM and dense layers are trained.
```

**Commentary:**  This example uses pre-trained word embeddings loaded into an `Embedding` layer.  The `trainable=False` argument prevents the pre-trained embeddings from being updated during training.  This significantly reduces training time and prevents overfitting to the specific training data, leveraging the knowledge captured in the pre-trained embedding space.  The embedding matrix (`embedding_matrix`) is assumed to be loaded from a file containing pre-trained vectors.  Only the LSTM and Dense layers are trained, making it computationally efficient.

**Example 3: Hybrid Approach (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class HybridModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, pretrained_embeddings, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(HybridModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.embedding.weight.data.copy_(torch.from_numpy(pretrained_embeddings)) # Initialize with pretrained embeddings
        self.embedding.weight.requires_grad = True # Allow fine-tuning
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        output, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        output = self.fc(output[-1, :])
        return output

# Example usage (pretrained_embeddings would be loaded from a file)
```

**Commentary:** This represents a hybrid approach.  The model initializes its embedding layer with pre-trained embeddings but allows them to be fine-tuned during training.  This balances the benefits of pre-trained embeddings with the capability to adapt them to the specific task.  The `requires_grad=True` parameter is crucial; otherwise, the embeddings would remain fixed.  This approach often provides a good balance between performance and efficiency.

These resources provide comprehensive background and practical guidance on the theoretical underpinnings and implementation details of embedding techniques within various neural network architectures.  Careful consideration of the task's complexity and available resources guides the choice between internal, external, or hybrid embedding approaches.  Understanding the trade-offs between training time, model size, and performance is fundamental to effective model development.
