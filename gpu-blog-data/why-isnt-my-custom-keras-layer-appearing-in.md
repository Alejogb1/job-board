The absence of a custom Keras layer in a model summary typically stems from an incorrect implementation of the `__init__` and `call` methods, or a failure to correctly integrate the layer within the model's sequential or functional API.  Over the years, I've debugged countless instances of this, often stemming from subtle errors in how the layer interacts with the Keras tensor manipulation system.  The key is to meticulously verify both the layer's internal structure and its proper inclusion within the larger model.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Keras layers, whether built-in or custom, need to adhere to a specific structure to be recognized by the `model.summary()` function.  The `__init__` method defines the layer's internal weights and variables, while the `call` method dictates how input tensors are transformed.  Crucially, both methods need to correctly utilize the Keras backend's tensor manipulation functions (e.g., `tf.keras.backend.dot`, `tf.keras.layers.Layer.add_weight`, etc.)  Failing to do so can result in Keras not recognizing the layer as a valid component, thus omitting it from the summary.  Moreover, the layer must be correctly added to the model using either the sequential or functional API.  Incorrect usage of these APIs will also prevent the layer from being included in the summary.  Finally, ensure that the layer is actually being called during the model's forward pass. A seemingly correctly defined layer, if bypassed due to logic flaws in the model, will similarly not appear.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Weight Initialization**

This example demonstrates a common error where the layer's weights aren't correctly initialized using the Keras backend functions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        # Incorrect:  This uses a NumPy array, not a Keras tensor.
        self.w = np.random.randn(units) #INCORRECT

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.w)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyLayer(name='my_layer'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.summary()
```

In this case, `model.summary()` would likely omit `MyLayer` because `self.w` isn't a Keras variable.  The corrected version below utilizes `add_weight` for proper initialization:


```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', name='kernel')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.w)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyLayer(name='my_layer'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.summary()
```

This corrected version uses `add_weight` to create a Keras tensor, ensuring the layer is correctly recognized.

**Example 2:  Missing `call` method or incorrect tensor manipulation**

This demonstrates a scenario where the `call` method isn't correctly handling the input tensor, leading to the layer not being included.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', name='kernel')

    # Incorrect:  This doesn't perform a proper tensor operation.
    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs #INCORRECT

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyLayer(name='my_layer'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.summary()
```

The `call` method simply returns the input without any transformation. The corrected version would perform a valid tensor operation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', name='kernel')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.w)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyLayer(name='my_layer'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.summary()
```

This revised `call` method correctly applies a matrix multiplication, integrating the layer into the model's computational graph.

**Example 3: Functional API Integration Issue**

This example illustrates a potential problem when incorporating a custom layer into a model built using the Keras functional API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', name='kernel')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.w)


input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = MyLayer(name='my_layer')(input_layer) #Correct usage
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)
model.summary()
```

This demonstrates the proper usage of the functional API, where `MyLayer` is correctly integrated and applied to the input tensor.  However, forgetting to correctly integrate into the input/output structure would lead to the layer not appearing in the summary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers.  Consult advanced Keras tutorials focusing on the functional API and layer implementation.  Explore documentation specific to the tensor manipulation functions provided by the Keras backend.  Furthermore, debugging techniques like print statements within the `__init__` and `call` methods to monitor variable values and tensor shapes can prove invaluable.  Carefully examine Keras error messages as they often pinpoint the source of the issue. Finally, reviewing examples of correctly implemented custom layers in open-source projects can aid understanding.
