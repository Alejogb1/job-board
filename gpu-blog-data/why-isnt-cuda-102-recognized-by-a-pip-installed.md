The incompatibility between a pip-installed PyTorch 1.7.1 and CUDA 10.2 stems from PyTorch's pre-built binary distributions being version-specific.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects—ranging from deep reinforcement learning environments to high-throughput image processing pipelines—has underscored this critical point:  PyTorch wheels are not universally compatible;  the CUDA toolkit version used during compilation is inextricably linked to the resulting binary.

**1. Explanation:**

PyTorch, for efficiency, provides pre-compiled binaries optimized for specific hardware and software configurations. This is done to bypass the often-lengthy compilation process required when building PyTorch from source.  These pre-built wheels are packaged to include the necessary CUDA libraries and routines.  If the CUDA version on your system (10.2 in this case) doesn't match the CUDA version that the PyTorch 1.7.1 wheel was built against, PyTorch will fail to load correctly. This results in errors indicating it cannot find necessary CUDA libraries or functions. The mismatch manifests in various ways, from cryptic runtime errors to outright import failures.  Importantly, the CUDA version is not the only factor.  The cuDNN version used during the PyTorch build is also critical for compatibility.  Incorrect versions of either CUDA or cuDNN will lead to a similar problem.

The pip installation process, while convenient, relies on finding a pre-built wheel compatible with your system's architecture (e.g., x86_64) and installed dependencies.  If no matching wheel is found in the PyPI repository (or your chosen index), pip will either fail or, in some cases, attempt (and likely fail) to build PyTorch from source, requiring a full CUDA toolkit and other relevant dependencies. This is generally avoided given the complexities and potential for errors.

Therefore, the core issue is not a fundamental incompatibility between CUDA 10.2 and PyTorch 1.7.1 in principle, but rather a mismatch between the CUDA version used to build the specific PyTorch 1.7.1 wheel you installed and the CUDA toolkit currently on your system.

**2. Code Examples & Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how this incompatibility manifests, accompanied by commentary:

**Example 1:  Import Failure**

```python
import torch

# Output:  ImportError: ... could not be loaded because ... (CUDA-related error message)
```

This is a common initial symptom.  The `import torch` statement fails because PyTorch cannot find the correctly compiled CUDA libraries at runtime. The specific error message provides crucial clues regarding the missing library, often specifying the CUDA version.

**Example 2:  Runtime Error**

```python
import torch

x = torch.rand(10, 10).cuda() # Attempt to allocate tensor on the GPU

# Output: RuntimeError: ... CUDA error ... (a CUDA runtime error detailing the incompatibility)
```

Here, the import succeeds, but the attempt to use the GPU fails. The `cuda()` method attempts to allocate a tensor on the CUDA-enabled GPU.  A runtime error indicates that the CUDA driver cannot communicate correctly with the PyTorch library.

**Example 3:  Checking CUDA Availability (and Version)**

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Output: True or False (depending on CUDA availability)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(torch.version.cuda) # Output: Version string (e.g., '10.1') or None
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    x = torch.rand(10,10).to(device)
    print(x.device)
else:
    print("CUDA is not available")

```
This code snippet is useful for diagnosing the problem. It first checks for CUDA availability.  If available, it prints the CUDA version used by PyTorch.  This is crucial – comparing this version to your system's CUDA version (10.2) will confirm the version mismatch. The final block allocates a tensor to a specific device in case the CUDA version aligns. If the printed device is "cuda", then the CUDA setup is correct.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation pertaining to installation instructions.  Specifically, pay attention to the available pre-built binaries and their respective CUDA and cuDNN version requirements.  The PyTorch website usually provides clear guidance on selecting the appropriate package. Consult the CUDA Toolkit documentation for details on installing and verifying the correct version of the CUDA toolkit. The cuDNN library documentation should also be reviewed for compatibility information. Finally, consult the documentation for your specific NVIDIA GPU to ensure driver compatibility with both CUDA and cuDNN.  Understanding the interdependencies is key.  A systematic check of all three — PyTorch, CUDA, and cuDNN — is essential to eliminate incompatibility.
