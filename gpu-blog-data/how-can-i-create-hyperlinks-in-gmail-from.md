Gmail's lack of direct mail merge functionality necessitates a workaround involving Google Apps Script.  My experience automating email campaigns revealed that the most robust and scalable solution leverages Google Sheets as the data source and Apps Script to generate emails with hyperlinks, circumventing the limitations of built-in mail merge capabilities. This approach ensures dynamic hyperlink generation based on the sheet data, eliminating the need for manual link insertion in each email.

**1. Explanation of the Process:**

The process involves three key components: a Google Sheet containing email data and hyperlinks, a Google Apps Script to read and process this data, and Gmail's sending functionality accessed via the script.  The Google Sheet will act as the master data repository. Each row represents a recipient, with columns dedicated to recipient email address, the display text for the hyperlink, and the actual URL.  The Apps Script iterates through the rows, constructing the email body dynamically, embedding hyperlinks using HTML `<a>` tags.  Finally, the script uses the Gmail API to send these customized emails.  Error handling is crucial; the script should gracefully handle missing data, invalid URLs, and Gmail API rate limits.  My experience has shown that implementing exponential backoff strategies significantly improves the reliability of large-scale mail merges.  Further, utilizing batch processing techniques for sending emails minimizes the overall execution time.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Hyperlink Generation**

This example demonstrates the fundamental process of creating and embedding hyperlinks within a Gmail email body generated from Google Sheet data.

```javascript  
function sendEmailsWithHyperlinks() {
  // Get the spreadsheet and sheet data
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const sheet = ss.getSheetByName("Sheet1"); // Replace "Sheet1" with your sheet name
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  // Iterate through the data, skipping the header row
  for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    const row = data[i];
    const recipientEmail = row[0]; // Assuming email address is in the first column
    const linkText = row[1];      // Assuming link text is in the second column
    const linkURL = row[2];       // Assuming link URL is in the third column

    // Construct the email body with the hyperlink
    const emailBody = `Dear ${recipientEmail},\n\nPlease find the link below:\n\n<a href="${linkURL}">${linkText}</a>\n\nSincerely,\nYour Name`;

    // Send the email
    GmailApp.sendEmail({
      to: recipientEmail,
      subject: "Your Subject Here",
      htmlBody: emailBody
    });
  }
}
```

This script directly accesses the sheet data.  The `htmlBody` parameter ensures proper hyperlink rendering in Gmail.  Remember to replace `"Sheet1"` and adjust column indices according to your spreadsheet structure.


**Example 2:  Handling Errors and Invalid URLs**

This example enhances the basic script by incorporating error handling for missing data and invalid URLs.

```javascript
function sendEmailsWithErrorHandling() {
  // ... (Get spreadsheet and data as in Example 1) ...

  for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    const row = data[i];
    const recipientEmail = row[0];
    const linkText = row[1];
    const linkURL = row[2];

    if (!recipientEmail || !linkText || !linkURL) {
      Logger.log(`Skipping row ${i + 1}: Missing data.`);
      continue;
    }

    try {
      //Validate URL using a regular expression (a rudimentary check)
      const urlRegex = /^(?:http(s)?:\/\/)?[\w.-]+(?:\.[\w\.-]+)+[\w\-\._~:/?#[\]@!\$&'\(\)\*\+,;=.]+$/;
      if (!urlRegex.test(linkURL)) {
          Logger.log(`Skipping row ${i+1}: Invalid URL: ${linkURL}`);
          continue;
      }

      const emailBody = `Dear ${recipientEmail},\n\nPlease find the link below:\n\n<a href="${linkURL}">${linkText}</a>\n\nSincerely,\nYour Name`;
      GmailApp.sendEmail({ to: recipientEmail, subject: "Your Subject", htmlBody: emailBody });
    } catch (error) {
      Logger.log(`Error sending email to ${recipientEmail}: ${error}`);
    }
  }
}
```

This improved script checks for null or empty values and uses a regular expression for basic URL validation. The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during email sending.  More robust URL validation might be necessary depending on the complexity of expected URLs.


**Example 3: Batch Processing for Efficiency**

This example showcases batch processing to improve performance for large datasets.

```javascript
function sendEmailsInBatches() {
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const sheet = ss.getSheetByName("Sheet1");
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  const batchSize = 100; // Adjust batch size as needed

  for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = data.slice(i, Math.min(i + batchSize, data.length));
    const emails = batch.map(row => {
      const recipientEmail = row[0];
      const linkText = row[1];
      const linkURL = row[2];
      const emailBody = `Dear ${recipientEmail},\n\nPlease find the link below:\n\n<a href="${linkURL}">${linkText}</a>\n\nSincerely,\nYour Name`;
      return { to: recipientEmail, subject: "Your Subject", htmlBody: emailBody };
    });
    GmailApp.sendEmail(emails);
  }
}
```

This version sends emails in batches of 100 (adjustable).  The `GmailApp.sendEmail(emails)` method accepts an array of email objects, dramatically reducing the number of API calls and improving efficiency.  Remember to adjust the `batchSize` according to your application's needs and Gmail API quota limits.  Monitoring the script's execution log for errors and API quota usage is crucial for optimizing performance.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Google Apps Script documentation:  This is the primary resource for understanding the syntax, functions, and capabilities of the scripting language.  Pay particular attention to the Gmail and Sheets APIs.
* Google Apps Script best practices guide:  This resource provides valuable insights into efficient script design, error handling, and performance optimization.  Focus on sections related to asynchronous operations and data handling for large datasets.
* Regular expressions tutorials: Mastering regular expressions will enable more robust data validation and manipulation.


This comprehensive approach, combining Google Sheets data management with the power of Google Apps Script, provides a robust and scalable solution for generating and sending emails with hyperlinks from a Google Sheet, overcoming the limitations of a direct mail merge function within Gmail.  Careful consideration of error handling and batch processing is essential for optimizing efficiency and reliability. Remember to always respect Gmail's API usage limits to avoid service disruptions.
