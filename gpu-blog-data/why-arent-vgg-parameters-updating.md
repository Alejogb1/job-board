The inability of VGG network parameters to update during training typically stems from a problem within the optimization process, specifically concerning the gradient calculation and application.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous deep learning projects – ranging from image classification to object detection –  I've encountered this primarily due to incorrect optimizer configuration, data pipeline malfunctions leading to zero gradients, or inadvertently disabling gradient calculation within the model architecture.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core of training a neural network involves iteratively adjusting its weights (parameters) to minimize a loss function. This adjustment is guided by the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights.  The optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) uses these gradients to update the parameters according to a defined learning rule. If the parameters aren't updating, it strongly suggests that either the gradients are not being computed correctly or the optimizer isn't applying them effectively.

Several factors can contribute to this failure:

* **Gradient Vanishing/Exploding:**  VGG networks, particularly deeper variations, are susceptible to gradient vanishing or exploding problems.  Very small or extremely large gradients can hinder or entirely prevent parameter updates.  This is often mitigated through careful initialization techniques (e.g., Xavier/Glorot initialization) and the use of regularization methods (e.g., Batch Normalization, dropout).

* **Incorrect Optimizer Configuration:**  An improperly configured optimizer, such as an incorrect learning rate, momentum, or weight decay, can lead to ineffective or no parameter updates.  A learning rate that is too small will result in minuscule updates, essentially freezing the network's parameters.  Conversely, a learning rate that is too large can lead to unstable training, causing the optimizer to overshoot optimal solutions and potentially preventing convergence.

* **Data Issues:**  Problems with the data pipeline, such as incorrectly normalized or preprocessed data, can lead to inconsistent or zero gradients, effectively halting the training process.  This can stem from bugs in data loading scripts, incorrect data augmentation techniques, or errors in data normalization procedures.  Zero gradients are particularly problematic, as they indicate that the optimizer has nothing to work with.

* **Gradient Calculation Issues:**  This relates directly to the model architecture.  Layers that unintentionally disable gradient calculation (e.g., through incorrect `requires_grad` settings in PyTorch or equivalent functions in other frameworks) will prevent the optimizer from updating their weights.  This can easily happen when using pre-trained models or when incorporating custom layers.

* **Freezing Layers:** Deliberately freezing certain layers (e.g., during transfer learning) can also cause a subset of parameters to not update. While intended, this must be accounted for when assessing the overall training progress.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Learning Rate**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... VGG model definition ...

model = VGG16() # Fictional VGG16 implementation
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
# Incorrectly low learning rate
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-10)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**Commentary:**  The learning rate (lr) of `1e-10` is extremely small.  This will lead to practically negligible updates to the model's parameters, giving the illusion that the parameters are not updating.  Increasing the learning rate (e.g., to `1e-3` or `1e-4`, depending on the dataset and model) usually resolves this.


**Example 2:  `requires_grad=False` inadvertently set**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... VGG model definition ...

model = VGG16()

# Assume a custom layer within the VGG model, unintentionally disabling gradient calculation
for param in model.layer_4.parameters(): #Fictional layer
    param.requires_grad = False


# ... Rest of the training loop ...
```

**Commentary:**  Setting `requires_grad=False` prevents the optimizer from updating the parameters of `model.layer_4`.  This is a common mistake when using pre-trained models or modifying existing architectures.  Ensure that `requires_grad` is set to `True` for all parameters that should be updated. Verify this setting for each layer if using a pre-trained model.


**Example 3: Data Normalization Error**

```python
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# ... Data loading code ...

#Incorrect data normalization
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1]) # Incorrect std
])

train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64,
                                          shuffle=True)
# ... Rest of the training loop ...
```

**Commentary:**  Here, the standard deviation (`std`) in normalization is unrealistically low. This can lead to extremely small or zero gradients, resulting in stagnant parameters.  Confirm that data normalization parameters are appropriate for the dataset.  Check for potential errors in data loading or preprocessing.  Using a standard deviation close to 1 is a general guideline, but you may need to fine-tune based on the specifics of your data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of optimization algorithms, I recommend consulting the original research papers on Adam, SGD, and other relevant optimizers.  A thorough grasp of automatic differentiation within deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch's autograd) is crucial for troubleshooting gradient-related problems.  Finally, a solid understanding of  backpropagation and its nuances will provide invaluable insight into the training dynamics of neural networks.  Reviewing introductory and advanced materials on these concepts will provide a robust foundation.  Examining the documentation specific to your deep learning framework is vital for understanding framework-specific functionalities and potential pitfalls.
