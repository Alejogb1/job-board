TensorFlow 1.x's distributed training using the Parameter Server (PS) architecture doesn't inherently halt workers during `sess.run()` calls in the way one might initially suspect.  The perceived halting behavior often stems from misunderstandings regarding the asynchronous nature of the communication between workers and parameter servers, coupled with potential bottlenecks elsewhere in the system.  My experience working on large-scale NLP models using TensorFlow 1.x has highlighted this distinction numerous times.  Workers don't synchronously pause for every `sess.run()`; rather, the apparent halting arises from dependencies and communication latencies.


**1.  Explanation of Asynchronous Operation and Apparent Halting:**

The PS architecture in TensorFlow 1.x operates asynchronously.  Workers independently fetch parameters from the parameter servers, compute gradients based on their assigned data batches, and then push the computed gradients back to the servers.  These operations are not inherently blocking.  A `sess.run()` call on a worker initiates a computational graph execution; however, the execution isn't paused until all communication with the parameter server is complete.  The worker continues execution as soon as it has the necessary parameters, launching asynchronous requests for future parameter updates.

The illusion of halting can arise from several factors:

* **Parameter Server Bottleneck:**  A heavily loaded or poorly configured parameter server can become a significant bottleneck.  If the server cannot keep up with the gradient update requests from workers, workers will experience delays while waiting for updated parameters or acknowledgment of their gradient pushes. This delay manifests as apparent halting, even though the workers are technically still executing, albeit with stalled operations.

* **Network Latency:** Network congestion or high latency between workers and parameter servers significantly impacts performance.  Slow network communication causes workers to spend more time waiting for responses, leading to the perception of freezing or halting.

* **Data Imbalance:**  Uneven data distribution across workers can result in some workers finishing their computations significantly faster than others. While waiting for the slowest worker to complete its `sess.run()` call before proceeding to the next iteration, other workers appear to be idle.

* **Synchronization Mechanisms (Implicit or Explicit):**  If any explicit synchronization primitives are used within the `sess.run()` call, such as `tf.group`, this will inherently cause workers to wait on each other.  Similarly, implicit synchronization through dependencies within the computation graph can lead to unnecessary waiting.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of distributed training in TensorFlow 1.x and potential causes of perceived worker halting.

**Example 1: Basic PS+Worker Setup (Illustrative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Define your model, loss, and optimizer ...

ps_hosts = ['localhost:2222']
worker_hosts = ['localhost:2223', 'localhost:2224']

cluster = tf.train.ClusterSpec({'ps': ps_hosts, 'worker': worker_hosts})

if FLAGS.job_name == 'ps':
  server = tf.train.Server(cluster, job_name='ps', task_index=0)
  server.join()
elif FLAGS.job_name == 'worker':
  server = tf.train.Server(cluster, job_name='worker', task_index=FLAGS.task_index)
  with tf.device('/job:worker/task:%d' % FLAGS.task_index):
    # ... Define variables and operations ...
    with tf.Session(server.target) as sess:
      # Initialize variables
      sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
      # Training loop
      for step in range(1000):
        # ... Fetch parameters, compute gradients, update parameters ...
        _, loss = sess.run([train_op, loss_op])  # Apparent halting can occur here due to PS/network bottlenecks
        print('Worker %d, Step %d, Loss: %f' % (FLAGS.task_index, step, loss))
```

This demonstrates a basic setup.  Halting might be observed due to overloaded PS or network issues during the `sess.run()` call within the training loop.  The lack of explicit synchronization mechanisms means that workers operate independently, but communication bottlenecks can still impact their apparent speed.


**Example 2: Explicit Synchronization (Illustrative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Define your model, loss, and optimizer ...

# ... Cluster specification as in Example 1 ...

# ... Worker-specific code ...
with tf.Session(server.target) as sess:
    # ... Initialize variables ...
    for step in range(1000):
        # ... Fetch parameters ...
        # Explicit Synchronization:
        gradient_ops = [worker_gradient_op for i in range(num_workers)]
        apply_gradients_op = tf.group(*gradient_ops)  #Force all gradient computations to complete before applying
        _, loss = sess.run([apply_gradients_op, loss_op]) #Halting is expected here due to explicit synchronization
        print('Worker %d, Step %d, Loss: %f' % (FLAGS.task_index, step, loss))
```

This example explicitly synchronizes workers using `tf.group`.  All gradient calculations are forced to complete before applying the gradients, causing workers to halt until all have finished their `sess.run()` calls for that step. This is deliberate synchronization, not an inherent property of `sess.run()`.


**Example 3:  Addressing Potential Bottlenecks (Illustrative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Define your model, loss, and optimizer ...

# ... Cluster specification as in Example 1 ...

# ... Worker-specific code ...
with tf.Session(server.target) as sess:
    # ... Initialize variables ...
    for step in range(1000):
        # ... Fetch parameters asynchronously ... (e.g. using tf.train.replica_device_setter)
        # Use asynchronous gradient updates to prevent blocking.
        _, loss = sess.run([train_op, loss_op], options=tf.RunOptions(report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom=True)) #More robust error handling
        print('Worker %d, Step %d, Loss: %f' % (FLAGS.task_index, step, loss))
```

This example hints at strategies for mitigating bottlenecks.  Using asynchronous operations and sophisticated device placement (`tf.train.replica_device_setter`) can reduce the probability of a single point of failure causing apparent worker halts.  The addition of `tf.RunOptions` helps in diagnosing memory related issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation (specifically the sections on distributed training and the `tf.train` module) is crucial.  Thorough understanding of asynchronous programming concepts is essential.  Familiarity with network programming and performance analysis tools will prove beneficial for diagnosing bottlenecks.  Understanding the implications of various optimizer choices and their interaction with distributed training is also valuable.  Consult advanced texts on parallel and distributed computing for a comprehensive treatment.
