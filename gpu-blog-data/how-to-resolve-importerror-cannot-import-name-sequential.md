The `ImportError: cannot import name 'Sequential'` within the Keras context stems fundamentally from a version mismatch or an incorrect installation pathway.  Over my years working with deep learning frameworks, I've encountered this frequently, often tracing it back to the subtle differences between Keras versions and their dependencies, specifically TensorFlow and/or Theano.  The core issue is that the `Sequential` model API, a cornerstone of Keras's functional API, resides in different locations depending on the Keras installation and its underlying backend.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The error arises because your Python interpreter cannot locate the `Sequential` class within the imported Keras namespace.  This usually points to one of three scenarios:

* **Incorrect Keras installation:** The Keras package itself might be corrupted, incomplete, or not installed correctly. This often happens when using system-level package managers like `apt` or `yum` without ensuring compatibility with your Python environment (e.g., virtual environments are highly recommended).

* **Conflicting Keras versions:**  You might have multiple versions of Keras installed, potentially with different backends (TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK).  Python's import mechanism will prioritize one version over another, which might lack the expected `Sequential` model.  If the prioritized version doesn't have the functional API you need, the error manifests.

* **Backend mismatch:**  Even with a correctly installed Keras version,  problems occur if Keras isn't configured correctly to use a compatible backend.  If you've specified a backend (e.g., TensorFlow 1.x) that doesn't support the `Sequential` API in the way you're trying to use it, or if the backend isn't installed, the import will fail.

To rectify this, a systematic approach is needed, focusing on environment verification, package management, and backend configuration.  My experience shows that meticulously examining these points usually solves the problem.  The error message itself is somewhat vague and requires a deeper investigation into the setup.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating different scenarios and their resolutions.  These examples showcase how to leverage virtual environments and explicitly set the backend to avoid conflicts.

**Example 1: Correct setup using a virtual environment and TensorFlow as the backend**

```python
# Create a virtual environment (recommended):
# python3 -m venv .venv
# source .venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS) or .venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

# Install required packages within the virtual environment:
# pip install tensorflow keras

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.models import Sequential

# Verify TensorFlow is the backend:
print(f"Keras backend: {keras.backend.backend()}")

model = Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... rest of your model training code ...
```

**Commentary:** This example explicitly imports Keras after installing TensorFlow within a virtual environment. The virtual environment isolates the project's dependencies, preventing conflicts with globally installed packages. The `print` statement verifies that TensorFlow is used as the backend, confirming the setup.

**Example 2:  Handling potential conflicts with multiple Keras installations**

```python
# Before proceeding, ensure you've deactivated any previously active virtual environments.

# Remove any existing Keras installations (use cautiously!):
# pip uninstall keras

# Reinstall Keras with a specified TensorFlow version, ensuring compatibility:
# pip install tensorflow==2.10 keras

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.models import Sequential

# ... (rest of your model code) ...
```

**Commentary:** This approach aggressively removes potentially conflicting Keras installations before reinstalling it with a specified TensorFlow version.  This is a more drastic solution and should be used with caution; always back up your work before uninstalling packages.  Specify the TensorFlow version for improved compatibility.


**Example 3: Explicitly setting the TensorFlow backend**

```python
import os
os.environ['KERAS_BACKEND'] = 'tensorflow'

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.models import Sequential

# ... (rest of your model code) ...
```

**Commentary:** This example directly sets the Keras backend to TensorFlow using an environment variable.  This can be useful if you're facing backend ambiguities or if another backend is implicitly set.  This approach should be utilized with care, ensuring the chosen backend is compatible with your Keras version.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Official Keras documentation: This is the definitive source for Keras API usage, installation, and troubleshooting.

* TensorFlow documentation: Since TensorFlow is a common Keras backend, understanding its installation and configuration is crucial.

* Python packaging tutorials:  Familiarizing yourself with `pip`, virtual environments, and package management best practices is essential for avoiding dependency conflicts.


By carefully reviewing your environment setup, installing packages correctly within virtual environments, and explicitly setting the Keras backend, you can resolve the `ImportError: cannot import name 'Sequential'` error effectively and build robust deep learning models.  The key is methodical troubleshooting to identify and eliminate the root cause of the incompatibility. Remember to always prioritize virtual environments for managing your project dependencies and consult the official documentation of the libraries involved for precise compatibility instructions.
