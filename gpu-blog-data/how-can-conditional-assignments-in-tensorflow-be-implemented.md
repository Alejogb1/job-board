TensorFlow, while designed for numerical computation using tensors, doesn't directly support in-place conditional assignments that mirror NumPy's concise boolean indexing. Instead, operations must be structured using a combination of logical operations, `tf.where`, and element-wise assignments to achieve similar behavior. The key challenge lies in TensorFlow's computational graph paradigm: operations are not executed imperatively but are instead symbolic descriptions of computations. Therefore, conditional behavior requires constructing conditional operations that are part of the graph.

The primary way to achieve conditional assignments is through the `tf.where` operation. It acts like a vectorized "if-then-else" statement. It takes three arguments: a condition (boolean tensor), a tensor to return if the condition is true, and a tensor to return if the condition is false. The dimensions of all input tensors must be compatible, including broadcasting, to perform element-wise selection. Instead of directly modifying a tensor based on a mask, we generate a new tensor based on the condition. To modify a specific part of a tensor, this new tensor is then used to update the original tensor using some type of conditional assign mechanism. This approach differs from NumPy's in-place modification, as no assignment to the original tensor's memory is performed.

Let's look at specific implementations. Imagine I have a tensor representing sensor readings and a threshold. I need to set all readings below the threshold to zero. This is analogous to an operation I regularly performed when cleaning up raw sensor data in my past role in embedded systems.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simulate sensor readings.
sensor_readings = tf.constant([10, 5, 12, 3, 8, 15], dtype=tf.float32)
threshold = tf.constant(7.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Create a boolean mask indicating which elements are less than the threshold.
mask = sensor_readings < threshold

# Use tf.where to create a tensor where readings below the threshold are replaced with 0.
modified_readings = tf.where(mask, tf.zeros_like(sensor_readings), sensor_readings)

print("Original Readings:", sensor_readings.numpy())
print("Modified Readings:", modified_readings.numpy())
```

In this first example, a boolean `mask` tensor is generated using an element-wise comparison. `tf.where` then creates a new tensor, `modified_readings`, where elements corresponding to `True` in the `mask` are set to zero and all other elements retain their original values. This method allows modification of values based on a condition without directly performing assignments on the original tensor. The original `sensor_readings` is left unchanged.

Now consider a scenario where I need to dynamically adjust gain factors based on signal amplitude. This is something I used to do frequently when working on audio processing applications.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simulate signal amplitudes
amplitudes = tf.constant([0.2, 0.8, 1.5, 0.5, 1.2], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define gain factors
gain_low = tf.constant(0.8, dtype=tf.float32)
gain_high = tf.constant(1.2, dtype=tf.float32)

# Apply gains based on condition.
# Simulate a condition
condition = amplitudes < tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Apply the gain factors using tf.where
gains = tf.where(condition, gain_low * tf.ones_like(amplitudes), gain_high * tf.ones_like(amplitudes))

# Apply calculated gains
processed_signals = amplitudes * gains

print("Original Amplitudes:", amplitudes.numpy())
print("Applied Gains:", gains.numpy())
print("Processed Signals:", processed_signals.numpy())
```

Here, multiple gain values are calculated using `tf.where`, which chooses between the `gain_low` and `gain_high` based on whether the amplitude is below 1.0. These gains are then applied to the original amplitudes to obtain the processed signals. The `tf.ones_like` part broadcasts the gain scalars to the tensor dimensions, so they can be used element-wise. This example showcases how `tf.where` can be used with different tensors that have been broadcasted to the necessary dimensions.

A more intricate case involves targeted updates to a specific portion of a tensor within a larger structure, mimicking a similar operation I used in a image processing project where I'd adjust color values based on a segmented mask.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example image represented as a rank 3 tensor
image = tf.constant([[[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]], [[70, 80, 90], [100, 110, 120]]], dtype=tf.float32)

# A mask indicating the region to modify.
mask_indices = tf.constant([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
mask_values = tf.constant([1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)

# Values to assign
new_color_values = tf.constant([255, 0, 255], dtype=tf.float32)


# Create a sparse tensor for assigning specific values to the image
updates = tf.scatter_nd(
    indices=tf.stack([tf.cast(mask_indices, dtype=tf.int32), mask_values], axis=-1),
    updates=new_color_values,
    shape=tf.constant(image.shape, dtype=tf.int32)
)


# Update pixels based on updates in scatter tensor

updated_image = tf.where(
    tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(updates), axis=-1, keepdims=True) > 0 ,
    updates,
    image
)

print("Original Image:\n", image.numpy())
print("Updated Image:\n", updated_image.numpy())
```

In this example, `tf.scatter_nd` is utilized to produce a sparse tensor, `updates`, containing only modified values based on a location mask provided by mask_indices, and mask_values. These mask variables select certain pixels from the image to which the new values are to be assigned. These `updates` are assigned via the `tf.where` conditional statement. We use `tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(updates), axis=-1, keepdims=True) > 0` as the mask that determines whether a given pixel has had an update from the sparse update tensor.

This pattern of using `tf.where` and `tf.scatter_nd` highlights the flexibility of TensorFlow in replicating NumPy-like operations by generating intermediate tensors. The critical takeaway is that modifications are not performed in place but rather through generating a new tensor based on the condition and desired values.

For further exploration into TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities, consulting the official TensorFlow documentation is highly recommended. The sections on `tf.where`, `tf.scatter_nd`, and broadcasting are particularly relevant. Additionally, the TensorFlow guide on tensors provides a comprehensive overview of tensor manipulation techniques. While textbooks on deep learning often cover specific applications of these techniques, the official documentation should always be the first port of call. Books on more general numerical methods may also be helpful for understanding the conceptual underpinnings.
