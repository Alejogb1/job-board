The core challenge in migrating TensorFlow 1 layers to TensorFlow 2 lies not simply in syntactic changes, but in the fundamental shift from the static computational graph paradigm to the eager execution model.  My experience porting a large-scale image recognition model from TF1 to TF2 highlighted this crucial distinction.  While many layers have direct equivalents, understanding the underlying execution mechanics is paramount for a successful and efficient migration.  This requires a careful consideration of layer instantiation, weight management, and the overall model architecture.

**1.  Explanation: Bridging the Static and Eager Execution Paradigms**

TensorFlow 1 relied heavily on `tf.Session` and the `tf.Graph` object.  Layer definitions were embedded within this graph, compiled, and then executed.  TensorFlow 2, conversely, defaults to eager execution, where operations are performed immediately. This change necessitates a different approach to defining and using layers.  The crucial element is understanding the transition from `tf.layers` (deprecated in TF2) to the `tf.keras.layers` API.  While `tf.layers` offered a functional approach to building layers, `tf.keras.layers` promotes the use of object-oriented classes for greater flexibility and maintainability, particularly in larger models.  Moreover, TF2's Keras integration streamlines the model building process, offering seamless integration with pre-trained models and various training utilities.  The migration process often involves rewriting layer definitions to utilize the `tf.keras.layers` equivalents, managing variable initialization explicitly, and adapting the training loop to the eager execution context.  The conversion isn't always a simple one-to-one mapping, as some TF1 layers' functionalities may require a combination of multiple TF2 layers or custom implementations to achieve comparable results.  Furthermore, the management of variable scopes in TF1 has been simplified in TF2 through the inherent structure of the Keras layer objects.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Converting a Simple Dense Layer**

```python
# TensorFlow 1
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session()
dense_layer_tf1 = tf.layers.dense(inputs=tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10]), units=5, activation=tf.nn.relu)
output_tf1 = sess.run(dense_layer_tf1, feed_dict={tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10]): [[1]*10]})
print("TensorFlow 1 Output:", output_tf1)
sess.close()

# TensorFlow 2
import tensorflow as tf
dense_layer_tf2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5, activation='relu')
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0]*10])
output_tf2 = dense_layer_tf2(input_tensor)
print("TensorFlow 2 Output:", output_tf2.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the basic transformation. The TF1 code utilizes `tf.layers.dense` within a session, requiring explicit placeholder definition and session management.  The TF2 equivalent directly instantiates a `tf.keras.layers.Dense` object. The `activation` parameter is specified as a string, and the computation occurs directly due to eager execution; the `.numpy()` method is used to convert the Tensor output to a NumPy array for printing.

**Example 2:  Handling Convolutional Layers**

```python
# TensorFlow 1
import tensorflow as tf
conv_layer_tf1 = tf.layers.conv2d(inputs=tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28, 28, 1]), filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation=tf.nn.relu)
# ... (Rest of the TF1 code with session management)

# TensorFlow 2
import tensorflow as tf
conv_layer_tf2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1)) #Example input
output_tf2 = conv_layer_tf2(input_tensor)
print("TensorFlow 2 Output Shape:", output_tf2.shape)
```

This showcases the migration of a convolutional layer.  The TF1 code, again, relies on placeholders and a session. The TF2 code uses `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`, simplifying the layer definition and eliminating the need for explicit session handling.  The input tensor is created using `tf.random.normal` for demonstration.  Notice the shape of the output tensor is readily accessible.

**Example 3:  Migrating a Custom Layer**

```python
# TensorFlow 1 (Custom Layer)
import tensorflow as tf
class MyCustomLayer(tf.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.layers.Dense(units=10)
    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

# TensorFlow 2 (Custom Layer)
import tensorflow as tf
class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10)
    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)
```

This example demonstrates a more complex scenario involving a custom layer.  The core difference lies in the inheritance: TF1 uses `tf.layers.Layer` while TF2 employs `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.  The internal structure and `call` method remain largely consistent, highlighting the seamless integration of custom layers within the Keras framework.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow migration guide.  TensorFlow's Keras documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a TensorFlow focus.  Articles specifically addressing the transition from TF1's `tf.layers` to TF2's `tf.keras.layers`.  The TensorFlow API documentation.


My experience with large-scale model migrations emphasizes the importance of a phased approach.  Start with smaller components, thoroughly test each converted layer, and gradually integrate them into the larger model.  Utilize automated conversion tools where possible, but always manually inspect and validate the converted code. A rigorous testing strategy is crucial to ensure the migrated model maintains the expected functionality and performance.  Remember that even minor discrepancies in layer behavior can significantly impact the model's overall accuracy.  By carefully considering the transition from static graphs to eager execution, and leveraging the strengths of the Keras API, you can effectively and efficiently migrate your TensorFlow 1 layers to TensorFlow 2.
