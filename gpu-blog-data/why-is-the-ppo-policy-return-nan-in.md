The pervasive appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in the return of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm implemented within the TensorFlow/Keras framework often stems from numerical instability during the policy update process.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous reinforcement learning projects points to three primary culprits: vanishing gradients, exploding gradients, and improper reward scaling.  These problems frequently manifest subtly, making diagnosis challenging.  Let's examine these in detail, supplemented by illustrative code examples.

**1. Vanishing Gradients:**

The PPO algorithm relies heavily on gradient-based optimization to improve the policy.  Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients of the loss function become exceedingly small during backpropagation. This effectively halts the learning process, leaving the policy parameters unchanged or, worse, leading to NaN values.  This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in deep neural networks, such as those commonly employed in PPO, if the network is too deep or the activation functions are not appropriately chosen.  For instance, repeated application of sigmoid or tanh activation functions can squash gradients, leading to vanishing gradients.

Furthermore, improper initialization of the neural network weights can exacerbate this issue.  If weights are initialized too small, the activations will remain small throughout the network, leading to minute gradients.  My experience shows that using techniques like Xavier/Glorot or He initialization, which tailor weight initialization to the activation function used, significantly mitigates this risk.

**Code Example 1: Addressing Vanishing Gradients with He Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define the actor network with He initialization
actor_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal', input_shape=(state_dim,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
    keras.layers.Dense(action_dim, activation='tanh') #Output layer for continuous actions
])

# ...rest of the PPO implementation...
```

This snippet demonstrates the use of `'he_normal'` initializer, specifically designed for ReLU activation functions, to combat vanishing gradients.  Applying appropriate initialization for other activation functions (e.g., 'glorot_uniform' for tanh) is crucial. The `state_dim` and `action_dim` would be replaced with the appropriate dimensionality for your environment.


**2. Exploding Gradients:**

The inverse of vanishing gradients, exploding gradients occur when the gradients become excessively large during backpropagation. This can lead to numerical overflow, resulting in NaN values in the model's parameters and ultimately, the PPO return.  Exploding gradients often stem from large weight updates, which in turn might be caused by inappropriate learning rates or a poorly scaled loss function.

In my past work, I've encountered this problem when using a learning rate that was too high relative to the scale of the gradients.  Using gradient clipping techniques is an effective strategy to prevent this. Gradient clipping limits the norm of the gradient vector, preventing excessively large updates.

**Code Example 2: Implementing Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ...PPO training loop...

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # ...calculate loss...
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, actor_model.trainable_variables)

# Clip the gradients
clipped_gradients = [tf.clip_by_norm(grad, clip_norm=0.5) for grad in gradients]

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_gradients, actor_model.trainable_variables))

# ...rest of the PPO implementation...
```

Here, `tf.clip_by_norm` limits the L2 norm of each gradient to 0.5.  The `clip_norm` value should be carefully tuned based on the specific problem. Experimentation is key to finding an appropriate value that prevents exploding gradients without hindering learning.


**3. Improper Reward Scaling:**

The magnitude of rewards significantly impacts the stability of the PPO algorithm.  If the rewards are on a drastically different scale compared to the loss function, it can lead to numerical instability and NaN values.  For instance, if rewards are consistently very large, gradients will also be very large, potentially leading to exploding gradients as discussed previously. Conversely, if rewards are consistently near zero, this can also lead to vanishing gradients.

My experience has shown that standardizing or normalizing the rewards before training the agent is a crucial preprocessing step. This ensures that the rewards are on a similar scale to the other values within the optimization process.

**Code Example 3: Reward Normalization**

```python
import numpy as np

# ...within the PPO training loop, after obtaining rewards...

# Calculate mean and standard deviation of rewards
reward_mean = np.mean(rewards)
reward_std = np.std(rewards)

# Normalize the rewards
normalized_rewards = (rewards - reward_mean) / reward_std

# Use normalized_rewards in the PPO loss calculation
# ...rest of the PPO implementation...
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple reward normalization technique. More sophisticated methods, such as running mean and standard deviation calculations over a sliding window, can also be employed. The choice depends on the characteristics of your reward signal.  Note that the normalization should be consistent between training and evaluation.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PPO, I would recommend consulting the original PPO paper and exploring several well-regarded reinforcement learning textbooks.  Additional resources that cover gradient-based optimization techniques and numerical stability in deep learning would also prove beneficial.  Understanding these underlying concepts is essential for effective debugging.  Furthermore, carefully studying the documentation for TensorFlow and Keras is crucial to grasp the intricacies of these frameworks and how they handle numerical operations.  Finally, reviewing example implementations of PPO from reputable sources will provide practical insights into handling potential pitfalls and best practices.  Thorough testing and systematic debugging remain the most reliable approach to identifying and resolving NaN issues.
