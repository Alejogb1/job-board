Creating custom layers within TensorFlow's functional API requires a nuanced understanding of the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class and its methods.  My experience building high-performance neural networks for financial modeling has underscored the critical importance of well-defined custom layers for both efficiency and model interpretability.  A common pitfall is neglecting proper initialization and call method implementation, leading to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.  This response will detail the necessary steps, along with illustrative examples.

**1.  Understanding the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` Class:**

The foundation of any custom layer is the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class.  It provides the essential framework for defining the layer's behavior, including weight initialization, forward pass computation, and serialization.  Crucially, it manages the layer's internal state, such as trainable weights and biases.  Subclasses must implement at a minimum the `__init__` and `call` methods.  The `build` method is also highly recommended for managing weight creation, ensuring it happens only once and efficiently.

The `__init__` method initializes the layer's configuration.  This typically involves setting up internal variables, like the number of units or filters, which will influence the layer's dimensionality and operations.  Importantly, you should not create weights here; the `build` method handles this.  The `call` method defines the forward pass computation: it takes the input tensor and returns the output tensor.  The `build` method receives the input shape as an argument and is responsible for creating the layer's weights and biases using `self.add_weight`. This step ensures that weights are only created after the input shape is known, preventing errors associated with undefined dimensions.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: A Simple Linear Layer:**

This example demonstrates a basic linear layer with a bias term.  Note the careful use of `self.add_weight` within the `build` method and the straightforward matrix multiplication in the `call` method.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLinearLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(MyLinearLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                  initializer='zeros',
                                  trainable=True)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Example usage
layer = MyLinearLayer(units=64)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 32)) # Batch size of 10, input dimension 32
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (10, 64)
```

**Example 2:  A Layer with Activation:**

This expands on the previous example by incorporating an activation function.  This highlights the flexibility of integrating existing TensorFlow operations within custom layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyActivatedLinearLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, activation='relu'):
        super(MyActivatedLinearLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='glorot_uniform', #Improved initialization
                                  trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                  initializer='zeros',
                                  trainable=True)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.activation(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b)

# Example usage
layer = MyActivatedLinearLayer(units=128, activation='sigmoid')
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((5, 64))
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (5, 128)
```

**Example 3: A More Complex Layer with Internal State:**

This example showcases a more sophisticated layer that maintains an internal state, specifically a running average of the input.  This demonstrates the capabilities of custom layers for implementing more complex functionalities.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class RunningAverageLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        super(RunningAverageLayer, self).__init__(name=name)
        self.running_average = tf.Variable(0.0, trainable=False, name="running_average")

    def call(self, inputs):
        batch_average = tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=0)
        self.running_average.assign(0.9 * self.running_average + 0.1 * batch_average)
        return self.running_average

# Example usage
layer = RunningAverageLayer()
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor) #Displays the running average.

#Subsequent calls update the running average.
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor)

```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable, particularly the sections detailing the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class and the functional API.  Exploring example code provided in the TensorFlow repository itself often reveals best practices and efficient implementation techniques.  Furthermore, dedicated textbooks on deep learning and neural networks with chapters focusing on custom layer implementation offer a deeper theoretical understanding.  Finally, reviewing related Stack Overflow questions and answers, focusing on those addressing specific layer types or complexities encountered during implementation, can be highly beneficial.  Thorough testing, including unit tests, are essential for ensuring the correctness and stability of your custom layers.  These should verify the layer's behavior across various input shapes and configurations.
