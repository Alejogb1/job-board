The persistent prediction of a single class by a Naive Bayes classifier almost always stems from severe data imbalance coupled with insufficient feature engineering or inappropriate parameter settings.  In my experience troubleshooting machine learning models over the past decade, this issue manifests far more frequently than problems arising from the algorithm's inherent limitations.  The core problem isn't the Bayes theorem itself, but rather the data it operates on.


**1. Explanation:**

Naive Bayes classifiers rely on Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class given its features.  The "naive" assumption is that all features are conditionally independent given the class.  While this assumption rarely holds true in real-world scenarios, the classifier often performs surprisingly well.  However, this independence assumption becomes problematic when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Consider a binary classification problem where one class significantly outnumbers the other. Let's say 99% of your data points belong to class A and only 1% to class B.  Even if a feature exhibits some predictive power for class B, the sheer dominance of class A in the training data will skew the prior probabilities.  The classifier learns that it's overwhelmingly likely to encounter class A, and subsequently assigns a high probability to class A for almost every new data point, regardless of the feature values. This prior probability overshadows the conditional probabilities calculated from the features.


This effect is compounded by insufficient feature engineering.  If the features are not informative enough to distinguish between classes, even with a balanced dataset, the classifier will resort to its prior probabilities, essentially predicting the majority class.  For example, if all features are irrelevant to the target variable, the model defaults to predicting the most frequent class. Similarly, incorrect parameter choices, such as using a Laplace smoothing factor that's too high, can also lead to overly smoothed probabilities, diminishing the impact of informative features and reinforcing the dominance of the majority class.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three Python code examples using scikit-learn.  Each example demonstrates a different aspect of the problem and a potential solution.  Assume we are classifying emails as spam (class 1) or not spam (class 0).

**Example 1: Imbalanced Dataset:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Simulate an imbalanced dataset
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2)  # Two features
y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(900), np.ones(100)]) # 90% class 0, 10% class 1

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This code creates a highly imbalanced dataset.  The classification report will likely show a high precision and recall for class 0 (not spam) and very poor performance for class 1 (spam) because the model overwhelmingly predicts the majority class.


**Example 2: Irrelevant Features:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Simulate a dataset with irrelevant features
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Randomly assigned classes

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

Here, the features are completely random and unrelated to the target variable. The model's performance will be no better than random guessing, often predicting the majority class more frequently.


**Example 3: Addressing Imbalance with SMOTE:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Simulate an imbalanced dataset (same as Example 1)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2)
y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(900), np.ones(100)])

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This example demonstrates a solution using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance.  SMOTE synthesizes new data points for the minority class, improving the classifier's ability to learn the patterns associated with it.  The resulting classification report should show a marked improvement in the performance metrics for the minority class.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Naive Bayes, I suggest exploring established machine learning textbooks.  Focus on chapters dedicated to Bayesian classification and handling imbalanced datasets.  Furthermore,  consult documentation for various machine learning libraries, particularly those offering resampling techniques like SMOTE.  Finally, delve into research papers on imbalanced learning to explore more advanced methods for tackling this common challenge.  These resources will provide a robust foundation for diagnosing and resolving the issue of consistent class prediction in your Naive Bayes models.
