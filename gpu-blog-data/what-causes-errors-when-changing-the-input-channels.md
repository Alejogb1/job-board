Inception-v3, a convolutional neural network renowned for its efficiency and performance in image recognition tasks, is particularly sensitive to alterations in the input channel configuration, primarily due to its architecture's reliance on pre-trained weights. The model is explicitly trained and structured to accept three-channel RGB input images; deviations from this standard directly cause downstream incompatibilities and errors.

When we modify the input channel count – such as moving from RGB to grayscale (one channel), or an arbitrary multi-channel input like hyperspectral images – the initial convolutional layers that are expecting a three-dimensional input tensor, fail to find corresponding weight tensors. These layers have been initialized with the understanding that each of their filters would operate on an RGB input, which is a three-dimensional arrangement of pixel values across three distinct color channels. The very first layer's weight tensor is thus configured as, in a common representation, `[filter_height, filter_width, 3, num_filters]`. Changing the input channels implies altering the dimensionality of the '3' in this tensor, resulting in a shape mismatch. This causes a direct failure in matrix multiplication and other fundamental tensor operations within the first convolutional layer and often crashes the model during the initial forward pass.

The error manifests in various forms across different frameworks, but the core issue remains consistent: shape incompatibilities between the expected input and the actual input. In TensorFlow, this often presents as a `ValueError` during the initial layer calculations. In PyTorch, it frequently surfaces as a `RuntimeError` highlighting mismatched tensor dimensions. Moreover, if the error is not detected at model initialization, it can manifest as nonsensical results after a forward pass. Instead of meaningful feature maps, the network might produce artifacts or blank tensors, revealing that the network is not processing the information as intended. These issues arise because the pre-trained weights, representing the learnt features from a vast RGB training dataset, cannot be simply reinterpreted for an altered input space.

To illustrate the problem, and approaches to address it, consider these code snippets. Let us assume, initially, we are using TensorFlow to work with the Inception-v3 model.

```python
# Example 1: Demonstrating Input Shape Error in TensorFlow

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3
import numpy as np

# Load InceptionV3 model with default input shape (299, 299, 3)
model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')

# Create a dummy input with correct shape
dummy_rgb_input = np.random.rand(1, 299, 299, 3)

# Pass the correct input and get output. This should work.
output = model(dummy_rgb_input)
print("Output shape for RGB input:", output.shape)


# Create a dummy grayscale input (1 channel)
dummy_grayscale_input = np.random.rand(1, 299, 299, 1)

try:
    # Trying to pass the grayscale input will trigger an error
    output = model(dummy_grayscale_input)
    print("Output shape for Grayscale input:", output.shape)  # This line will not be reached
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
     print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

```

This first example plainly demonstrates the error. The model operates without issue on the expected RGB tensor, but it immediately fails when the input is a single-channel grayscale image. The error message details the nature of the shape mismatch, clearly indicating that it occurred in a convolutional operation that was designed for 3 channels, but received a single channel. This is the foundational problem, the initial layer is simply expecting a different dimension.

To begin to solve this problem, one approach, when converting RGB input to grayscale, is to replicate the single-channel grayscale input across the three RGB channels before passing it into the model. This maintains the correct tensor shape and avoids crashing the network, at least initially. While this allows the data to propagate, it does not translate directly to meaningful outputs because the weight parameters are not interpretable this way. Let's illustrate that:

```python
# Example 2: Replicating Grayscale Channels

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3
import numpy as np

# Load InceptionV3 model
model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')

# Create a dummy grayscale input
dummy_grayscale_input = np.random.rand(1, 299, 299, 1)

# Replicate grayscale channel to three channels
dummy_grayscale_rgb = np.repeat(dummy_grayscale_input, 3, axis=-1)

# Pass the replicated input into the model
try:
    output = model(dummy_grayscale_rgb)
    print("Output shape after channel replication:", output.shape)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}") # This should not happen

```
By simply replicating the single-channel grayscale input across the three required RGB channels, the tensor dimensions align. The error no longer occurs. However, the semantic content remains incorrect. The model, which has been trained on color images will not treat the replicated data as if they represent three distinct channels. This might generate an output but it won't be a meaningful classification based on grayscale input semantics.

A more robust, but also significantly more involved, approach is to adapt the very first layer of the Inception-v3 architecture, modifying the weight matrix to accommodate the new input channel count. This requires rebuilding the layer from scratch, initializing new weights compatible with the new input dimensionality, and then retraining the model, or at least finetuning the new first layer. This retraining is vital to allow the new first layer to adapt to the input space and produce features which are understood by the rest of the trained network. The following example demonstrates the alteration of the first layer. This is simplified, a full retraining process is usually necessary:

```python
# Example 3: Adapting the first layer in Keras

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D
import numpy as np

# Load InceptionV3 model with no weights, get the layer
base_model = InceptionV3(include_top=False, input_shape=(299, 299, 3))

# Get the original first conv layer.
first_layer = base_model.layers[0]

# Extract original layer configuration.
config = first_layer.get_config()

# Modify the number of input channels to one.
config['input_shape'] = (299, 299, 1)
config['kernel_size'] = config['kernel_size']  # Keep kernel size
config['filters'] = config['filters']  # Keep same filter number
config['strides'] = config['strides'] # Keep the same strides


# create new first layer for 1 channel and use weights if desired.
new_first_layer = Conv2D.from_config(config)

# Create new model from scratch with modified first layer.
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(299, 299, 1))

x = new_first_layer(input_layer)
for layer in base_model.layers[1:]:
    x = layer(x)
    
adapted_model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)

# Create a dummy grayscale input
dummy_grayscale_input = np.random.rand(1, 299, 299, 1)

# Pass the grayscale input to the adapted model
try:
    output = adapted_model(dummy_grayscale_input)
    print("Output shape from adapted model:", output.shape)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}") #This should not occur.
```

In the last example, we create a new first layer with the correct input dimensions and use the previously trained base model layers. Now the modified model will accept the grayscale input, but the model now needs to be retrained or fine-tuned in order to achieve the desired results, especially in cases where the input data does not correspond to a greyscale projection of RGB data used during the initial training phase. This final example gives an insight into a pathway for using non-standard channel counts.

For further understanding of convolutional neural networks and the challenges of modifying input dimensions, I recommend exploring resources such as ‘Deep Learning’ by Goodfellow et al. for a comprehensive theoretical background. Practical guides and tutorials on convolutional neural networks implementation in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch (available through their respective official documentation) will prove helpful. Also studying the Inception-v3 paper itself will assist in better understanding its inner workings and how any modification might impact its performance. Specific research papers on multi-modal learning could also be explored as an advanced topic, which deals with the use of networks with multiple input channels. These resources will offer both fundamental knowledge and practical implementation strategies. Modifying the channel configuration of a neural network such as Inception-v3 requires careful consideration of the impact on the initial tensor dimensionality.
