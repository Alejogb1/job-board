A pre-trained BERT model, when directly repurposed for binary classification with a sigmoid activation on its output layer, frequently encounters training difficulties stemming from a combination of factors rather than a single, easily identified cause. I've witnessed this firsthand across multiple NLP projects, and the issue typically involves an unfavorable interaction between BERT's powerful pre-training and the classification-specific adaptations.

The core problem is often the initialization of the final classification layer's weights. BERT's pre-training objective is not binary classification, meaning its output embeddings are not naturally scaled or structured for a single sigmoid unit. Consequently, the randomly initialized weights connecting BERT's final hidden states to this single output neuron often result in gradients that are excessively small or extremely large, or the output activation itself being consistently saturated early in training. The sigmoid function outputs a probability between 0 and 1. With random initialization, there's no inherent tendency for the pre-sigmoid logits to cluster around 0, the inflection point, often leading the model to initially output values extremely close to 0 or 1 regardless of input. This phenomenon pushes the sigmoid output to either extreme, and the resulting gradients are small as the sigmoid plateaus, thus hampering the learning process.

Furthermore, the learning rate used for pre-trained models and the classifier head is crucial. BERT's encoder, having been pre-trained, typically requires significantly smaller learning rates than the freshly initialized classifier weights. Overly aggressive learning rates for the classifier can lead to instability, causing large fluctuations in gradients that hinder effective learning, especially at the model’s initial stages. The classifier head, which we need to adapt, initially dominates the loss due to the random initialization, requiring careful calibration to facilitate stable training.

Another contributing factor is that BERT is trained with a more complex objective function and dataset. Fine-tuning often involves a much smaller dataset and a simpler classification objective. The disparity between these two training regimes can lead to overfitting or unstable gradients, particularly if the dataset is small or poorly representative of the overall distribution seen in the pre-training data. Specifically, when dealing with binary classification tasks that have a considerable class imbalance, the initial predictions may be highly skewed towards the majority class, leading to inefficient gradient updates and slow convergence.

Let’s consider specific scenarios through illustrative examples.

**Example 1: Basic Implementation with Poor Initialization**

The following Python code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation using the `transformers` library, showcasing common errors.

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class BinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model_name):
        super(BinaryClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.bert = BertModel.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(self.bert.config.hidden_size, 1) # Binary Classifier head
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.bert(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        pooled_output = outputs.pooler_output #CLS token embedding
        dropout_output = self.dropout(pooled_output)
        logits = self.classifier(dropout_output)
        return torch.sigmoid(logits) # Sigmoid activation

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BinaryClassifier('bert-base-uncased')
inputs = tokenizer("Example Text", return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
output = model(**inputs)
print(output) # Output around 0.5 at start of training
```

This setup uses a standard linear layer for classification followed by a sigmoid. The issue is that `nn.Linear` initializes its weights randomly, and the sigmoid activation on top will not have a strong driving force for any particular classification outcome. The model will likely output predictions near 0.5 initially, with little to no meaningful variance. A training loop with simple Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function will have difficulty pushing the pre-sigmoid logits towards values where the gradient is more significant. This would lead to slow or stagnant learning.

**Example 2: Adding a learning rate scheduler**

The following code includes a different way to handle learning rates.

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.optim import AdamW
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

class BinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self, pretrained_model_name):
        super(BinaryClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.bert = BertModel.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(self.bert.config.hidden_size, 1)

   def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
       outputs = self.bert(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
       pooled_output = outputs.pooler_output
       dropout_output = self.dropout(pooled_output)
       logits = self.classifier(dropout_output)
       return torch.sigmoid(logits)

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BinaryClassifier('bert-base-uncased')

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5) # Start with a small learning rate
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', patience=2, factor=0.5) # Reduce learning rate upon plateau

# Example training loop (not executable without dataset)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

for epoch in range(10):
  # Forward and loss calculations
  # inputs defined as previous code block
  predictions = model(**inputs).squeeze()
  labels = torch.tensor([0.0], dtype=torch.float)
  loss = criterion(predictions, labels)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  scheduler.step(loss)
  print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss}')
```

This example incorporates a learning rate scheduler to reduce the learning rate when the loss plateaus. It uses `AdamW` which is a variant of the Adam optimizer that can work well in practice, and ReduceLROnPlateau, which reduces learning rate by a certain factor if the loss hasn't improved over a set period. This helps fine-tune the classifier while protecting the pre-trained weights of the model. We also initialize the AdamW optimizer with a fairly low learning rate that is common to see when using BERT.

**Example 3: Using a Custom Classifier Head**

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class BinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self, pretrained_model_name):
       super(BinaryClassifier, self).__init__()
       self.bert = BertModel.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name)
       self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
       self.intermediate_layer = nn.Linear(self.bert.config.hidden_size, 128)
       self.classifier = nn.Linear(128, 1)

   def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
       outputs = self.bert(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
       pooled_output = outputs.pooler_output
       dropout_output = self.dropout(pooled_output)
       intermediate_output = self.intermediate_layer(dropout_output) # Add another linear layer
       logits = self.classifier(intermediate_output)
       return torch.sigmoid(logits)

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BinaryClassifier('bert-base-uncased')

inputs = tokenizer("Example Text", return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
output = model(**inputs)
print(output)
```

In this example, I have introduced a custom classification head. It adds an extra linear layer before the final sigmoid. Adding this intermediary layer gives more parameters and thus increases the model's flexibility. This could help create a more effective representation of the BERT embeddings for our particular classification task. It can also allow for better gradient flow, improving training stability. While still initialized randomly, the extra intermediate layer reduces the sensitivity of the sigmoid output to initial weight conditions by adding a layer of complexity.

To summarize, achieving stable training with a pre-trained BERT model and a sigmoid output requires careful management of initializations, learning rates, and the complexity of the classifier head. A simple linear classifier without specific strategies can impede effective learning.  For further study, I recommend exploring publications on transfer learning in NLP, specifically focusing on techniques for fine-tuning pre-trained models. Consult documentation for PyTorch or TensorFlow's NLP libraries. Look into articles and resources about the intricacies of the Adam and AdamW optimizers, as well as exploring learning rate decay methodologies. Specifically, understanding how to implement and tune learning rate schedulers is highly beneficial. Finally, consider researching different approaches for handling class imbalances, since those are a common issue during training and can exacerbate some of the problems highlighted above. These resources, explored thoughtfully, should provide a robust understanding of challenges surrounding pre-trained model fine-tuning for binary classification.
