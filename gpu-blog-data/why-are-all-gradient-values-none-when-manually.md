The core issue, when encountering `None` gradient values during manual Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss calculation with frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, stems from improper tracking of operations that are required for automatic differentiation. Specifically, when the operations leading to the loss are not part of the computation graph, the framework cannot calculate the derivatives necessary for backpropagation, resulting in `None` gradients.

Let’s first establish the basics of a BCE Loss: it quantifies the dissimilarity between a predicted probability and a true binary label (0 or 1). Typically, the loss is expressed as:

`L = - [y * log(p) + (1-y) * log(1-p)]`

Where `y` is the true label (0 or 1), and `p` is the predicted probability. The crux of the problem arises when we either: 1) work directly with NumPy arrays instead of framework-specific tensors or 2) we use functions that are not framework aware. Frameworks, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, dynamically build a computation graph by tracking operations performed on their tensor objects. These operations, implemented as part of the framework, are designed to not only compute their results but also store information on how they can be differentiated. This tracked history enables the framework to use chain rule derivatives to calculate the gradients with respect to any intermediate variable.

When I first encountered this, debugging was tricky because the forward pass worked just fine – I got a sensible loss value. It was only upon attempting the backpropagation phase via `loss.backward()` (PyTorch) or with TensorFlow’s gradient tape, that everything broke down, with all parameters returning `None` gradients. The crucial aspect I had overlooked was that manually implemented computations, although mathematically correct, exist outside the purview of the automatic differentiation system.

To demonstrate, let’s look at specific scenarios and their solutions within PyTorch. We'll use a simple logistic regression as context.

**Code Example 1: The Problem – Using NumPy**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([[0.0], [1.0], [1.0]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Parameters - initialized as tensors
w = torch.tensor([[0.5]], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([[0.1]], requires_grad=True)

# --- Manual Calculation with Numpy ---
z_np = (X.detach().numpy() @ w.detach().numpy()) + b.detach().numpy() # detach to get raw arrays
p_np = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z_np))  # sigmoid with numpy
loss_np = - (y.detach().numpy() * np.log(p_np) + (1 - y.detach().numpy()) * np.log(1 - p_np)).mean()

print(f"Loss (NumPy): {loss_np}")

# PyTorch backpropagation
try:
    loss_np.backward() # This will trigger an error as numpy cannot be differentiated
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

print("Weight gradients (NumPy):", w.grad) # Expected to be None
print("Bias gradients (NumPy):", b.grad) # Expected to be None
```

In this first example, we see the fundamental issue: NumPy is not integrated into PyTorch’s computation graph. By detaching the tensors using `.detach()` and then using numpy arrays, we've effectively taken the operations “out of the loop” of what PyTorch can track. The loss value is computed using NumPy, and as a result, when we try to call `.backward()` on `loss_np`, it throws an `AttributeError` since the `loss_np` result does not contain the necessary computation history needed for derivative calculation. Subsequently, the gradients associated with `w` and `b` remain as `None`.

**Code Example 2: Partial Solution – Using Torch for Loss**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([[0.0], [1.0], [1.0]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Parameters - initialized as tensors
w = torch.tensor([[0.5]], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([[0.1]], requires_grad=True)

# --- Manual calculation - still using NumPy ---
z_np = (X.detach().numpy() @ w.detach().numpy()) + b.detach().numpy()
p_np = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z_np))

# Convert numpy back to tensor for calculating the loss
p_torch = torch.tensor(p_np, dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=False) # No gradient tracking necessary here

loss_torch = - (y * torch.log(p_torch) + (1 - y) * torch.log(1 - p_torch)).mean()

print(f"Loss (Partial Torch): {loss_torch.item()}")

# PyTorch backpropagation
loss_torch.backward()

print("Weight gradients (Partial Torch):", w.grad) # Expected to be None
print("Bias gradients (Partial Torch):", b.grad)  # Expected to be None
```

This second example represents an improvement, but is not yet correct. Although the final loss calculation uses Torch tensors and functions (specifically `torch.log`), the intermediate computations for `z_np` and `p_np` remain with NumPy. The tensors are converted back to Torch objects, but these new tensors do not inherit the computation history. Hence, PyTorch still cannot automatically trace the differentiation. Similar to the first example, `w.grad` and `b.grad` return `None`.

**Code Example 3: The Correct Solution – Full Torch Implementation**

```python
import torch

# Dummy data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([[0.0], [1.0], [1.0]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Parameters - initialized as tensors
w = torch.tensor([[0.5]], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([[0.1]], requires_grad=True)

# --- Manual calculation - Fully Torch Implementation ---
z_torch = (X @ w) + b
p_torch = torch.sigmoid(z_torch)
loss_torch = - (y * torch.log(p_torch) + (1 - y) * torch.log(1 - p_torch)).mean()


print(f"Loss (Full Torch): {loss_torch.item()}")

# PyTorch backpropagation
loss_torch.backward()

print("Weight gradients (Full Torch):", w.grad) # Expected to be non-None
print("Bias gradients (Full Torch):", b.grad)  # Expected to be non-None
```

This final example correctly computes gradients. Here, we've ensured every step of the forward pass—from the matrix multiplication, bias addition, to sigmoid activation, and finally the loss calculation— is implemented using framework-native operations. This allows PyTorch to dynamically construct the computation graph, enabling automatic differentiation. We see that the gradients `w.grad` and `b.grad` now hold the derivative information required for model parameter updates. The key change was replacing the numpy calculations with framework-aware operations such as `@` for matrix multiplication, `+` for addition and `torch.sigmoid` for the activation.

In conclusion, the `None` gradients issue arises when manually calculating BCE loss outside of the framework's automatic differentiation scope. The solution lies in exclusively using operations provided by the deep learning framework (like PyTorch's `torch` module or TensorFlow's `tf` module) on the framework's tensor objects for all intermediate calculations leading up to the final loss value, ensuring that the framework can track the computation graph for backpropagation.
