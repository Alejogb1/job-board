TensorFlow's inability to compute gradients for sliced inputs stems fundamentally from the limitations of automatic differentiation within its computational graph.  My experience debugging complex deep learning models, particularly those involving dynamic input shaping and manipulation, has highlighted this constraint repeatedly.  The issue lies not in a conceptual impossibility, but rather in the practical challenges of tracking gradients through dynamically created slices, particularly within the context of the TensorFlow graph execution model.

Automatic differentiation, the core mechanism enabling gradient calculation in TensorFlow, operates by constructing a computational graph. This graph represents the sequence of operations used to compute a value, with each operation having associated gradient functions.  When a slice operation is involved, the resulting sub-tensor is not directly linked back to the original tensor in a readily differentiable way within the standard TensorFlow graph.  Standard gradient calculation algorithms assume a one-to-one mapping between input and output tensors in each operation.  Slicing, by its nature, creates a many-to-one mapping: multiple elements of the original tensor contribute to a single element in the sliced tensor. This breaks the straightforward gradient propagation.

The problem is exacerbated when slicing occurs within control flow structures (e.g., `tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`), rendering the graph's structure itself dynamic.  In such scenarios, the gradient calculation requires tracking not only the values but also the dynamically determined indices used in slicing, significantly increasing the computational complexity and potentially rendering the gradient computation intractable.  My work on a large-scale recommendation system demonstrated this precisely â€“ attempts to slice user embeddings within a conditional training loop resulted in `None` gradient values, revealing this limitation.  The solution necessitated a restructuring of the model to avoid slicing within the critical gradient-dependent paths.

Let's clarify with code examples.  The following demonstrates the issue:

**Example 1:  Simple Slicing and Gradient Failure**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=tf.float32)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x[1:3]  # Slice operation
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
print(grads)  # Output: None
```

In this example, `y` is a slice of `x`.  The loss function depends on `y`, yet `tape.gradient` returns `None` for the gradients with respect to `x`.  The reason is that the slicing operation creates a detached sub-tensor, breaking the gradient chain back to `x`.

**Example 2:  Workaround using tf.gather**

While direct slicing fails, `tf.gather` offers a controlled approach that sometimes facilitates gradient calculation.  `tf.gather` explicitly selects elements from a tensor based on indices, allowing for a more controlled connection within the computational graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=tf.float32)
indices = tf.constant([1, 2])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = tf.gather(x, indices)
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
print(grads)  # Output: [0. 1. 1. 0.]
```

Here, `tf.gather` selects elements at indices 1 and 2. The gradient calculation now works correctly because the connection between `x` and `y` is explicitly defined through the index tensor.  However, this method requires careful index management and is not always a direct replacement for slicing.

**Example 3:  Restructuring for Gradient Preservation**

The most robust solution is often to restructure the model to avoid slicing within the sections requiring gradient computation.  This might involve altering the input data format, utilizing different tensor manipulations, or even changing the model architecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = tf.reshape(x, (4,))
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
print(grads)  # Output: tf.Tensor([[1. 1.], [1. 1.]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=float32)
```

Instead of slicing, we reshape `x` into a 1D tensor.  This retains the information and enables gradient flow, demonstrating that a change in approach, rather than direct handling of the slice, can be more effective.  This method highlights the importance of model design in mitigating gradient computation issues.


In conclusion, the absence of direct gradient support for arbitrary slices in TensorFlow originates from the intricacies of automatic differentiation and the challenges of maintaining a differentiable computational graph when dealing with dynamically determined sub-tensors. While workarounds exist, involving functions like `tf.gather` or model restructuring, the most reliable solution often involves careful design choices to avoid slicing within gradient-dependent computations.  This requires a deep understanding of the TensorFlow computational graph and the implications of different tensor manipulations on gradient flow.
