After debugging similar issues countless times with custom model deployments on SageMaker, the most frequent culprit behind failed invocations is a mismatch between the input format expected by the model’s `predict()` method and the data being sent to the SageMaker endpoint. This stems primarily from subtle differences in how data is serialized and deserialized across the model training environment and the deployed endpoint environment, especially when dealing with custom pre- and post-processing within the Keras model.

The core issue manifests when SageMaker receives input data encoded as JSON (or a serialized format) and attempts to pass this to the model’s `predict()` function, which expects a specific data type such as a NumPy array. The discrepancy occurs when either the pre-processing logic within the custom model is not correctly designed to handle the received format, or the serialization process before sending to the endpoint does not match the expectation of the model's pre-processing. This is compounded by the fact that data transformations performed during training, such as reshaping or data type conversions, are not automatically handled when the model is loaded into the SageMaker endpoint. Therefore, any data preparation that happens *before* the `fit()` method during training must also be replicated *before* the `predict()` method during inference.

To illustrate this, consider a common scenario where a Keras model expects a NumPy array input of a specific shape and data type. During training, the data is fed directly as NumPy arrays after any needed pre-processing. However, when deployed, the SageMaker endpoint receives requests formatted as a JSON string with keys and values. The Keras `predict()` function is expecting an ndarray directly, not a dictionary or JSON string. This results in the invocation failing because the `predict()` function either receives an incorrect data type, an incorrect array shape, or encounters an error during data interpretation.

Let's delve into a few specific cases with corresponding code examples:

**Example 1: Mismatched Data Types**

Imagine a scenario where the model expects float32 inputs, but the data, post-serialization to JSON, becomes a string.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, inputs):
       return self.dense(inputs)
    
    def predict(self, inputs, *args, **kwargs):
       # Error-prone prediction function with no input conversion
        #This will fail if the input to predict is a string
        return super().predict(inputs, *args, **kwargs)


# Example usage (Training phase):
model = CustomModel()
inputs_train = np.random.rand(10, 5).astype(np.float32)
outputs_train = np.random.rand(10, 1).astype(np.float32)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(inputs_train, outputs_train, epochs=2)

# Saving the trained model (assuming necessary code to save to a local path)
# ...
```

In this example, during training, `inputs_train` is a NumPy array of type float32. However, when the endpoint receives data, say `{"input_data": "[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]]"}`,  the model's `predict()` method receives a string. The `tf.keras.Model.predict()` method, which in this case we do not override, expects a NumPy array, thus the type mismatch leads to a cryptic error during invocation. The solution is to ensure that inside our `predict()` method we are converting the input string to the appropriate numpy array.

**Example 2: Incorrect Reshape or Array Format**

Another common issue occurs when the input array's shape is not what the `predict()` function expects.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(1)
        self.input_shape_ = input_shape

    def call(self, inputs):
       return self.dense(inputs)
    
    def predict(self, inputs, *args, **kwargs):
      
        try:
             # Pre-processing for correct format from endpoint data
            input_array = np.array(inputs['input_data']) # Assuming dict input
            reshaped_input = input_array.reshape(-1, self.input_shape_).astype(np.float32)
            # Call the base predict to do the actual forward pass
            return super().predict(reshaped_input, *args, **kwargs) 
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during pre-processing: {e}")
            return None



# Example usage (Training phase):
input_shape = 5
model = CustomModel(input_shape=input_shape)
inputs_train = np.random.rand(10, input_shape).astype(np.float32)
outputs_train = np.random.rand(10, 1).astype(np.float32)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(inputs_train, outputs_train, epochs=2)
# Saving the trained model
# ...
```

Here, the model during training receives input with a shape `(batch_size, input_shape)`. However, the SageMaker endpoint may send an input resembling `{"input_data": [[1,2,3,4,5]]}` which is not in the shape the internal layers of `tf.keras.Model.predict()` are expecting. To mitigate this, within the custom model's `predict()` function, we first parse the input from the JSON string format into a NumPy array and perform a reshaping operation prior to passing it to the `call` function. We use try/except blocks so we can log what is happening if we get an error. This ensure the input data is in the correct shape `(batch_size, input_shape)` prior to calling `super().predict`.

**Example 3: Handling Custom Serialization**

In situations where complex, custom serialization or preprocessing is used, explicitly defining the input handling in the `predict()` method becomes crucial.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import json

class CustomModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, inputs):
       return self.dense(inputs)
    
    def predict(self, inputs, *args, **kwargs):

        try:
            # Custom deserialization and pre-processing
            if isinstance(inputs, str):
                input_dict = json.loads(inputs) # Parse JSON
                input_array = np.array(input_dict['data'], dtype=np.float32) 
            elif isinstance(inputs, dict):
                input_array = np.array(inputs['data'], dtype=np.float32)
            else: # Assume numpy array case
                input_array = np.array(inputs, dtype=np.float32)


            # Call the base predict
            return super().predict(input_array, *args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in predict: {e}")
            return None



# Example usage (Training phase):
model = CustomModel()
inputs_train = np.random.rand(10, 5).astype(np.float32)
outputs_train = np.random.rand(10, 1).astype(np.float32)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(inputs_train, outputs_train, epochs=2)
# Saving the trained model
# ...
```

Here, the `predict()` function demonstrates handling multiple input scenarios for custom preprocessing of data coming from an endpoint. Note that there is logic that will convert to `np.array` if the input is a `str`, a `dict` or a `np.array`. This is to ensure that the input format is compatible with what is expected by the keras API, in this case a numpy array. The core concept is that we explicitly check input formats and convert them to what our model expects.

To troubleshoot and resolve similar endpoint failures, I have found the following resources helpful. Start by examining the SageMaker logs via the AWS console or CLI to pinpoint specific error messages. Refer to the TensorFlow documentation, particularly for information regarding model deployment and custom input handling. Review the SageMaker documentation for the specific inference containers that you're using, and any relevant documentation for using custom containers. Finally, for detailed debugging and tracing, consider utilizing the SageMaker Debugger. These resources, coupled with rigorous testing and careful examination of input-output expectations, significantly reduce the occurrence of failed invocations. The key takeaway is meticulous management of data types and shapes, ensuring consistency across the entire pipeline.
