The `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` in asyncio applications, particularly those involving aiohttp and concurrent requests, stems fundamentally from attempting to utilize the asyncio event loop after it has been explicitly closed or implicitly terminated.  This error manifests most commonly due to improper handling of asynchronous operations within the lifecycle of the event loop.  My experience debugging similar issues across large-scale microservices—specifically, a financial trading platform I contributed to—highlighted the critical need for structured concurrency and meticulously managed cleanup routines.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The asyncio event loop is the core of asynchronous programming in Python. It manages the scheduling and execution of coroutines, essentially allowing multiple I/O-bound operations (like network requests) to progress concurrently without blocking.  When the event loop is closed, it ceases to manage these operations. Any attempt to schedule a new task, execute a pending task, or access its internal state (like attempting to perform a network request using aiohttp after loop closure) will result in the `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`.

Several situations lead to this error:

* **Premature loop closure:**  The event loop might be closed before all asynchronous operations have completed. This can occur due to exceptions in one part of the application prematurely terminating the loop, or due to improper structuring of the `async def main()` function.
* **Concurrent access violations:**  Multiple threads or asynchronous tasks attempting to access or modify the event loop simultaneously can lead to unpredictable behavior, including premature closure and the resulting runtime error.
* **Incorrect usage of `asyncio.run()`:** While convenient, `asyncio.run()` implicitly handles loop creation and closure.  If a coroutine launched within `asyncio.run()` attempts to interact with the loop after `asyncio.run()` returns, the loop is already closed.  This is a common pitfall.
* **Resource leaks:** Failing to properly close resources, particularly aiohttp clients, can indirectly contribute to this error by leaving tasks pending on the loop, potentially leading to an implicit or unexpected loop closure.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Proper loop management with `asyncio.run()`:**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        try:
            data = await fetch_data(session, "https://example.com") # Replace with a valid URL
            print(data)
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            print(f"Error during request: {e}")
        finally:
            await session.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates proper usage of `aiohttp.ClientSession` within the context of `asyncio.run()`. The `async with` statement ensures the session is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur. This prevents resource leaks and the likelihood of post-closure loop interactions.  Crucially, all asynchronous operations are contained within the `main` coroutine, ensuring the loop's lifecycle is managed correctly by `asyncio.run()`.


**Example 2: Explicit loop handling and closure:**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    session = aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=loop)
    try:
        data = await fetch_data(session, "https://example.com")  # Replace with a valid URL
        print(data)
    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error during request: {e}")
    finally:
        await session.close()
        loop.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy()) #Only needed on Windows
    main()
```

**Commentary:** This example explicitly creates and manages the event loop.  The `finally` block ensures both the `aiohttp.ClientSession` and the event loop are closed, preventing the `RuntimeError`.  Note that the `asyncio.set_event_loop_policy()` line may be needed on Windows operating systems, as the default selector loop isn't compatible with `aiohttp` there.


**Example 3: Handling concurrent requests with `asyncio.gather`:**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_data(session, url) for url in ["https://example.com", "https://google.com"]] # Replace with valid URLs
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates the safe use of `asyncio.gather` for concurrent requests.  `asyncio.gather` ensures all tasks are completed before the `aiohttp.ClientSession` is automatically closed by the `async with` block. This prevents tasks from attempting to access the closed loop.  Note that `asyncio.gather` handles exceptions within individual tasks gracefully; an error in one request will not prevent others from completing.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **"Python's asyncio" from the official Python documentation.** This provides comprehensive details on asyncio's mechanisms and best practices.
* **"Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho.**  This book contains extensive coverage of asynchronous programming and concurrent programming techniques.
* **"Effective Python" by Brett Slatkin.**  This book offers valuable guidance on writing efficient and idiomatic Python code, including principles applicable to asynchronous programming.  Pay particular attention to chapters dealing with concurrency.


Addressing the `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` requires a deep understanding of the asyncio event loop's lifecycle and careful management of resources within asynchronous operations. By adhering to these principles and implementing proper cleanup procedures, as demonstrated in the provided code examples, developers can avoid this common error and build robust, scalable asynchronous applications.
