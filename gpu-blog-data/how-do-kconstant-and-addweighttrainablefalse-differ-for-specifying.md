The core distinction between using `K.constant` and `add_weight(trainable=False)` in Keras to define fixed weights within a custom layer lies in their integration with the Keras backend and the layer's overall lifecycle management.  While both methods achieve the same outcome—imposing non-trainable weights—they differ fundamentally in how those weights are handled during model compilation, training, and serialization. My experience developing custom layers for complex image processing pipelines has highlighted these critical differences repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`K.constant` (assuming `K` refers to the Keras backend, typically TensorFlow or Theano) creates a tensor of fixed values directly within the Keras computation graph. This tensor is essentially a static element; its values are immutable and are not subject to any gradient-based updates during the training process.  This is crucial because including a constant in the graph doesn't trigger the weight update mechanisms associated with the optimization algorithm. The constant is merely incorporated as part of the layer's forward pass computations.

`add_weight(trainable=False)`, on the other hand, leverages Keras's internal weight management system.  While setting `trainable=False` explicitly prevents gradient calculations and subsequent weight updates, the weight is still treated as a layer parameter.  This means it's managed alongside other trainable weights within the layer, participating in serialization (saving and loading model weights) and contributing to the model's overall structure.  Crucially, even though the weight itself isn't updated, the process of including it in the model's parameter list provides a structured approach that is often simpler to manage, particularly in larger models.

The key practical difference boils down to how the weights interact with the model's architecture and lifecycle.  `K.constant` provides a more direct and less integrated approach, best suited for simple, self-contained operations within the custom layer's logic. `add_weight(trainable=False)` offers superior integration with the Keras framework, facilitating better organization and maintenance, particularly within more complex layer designs.  I've personally found the latter approach significantly more maintainable in large-scale projects, even when the resulting performance difference is often negligible.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `K.constant`**

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class ConstantWeightLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, output_dim, constant_value, **kwargs):
        super(ConstantWeightLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.output_dim = output_dim
        self.constant_weights = K.constant(constant_value, shape=(1, output_dim), dtype='float32')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs * self.constant_weights

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return (input_shape[0], self.output_dim)

# Example Usage
layer = ConstantWeightLayer(output_dim=3, constant_value=[0.5, 1.0, 2.0])
#The constant weight is directly embedded in the layer definition. No weight update will occur.
```

This example demonstrates a simple layer that scales the input by a constant factor. The constant weights are defined directly using `K.constant`, making them part of the layer's internal logic but not part of the model's weight parameters.  This approach is straightforward for simple operations but may prove unwieldy in larger models.

**Example 2: Using `add_weight(trainable=False)`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class TrainableWeightLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, output_dim, initial_weight, **kwargs):
        super(TrainableWeightLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.output_dim = output_dim
        self.weights = self.add_weight(name='constant_weights',
                                        shape=(1, output_dim),
                                        initializer=tf.constant_initializer(initial_weight),
                                        trainable=False)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs * self.weights

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return (input_shape[0], self.output_dim)

# Example usage
layer = TrainableWeightLayer(output_dim=3, initial_weight=[0.5, 1.0, 2.0])
#This incorporates the fixed weights into the layer's weights attribute, simplifying model management.
```

This example achieves the same scaling as Example 1 but uses `add_weight(trainable=False)`. The constant weights are now managed as part of the layer's parameters, maintaining a consistent structure with trainable weights. This approach is preferable when dealing with multiple parameters and enhances model organization.


**Example 3:  Highlighting Serialization Differences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import InputLayer
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class ConstantLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(ConstantLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.constant = K.constant([1.0], dtype='float32')

    def call(self, x):
        return x + self.constant

class WeightLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(WeightLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.weight = self.add_weight(shape=(1,), initializer='ones', trainable=False)

    def call(self, x):
        return x + self.weight

#Model with Constant Layer
model_constant = Sequential([InputLayer(input_shape=(1,)), ConstantLayer()])
model_constant.save_weights('constant_model.h5')

#Model with Add_Weight Layer
model_weight = Sequential([InputLayer(input_shape=(1,)), WeightLayer()])
model_weight.save_weights('weight_model.h5')

#Loading the weights and verify structure (requires further checks for actual weight values)
model_constant.load_weights('constant_model.h5')
model_weight.load_weights('weight_model.h5')
#The weight model will load the weights properly because they are tracked by the framework
#The constant model's 'constant' will not be tracked; it is not part of the framework's structure.
```

This example explicitly demonstrates the serialization difference. Attempting to save and load the model using `K.constant` will result in the loss of the constant, whereas the `add_weight` approach ensures proper weight persistence.  This underscores the advantage of `add_weight` for model reproducibility and management.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation, a comprehensive textbook on deep learning (such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville), and relevant research papers on custom layer implementation in Keras.  Reviewing source code of existing Keras custom layers can also provide valuable insights.  Understanding the intricacies of the Keras backend (TensorFlow or Theano) is crucial for deeper comprehension.  Finally, actively engaging with online forums and communities dedicated to deep learning and Keras can be highly beneficial.
