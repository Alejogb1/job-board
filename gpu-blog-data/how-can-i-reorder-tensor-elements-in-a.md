Reordering tensor elements in PyTorch necessitates a nuanced understanding of indexing and advanced indexing techniques.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently involved manipulating tensor layouts for performance gains and compatibility with specific layers.  Directly manipulating the underlying memory is generally avoided due to potential for data corruption; instead, PyTorch provides efficient mechanisms for creating new tensors reflecting the desired order. This approach avoids in-place modification and maintains data integrity.

The core approach hinges on leveraging advanced indexing with either integer arrays or boolean masks. Integer arrays provide direct element mapping, while boolean masks selectively include elements based on a condition. The choice depends on the nature of the desired reordering.  For complex reordering schemes, defining a mapping function and applying it via `torch.gather` offers the most flexibility and readability.

**1.  Explanation of Core Techniques**

PyTorch offers several ways to achieve custom tensor reordering.  The most common methods leverage advanced indexing:

* **Integer Array Indexing:** This is the most direct method. You create an array representing the new index order for each dimension of your tensor. For example, if you want to swap the first and second elements of a one-dimensional tensor, you would use `[1, 0]` as your index array. This approach scales well to multi-dimensional tensors, but requires careful construction of the index array to represent the desired permutation.  Incorrectly constructed index arrays can lead to `IndexError` exceptions.

* **Boolean Mask Indexing:** This method is useful when selecting elements based on a condition.  You create a boolean tensor of the same shape as your source tensor, where `True` indicates elements to include in the reordered tensor and `False` indicates exclusion. This approach is less suitable for arbitrary reordering but excels in filtering and selecting subsets of tensor elements.

* **`torch.gather` Function:**  This function provides a powerful and general solution for arbitrary reordering.  You specify the source tensor, the dimension along which to gather, and an index tensor specifying the new order for each element along that dimension. This is particularly beneficial for complex reordering schemes where constructing integer arrays for multi-dimensional tensors would become unwieldy.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Reordering a 1D Tensor using Integer Array Indexing**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
new_order = torch.tensor([4, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # Reorder to [50, 30, 10, 20, 40]

reordered_tensor = tensor[new_order]
print(reordered_tensor)  # Output: tensor([50, 30, 10, 20, 40])
```

This example demonstrates the direct use of an integer array to specify the new element order. The `new_order` tensor dictates the mapping of indices from the original tensor to the reordered tensor. This approach is concise and efficient for simple reordering tasks.


**Example 2:  Reordering a 2D Tensor using Advanced Indexing**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
row_order = torch.tensor([2, 0, 1])
col_order = torch.tensor([1, 0])

reordered_tensor = tensor[row_order, :][:, col_order]
print(reordered_tensor) # Output: tensor([[6, 5], [1, 2], [4, 3]])
```

This example shows how to reorder a 2D tensor by independently reordering rows and columns.  `row_order` specifies the new row order, and `col_order` the new column order. Note that the slicing `[:, col_order]` is applied *after* the row reordering.  This approach is more complex than the 1D case but remains relatively straightforward for low-dimensional tensors.  For higher dimensional cases, this approach becomes less practical.


**Example 3: Reordering a 1D Tensor using `torch.gather`**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = torch.tensor([4, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # Same reordering as Example 1

reordered_tensor = torch.gather(tensor, 0, indices)
print(reordered_tensor) # Output: tensor([50, 30, 10, 20, 40])
```

This example uses `torch.gather` to achieve the same reordering as Example 1.  The `0` in `torch.gather(tensor, 0, indices)` specifies that we are gathering along the 0th dimension (the only dimension in this 1D case).  `torch.gather` offers a more generalized and readable solution, especially when dealing with complex reordering tasks and higher-dimensional tensors. This method avoids the potential ambiguity that can arise from chained slicing used in Example 2, particularly in multi-dimensional contexts.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on tensor indexing and the `torch.gather` function.  Thorough exploration of the examples provided in the documentation will solidify understanding of the practical implications of these techniques.  Furthermore, familiarizing yourself with advanced indexing practices within NumPy (which often translate directly to PyTorch) would provide a valuable foundation.  Finally, working through exercises involving increasingly complex tensor manipulations will build practical expertise in this area.  Careful attention to error handling and exception management is crucial when working with advanced indexing, especially in production environments where robustness is paramount.
