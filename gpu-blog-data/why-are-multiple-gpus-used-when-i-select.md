The apparent discrepancy between a single GPU selection at the terminal level and the utilization of multiple GPUs during application execution stems from a misunderstanding of how CUDA and similar frameworks manage device resources.  My experience in high-performance computing, particularly within the context of large-scale simulations and machine learning model training, has shown this to be a common point of confusion.  The terminal selection often dictates the *primary* or *default* GPU, while the application itself may be configured – either explicitly or implicitly – to leverage additional GPUs for improved performance. This behavior is not a bug, but a feature facilitated by parallel computing libraries.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

The operating system manages GPU resources, assigning each device an ID. When you select a GPU using command-line tools (e.g., `nvidia-smi -i 0`), you're typically designating a default device for processes that don't explicitly specify their GPU requirements.  However, many frameworks, most notably CUDA and OpenCL, allow applications to access and utilize multiple GPUs concurrently.  This is often accomplished through techniques like data parallelism, where different parts of a computation are assigned to different GPUs, or model parallelism, where different parts of a model reside on different devices.

The application's runtime environment, whether it's a custom C++ program using the CUDA library, a Python script using PyTorch, or a TensorFlow program, plays a critical role. These frameworks offer APIs to enumerate available GPUs and allocate resources based on the application's needs. The application might be configured to use all available GPUs, or a specific subset, regardless of the default GPU selection made at the system level. This configuration is often handled through configuration files, command-line arguments, or programmatically within the code itself.  The default GPU selection merely sets a precedence for processes that don't actively manage their GPU resource allocation.

It's essential to differentiate between device selection and device utilization.  Selecting a primary GPU via the terminal influences the behavior of applications that do not explicitly manage their GPU resources. Conversely, applications designed for parallel processing actively manage GPU utilization, often employing all available devices to achieve faster computation.  Failure to understand this distinction leads to the misconception that a single GPU selection prevents the use of others.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: CUDA C++ (Explicit GPU Selection)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    printf("Number of devices: %d\n", deviceCount);

    // Explicitly select multiple GPUs
    int deviceIds[] = {0, 1}; // Use GPUs 0 and 1
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        cudaSetDevice(deviceIds[i]);
        cudaDeviceProp prop;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, deviceIds[i]);
        printf("Using device %d: %s\n", deviceIds[i], prop.name);
        // ... CUDA kernel launches and memory allocation on deviceIds[i] ...
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates explicit GPU selection within a CUDA C++ application.  `cudaGetDeviceCount` retrieves the number of available GPUs.  The `deviceIds` array specifies the GPUs to use. The code iterates through the specified GPUs, setting each as the current device using `cudaSetDevice` before performing CUDA operations.  This code directly manages the GPU allocation, overriding any default GPU selection at the operating system level.  The `cudaGetDeviceProperties` call showcases how to obtain device-specific details.


**Example 2: PyTorch (Implicit Multi-GPU Usage)**

```python
import torch

# Check for available devices
print(torch.cuda.device_count())

# If multiple GPUs are available, use DataParallel
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model)

# Move model and data to GPU(s)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
# ... training loop using model ...
```

This Python code snippet, using PyTorch, demonstrates implicit multi-GPU usage.  `torch.cuda.device_count()` checks the number of available GPUs.  `torch.nn.DataParallel` automatically distributes the model across available devices if more than one is detected.  The `model.to(device)` line moves the model to the available GPU(s). The framework handles the parallel execution without explicit device management in the training loop. This showcases how high-level frameworks can abstract away low-level GPU management, making multi-GPU programming significantly simpler.


**Example 3: TensorFlow (GPU Configuration via Environment Variables)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for available GPUs
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(logical_gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)
# ... TensorFlow model building and training ...
```

This TensorFlow example demonstrates GPU resource management using environment variables or within the code.  The code checks for available GPUs using `tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices`. The `set_memory_growth` function dynamically allocates GPU memory as needed during training.  The print statement confirms the number of physical and logical GPUs. Although this example doesn't explicitly specify which GPUs to use,  TensorFlow will typically utilize all available GPUs unless specifically constrained. The flexibility of managing GPU memory through the `set_memory_growth` call addresses a crucial aspect of efficient multi-GPU usage.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA programming, consult the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation.  For parallel computing with Python, the PyTorch and TensorFlow documentation offer comprehensive guides and tutorials.  Exploring resources on parallel algorithms and distributed computing will enhance your ability to design and implement efficient multi-GPU applications.  Furthermore, textbooks on high-performance computing provide a strong theoretical foundation for this topic.  Familiarize yourself with the concepts of data parallelism and model parallelism.  Finally, understanding the memory management specifics within the chosen framework is crucial for avoiding performance bottlenecks.
