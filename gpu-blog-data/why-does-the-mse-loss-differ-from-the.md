During TensorFlow model training, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss often appears numerically distinct from the MSE metric reported during the same training process, despite both conceptually measuring the squared difference between predicted and true values. This discrepancy stems from the fundamentally different roles these calculations serve within the training loop, specifically how backpropagation and batching impact the computation.

The core difference lies in the averaging scope and timing. The MSE loss, employed during optimization via backpropagation, is calculated per batch, and its gradients are used to update model weights. Conversely, the MSE metric, typically displayed during training or evaluation, is computed across an entire epoch's worth of batches, or sometimes the entire dataset at the end of training. This averaging across batches, combined with potential differences in batch sizes, leads to variations in the reported values.

Let's examine the operational specifics. During each training step, TensorFlow feeds a batch of data into the model, generates predictions, and then computes the MSE loss. This loss is effectively a batch-level average of the squared error. The backpropagation algorithm leverages this batch loss to calculate gradients and adjust the model's internal parameters. The optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD) then uses these gradients to update weights. The key here is that the loss value directly drives parameter updates, and it’s specific to that batch.

On the other hand, the metric is an aggregate measure. Typically, within each epoch, metrics are computed and averaged across all batches. TensorFlow accumulates the necessary values (in this case, squared errors and counts) as it processes each batch, and at the end of the epoch, it calculates the final metric value by averaging over the entire epoch's accumulation. Because of the averaging scope and how values are stored internally, these aggregated metrics tend to be smoother and more representative of the model’s performance across a broader data sample.

To illustrate with code, consider the following:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the difference within a single epoch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy dataset
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer='random_normal', use_bias=False)
])

# Loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Metric
metric = tf.keras.metrics.MeanSquaredError()

# Training loop
epochs = 1
batch_size = 10

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(len(x_train) // batch_size):
        start = batch * batch_size
        end = start + batch_size
        x_batch = x_train[start:end]
        y_batch = y_train[start:end]

        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(x_batch)
            loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        # Update metric
        metric.update_state(y_batch, predictions)
        print(f"Batch: {batch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}, Metric (after update): {metric.result().numpy()}")

    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1} Metric (after epoch): {metric.result().numpy()}")
    metric.reset_state()
```

In this example, we establish a rudimentary linear model and a dummy dataset. The key observation is that within the inner loop, the `loss` and `metric.result()` values are computed after each batch. While `loss` reflects the loss computed directly on the batch, the `metric.result()` has incorporated all previously computed batches due to the `metric.update_state` method. At the end of the epoch, after the nested loop, the same `metric.result()` is printed with the accumulated error across all batches. The loss and metric for the same batch differ since the loss is for just that specific batch whereas the metric is averaged across all batches before it. The reset after the epoch ensures the metric starts fresh in the next epoch.

**Example 2: Different Batch Sizes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer='random_normal', use_bias=False)
])

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
metric = tf.keras.metrics.MeanSquaredError()

epochs = 1
batch_size_1 = 10
batch_size_2 = 20

def train_with_batch_size(batch_size):
    metric.reset_state()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in range(len(x_train) // batch_size):
            start = batch * batch_size
            end = start + batch_size
            x_batch = x_train[start:end]
            y_batch = y_train[start:end]

            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                predictions = model(x_batch)
                loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)

            gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
            optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

            metric.update_state(y_batch, predictions)

        print(f"Batch size {batch_size} - Metric after epoch: {metric.result().numpy()}")


train_with_batch_size(batch_size_1)
train_with_batch_size(batch_size_2)
```

Here, we demonstrate that different batch sizes can lead to different epoch-level MSE metric values. Because the metric averages over all batches in each epoch, different batch sizes lead to different number of batches that the metric averages across, hence the different values of metric at the end of the epoch. This difference arises because with larger batch sizes, the number of batches that contribute to the cumulative metric is smaller, and thus the impact of larger errors on smaller number of samples would be more impactful on the final metric than with a small batch sizes where that impact would be diluted more with more samples. This also emphasizes that the per batch loss, which governs the gradients, is fundamentally different from the metric used to evaluate model performance.

**Example 3: Evaluation phase vs training loop metric**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer='random_normal', use_bias=False)
])

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
metric = tf.keras.metrics.MeanSquaredError()

epochs = 1
batch_size = 10

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(len(x_train) // batch_size):
            start = batch * batch_size
            end = start + batch_size
            x_batch = x_train[start:end]
            y_batch = y_train[start:end]

            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                predictions = model(x_batch)
                loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)

            gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
            optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
            metric.update_state(y_batch, predictions)


    print(f"Training Metric (End of Epoch): {metric.result().numpy()}")
    metric.reset_state()

#Evaluation on the entire dataset
y_pred = model(x_train)
eval_metric = tf.keras.metrics.MeanSquaredError()
eval_metric.update_state(y_train, y_pred)
print(f"Evaluation Metric (entire dataset): {eval_metric.result().numpy()}")
```

In this example, I demonstrate the difference between the metric calculation within the training loop across batches, and the evaluation metric when the prediction is done for entire dataset. Both methods use the same MSE metric. The metric within the training loop accumulates the squared error and mean across batches, while the evaluation metric computes it over the entire dataset in one go. Even though we are using the same model and metric function the value can vary slightly since they are being averaged over the full training dataset versus a partial one based on the batches. This showcases how the scope across which the metric is computed impacts the final value.

In summary, the discrepancy between the MSE loss and MSE metric during training is not an error but arises from their distinct roles and averaging scopes. The loss is a batch-specific measure driving parameter updates, whereas the metric is an aggregate across an epoch (or the full dataset for evaluation) providing a more robust estimate of overall performance. To gain a deeper understanding, I recommend studying material focusing on the fundamentals of stochastic gradient descent, batch processing, and how metrics are aggregated in TensorFlow. Publications on optimization techniques and practical machine learning implementations are also useful resources. Textbooks providing a theoretical background on convex optimization and the mathematical underpinnings of neural networks would be valuable to further grasp the nuances. Further, experimentation with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers will build more practical knowledge.
