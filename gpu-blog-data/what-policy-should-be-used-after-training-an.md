The efficacy of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent post-training hinges critically on the deployed policy's robustness and adaptability to unforeseen situations.  Simply deploying the policy that achieved the highest average reward during training is often insufficient, and frequently leads to suboptimal or even catastrophic performance in real-world scenarios. My experience working on autonomous navigation for industrial robots highlighted this acutely; a policy optimized in a simulated, noise-free environment performed abysmally when deployed in a real factory setting due to unmodeled sensor noise and unexpected object placements.  Therefore, the choice of post-training policy requires careful consideration of several factors, including the environment's stochasticity, the agent's safety requirements, and the computational resources available for deployment.


**1. Explanation:  Policy Selection and Deployment Strategies**

Several strategies exist for determining the post-training policy.  The most straightforward, but often least robust, approach involves deploying the policy directly from the final iteration of the training process. This approach, however, fails to account for the inherent variability in RL training, particularly the possibility of overfitting to specific training scenarios.  Instead, several more sophisticated methods offer improved performance and resilience:

* **Averaging over multiple policies:**  This involves saving policies at regular intervals during training and averaging their weights to create a more generalized policy.  This reduces the sensitivity to specific training trajectories and mitigates the risk of overfitting.  The averaging can be a simple arithmetic mean or a weighted average, where weights might reflect the performance of each policy during its evaluation phase.

* **Ensemble methods:**  Similar to averaging, ensemble methods maintain multiple policies trained on potentially different subsets of the data or under varied training hyperparameters.  The final decision can be made through voting or a weighted average of the individual policies' predictions. This method enhances robustness by offering a more diverse set of decision-making strategies.

* **Exploration-exploitation balance during deployment:**  Even the most robust policy may encounter unforeseen situations. Incorporating exploration techniques during deployment allows the agent to adapt to novel circumstances.  This can be achieved through techniques like ε-greedy exploration or Boltzmann exploration, introducing a small probability of selecting a random action instead of the policy's suggested action. The value of ε (or the temperature in Boltzmann exploration) can be dynamically adjusted based on the agent's confidence in its current policy, decreasing exploration as confidence increases.

The optimal choice depends heavily on the specifics of the application. For high-stakes applications requiring a high degree of safety, averaging or ensemble methods are preferred due to their inherent robustness.  For applications where adaptation is crucial, strategies incorporating exploration during deployment are necessary.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different policy deployment strategies using Python and a simplified RL framework.  Note that these are illustrative and would need adaptation based on the specific RL algorithm and environment.  These examples assume the existence of a function `get_policy(iteration)` which returns a policy object at a given training iteration.

**Example 1: Averaging Policy Weights**

```python
import numpy as np

num_iterations = 1000
policies = [get_policy(i) for i in range(num_iterations, num_iterations-100, -10)] # Last 10 policies

# Assuming policies are represented by weight matrices
averaged_weights = np.mean([policy.weights for policy in policies], axis=0)

deployed_policy = type(policies[0])(averaged_weights) # Create a new policy with averaged weights.
```

This example averages the weights of the last 10 policies.  The choice of 10 is arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the characteristics of the training process.  The `type(policies[0])` call assumes all policies are of the same class.  Appropriate error handling should be added for robustness.


**Example 2: Ensemble Method (Voting)**

```python
import numpy as np

num_policies = 5
policies = [get_policy(i * 200) for i in range(num_policies)] # Select policies at intervals

def ensemble_predict(observation):
    predictions = np.array([policy.predict(observation) for policy in policies])
    return np.argmax(np.bincount(predictions)) # Majority voting

deployed_policy = lambda observation: ensemble_predict(observation)
```

This example creates an ensemble of 5 policies selected at intervals during training.  The `ensemble_predict` function determines the action by majority voting among the predictions of individual policies.


**Example 3: Epsilon-Greedy Exploration during Deployment**

```python
import random
import numpy as np

deployed_policy = get_policy(num_iterations-1) # Get the final trained policy
epsilon = 0.1

def deploy_policy(observation, action_space):
    if random.random() < epsilon:
        return random.choice(action_space) # Explore randomly
    else:
        return deployed_policy.predict(observation) # Exploit the trained policy

```

This example demonstrates epsilon-greedy exploration.  With probability `epsilon`, a random action is chosen, encouraging exploration.  Otherwise, the final trained policy is used for exploitation. The `action_space` is assumed to be a list of available actions.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of RL policy deployment strategies, I recommend exploring advanced topics in reinforcement learning textbooks, particularly those focusing on practical applications and real-world deployments.  Furthermore, reviewing research papers on policy robustness and safety in RL, as well as those addressing challenges encountered in transferring RL agents from simulated to real-world environments, will be extremely valuable.  Finally, familiarity with various RL algorithms and their respective strengths and weaknesses is crucial for making informed decisions about policy selection.  A strong grasp of statistical methods for policy evaluation and comparison is equally beneficial.
