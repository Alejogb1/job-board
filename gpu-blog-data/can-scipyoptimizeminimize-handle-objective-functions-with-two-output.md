The core limitation of `scipy.optimize.minimize` stems from its expectation of a scalar objective function.  While the function itself can internally perform vectorized operations, the algorithm fundamentally requires a single numerical value representing the "cost" or "error" to minimize.  This inherent constraint directly prevents the direct optimization of functions yielding multiple outputs without modification.  In my experience troubleshooting complex electromagnetic simulations, encountering this limitation was frequent.  Overcoming it required careful restructuring of the problem.

The misunderstanding often lies in the difference between a function *returning* multiple values and a function having a multi-dimensional *parameter space*. `scipy.optimize.minimize` adeptly handles high-dimensional parameter spaces – that is, your objective function can accept a vector as input. However, it cannot directly minimize across multiple, independent objective values simultaneously.

The solution necessitates combining multiple output variables into a single scalar metric.  The specific approach depends entirely on the nature of your problem and the relationships between the output variables.  Common strategies include:

1. **Weighted Summation:** This involves assigning weights to each output variable reflecting their relative importance.  The weighted sum then serves as the scalar objective function.  This method is suitable when the output variables represent similar quantities or when a prioritization scheme is readily available.  The weights must be carefully chosen; an inappropriate weighting can bias the optimization.

2. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**  When the output variables represent deviations from target values, RMSE offers a robust approach.  It treats all variables equally and is less sensitive to outliers compared to a simple weighted sum.  The downside is that its interpretation is less intuitive than a simple sum, especially for outputs with differing scales.

3. **Custom Metric:** For complex scenarios where neither weighted summation nor RMSE are appropriate, a custom metric reflecting the desired trade-off between the output variables must be defined. This metric must be a single scalar value, differentiable (or at least adequately approximated as differentiable) for most optimization algorithms within `scipy.optimize.minimize`.


Let's illustrate these techniques with code examples.  Consider a hypothetical scenario where we're trying to optimize two design parameters (`x`, `y`) for a process yielding two outputs: `output1` and `output2`.  Assume we desire to minimize `output1` while simultaneously maximizing `output2`.


**Example 1: Weighted Summation**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(params):
    x, y = params
    output1 = x**2 + y**2  # Example output 1 to minimize
    output2 = -np.sin(x) * np.cos(y)  # Example output 2 to maximize

    # Assign weights (e.g., 0.7 for output1, 0.3 for output2)
    weight1 = 0.7
    weight2 = 0.3

    # Weighted sum as the scalar objective function
    return weight1 * output1 - weight2 * output2 # Note the negative sign for output2

initial_guess = [1, 1]
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess)
print(result)
```

This example showcases a simple weighted summation. The negative sign in front of `weight2 * output2` ensures that maximizing `output2` contributes to minimizing the overall objective function.  The choice of weights (0.7 and 0.3) is arbitrary and needs careful consideration based on the problem's context and the relative importance of the outputs.  Changing these weights dramatically alters the optimization result.


**Example 2: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(params):
    x, y = params
    output1 = x**2 + y**2
    output2 = -np.sin(x) * np.cos(y)

    # Assume target values for output1 and output2
    target_output1 = 0
    target_output2 = 1

    # Calculate RMSE
    rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean([(output1 - target_output1)**2, (output2 - target_output2)**2]))
    return rmse

initial_guess = [1, 1]
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess)
print(result)
```

This example illustrates RMSE.  We define target values for `output1` and `output2`, representing the ideal or desired outcomes. The RMSE then quantifies the deviation from these targets, providing a single scalar value for minimization. This approach is particularly useful when the specific scale of each output is less critical than the overall distance from the targets.


**Example 3: Custom Metric**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(params):
    x, y = params
    output1 = x**2 + y**2
    output2 = -np.sin(x) * np.cos(y)

    # Custom metric: Prioritize minimizing output1, then maximizing output2
    if output1 < 0.5: #Example Threshold
        return output1
    else:
        return output1 - output2

initial_guess = [1, 1]
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess)
print(result)

```

This code demonstrates a custom metric.  Here, we prioritize minimizing `output1`. Only if `output1` falls below a specific threshold (0.5 in this case) do we consider maximizing `output2`. This introduces a hierarchical optimization strategy.  This approach is highly flexible, but requires a deep understanding of the problem domain to construct a meaningful and effective metric.  Further, this metric's differentiability should be carefully evaluated to ensure proper optimization convergence.



In summary, `scipy.optimize.minimize` inherently requires a scalar objective function.  Handling multiple output variables mandates converting them into a single scalar metric.  Choosing the correct approach—weighted summation, RMSE, or a custom metric—depends on the specific problem requirements and the relationships between the output variables.  Careful consideration of weighting, target values (for RMSE), and thresholding (for custom metrics) is crucial for obtaining meaningful and reliable optimization results.  Remember to thoroughly analyze the properties (particularly differentiability) of your chosen metric to ensure that the chosen optimization algorithm converges properly.  Further exploration of optimization algorithms beyond `minimize` (e.g., those handling constrained optimization) might be necessary depending on the complexities of your problem.  A solid grasp of multivariable calculus is essential for designing effective custom metrics.  Consulting textbooks on numerical optimization and multivariate calculus is highly recommended.
