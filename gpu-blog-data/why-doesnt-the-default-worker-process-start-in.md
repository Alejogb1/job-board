The behavior of a Docker container's main process not starting when `DEBUG=0` is often a misunderstanding of how entrypoints and signals are handled within the Docker environment, particularly in the context of application frameworks and process managers. This isn't a Docker-specific failure, but a consequence of how some applications are designed to operate in different execution modes. Based on my experience debugging numerous container deployments, the core issue generally arises when a framework's primary startup logic, which might be wrapped in a `run` or similar command, is conditional upon an environment variable like `DEBUG`. In effect, when `DEBUG` is absent or set to zero (or any value that evaluates to false), the application doesn't actually initiate the process that Docker expects to be the container's primary executable.

Docker fundamentally tracks the PID 1 process within the container. It's this process, defined by the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in the `Dockerfile` that Docker watches. If this initial process exits, the container exits. If it never starts, the container stays up but is effectively inactive.  Many applications that utilize debug modes often defer or replace the primary entrypoint process with a no-op or a logging handler when not in debug. This is frequently implemented by libraries or boilerplate code to avoid resource contention or activate diagnostic tools in development environments. When Docker runs the container, it sees that the process specified in `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` executes, but that the execution is conditional. If the condition is not met, no primary application process ever takes hold.

This often manifests in a seemingly "stuck" container where `docker ps` shows the container as running (because the initial process did run), but the expected service is absent, and no logs are generated beyond the immediate startup phase of the entrypoint script. The root cause lies not with Docker failing to start, but the application failing to commence operation *within* the Docker container's context. The application's runtime environment, specifically the conditional start, is the primary driver of this behavior.

Let's consider this using a Python application example with Flask. Often you see initialization routines where the server startup is predicated on a `DEBUG` setting.

```python
# app.py
import os
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    debug_mode = os.environ.get('DEBUG', '0') == '1'
    if debug_mode:
        print("Running in DEBUG mode...")
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
    else:
      print("Debug mode disabled, not starting Flask app")
```
```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile for the example above
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY app.py .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Here, the Python script `app.py` will only start the Flask development server if the `DEBUG` environment variable is set to `1`. If not, the `app.run()` is not executed and the program exits without creating a listening process at port 5000.  Building the image and running it with `docker run -p 5000:5000 <image-name>` will not provide a running web server. The container will start, `CMD ["python", "app.py"]` will run the script, the print statement for `debug mode disabled` will display and exit.  The container is active according to docker, but no listening port is exposed.

To enable the web server, run it with `docker run -p 5000:5000 -e DEBUG=1 <image-name>`, which sets the `DEBUG` variable, enabling the server start.  This example clearly highlights that the behavior is not Docker malfunctioning but the conditional logic in `app.py` dictating when the actual service starts.

Now, let's explore a Node.js example using Express where a similar pattern might appear.

```javascript
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const debugMode = process.env.DEBUG === '1';

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

if(debugMode){
    console.log('Running in debug mode...');
    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
    });
} else {
    console.log('Debug mode disabled, not starting Express app');
}
```

```Dockerfile
FROM node:16-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Similar to the Python example, the Express server in `index.js` only starts listening on the defined port when `DEBUG` is set to '1'.  If not, the `app.listen` function isn't called, and the server will never actually start. Again, the Docker container runs the `node index.js` command as expected, but the conditional nature of the application's initialization means the expected service isn't launched without the environment variable.

Finally, let’s take a look at a slightly more complex example using a typical `start` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# start.sh
if [ "$DEBUG" = "1" ]; then
  echo "Starting in debug mode..."
  exec python app.py
else
  echo "Debug mode disabled, not starting the app."
  exit 0
fi
```
```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY app.py .
COPY start.sh .
RUN chmod +x start.sh

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```
In this scenario, the `CMD` directive in the `Dockerfile` calls a bash script (`start.sh`). The script conditionally initiates the application (`python app.py`), but only if `DEBUG=1`. Without this environment variable set, the application never starts. In this instance, the application code itself isn't aware of the `DEBUG` variable, its effect is managed by a startup script wrapper. This is a common pattern when using a more involved entrypoint.

To correctly address this, we need to modify either the application code or startup script or, in the general case, the way we invoke the application so that the startup process *does not* rely on a conditional statement like this. If using an external mechanism (like a startup script) to control the application behavior, always make sure that the fallback behavior for no debugging actually starts the service. If that behavior is built into the application itself, you will need to consider a way to expose the needed functionality via an argument, an environment variable, or a file that is loaded from the filesystem.  This avoids any unintended consequences of the conditional startup logic.

For further information on effective Docker practices I would recommend researching:
-  Docker's official documentation:  It provides the authoritative source of knowledge on all Docker commands, best practices and internals.
-  Best practices for building Docker images. A deep dive into this can be of immense benefit to understanding how the various layers and instructions work.
-  Container orchestration tutorials using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. These sources will give the necessary context when you use Docker in larger systems.
-  Application architecture patterns for microservices. These tutorials often cover running applications in container environments and can assist in understanding best practices for building applications to run in such an environment.
-   The 12 factor app methodology which outlines a good baseline for building applications for modern deployment environments.

By understanding this interplay between Docker, entrypoints, and application-level conditional logic, the often frustrating issue of a seemingly "stuck" container can be diagnosed and resolved systematically. The key lies in treating the Docker container’s behavior as a direct result of its inner workings, rather than a Docker-specific malfunction.
