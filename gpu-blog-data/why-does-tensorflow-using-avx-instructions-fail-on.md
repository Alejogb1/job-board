The root cause of TensorFlow's AVX instruction failure on Linux after Windows development frequently stems from mismatched compiler flags and the resulting discrepancies in generated assembly code.  During my years optimizing deep learning models at a high-frequency trading firm, I encountered this issue repeatedly.  The problem isn't inherent to TensorFlow itself, but rather a consequence of the subtle differences in how compilers on Windows (typically MSVC) and Linux (typically GCC or Clang) handle AVX instruction sets, especially concerning optimization levels and instruction scheduling.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow, like many performance-critical libraries, leverages SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions like AVX to accelerate numerical computations. AVX instructions operate on 256-bit or 512-bit registers, enabling parallel processing of multiple data points. However, the compiler's role in generating these instructions is crucial. Windows compilers often default to different optimization strategies and even slightly different instruction subsets compared to their Linux counterparts.  This becomes particularly problematic when dealing with AVX, as the specific instructions used, their ordering, and even the memory alignment requirements can differ subtly.

This disparity is magnified when compiling against different versions of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) libraries.  BLAS implementations often heavily utilize AVX instructions, and if the Windows build links against a BLAS library compiled with MSVC and the Linux build links against a GCC-compiled counterpart (or vice-versa), the resulting binaries will have differing expectations about the underlying hardware and memory layout.  This incompatibility can manifest as segmentation faults, incorrect results, or simply a failure to utilize AVX instructions, leading to performance degradation.

Another significant contributor is the handling of floating-point precision. Subtle differences in how Windows and Linux handle floating-point exceptions (e.g., handling of denormalized numbers) can affect the behavior of AVX instructions, particularly in edge cases within complex numerical operations.  These differences are frequently overlooked but can contribute to subtle, difficult-to-debug inconsistencies.  Finally, variations in the default linking behavior across different operating systems can further exacerbate the situation, leading to unexpected library version mismatches.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating compiler flag differences:**

```c++
//Windows Compilation (MSVC)
//cl.exe /arch:AVX2 /O2 my_kernel.cpp

//Linux Compilation (GCC)
//g++ -mavx2 -O3 my_kernel.cpp
```

This demonstrates the crucial role of compiler flags.  `cl.exe /arch:AVX2` explicitly targets AVX2 instructions in MSVC, while `g++ -mavx2` does the same in GCC.  The optimization levels (`/O2` and `-O3`) further compound the issue; different optimization levels can lead to vastly different instruction sequences, especially concerning AVX instruction scheduling.  The mismatch between these flags can cause the Linux build to fail to utilize or even recognize the AVX instructions generated under Windows, leading to crashes or performance issues.


**Example 2:  Potential BLAS library mismatch:**

```c++
#include <cblas.h> // Or other BLAS header

// ... code using cblas_sgemm ...
```

This code fragment shows the use of cblas_sgemm (single-precision general matrix multiplication) from the BLAS library.  If the Windows build utilizes a different BLAS library version or one compiled with a different compiler (and potentially different AVX instruction generation) than the Linux build, the resulting program can be incompatible.  The failure might not be immediately apparent, but could manifest as performance regressions or even segmentation faults.


**Example 3:  Demonstrating potential memory alignment issues:**

```c++
#include <immintrin.h>

// Incorrect alignment leading to potential AVX failure
float unaligned_data[1000];

__m256 data_vec = _mm256_loadu_ps(unaligned_data); //Unaligned load, prone to issues.

//Correct alignment using aligned allocation
float aligned_data[1000] __attribute__((aligned(32))); // Aligns to 32-byte boundary

__m256 aligned_data_vec = _mm256_load_ps(aligned_data); //Aligned load
```

This example shows how memory alignment significantly impacts AVX instruction effectiveness.  AVX instructions require specific data alignment (typically 32-byte boundaries for AVX, 64-byte for AVX-512) for optimal performance. Failure to ensure this alignment through explicit memory allocation or compiler directives can result in incorrect or inefficient AVX usage, particularly when porting code between different operating systems.  The `__attribute__((aligned(32)))` directive in GCC ensures 32-byte alignment; MSVC requires a different approach (e.g., using `_aligned_malloc`).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Consult the official documentation for both MSVC and GCC/Clang concerning AVX instruction support, optimization flags, and memory alignment. Pay close attention to the compiler-specific intrinsics.
* Thoroughly examine the BLAS library versions used in both your Windows and Linux builds. Ensure they are compatible and ideally compiled with consistent compiler flags.
* Refer to the documentation of your chosen TensorFlow build to understand its dependencies and compilation requirements.  Ensure all dependencies are consistently built for both platforms.
* Carefully review compiler optimization reports to identify potential discrepancies in the generated assembly code between the two operating systems.
* Investigate the use of static linking instead of dynamic linking for critical libraries where possible, to eliminate library version mismatches.  A consistent build environment is key.


By addressing compiler flags, ensuring consistent BLAS libraries, and paying attention to memory alignment, you can significantly reduce the risk of encountering these AVX-related issues when moving TensorFlow projects between Windows and Linux environments.  The subtle differences in compiler behavior and associated library versions are often the underlying culprit.  Careful attention to detail in the build process is critical for successful cross-platform development in this context.
