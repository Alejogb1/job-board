TensorFlow's eager execution fundamentally alters how type conversions are handled compared to graph mode.  The key difference lies in the immediate evaluation of operations.  This means type casting, including float-to-integer conversion, is executed directly, avoiding the deferred execution characteristic of graph mode.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines highlighted the importance of understanding this nuanced behavior.  Improper handling can lead to unexpected results, particularly concerning data truncation and potential performance bottlenecks.

The most straightforward method for converting a TensorFlow float tensor to an integer tensor in eager mode uses the `tf.cast` operation. This function provides explicit control over the output data type, ensuring predictable results.  Crucially, `tf.cast` operates element-wise, converting each float value in the input tensor individually.  Incorrect usage, such as applying the function to the entire tensor as a single unit instead of element-wise on the tensor's components, is a common source of errors for developers new to TensorFlow eager execution.

**Explanation:**

`tf.cast` accepts two arguments: the tensor to be converted and the desired data type.  The data type can be specified using various TensorFlow data type constants like `tf.int32`, `tf.int64`, `tf.uint8`, etc. The choice of integer type significantly impacts the result, particularly concerning the range of representable values and potential overflow.  For example, converting a large floating-point number to `tf.int32` may result in an overflow, leading to unexpected negative values due to the two's complement representation. Selecting the appropriate integer type is paramount; underestimation may result in data loss, while overestimation may increase memory consumption unnecessarily.

The conversion process itself involves truncation.  The fractional part of each floating-point number is discarded; there is no rounding. This behavior differs from other languages where casting may incorporate rounding functions. Understanding this truncation is vital for correct interpretation of results. Any operation after the casting which expects floating-point values may produce unexpected results because of the truncation.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic Conversion to `tf.int32`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()  #Ensure eager execution is enabled

float_tensor = tf.constant([3.14159, 2.71828, 1.61803], dtype=tf.float32)
int_tensor = tf.cast(float_tensor, tf.int32)

print(f"Original Float Tensor: {float_tensor}")
print(f"Converted Integer Tensor: {int_tensor}")
```

This example demonstrates a basic conversion. Observe that the fractional parts are truncated.  The output will clearly show the integer values resulting from the truncation, highlighting the lack of rounding.  The `tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()` line ensures that the code runs in eager mode, avoiding potential inconsistencies between graph and eager execution behaviors.

**Example 2: Handling Potential Overflow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

large_float_tensor = tf.constant([2147483647.5, 2147483648.5], dtype=tf.float32) #Values near int32 max

int32_tensor = tf.cast(large_float_tensor, tf.int32)
int64_tensor = tf.cast(large_float_tensor, tf.int64)

print(f"Original Float Tensor: {large_float_tensor}")
print(f"Converted to int32: {int32_tensor}") #Observe potential overflow
print(f"Converted to int64: {int64_tensor}") #Correct representation with sufficient bit-width
```

This example illustrates the importance of selecting the appropriate integer data type. Converting values exceeding the `int32` maximum results in overflow in the `int32_tensor`.  The `int64_tensor` demonstrates the correct handling of potentially larger values by using a data type with a wider range.  This example highlights the need for careful consideration of the magnitude of the floating-point values before conversion.


**Example 3: Conversion within a TensorFlow Operation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

float_tensor = tf.constant([1.2, 2.5, 3.8], dtype=tf.float32)

# Integer division using tf.cast within the operation
result = tf.cast(float_tensor, tf.int32) // 2

print(f"Original Float Tensor: {float_tensor}")
print(f"Result of Integer Division: {result}")
```

This example shows how `tf.cast` can be integrated seamlessly within other TensorFlow operations. The integer division `//` requires integer inputs. The `tf.cast` operation converts the floating-point tensor to an integer type before the division is performed. The absence of an explicit variable assignment for the intermediate integer values emphasizes the potential for efficient inline conversion.  This technique avoids the creation of unnecessary intermediate tensors, potentially improving performance in larger computations.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections detailing eager execution and data types, provide comprehensive information.  Additionally, exploring TensorFlow tutorials focusing on data manipulation and type conversions would offer practical insights.  A good understanding of fundamental data types and their limitations in programming would also be helpful.  Reviewing materials on numerical precision and potential data loss during type conversions will enhance your understanding of potential pitfalls.
