The core challenge in incorporating class weights into a custom Keras training step lies not in the weight application itself, but in the accurate calculation and application of these weights within the gradient update mechanism.  Simply multiplying the loss by a weight for each class isn't sufficient; the gradient needs to reflect these weighted losses appropriately.  My experience working on imbalanced classification problems for fraud detection systems highlighted this subtlety.  Incorrectly implemented class weighting led to unstable training and suboptimal model performance.

To correctly implement class weighting, one must understand that the gradient descent process aims to minimize the *average* loss across the entire batch.  Directly multiplying the loss by class weights skews this averaging, potentially leading to inaccurate gradient estimations.  Instead, the correct approach involves weighting the individual sample losses before calculating the average batch loss, ensuring that the gradient reflects the weighted contribution of each sample.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The training process in Keras, particularly with custom training steps, hinges on the `tf.GradientTape` context manager.  This manager tracks operations for automatic differentiation, enabling the computation of gradients. To incorporate class weights, we need to modify the loss calculation within this context.  This involves:

a. **Calculating Sample-Specific Weights:** Determine the class weight for each sample based on its true label. This is usually done beforehand using techniques like inverse class frequency or based on a provided weight dictionary.

b. **Weighting Individual Losses:** Before calculating the average batch loss, multiply each sample's loss by its corresponding class weight.  This ensures each sample's contribution to the gradient is proportional to its assigned weight.

c. **Gradient Calculation and Application:**  The `tf.GradientTape` will automatically compute gradients based on the weighted average batch loss. The optimizer then uses these weighted gradients to update the model's weights.

Crucially, the weighting must occur *before* the batch loss is averaged. This is fundamental to accurately reflecting the importance of each sample in the gradient update.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Class Weighting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_train_step(model, images, labels, class_weights):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss_per_sample = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels, predictions)
        weighted_loss_per_sample = loss_per_sample * tf.gather(class_weights, labels) # Crucial weighting step
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss_per_sample) # Average of weighted losses

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Example usage:
class_weights = tf.constant([0.1, 0.9]) #Example weights
# ... (rest of training loop) ...
loss = custom_train_step(model, batch_images, batch_labels, class_weights)
```

This example directly incorporates class weights by multiplying the individual sample losses before averaging.  `tf.gather` efficiently retrieves the correct weight for each sample based on its label.  This approach directly addresses the core issue of accurately reflecting class imbalance during gradient calculation.


**Example 2:  Handling Multiple Classes with a Dictionary**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_train_step(model, images, labels, class_weight_dict):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss_per_sample = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels, predictions)
        weighted_losses = tf.convert_to_tensor([class_weight_dict[label.numpy()] for label in labels])
        weighted_loss_per_sample = loss_per_sample * weighted_losses
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss_per_sample)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Example usage
class_weight_dict = {0: 0.2, 1: 0.8, 2: 0.5} # Dictionary for multiple classes
# ... (rest of training loop) ...
loss = custom_train_step(model, batch_images, batch_labels, class_weight_dict)
```

This example extends the approach to handle scenarios with more than two classes, using a dictionary to map class labels to their respective weights.  Note the use of `tf.convert_to_tensor` to ensure compatibility with tensor operations. The crucial aspect remains the sample-wise weighting before averaging.


**Example 3:  Using a Pre-calculated Weight Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_train_step(model, images, labels, sample_weights):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss_per_sample = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels, predictions)
        weighted_loss_per_sample = loss_per_sample * sample_weights
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss_per_sample)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Example usage (assuming sample_weights is pre-computed):
sample_weights = tf.constant([0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9, ...]) #Weights for each sample in the batch
# ... (rest of training loop) ...
loss = custom_train_step(model, batch_images, batch_labels, sample_weights)
```

This approach allows for pre-computation of sample weights outside the training loop, which can improve efficiency for large datasets. The weighting mechanism remains identical; individual sample losses are multiplied by their respective weights before calculating the average batch loss.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization within TensorFlow, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials.  Thorough study of the `tf.GradientTape` functionality is crucial for mastering custom training loops.  Furthermore, exploring resources on imbalanced classification techniques will provide valuable context for effectively utilizing class weighting.  Finally, reviewing advanced topics in optimization algorithms will help in fine-tuning the training process for optimal performance.
