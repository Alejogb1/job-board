PyTorch's utilization of a GPU for computations is not automatic; it requires explicit instruction and configuration, even when a compatible GPU is present in the system. Based on my experience debugging countless deep learning setups, the default behavior is to leverage the CPU for tensor operations. This choice stems from a combination of factors, primarily related to PyTorch's design philosophy and the complexities of GPU programming.

The fundamental reason why PyTorch defaults to the CPU is that CPU computations require no specialized hardware setup and are universally accessible. When you install PyTorch, the core library and its dependencies are readily functional on most operating systems and CPU architectures. GPU support, conversely, necessitates the presence of a compatible NVIDIA GPU and the installation of appropriate CUDA drivers and libraries. Making GPU usage the default would introduce a significant barrier to entry for users without the necessary hardware and software configurations. Therefore, PyTorch's deliberate CPU default ensures that code can run immediately after installation, regardless of the machine’s specifications.

Furthermore, PyTorch’s primary focus is to offer a flexible and user-friendly environment for research and rapid prototyping. By beginning on the CPU, users can immediately write and execute their model definitions, experiment with data, and verify algorithm logic, deferring the complexities of GPU optimization for later stages. This iterative approach enables rapid development cycles and promotes the accessibility of deep learning to a broader community. GPU support is crucial for scaling up to real-world problems and accelerating training, but it’s consciously an additional step that the user must initiate.

The transition to GPU computation in PyTorch happens through the manipulation of device context, typically involving the `.to()` method. Tensors, by default created in CPU memory, must explicitly be moved to the GPU’s memory before operations will be executed on the graphics processor. Similarly, any model parameters and input data must also reside on the same device as the tensor on which computation is performed. If a tensor is created on the CPU and an attempt is made to operate on it with a tensor already on the GPU, PyTorch will raise a runtime exception.

Let’s illustrate this with code examples. First, let’s examine a scenario where tensors are created and all computations remain on the CPU.

```python
import torch

# Create two tensors on the CPU (default)
tensor_cpu_1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor_cpu_2 = torch.randn(3, 4)

# Perform an element-wise addition
tensor_cpu_sum = tensor_cpu_1 + tensor_cpu_2

print("Device of tensor_cpu_1:", tensor_cpu_1.device)
print("Device of tensor_cpu_2:", tensor_cpu_2.device)
print("Device of tensor_cpu_sum:", tensor_cpu_sum.device)
```

In this example, no explicit device specification is given, and the tensors are, by default, placed on the CPU, which is represented as `device(type='cpu')` in the output. This shows the fundamental behavior of PyTorch operating on the CPU without user intervention. Computations follow the creation device of the operands.

Now, consider an example where we explicitly move tensors to the GPU, provided that one is available.

```python
import torch

# Check for CUDA availability and set device accordingly
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create tensors on the CPU first
tensor_1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor_2 = torch.randn(3, 4)


# Move tensors to the chosen device (CPU or GPU)
tensor_gpu_1 = tensor_1.to(device)
tensor_gpu_2 = tensor_2.to(device)

# Perform an element-wise addition (on either CPU or GPU based on `device`)
tensor_gpu_sum = tensor_gpu_1 + tensor_gpu_2

print("Device of tensor_gpu_1:", tensor_gpu_1.device)
print("Device of tensor_gpu_2:", tensor_gpu_2.device)
print("Device of tensor_gpu_sum:", tensor_gpu_sum.device)
```

In the preceding code, I incorporate a check for CUDA availability. If a compatible NVIDIA GPU is detected, `device` will become the GPU; otherwise, it will fall back to the CPU. This adaptive approach ensures the code's usability across different hardware configurations. The crucial point here is that the `to(device)` method facilitates the transfer of tensors from CPU memory to the target device. Computations are then performed on whichever device the involved tensors reside.

Finally, it is essential to illustrate the error that occurs when tensors residing on different devices are subjected to the same operation.

```python
import torch

# Create one tensor on the CPU
tensor_cpu = torch.randn(3, 4)

# Check for CUDA availability and set device accordingly
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create another tensor on the chosen device
tensor_device = torch.randn(3, 4).to(device)


# Attempt to add tensors on different devices
try:
    tensor_incorrect_sum = tensor_cpu + tensor_device
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Error during tensor addition:", e)

```

In this example, an attempt is made to add a CPU-bound tensor (`tensor_cpu`) to a tensor residing on the GPU or CPU, based on the `device` variable. If a GPU is available, PyTorch will generate a `RuntimeError`, explicitly stating that the operation is only defined for tensors residing on the same device. This reinforces the explicit device handling responsibility placed on the developer when working with PyTorch and further justifies the CPU as the initial computation environment due to its inherent compatibility and lack of hardware dependencies.

Regarding resources, numerous sources offer insights into GPU programming using PyTorch. The official PyTorch documentation provides a thorough explanation of tensor operations, device manipulation, and best practices for GPU acceleration. For a more theoretical understanding of parallel processing and GPU architectures, textbooks on parallel and distributed computing provide fundamental knowledge. Online courses focusing on deep learning with PyTorch often include dedicated sections on leveraging GPUs for training. Finally, research papers in the field of deep learning frequently detail specialized GPU optimization techniques, especially regarding complex neural network architectures. Combining these resources allows a user to move beyond basic functionality and fully optimize their deep learning workflows for performance. In my experience, reading the official documentation has always been the first step when transitioning to GPU utilization within the framework, and a thorough understanding of device handling is necessary for any serious deep learning application.
