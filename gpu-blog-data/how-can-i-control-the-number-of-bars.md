The core issue in controlling the number of bars in an Altair bar chart stems from the interaction between the underlying data and the chart's aggregation strategy.  Altair, by default, treats unique values in a specified field as distinct categories for bars.  Therefore, directly controlling the bar count requires manipulating the data itself, or employing Altair's aggregation capabilities effectively.  Over the years, I've encountered this repeatedly in data visualization projects, often involving large datasets needing summary representation.  My experience suggests a multi-faceted approach, dependent on the desired level of data summarization.

**1. Data Pre-processing for Bar Count Control:**

The most straightforward approach involves pre-processing your data to reduce the number of distinct categories. This is ideal when dealing with a large number of granular categories that need to be grouped for a more concise visual representation.  For instance, you might have daily sales data but want a weekly or monthly summary.  This requires transforming your dataset before passing it to Altair.  

Consider a scenario where you possess a dataset containing sales figures for each day of the year.  Directly plotting this would result in 365 bars, which is overwhelmingly dense. To reduce this to monthly sales, you’d first group the daily data by month, summing the sales for each month.

**Code Example 1: Data Pre-processing with Pandas**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = {'Date': pd.to_datetime(['2024-01-15', '2024-01-20', '2024-02-10', '2024-02-28', '2024-03-05']),
        'Sales': [100, 150, 200, 120, 250]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group by month and sum sales
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_sales = df.groupby('Month')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()

# Convert Month back to datetime for better Altair handling
monthly_sales['Month'] = monthly_sales['Month'].dt.to_timestamp()

# Create Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(monthly_sales).mark_bar().encode(
    x='Month:T',  #Note the :T type specification for datetime
    y='Sales:Q'
).properties(
    title='Monthly Sales'
)

chart.show()
```

This code uses Pandas to group the data by month, sum the sales for each month, and then generates an Altair chart showing monthly sales.  The key is the `groupby()` and `sum()` operations, which reduce the number of data points before visualization.  The `:T` type specification is crucial for proper datetime handling in Altair.  Note that I explicitly convert the Period dtype back to datetime to maintain compatibility with Altair’s temporal encodings.


**2. Altair's Aggregation Functions:**

Altair itself offers robust aggregation capabilities that can be used directly within the chart definition. This approach avoids explicit data pre-processing, keeping the data manipulation within the visualization pipeline.  This is beneficial when the aggregation logic is more complex, or when you wish to avoid modifying the original dataset.

Let’s use the same daily sales data example, but now we aggregate within the Altair chart definition:


**Code Example 2: Altair Aggregation**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data (same as before)
data = {'Date': pd.to_datetime(['2024-01-15', '2024-01-20', '2024-02-10', '2024-02-28', '2024-03-05']),
        'Sales': [100, 150, 200, 120, 250]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# Create Altair chart with aggregation
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('month(Date):O', title='Month'), #Aggregate by month
    y=alt.Y('sum(Sales):Q', title='Total Sales')
).properties(
    title='Monthly Sales using Altair Aggregation'
)

chart.show()
```

Here, `alt.X('month(Date):O')` groups the data by month using Altair's built-in `month()` function.  Simultaneously, `alt.Y('sum(Sales):Q')` calculates the sum of sales for each month. This achieves the same result as the previous example, but within the Altair chart specification itself. The `:O` ordinal type specification is appropriate here as months are naturally ordered categories.


**3.  Binning for Continuous Data:**

When dealing with continuous data, such as age or income, you might want to group data into bins to reduce the number of bars.  This technique transforms continuous data into categorical data, allowing for a more manageable bar chart.

Let’s assume you have a dataset with individual customer ages and their spending habits.  Plotting each age individually might produce too many bars.  Binning allows grouping ages into ranges (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.) resulting in a more interpretable chart.


**Code Example 3: Binning with Altair**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
np.random.seed(42) # for reproducibility
data = {'Age': np.random.randint(18, 65, 100),
        'Spending': np.random.randint(50, 1000, 100)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create Altair chart with binning
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('bin(Age):O', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=5), title='Age Group'), # 5 bins maximum
    y=alt.Y('mean(Spending):Q', title='Average Spending')
).properties(
    title='Average Spending per Age Group'
)

chart.show()
```

This example uses `alt.Bin(maxbins=5)` to create at most 5 bins for the age data.  The `mean()` aggregation function calculates the average spending for each age bin. This provides a summary visualization without overwhelming the viewer with too many bars.  Experimenting with `maxbins` controls the level of detail.  You might consider using `step` instead of `maxbins` to define explicit bin widths.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Altair documentation, particularly the sections on encoding and transformations, provides comprehensive information on data manipulation within Altair.  The Pandas documentation is invaluable for efficient data pre-processing and manipulation.  Finally, exploring examples in the Altair gallery can provide inspiration for diverse visualization techniques.  Understanding the different data types (nominal, ordinal, quantitative, temporal) and their correct encoding within Altair is crucial for effective chart creation and control.  Mastering these elements allows for fine-grained control over the visualization process, preventing overplotting and ensuring clarity in your charts.
