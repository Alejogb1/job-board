Tensor indexing within loops necessitates a deep understanding of tensor shapes and the underlying data layout.  My experience optimizing large-scale physics simulations heavily relied on efficient tensor manipulation, frequently involving nested loops and intricate indexing schemes.  The crucial insight is that the efficiency of such operations is intrinsically tied to how you access the data, directly impacting memory access patterns and computational cost.  Inefficient indexing can easily lead to performance bottlenecks, even with highly optimized linear algebra libraries.

**1. Clear Explanation of Tensor Indexing within Loops**

Tensor indexing, in its essence, translates multi-dimensional array coordinates into a single linear memory address.  The specific mapping depends on the tensor's shape and the memory layout (e.g., row-major or column-major order, which is typically determined by the underlying hardware and programming language).  When nested loops are involved, each loop iteration corresponds to incrementing an index along a specific dimension.  The challenge is to correctly translate these loop indices into the correct linear memory address to access the desired tensor element.

Consider a three-dimensional tensor `T` with shape (x, y, z). In row-major order (common in C/C++ and Python's NumPy), the element at coordinate (i, j, k) will have a linear index calculated as:

`linear_index = i * y * z + j * z + k`

This formula reflects how the data is stored contiguously in memory.  `i` increments slowest, followed by `j`, and then `k`.  This ordering is critical for cache efficiency.  Accessing elements in a contiguous block dramatically reduces the number of cache misses, leading to considerable performance gains.  Looping in the natural order of indices, corresponding to the memory layout, maximizes this benefit.

Conversely, in column-major order (common in Fortran and some specialized libraries), the calculation would be different:

`linear_index = k * x * y + j * x + i`


Failing to correctly account for the memory layout and tensor shape will result in incorrect data access and potentially runtime errors, even if the loop structure is logically correct.  Furthermore, accessing elements in a non-contiguous manner significantly degrades performance due to increased cache misses.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate with three examples showcasing different scenarios and techniques.  These examples utilize a fictional tensor library called 'TensorLib' with a consistent API for demonstration purposes. I have omitted error handling for brevity.

**Example 1: Simple 3D Tensor Summation**

This example demonstrates a basic summation over a 3D tensor using nested loops and explicit indexing in row-major order.

```c++
#include "TensorLib.h"

int main() {
  TensorLib::Tensor<double> T(10, 20, 30); // Create a 3D tensor of doubles
  // ... Initialize T with some values ...

  double sum = 0.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 20; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 30; ++k) {
        sum += T(i, j, k); // Access element using overloaded () operator
      }
    }
  }
  // ... process sum ...
  return 0;
}
```

This code directly accesses each element using the natural indexing order, leveraging row-major memory layout for optimal cache performance.  `T(i,j,k)` is a hypothetical overloaded operator which internally handles the linear index calculation based on the tensor's shape and memory layout.

**Example 2:  Selective Element Access**

This example shows how to access only specific elements of the tensor based on a condition.

```python
import TensorLib

T = TensorLib.Tensor([10,20,30], dtype='float64') #Create a 3D tensor of 64-bit floats

# ... Initialize T ...

result = []
for i in range(10):
  for j in range(20):
    for k in range(30):
      if T[i,j,k] > 100:  # Access element using array-like indexing
        result.append(T[i,j,k])
#... process result ...
```

This code utilizes a conditional statement within the loop to select elements based on a criteria, demonstrating selective indexing. Again, the underlying library handles efficient index mapping.


**Example 3:  Advanced Indexing with Strides**

This example demonstrates accessing elements with non-unitary strides, simulating sub-sampling or processing specific slices of a tensor.

```java
import TensorLib.*;

public class TensorLoop {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tensor<float> T = new Tensor<>(100, 100, 100); // Create a 3D tensor of floats
    // ... Initialize T ...

    float[] sub_sampled = new float[10000];
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 10) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 100; j += 10) {
          for (int k = 0; k < 10; ++k){
              sub_sampled[count++] = T.get(i,j,k);
          }
      }
    }
    // ... Process sub_sampled ...
  }
}
```

This example shows that even with non-unitary strides (incrementing by 10), the loop structure remains conceptually similar but requires careful handling to ensure correct index mapping within the nested loops.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend studying the documentation for your specific tensor library (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  Additionally, a thorough review of linear algebra fundamentals and memory management concepts, including cache coherency and memory access patterns, is crucial.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like optimized tensor contractions and BLAS/LAPACK libraries will provide further insights into high-performance tensor manipulation.
