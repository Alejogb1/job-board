The computational cost of running ensembles of neural network models, particularly within Keras, can become a significant bottleneck, especially when forecasting time series or processing large datasets. Accelerating this process using GPUs is not merely desirable but often essential for achieving practical inference times. The degree of acceleration attainable relies primarily on how the ensemble is constructed and how model predictions are aggregated, as not all approaches lend themselves equally to GPU parallelization.

Fundamentally, Keras models leverage TensorFlow’s or other backends' inherent ability to execute computations on GPUs. When a single model is constructed and its prediction method is invoked on a suitable input tensor residing on a GPU device, the underlying calculations are transparently offloaded. The challenges with ensembles arise from the way these predictions, calculated by each individual model within the ensemble, are combined. Naive methods like a simple loop where each model’s predictions are appended to a list before computing the final ensemble output will introduce data transfers between CPU and GPU memory, negating the intended speedups. A more efficient methodology involves ensuring the entire prediction and aggregation pipeline remains resident on the GPU.

Several strategies can be employed to maximize GPU utilization. A common approach is to leverage vectorized computations, where entire batches of predictions are performed in parallel and then combined in a tensor-centric manner. We can also investigate model parallelism within each individual network. However, the most common approach to enhance speedups, in my experience, is to parallelize at the ensemble level, running all models together on the GPU. This avoids memory transfer bottlenecks. To implement this, we can create a custom Keras Layer and define all model predictions in its call method.

Here are three code examples illustrating these concepts, progressively moving towards optimal GPU usage. The examples utilize a simplified scenario, assuming the individual models are pre-trained and loaded.

**Example 1: Naive Sequential Prediction (Poor GPU Utilization)**

This initial example demonstrates a basic, yet inefficient, way to generate ensemble predictions. Each model's prediction is calculated individually within a loop, appending the output to a list. Though the underlying model’s computations may be happening on the GPU, this approach introduces a data transfer overhead as the intermediate predictions are moved from the GPU memory back to the CPU.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'models' is a list of pre-trained Keras models
# Assume 'input_data' is a NumPy array

def naive_ensemble_predict(models, input_data):
    predictions = []
    for model in models:
        prediction = model.predict(input_data, verbose=0)
        predictions.append(prediction)
    return np.mean(predictions, axis=0) #CPU-based aggregation

# Create dummy models for demonstration
input_shape = (10, 10)
num_models = 5
models = [keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=input_shape)]) for _ in range(num_models)]
input_data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 10)

# Run with naive approach
naive_predictions = naive_ensemble_predict(models, input_data)
print("Naive Predictions Shape:", naive_predictions.shape) #Output: (100, 1)
```

In this code, despite the model.predict potentially utilizing the GPU, the overall execution time is slowed because each prediction is transferred back to the CPU as it's calculated. Furthermore, the mean aggregation is performed on the CPU, further contributing to inefficiency.

**Example 2:  Tensor-Based Prediction (Improved GPU Utilization)**

This example improves upon the first by converting the loop into a vector operation that enables concurrent model evaluation.  The predictions are stacked as a tensor directly on the GPU, minimizing CPU memory interaction and enabling vectorized mean calculation. This significantly leverages the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'models' is a list of pre-trained Keras models
# Assume 'input_data' is a NumPy array

def tensor_ensemble_predict(models, input_data):
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_data, dtype=tf.float32)
    predictions = [model(input_tensor) for model in models]  # predictions is now a list of tf tensors
    stacked_predictions = tf.stack(predictions) # Stack tensors into a single tensor
    ensemble_predictions = tf.reduce_mean(stacked_predictions, axis=0) # GPU-based aggregation
    return ensemble_predictions.numpy()

# Create dummy models for demonstration
input_shape = (10, 10)
num_models = 5
models = [keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=input_shape)]) for _ in range(num_models)]
input_data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 10)


# Run with tensor-based approach
tensor_predictions = tensor_ensemble_predict(models, input_data)
print("Tensor Predictions Shape:", tensor_predictions.shape) #Output: (100, 1)
```

The `tf.stack()` operation gathers all prediction tensors efficiently. Importantly, `tf.reduce_mean()` performs the averaging operation within the GPU, further optimizing the workflow. In this approach, we are now running all models on the GPU simultaneously rather than serially. The only time the CPU is used is for the final `.numpy()` call to retrieve the results.

**Example 3: Custom Layer Ensemble (Optimal GPU Utilization)**

This example takes the best approach to GPU utilization by encapsulating the entire ensemble prediction logic within a custom Keras layer. This allows the ensemble, essentially, to be treated as a single model from Keras's perspective. This method minimizes data transfer overhead, keeps all computations on the GPU, and allows the user to incorporate the ensemble into a more complex model workflow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class EnsembleLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, models, **kwargs):
        super(EnsembleLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.models = models

    def call(self, inputs):
        predictions = [model(inputs) for model in self.models]
        stacked_predictions = tf.stack(predictions)
        ensemble_predictions = tf.reduce_mean(stacked_predictions, axis=0)
        return ensemble_predictions

# Assume 'models' is a list of pre-trained Keras models
# Assume 'input_data' is a NumPy array

# Create dummy models for demonstration
input_shape = (10, 10)
num_models = 5
models = [keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=input_shape)]) for _ in range(num_models)]
input_data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 10)

ensemble_layer = EnsembleLayer(models)

input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_data, dtype=tf.float32)

# Run with the custom layer approach
custom_layer_predictions = ensemble_layer(input_tensor)
print("Custom Layer Predictions Shape:", custom_layer_predictions.shape) # Output: (100, 1)
```
By implementing a custom layer, the predictions for all models and their aggregation are done completely on the GPU without needing to explicitly manage data transfers. Keras now recognizes the ensemble as a single callable unit, which greatly enhances integration with more complex modeling.

In summary, GPU acceleration of Keras ensembles is critically dependent on how predictions and aggregations are handled. The naive approach of looping through individual models leads to unnecessary data transfers, thereby limiting the potential for GPU speedups.  Leveraging TensorFlow tensors and incorporating aggregation operations within the GPU environment allows for significant performance improvements. The custom layer approach provides the most streamlined and efficient solution, enabling the ensemble to be treated as a single unit on the GPU. This latter approach often is the most straightforward to incorporate into a larger pipeline, as other keras layers can be composed with this custom layer without complex changes to the pipeline.

For additional information on GPU utilization, one should examine the TensorFlow documentation pertaining to performance optimization, focusing on the usage of the `tf.function` decorator, graph execution, and data pipelines. Similarly, the Keras API documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of custom layers and model building that facilitates the construction of optimized ensembles. Furthermore, resources detailing best practices for vectorized operations and optimizing tensor operations would prove very valuable.  Understanding how TensorFlow handles memory management, particularly with regards to GPUs, also facilitates building high-performance pipelines.
