The optimal performance of `cublasDgetrfBatched` and `cublasDtrsmBatched` in tandem hinges on the structure and characteristics of the batched linear systems being solved.  Specifically, their combined use is most advantageous when dealing with a large number of relatively small, dense, and independent systems, where the computational overhead of batching outweighs the cost of individual LU decompositions and triangular solves. My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving large-scale simulations demonstrates this clearly.  Improper application, particularly with poorly sized batches, can lead to performance degradation compared to solving each system independently on the CPU.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`cublasDgetrfBatched` performs a batched LU factorization on a set of square matrices.  The 'LU factorization' decomposes each matrix A into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that A = L * U.  This is a fundamental step in solving linear systems.  The 'batched' aspect implies it performs this decomposition simultaneously on multiple matrices, improving efficiency for parallel processing units like GPUs.

`cublasDtrsmBatched` performs a batched triangular solve.  Given the LU factorization from `cublasDgetrfBatched` (and a right-hand side vector b), `cublasDtrsmBatched` efficiently solves for x in the equation Ax = b.  Crucially, it leverages the triangular structure of L and U to significantly reduce the computational complexity compared to a general matrix solve.  Again, the batching allows for concurrent solutions of multiple systems.

The synergy comes from combining these two functions. We first factorize the matrices using `cublasDgetrfBatched`, storing the L and U factors. Then, for each right-hand side vector, we perform the forward and backward substitution using `cublasDtrsmBatched` leveraging the precomputed factors.  This avoids redundant computations that would arise if we performed LU decomposition for every right-hand side vector.  This is particularly efficient when multiple systems share the same coefficient matrix A but have different right-hand sides.

The key performance considerations are:

* **Batch Size:**  A sufficiently large batch size is crucial to amortize the overhead of launching kernels on the GPU.  Too small a batch, and the overhead might negate the benefits of batched computation.  Optimal batch size is problem-dependent and requires experimentation.
* **Matrix Size:** For very small matrices, the overhead of the batching operations might exceed the computational gain.  The optimal balance between batch size and matrix size needs careful assessment.
* **Memory Bandwidth:**  Efficient memory access is paramount.  Proper data alignment and memory transfer optimization are essential to minimize memory bottlenecks.  This is especially critical with batched operations, where a large amount of data needs to be transferred between the host and device.
* **Data Type:** Using double-precision (`cublasDgetrfBatched`, `cublasDtrsmBatched`) implies higher precision but also increased computational cost compared to single-precision. The choice should be tailored to the application's accuracy requirements.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Batched Solve**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>

// ... (Error handling omitted for brevity) ...

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);

    int batchCount = 1024; // Number of systems to solve
    int n = 100;          // Size of each matrix

    double *A_d, *b_d, *x_d;
    // Allocate memory on GPU
    cudaMalloc((void **)&A_d, batchCount * n * n * sizeof(double));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&b_d, batchCount * n * sizeof(double));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&x_d, batchCount * n * sizeof(double));

    // ... (Populate A_d and b_d with data) ...

    int *info = (int *)malloc(batchCount * sizeof(int));
    cublasDgetrfBatched(handle, n, A_d, n, nullptr, info, batchCount);

    // Check for errors in factorization.
    for (int i = 0; i < batchCount; ++i) {
        if (info[i] != 0) {
            // Handle factorization failure
        }
    }

    cublasDtrsmBatched(handle, CUBLAS_SIDE_LEFT, CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_DIAG_UNIT, n, 1, &alpha, A_d, n, b_d, n, batchCount);
    cublasDtrsmBatched(handle, CUBLAS_SIDE_LEFT, CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_DIAG_NON_UNIT, n, 1, &alpha, A_d, n, b_d, n, batchCount);

    // ... (Copy x_d back to host) ...

    free(info);
    cudaFree(A_d);
    cudaFree(b_d);
    cudaFree(x_d);
    cublasDestroy(handle);

    return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates a basic batched solve.  Note the crucial error checking after `cublasDgetrfBatched`.  The `info` array contains status flags for each factorization.

**Example 2:  Handling Different Right-Hand Sides**

This example shows how to solve for multiple right-hand sides with the same coefficient matrix A.


```c++
// ... (Includes and handle creation as before) ...

int main() {
    // ... (Allocate memory as before, but with multiple b vectors) ...
    double *b_d[NUM_RHS];
    for(int i = 0; i < NUM_RHS; ++i){
        cudaMalloc((void **)&b_d[i], n * sizeof(double));
        // ... (Populate b_d[i] )...
    }
    double *x_d[NUM_RHS];
    for(int i = 0; i < NUM_RHS; ++i){
        cudaMalloc((void **)&x_d[i], n * sizeof(double));
    }

    // ... (Perform LU factorization using cublasDgetrfBatched) ...


    for(int i = 0; i < NUM_RHS; ++i){
        cublasDtrsmBatched(handle, CUBLAS_SIDE_LEFT, CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_DIAG_UNIT, n, 1, &alpha, A_d, n, b_d[i], n, 1); //Solve for each RHS
        cublasDtrsmBatched(handle, CUBLAS_SIDE_LEFT, CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_DIAG_NON_UNIT, n, 1, &alpha, A_d, n, b_d[i], n, 1);
    }

    // ... (Copy solutions to host) ...

    // ... (Free memory) ...

    return 0;
}

```

This improves efficiency by only factorizing A once.

**Example 3:  Addressing potential performance bottlenecks**

This example addresses potential memory-related bottlenecks.


```c++
// ... (Includes and handle creation as before) ...

int main() {
    // ... (Memory allocation as before, but using pinned memory for faster host-device transfers) ...

    double *A_h = (double *)malloc(batchCount * n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *b_h = (double *)malloc(batchCount * n * sizeof(double));

    cudaMallocHost((void **)&A_h, batchCount * n * n * sizeof(double)); // Pinned memory
    cudaMallocHost((void **)&b_h, batchCount * n * sizeof(double)); // Pinned memory
    // ... (Populate A_h and b_h) ...
    cudaMemcpy(A_d, A_h, batchCount * n * n * sizeof(double), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(b_d, b_h, batchCount * n * sizeof(double), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // ... (Perform LU factorization and triangular solves) ...

    cudaMemcpy(x_h, x_d, batchCount * n * sizeof(double), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    // ... (Free memory) ...
}
```
Using pinned memory (`cudaMallocHost`) reduces the overhead associated with data transfers.
