The core issue in copying formatted values as plain text stems from the inherent conflict between the presentation layer (how data *appears*) and the underlying data itself.  Formatted text, whether in a spreadsheet, rich text editor, or even a terminal with ANSI escape codes, embeds formatting instructions directly within the data representation.  Standard copy-paste operations, by default, preserve this formatting.  Overcoming this necessitates decoupling the presentation from the raw data before copying. My experience developing data migration tools for large financial institutions has highlighted this repeatedly.  The solutions depend heavily on the context of where the formatted value originates.

**1.  Explanation:**

The process of extracting plain text from formatted data involves identifying the formatting mechanism used and then stripping it away.  Several approaches exist, depending on the source of the formatted data:

* **Regular Expressions:**  For data with predictable formatting, regular expressions offer a powerful way to identify and remove formatting tags or escape sequences. This is particularly effective when dealing with simple formats like HTML or text with embedded ANSI color codes.  The effectiveness depends on the consistency of the formatting.  Complex or inconsistent formats might require more sophisticated techniques.

* **Parsing Libraries:** If the formatted data adheres to a structured format such as XML, JSON, or even a custom format with a defined grammar, specialized parsing libraries provide a robust and efficient way to extract the underlying data. These libraries handle the complexities of parsing the structure and typically offer methods to access only the textual content.

* **Programmatic Manipulation (e.g., DOM manipulation for HTML):**  For web-based formatted data, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) allows direct access to the textual content of elements. This approach bypasses the need for regular expressions, particularly beneficial when dealing with nested elements or complex layouts.

* **Clipboard Manipulation (OS-specific):** In some scenarios, operating system-level access to the clipboard's content might be necessary. This allows for pre-processing the clipboard contents before the actual paste operation.  This typically involves OS-specific APIs and is less portable across systems.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Stripping HTML tags using Regular Expressions (Python)**

```python
import re

def strip_html_tags(html_string):
    """Removes HTML tags from a string using regular expressions."""
    text = re.sub('<[^<]+?>', '', html_string)  #Removes tags including contents
    return text

html_data = "<p>This is <strong>some</strong> formatted <i>text</i>.</p>"
plain_text = strip_html_tags(html_data)
print(f"Original: {html_data}")
print(f"Plain Text: {plain_text}")
```

This example uses a simple regular expression to remove all HTML tags.  It's important to note that this approach might not handle all edge cases perfectly, especially with malformed HTML.  For robust HTML parsing, a dedicated library like `Beautiful Soup` is recommended.


**Example 2: Extracting text from JSON using a parsing library (JavaScript)**

```javascript
const jsonData = `{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}`;
const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonData);

let plainText = "";
for (const key in jsonObject) {
    plainText += `${key}: ${jsonObject[key]}\n`;
}

console.log("Original JSON:", jsonData);
console.log("Plain Text:", plainText);

//For copying to clipboard (browser-specific)
navigator.clipboard.writeText(plainText).then(() => {
    console.log('Copied to clipboard!');
  }, (err) => {
    console.error('Failed to copy: ', err);
  });

```

This JavaScript example demonstrates extracting data from a JSON object.  JSON's inherent structure simplifies the process. The addition of the clipboard functionality is crucial for direct application of the solution.  Error handling is included for robustness.


**Example 3:  Removing ANSI escape codes from terminal output (Bash)**

```bash
# Sample string with ANSI escape codes
formatted_text=$(echo -e "\e[31mThis is red text\e[0m and this is normal.")

# Remove ANSI escape codes using sed
plain_text=$(echo "$formatted_text" | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mG]//g')

echo "Formatted Text: $formatted_text"
echo "Plain Text: $plain_text"

#For copying to clipboard (OS-specific;  requires appropriate tools like xclip or pbcopy)
echo "$plain_text" | xclip -selection clipboard #Or pbcopy on macOS
```

This bash script showcases removing ANSI escape codes often found in terminal output.  `sed` is used for its efficiency in performing the substitution.  Clipboard interaction is highly OS-dependent, as indicated by the comment.  Alternatives might be required on different systems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For robust HTML parsing, explore dedicated libraries such as Beautiful Soup (Python) or jsdom (JavaScript). For efficient regular expression usage, consult comprehensive guides on regular expression syntax and optimization.  When working with different operating systems, investigate platform-specific APIs for clipboard management.  Learn about different file formats and their parsing methods (e.g., CSV parsing libraries).  Finally, familiarize yourself with  structured data formats such as JSON and XML, and their respective parsing libraries.
