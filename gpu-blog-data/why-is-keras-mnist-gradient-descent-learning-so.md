The sluggish performance of Keras MNIST gradient descent training often stems from inadequate hyperparameter tuning and suboptimal model architecture choices, compounded by a lack of data preprocessing.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted these issues repeatedly.  Improperly configured learning rates, insufficient epochs, and the absence of appropriate regularization techniques all contribute to significantly extended training times and potentially poor generalization.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras, while a user-friendly deep learning framework, doesn't inherently guarantee rapid training. The MNIST dataset, despite its simplicity, can expose shortcomings in training methodologies if not carefully managed.  Gradient descent, the foundational optimization algorithm, relies on iteratively updating model weights to minimize the loss function.  Several factors impact the speed of this process:

* **Learning Rate:**  An inappropriately high learning rate can cause the optimization process to overshoot the minimum, leading to oscillations and slow convergence. Conversely, a learning rate that's too low results in extremely slow progress, requiring a disproportionately large number of iterations to achieve satisfactory results.  The optimal learning rate is often dataset-specific and requires careful experimentation.

* **Batch Size:** The batch size determines the number of training examples processed before updating the model's weights. Smaller batch sizes introduce more noise into the gradient estimations, potentially leading to slower, albeit potentially more robust, convergence. Larger batch sizes offer smoother gradients but may converge to suboptimal solutions.

* **Epochs:** The number of epochs (passes through the entire training dataset) significantly impacts training time. While more epochs usually improve accuracy, beyond a certain point, diminishing returns set in, resulting in wasted computational resources.  Early stopping techniques, which monitor a validation set's performance, can mitigate this.

* **Model Architecture:**  An overly complex model, particularly with an excessive number of layers or neurons, increases the computational cost of each iteration and can lead to slower training.  Overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data, is more likely in complex models unless appropriate regularization is employed.

* **Data Preprocessing:**  Failing to normalize or standardize the input data (the MNIST digit images in this case) can significantly slow down training.  Normalization, typically scaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1, improves the gradient descent process's efficiency.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Suboptimal Configuration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='sgd',  # Suboptimal optimizer choice.
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32) # Low epochs and default learning rate
```

This example demonstrates a common pitfall: using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer without tuning the learning rate and using a relatively low number of epochs. SGD's default learning rate often proves inadequate for efficient training.


**Example 2: Improved Configuration with Adam Optimizer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',  # Much improved optimizer
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3) # Prevents overtraining

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stopping])
```

This example utilizes the Adam optimizer, known for its adaptive learning rate, which often converges faster than SGD.  The addition of `EarlyStopping` prevents overfitting and saves training time. A larger batch size also speeds up training.  A validation split allows for monitoring performance on unseen data during training.

**Example 3: Data Preprocessing and Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
from tensorflow.keras.utils import normalize

# Data Preprocessing
x_train = normalize(x_train, axis=1)  # Normalize pixel values

model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2), #Adds regularization to prevent overfitting
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=256, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stopping])
```

This example incorporates data normalization, significantly improving training speed and performance. It also includes a `Dropout` layer, a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting, thus improving generalization and potentially reducing the necessary number of epochs.  A well-chosen learning rate within the Adam optimizer is also employed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of hyperparameter tuning, I suggest consulting relevant sections in textbooks on machine learning and deep learning.  Furthermore, studying the documentation for the Keras framework and TensorFlow will be indispensable.  Reviewing research papers on optimization algorithms, especially those comparing various optimizers' performance on image classification tasks, will deepen your comprehension.  Finally, exploring practical guides on building and training neural networks, with a specific focus on optimizing training speed, will provide invaluable insights.  These resources collectively offer a comprehensive approach to tackling slow training issues.
