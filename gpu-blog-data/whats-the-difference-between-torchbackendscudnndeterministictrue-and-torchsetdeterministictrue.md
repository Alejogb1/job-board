The core distinction between `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True` and `torch.set_deterministic(True)` lies in their scope and the level of reproducibility they guarantee within PyTorch's execution.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training pipelines has highlighted the crucial need for understanding this difference, especially when dealing with CUDA operations and ensuring consistent model outputs across runs.  Simply setting `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic` does not fully guarantee deterministic behavior, whereas `torch.set_deterministic` provides a more comprehensive approach, albeit with potential performance trade-offs.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` primarily affects the cuDNN backend used for convolutional operations.  cuDNN, NVIDIA's deep neural network library, often employs algorithms that prioritize speed over determinism.  Setting this flag attempts to force cuDNN to use only deterministic algorithms. However, this is not always possible, as some algorithms inherently lack deterministic implementations.  Even with this flag set, variations can still arise due to factors outside cuDNN's control, such as the order of operations within the GPU's memory management.  This is particularly relevant for complex architectures and large batch sizes where memory access patterns become more intricate.

`torch.set_deterministic(True)` takes a more holistic approach. This function sets a deterministic mode for the entire PyTorch runtime environment. It not only affects cuDNN but also influences other components that could introduce non-determinism, such as the underlying random number generators and the order of operations in specific PyTorch operators.  Effectively, it aims to enforce a deterministic execution path for the entire computation graph, wherever possible.

The crucial difference boils down to this:  `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True` focuses on a *specific* backend (cuDNN), while `torch.set_deterministic(True)` addresses potential non-determinism across the *entire* PyTorch environment.  The latter is therefore the stronger guarantee of reproducibility, even though it's less granular.  In practice, I've observed situations where `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True` failed to eliminate non-deterministic behavior, necessitating the use of `torch.set_deterministic(True)` for true reproducibility.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using only `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True`**

```python
import torch

torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False # Important for deterministic behavior

x = torch.randn(10, 10)
w = torch.randn(10, 10)

# Convolutional operation - cuDNN is likely to be used here if applicable
y1 = torch.matmul(x, w)
y2 = torch.matmul(x, w)

print(torch.equal(y1, y2)) # Might still be False, despite the setting
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the limited scope of `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic`. While we've tried to constrain cuDNN to deterministic algorithms, the overall output may not be completely reproducible due to other factors, like memory access patterns or other non-cuDNN components. Note the importance of setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`.  Benchmarking, while enhancing performance, often sacrifices determinism.

**Example 2: Using only `torch.set_deterministic(True)`**


```python
import torch
import random

torch.set_deterministic(True)
random.seed(42) # seeding for reproducibility of random operations

x = torch.randn(10, 10)
w = torch.randn(10, 10)

# Operations involving various PyTorch components
y1 = torch.matmul(x, w)
y2 = torch.matmul(x, w)
print(torch.equal(y1, y2)) # More likely to be True

#Another random operation to showcase the effect.
z1 = random.randint(0,10)
z2 = random.randint(0,10)

print(z1 == z2)
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases the more comprehensive approach. `torch.set_deterministic(True)` attempts to ensure consistent execution across PyTorch, resulting in a higher likelihood of reproducible results. Note that explicitly setting a seed for the `random` module is important as it impacts all parts of your code, not only PyTorch, if you're using external random number generation.


**Example 3: Comparing both approaches**

```python
import torch
import random

#Scenario 1: Only cudnn deterministic
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
random.seed(42)
x = torch.randn(100,100)
y = torch.matmul(x,x)
result1 = y.sum()

# Resetting the state
torch.manual_seed(0)
random.seed(42)
x = torch.randn(100,100)
y = torch.matmul(x,x)
result2 = y.sum()

print(f"Only cudnn deterministic: {result1 == result2}")

#Scenario 2: Using torch.set_deterministic
torch.manual_seed(0)
random.seed(42)
torch.set_deterministic(True)
x = torch.randn(100,100)
y = torch.matmul(x,x)
result3 = y.sum()

torch.manual_seed(0)
random.seed(42)
torch.set_deterministic(True)
x = torch.randn(100,100)
y = torch.matmul(x,x)
result4 = y.sum()

print(f"Using torch.set_deterministic: {result3 == result4}")


```

**Commentary:** This example directly compares the two approaches.  You are more likely to see `True` in the output when using `torch.set_deterministic`.  This emphasizes its more robust nature for achieving reproducible results. Remember to reset the random seed and manual seed before each run to ensure the test is consistent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides in-depth explanations of both functions and their implications.  Further exploration into the cuDNN library's documentation will yield detailed information on its algorithmic choices and the impact of the deterministic flag.  Finally, reviewing research papers on reproducible machine learning practices can offer broader insights into the challenges and best practices involved in ensuring consistent experimental results.  These resources offer a comprehensive foundation for understanding and managing determinism in PyTorch.
