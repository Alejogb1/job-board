High CPU utilization during concurrent PyTorch GPU execution stems primarily from data transfer and process management overhead, not inherent PyTorch limitations.  My experience troubleshooting performance issues in large-scale deep learning deployments has consistently highlighted this.  While GPUs handle the computationally intensive model operations, the CPU remains a critical bottleneck in managing data flow between the host and the devices, particularly when dealing with substantial datasets or complex model architectures.

**1. Explanation:**

The seemingly paradoxical scenario of high CPU utilization despite GPU use in separate PyTorch programs originates from the asynchronous nature of data transfer between CPU memory and GPU memory.  Each PyTorch program, even when running on a distinct GPU, frequently needs to fetch training data from the CPU's main memory (RAM) and transfer results back.  If the data transfer rate is slower than the GPU's processing capability, a queue of requests builds up on the CPU. This leads to the CPU becoming a performance bottleneck, even if individual GPUs are fully utilized.  

Several factors contribute to this effect:

* **Data loading:**  Methods used to load and preprocess training data (e.g., using `DataLoader` with multiple workers) significantly impact CPU load. Inefficient data loading or data augmentation processes can consume substantial CPU resources, regardless of GPU availability.  Increased numbers of worker processes, while improving parallelization of data loading, might still create contention and increase CPU usage if insufficient system RAM is available.

* **Inter-process communication:** Even if two PyTorch programs run on separate GPUs and seemingly independently, they might share resources, such as network connections for distributed training or disk I/O for logging. This inter-process communication adds overhead to the CPU, potentially leading to high usage.

* **Operating system overhead:**  The operating system itself requires processing resources to manage multiple processes, especially those with intensive data transfer needs. This background overhead, while often relatively small, becomes more noticeable under high load conditions.

* **Memory management:** PyTorch's memory management strategy relies on the CPU to allocate and deallocate GPU memory.  The complexity of this task increases with the number of concurrent programs and the size of the models and datasets involved.  Excessive memory fragmentation or inefficient garbage collection can also contribute to CPU performance degradation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate scenarios that can lead to high CPU usage even with separate GPU utilization:


**Example 1: Inefficient Data Loading**

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import time

# Define data transformations
transform = transforms.Compose(
    [transforms.ToTensor(),
     transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset (replace with your dataset)
trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=128,
                                          num_workers=8)  # High number of workers

# Training loop (simplified)
start_time = time.time()
for epoch in range(2):  # Reduced number of epochs for brevity
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        # ... (Your training logic here) ...
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed")
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Training time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

```

**Commentary:**  This example highlights a potential issue with the `DataLoader`. A high `num_workers` value (8 in this case) can lead to significant CPU usage if the system cannot efficiently handle the concurrent data loading threads.  Reducing this value or optimizing data preprocessing steps might alleviate this.


**Example 2:  Heavy Data Augmentation**

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import time

# Define data transformations with heavy augmentation
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(15),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

# ... (Dataset and DataLoader as in Example 1) ...

# Training loop (simplified)
start_time = time.time()
# ... (Training logic) ...
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Training time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

**Commentary:**  Complex data augmentation techniques (random cropping, flipping, rotation, etc.) can significantly increase CPU load during data preprocessing. If the augmentation pipeline is intensive, the CPU might become a bottleneck, even with efficient GPU utilization.


**Example 3:  Large Batch Sizes and Pinned Memory**

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import time

# ... (Dataset and transformations) ...

# DataLoader with pinned memory and large batch size
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=512, #Large batch
                                          num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)

# Training loop (simplified)
start_time = time.time()
# ... (Training logic) ...
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Training time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

**Commentary:** While `pin_memory=True` is generally recommended for performance (reducing data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU), using it with excessively large batch sizes can still stress the CPU during data transfer to the GPU. This is because a large amount of data needs to be transferred and prepared before the GPU can start processing.  Balancing batch size and `num_workers` is critical for optimization.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further investigation, I suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation on data loading and multiprocessing.  Examining your system's CPU and GPU usage metrics using system monitoring tools will be invaluable for identifying bottlenecks.  Understanding memory profiling techniques for PyTorch applications will further help in analyzing memory usage patterns and optimizing memory management.  Exploring techniques for asynchronous data loading and parallel data processing could potentially improve the efficiency of your workflows.  Lastly, consider reviewing best practices for efficient multi-GPU training in distributed settings, as this can greatly affect CPU resource utilization.
