The core challenge in executing a script with externally sourced variables lies in reliably handling diverse file formats and potential errors during data retrieval.  Over the years, I've encountered numerous scenarios requiring this functionality, ranging from automating complex simulations with configuration files to managing dynamic web application settings.  Robust error handling and clear variable scoping are paramount to achieving a reliable solution.

My approach emphasizes structured data formats for external files, primarily YAML and JSON, due to their readability and widespread parser availability. While CSV is an option, its lack of inherent structure increases the risk of parsing errors and necessitates more stringent input validation.  The chosen scripting language significantly influences the implementation details. I will illustrate using Python, Bash, and PowerShell, showcasing the common principles while highlighting language-specific nuances.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three main stages:

* **File Selection and Parsing:**  This stage determines the external file's location, reads its content, and converts it into a structured format accessible to the script.  The chosen method depends heavily on the file format.  For structured formats like YAML and JSON, dedicated libraries greatly simplify the process. For less structured formats, robust error handling is critical to mitigate issues such as missing fields or incorrect data types.

* **Variable Assignment:**  Once the data is parsed, the script extracts relevant information and assigns it to variables.  This stage requires careful consideration of variable naming conventions and scoping to prevent naming conflicts and ensure clarity.  The best practice is to use descriptive variable names that directly reflect the data they represent.

* **Script Execution:**  The script now utilizes the variables assigned from the external file to execute its intended task.  Error handling should be integrated throughout this stage to catch any unexpected behavior or exceptions that may arise from using external data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**a) Python with YAML:**

```python
import yaml

try:
    with open("config.yaml", "r") as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)

    username = config["user"]["name"]
    password = config["user"]["password"]
    server = config["server"]["address"]

    #Script execution using the variables
    print(f"Connecting to {server} as {username}...")
    # ... further script logic using username, password, and server ...

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: config.yaml not found.")
except yaml.YAMLError as e:
    print(f"Error parsing config.yaml: {e}")
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Error: Missing key in config.yaml: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates Python's capability to handle YAML files using the `PyYAML` library. The `try-except` block ensures robust error handling for file not found, parsing errors, and missing keys, providing informative error messages.  The `safe_load` function minimizes the risk of arbitrary code execution from malicious YAML files.

**b) Bash with JSON:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#Check for file existence
if [ ! -f "config.json" ]; then
  echo "Error: config.json not found." >&2
  exit 1
fi

#Parse JSON using jq
username=$(jq -r '.user.name' config.json)
password=$(jq -r '.user.password' config.json)
server=$(jq -r '.server.address' config.json)

#Handle potential jq errors
if [[ -z "$username" || -z "$password" || -z "$server" ]]; then
  echo "Error: Missing or invalid values in config.json" >&2
  exit 1
fi


#Script execution using the variables
echo "Connecting to ${server} as ${username}..."
# ... further script logic using username, password, and server ...
```

This Bash script utilizes `jq`, a command-line JSON processor, to extract values from a JSON configuration file.  The script checks for file existence and handles potential errors during JSON parsing. The error handling ensures that if any of the crucial variables are empty, the script gracefully exits with an error message.

**c) PowerShell with CSV (with error handling):**

```powershell
# Check if the file exists
if (!(Test-Path -Path "config.csv")) {
    Write-Error "Error: config.csv not found."
    exit 1
}

#Import the CSV file.  Note the use of explicit headers for robustness.
$config = Import-Csv -Path "config.csv" -Header "Setting","Value"

#Error handling for missing settings
try {
    $username = ($config | Where-Object {$_.Setting -eq "Username"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value)
    $password = ($config | Where-Object {$_.Setting -eq "Password"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value)
    $server = ($config | Where-Object {$_.Setting -eq "Server"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value)

    #Handle null values
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($username) -or [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($password) -or [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($server)){
        Write-Error "Error: One or more settings are missing in config.csv"
        exit 1
    }

    #Script execution using the variables
    Write-Host "Connecting to $($server) as $($username)..."
    # ... further script logic using username, password, and server ...

}
catch {
    Write-Error "An unexpected error occurred: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit 1
}
```

This PowerShell script demonstrates handling a CSV file.  Import-Csv with explicitly defined headers increases robustness. The script includes comprehensive error handling for missing files, missing settings, and null values.  Error messages are clear, aiding debugging.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of YAML, consult the official YAML specification and explore YAML parsers for your chosen language.  For JSON processing, refer to the JSON specification and examine available JSON libraries.  For CSV handling, study the CSV format specifications and consult the documentation of your scripting language's CSV parsing capabilities.  Understanding regular expressions will significantly enhance your ability to handle more complex data extraction tasks.  Finally, mastering the error handling capabilities of your chosen scripting language is crucial for robust, reliable scripts.
