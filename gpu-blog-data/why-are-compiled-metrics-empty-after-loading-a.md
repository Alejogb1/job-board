The absence of compiled metrics after loading a TensorFlow model frequently stems from a mismatch between the model's architecture during training and its subsequent loading configuration.  Specifically, the crucial element often overlooked is the proper restoration of the optimizer's state and the metric objects themselves.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale recommendation systems, often leading to hours of debugging before pinpointing the root cause.  The problem isn't necessarily with the model's weights, which are usually loaded correctly, but with the ancillary objects crucial for evaluating performance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.keras.Model.load_weights()` method, while effective for restoring model weights, does *not* automatically restore the optimizer's state or any compiled metrics.  These are separate objects that need explicit handling during the loading process.  The optimizer state includes information like the momentum and learning rate, essential for resuming training.  The metric objects, on the other hand, maintain internal accumulators that track the metric values over batches or epochs.  Failure to restore these leads to empty metric outputs after model evaluation, even if the predictions themselves are accurate.  Simply loading the weights is insufficient; the entire training process's state needs to be reconstituted.

A common scenario is loading a model trained with a specific optimizer (e.g., Adam) and then attempting evaluation without recreating that same optimizer and restoring its state.  This results in an optimizer operating from a default initialization, rather than from the point where training was left off. Similarly, metrics like accuracy or mean squared error are initialized to an empty state upon instantiation.  They don't automatically populate themselves; they require the accumulation of prediction and ground truth values during model evaluation. The absence of these values therefore leads to no results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Loading – Empty Metrics**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model and optimizer were previously defined and trained
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')  # Incorrect - only loads weights

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}") # Output: Loss: 0.0, Accuracy: 0.0 (or similar empty values)
```

This example only loads the model weights, omitting the optimizer and metrics.  Consequently, `model.evaluate()` produces empty metric values.

**Example 2: Correct Loading – Metrics Restored**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Assume model architecture is defined) ...

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...)  # Recreate model architecture
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(...) # Recreate optimizer with same parameters
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy']) #Compile with metrics
model.load_weights('my_model.h5')  # Load weights
# Restore the optimizer state (if available, often saved separately)
#  ... (Code to load optimizer state from a file or checkpoint) ...

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}") # Output: Loss: [actual loss], Accuracy: [actual accuracy]
```

This example correctly recreates the model architecture, optimizer, and compilation process with metrics *before* loading the weights.  This ensures the metrics are properly initialized and ready for use. The comments highlight the necessity to restore the optimizer state, a detail that is frequently omitted and causes significant issues.


**Example 3:  Saving and Loading the Entire Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#... (Model definition and training as before) ...
model.save('my_full_model.h5') # Save the entire model, including optimizer state and metrics

# Later, load the entire model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_full_model.h5')

loss, accuracy = loaded_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}") # Output: Loss: [actual loss], Accuracy: [actual accuracy]
```
This approach, leveraging `model.save()`, encapsulates the entire training state (including the model architecture, weights, optimizer state, and compiled metrics) into a single file.  This is the simplest and most reliable way to prevent empty metrics after model loading.  However, it requires sufficient disk space and may not be suitable for all deployments.  For very large models, saving the weights and optimizer state separately may be a better strategy.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation regarding model saving and loading is essential reading.  Pay close attention to the distinctions between saving only weights and saving the complete model.  Understanding the internal workings of the `tf.keras.optimizers` module and the specifics of each optimizer's state is also critical.  Finally, I highly recommend reviewing tutorials and examples demonstrating the complete lifecycle of model training, saving, loading, and evaluation to solidify your grasp of this process.  Careful attention to these aspects will help mitigate the problem of empty metrics.  Thorough testing with a small, easily reproducible model will reveal the core issue and its solution.  Remember that meticulously designed unit tests can prevent these issues from emerging in production environments.


In my experience, the most common oversight is neglecting to recreate the optimizer and compile the model *before* loading the weights.  A consistent, repeatable process for saving and loading models—whether it involves saving the complete model, weights alone, or a combination of both—is crucial for eliminating this issue and ensuring reproducible results.  Paying attention to detail in this area is fundamental to ensuring successful model deployment and evaluation.
