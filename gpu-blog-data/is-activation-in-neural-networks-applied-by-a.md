Activation functions in neural networks are not themselves layers, but rather integral components *within* layers.  This crucial distinction clarifies much of the confusion surrounding their application.  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for image recognition has highlighted the importance of understanding this fundamental architectural detail.  While the term 'activation layer' is sometimes used colloquially, it’s technically inaccurate and obscures the underlying mechanisms.  The activation function is applied element-wise to the output of a layer's weighted summation (or other linear transformation), shaping the non-linearity crucial for learning complex patterns.

**1.  A Clear Explanation:**

A neural network layer, regardless of type (fully connected, convolutional, recurrent, etc.), performs a linear transformation followed by an activation function. The linear transformation involves a matrix multiplication of the input with the layer's weights, and potentially the addition of a bias vector. This results in a vector of pre-activation values.  The activation function then operates element-wise on this vector, transforming each element independently.  The output of the activation function becomes the input to the subsequent layer.  It's the activation function that introduces non-linearity into the model, enabling the network to learn non-linear relationships in the data.  Without this non-linear transformation, the entire network would effectively collapse into a single linear layer, severely limiting its representational capacity.

Consider a fully connected layer with N input neurons and M output neurons. The linear transformation can be represented as:

`z = W * x + b`

Where:

* `x` is the input vector of size N.
* `W` is the weight matrix of size M x N.
* `b` is the bias vector of size M.
* `z` is the vector of pre-activation values of size M.

The activation function, denoted as σ(.), is then applied element-wise to `z`:

`a = σ(z)`

Where:

* `a` is the activation vector of size M, representing the layer's output.

Therefore, the activation is an operation performed *on* the output of a layer's linear transformation, not a separate layer itself.  It is a function applied element-wise, not a layer with trainable parameters independent of the weight matrix and biases.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the application of activation functions within layers using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

**Example 1: Dense Layer with ReLU Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)), # ReLU applied within the Dense layer
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# The 'relu' activation is a parameter within the Dense layer definition.
# It's not a separate layer object.
```

This code defines a simple neural network with a dense layer using the ReLU activation function.  Observe that 'relu' is specified as an argument *within* the `Dense` layer.  The ReLU function is applied element-wise to the output of the dense layer's linear transformation.  The `Dense` layer encapsulates both the linear transformation (weight matrix and bias) and the non-linear activation function.


**Example 2: Convolutional Layer with Sigmoid Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Similar to the previous example, 'sigmoid' is specified as an argument inside the Conv2D layer.
```

This example showcases a convolutional layer employing the sigmoid activation function.  The convolutional operation computes feature maps, and the sigmoid activation is applied element-wise to each feature map independently.  Again, the activation is a component *of* the layer, not a distinct layer itself.


**Example 3: Custom Activation Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def swish(x):
  return x * tf.sigmoid(x)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=swish, input_shape=(100,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# This demonstrates using a custom activation function, which is still applied within the layer.
# The swish function is passed as an argument.
```

Here, a custom activation function, Swish, is defined and used within a dense layer. This further emphasizes that the activation is not a separate layer but rather a function integrated within the layer's operation.  The flexibility to use custom functions highlights that the activation is a function applied to the layer's output.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on neural networks and deep learning.  Furthermore, reviewing the documentation for popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch will provide detailed explanations of layer implementations and activation function usage.  Exploring research papers on activation functions and their impact on network performance will further enhance your understanding of this crucial aspect of neural network architecture.  Finally, working through practical examples and implementing various neural network architectures will provide valuable hands-on experience.  These combined approaches will solidify your grasp of the topic.
