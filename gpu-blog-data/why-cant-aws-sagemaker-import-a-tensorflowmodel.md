The inability to directly import a `TensorFlowModel` class into an AWS SageMaker notebook environment often stems from a critical architectural distinction: SageMaker's model handling primarily revolves around serialized artifacts, while the `TensorFlowModel` class is a live, executable Python object designed for local TensorFlow execution. I've personally encountered this discrepancy across multiple machine learning deployments, requiring a shift in thinking from in-memory object instantiation to handling persistent model files.

Specifically, the problem isn't a missing library or incorrect version, but rather the fundamentally different ways SageMaker and TensorFlow interact with models. Locally, you might define a `TensorFlowModel` in Python, train it, and use it directly within the same Python process. SageMaker, however, treats models as external, opaque entities that it loads into containers for deployment or batch transformation. Therefore, you cannot "import" a Python object as a standalone SageMaker model; it must be first packaged into a specific, supported format.

SageMaker models exist as compressed archive files, typically `.tar.gz`, containing all the necessary elements for inference: the trained model weights, the inference code (usually Python), and any dependent libraries defined within a `requirements.txt` file. When you create a SageMaker model object, you are pointing to this archive file, not directly working with an in-memory instance of a class. This distinction is crucial and explains why simply importing a `TensorFlowModel` as you would a regular Python module fails within SageMaker. The platform is expecting a model artifact, not a class definition.

The process involves two key steps: first, saving the trained TensorFlow model to a suitable format, such as SavedModel or HDF5; and second, creating a specific script that SageMaker will utilize within its container environment to load this model, process input, and generate predictions. SageMaker then imports this script for processing purposes.

This explains the general issue. Here are three code examples detailing common scenarios and how to address them:

**Example 1: Saving a TensorFlow model and creating an inference script.**

```python
# Assume a trained TensorFlow model named 'model' exists.

import tensorflow as tf
import os

# 1. Define the directory for saving the model.
model_dir = "trained_model"
if not os.path.exists(model_dir):
    os.makedirs(model_dir)

# 2. Save the model in SavedModel format.
tf.saved_model.save(model, os.path.join(model_dir, "1"))

# 3. Create an inference script ('inference.py') to load and serve the model.
inference_code = """
import tensorflow as tf
import json

def model_fn(model_dir):
    # Load the saved model
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(model_dir)
    return loaded_model

def input_fn(input_data, content_type):
    # Assumes a JSON input format for simplicity.
    if content_type == 'application/json':
      input_data = json.loads(input_data)
      return tf.constant(input_data['data'], dtype=tf.float32)
    raise ValueError(f"Unsupported content type: {content_type}")

def predict_fn(input_data, model):
    # Runs a prediction
    predictions = model(input_data)
    return predictions.numpy().tolist()

def output_fn(predictions, content_type):
    # Converts predictions to a JSON response format.
    if content_type == 'application/json':
        return json.dumps({'predictions': predictions})
    raise ValueError(f"Unsupported content type: {content_type}")
"""

with open("inference.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(inference_code)

#4. Example packaging the model and script into a tar.gz file (using shell command).
# In a notebook, this would look like:
# !tar czvf model.tar.gz inference.py trained_model
```

**Commentary on Example 1:**

The first part of the example demonstrates saving the trained TensorFlow model using `tf.saved_model.save`. This function is critical for creating a deployable model artifact. The `inference.py` script is then created, which includes the `model_fn`, `input_fn`, `predict_fn`, and `output_fn` functions, the standard SageMaker inference requirements. `model_fn` loads the SavedModel, `input_fn` converts the raw input data into a tensor, `predict_fn` performs the inference, and `output_fn` formats the predictions for a response. This highlights the necessary separation of model code and model artifact. Finally, I have commented on how one might create a tar.gz archive to make this suitable for SageMaker ingestion. This is usually accomplished through shell commands executed directly from the notebook.

**Example 2: Utilizing an HDF5 saved model.**

```python
# Assume a trained TensorFlow model named 'model' exists.
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# 1. Define the directory for saving the model.
model_dir = "trained_model_h5"
if not os.path.exists(model_dir):
   os.makedirs(model_dir)

# 2. Save the model in HDF5 format
model.save(os.path.join(model_dir, "model.h5"))

# 3. Create a slightly different inference script.

inference_code_h5 = """
import tensorflow as tf
import json

def model_fn(model_dir):
    # Load the h5 model
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(os.path.join(model_dir, "model.h5"))
    return loaded_model

def input_fn(input_data, content_type):
    # Assumes JSON input as before
    if content_type == 'application/json':
      input_data = json.loads(input_data)
      return tf.constant(input_data['data'], dtype=tf.float32)
    raise ValueError(f"Unsupported content type: {content_type}")

def predict_fn(input_data, model):
    # Predict function remains the same
    predictions = model(input_data)
    return predictions.numpy().tolist()

def output_fn(predictions, content_type):
    # Output remains as json
     if content_type == 'application/json':
        return json.dumps({'predictions': predictions})
     raise ValueError(f"Unsupported content type: {content_type}")
"""

with open("inference_h5.py", "w") as f:
  f.write(inference_code_h5)

#4. Example packaging the model and script into a tar.gz file (using shell command).
# In a notebook, this would look like:
# !tar czvf model_h5.tar.gz inference_h5.py trained_model_h5
```

**Commentary on Example 2:**

This example switches to saving the model in HDF5 format, which was a common approach before SavedModel became the de facto standard. The primary difference is in how the model is loaded in `model_fn`, using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. This shows another acceptable, albeit older method of model packaging. The rest of the inference logic remains the same, underlining the flexibility of this approach but also the requirement to make this separation between loading and inference.

**Example 3: Using a `requirements.txt` file.**

```python
# Assume a trained TensorFlow model named 'model' exists.
# and an inference.py file is created in previous examples
import os

requirements_text = """
tensorflow==2.10.0
numpy
"""

with open("requirements.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write(requirements_text)

#1. Example packaging the model and script with requirements into a tar.gz file (using shell command).
#In a notebook, this would look like:
# !tar czvf model_req.tar.gz inference.py trained_model requirements.txt

```

**Commentary on Example 3:**

Example 3 demonstrates the inclusion of a `requirements.txt` file, which is essential when your inference script relies on specific package versions. This file ensures that the SageMaker container environment has all the dependencies needed for your model. When creating the tar.gz, the `requirements.txt` should also be included to correctly deploy the SageMaker model.

In summary, you cannot import a `TensorFlowModel` directly into SageMaker due to the architectural difference in model handling. You must first save your trained model in a compatible format (like SavedModel or HDF5), create an inference script with the necessary functions for loading and predicting, and package these artifacts into a `.tar.gz` file. The code examples presented illustrate how to accomplish this using two common model formats, and the necessity of a `requirements.txt`.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult official AWS SageMaker documentation on model deployment and container architecture. Explore TensorFlow's official documentation on saving and loading models, specifically the SavedModel API. Familiarize yourself with the format of the `requirements.txt` file as defined by Python's package manager, `pip`. These sources offer comprehensive explanations, further illuminating the best practices for converting TensorFlow models into deployable SageMaker models.
