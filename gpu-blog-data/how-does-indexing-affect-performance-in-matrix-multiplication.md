Indexing significantly impacts the performance of matrix multiplication, primarily by influencing memory access patterns and cache utilization. Direct, naive implementations can be surprisingly inefficient, especially with large matrices, because of the way data is arranged in memory and how processors access it. Understanding these dynamics is critical for writing optimized numerical computation routines.

The core problem arises from the typical row-major storage of matrices in memory (at least in C and Python’s NumPy), combined with the algorithms used for multiplication. Consider the standard algorithm, which involves taking the dot product of a row from the first matrix with a column from the second matrix. This seemingly straightforward operation can lead to scattered memory accesses, greatly hindering performance.

Let's illustrate this with a typical triple-nested loop implementation for multiplying two square matrices, `A` and `B`, resulting in `C`. Assume `A`, `B`, and `C` are all `n x n` matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

def naive_matrix_multiply(A, B):
    n = A.shape[0]
    C = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
    return C

# Example Usage (n=3 for illustration):
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
B = np.array([[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
C = naive_matrix_multiply(A, B)
print("Result (C):\n", C)
```

In the `naive_matrix_multiply` function, we iterate through rows of `A` using index `i`, columns of `B` using index `j`, and perform the dot product via the innermost loop, using `k`. While conceptually simple, this implementation creates significant performance issues due to how memory is accessed. The indices `A[i, k]` and `B[k, j]` are not accessed contiguously in memory, especially the `B[k,j]` accesses within the innermost loop for a given `i` and `j`. With row-major ordering, the elements of matrix `B` corresponding to a single column are far apart in memory. This leads to a high number of cache misses and stalls when accessing `B`, resulting in suboptimal execution times, particularly as `n` increases.

The root cause isn’t the algorithm itself, but the memory access pattern generated by the nested loops. We are fetching elements from non-contiguous memory regions, which are not optimized for modern hardware. CPUs rely heavily on caching mechanisms to improve performance. When a requested data element is not in the cache (a cache miss), the CPU must fetch it from slower main memory, introducing latency.

One common optimization technique involves loop reordering, specifically to improve memory locality. By interchanging the innermost two loops (the `j` and `k` loops), we can achieve a significant performance boost.  This reordering allows us to access columns of `B` using contiguous memory locations for `B[k, j]` in the inner loop of `j`, thereby improving cache usage.

```python
def reordered_matrix_multiply(A, B):
    n = A.shape[0]
    C = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i in range(n):
        for k in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
    return C

# Example Usage:
C_reordered = reordered_matrix_multiply(A, B)
print("Reordered Result (C):\n", C_reordered)
```

In the `reordered_matrix_multiply` function, notice that the `k` loop is now outside the `j` loop. This means, for a given `i` and `k` value, we are accessing `B[k, j]` with `j` varying sequentially, which is contiguous in memory. While we are still performing the exact same computational steps, we are now accessing data with better spatial locality, improving cache hit rates and overall performance. The difference between the two functions increases dramatically with the size of the matrices.

Another approach to improving matrix multiplication performance involves blocking or tiling. This involves dividing the matrices into smaller sub-matrices (blocks) and performing calculations on these blocks. This approach dramatically enhances performance by maximizing memory reuse and bringing the required matrix portions into the cache, working with cache-sized chunks of the matrices. In essence, we change the access pattern by introducing additional nested loops to iterate over blocks, which are themselves contiguous portions of the larger matrix in memory. We can create a simple blocked matrix multiply for demonstration purposes:

```python
def blocked_matrix_multiply(A, B, block_size):
    n = A.shape[0]
    C = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i in range(0, n, block_size):
        for j in range(0, n, block_size):
            for k in range(0, n, block_size):
                for ii in range(i, min(i + block_size, n)):
                   for jj in range(j, min(j + block_size, n)):
                        for kk in range(k, min(k + block_size, n)):
                            C[ii, jj] += A[ii, kk] * B[kk, jj]
    return C

# Example Usage (block_size=2 for illustration):
C_blocked = blocked_matrix_multiply(A,B,2)
print("Blocked Result (C):\n",C_blocked)
```

The `blocked_matrix_multiply` function divides the matrices into blocks of size `block_size`. It processes the result by iterating through the blocks (`i, j, k`), then through elements within each block (`ii, jj, kk`), applying the standard multiplication formula within the specified bounds.  The key idea is that `block_size` is chosen so that a block from each matrix will fit into cache. These approaches, particularly when `block_size` is properly tuned to match the cache sizes, produce a significant performance improvement compared to the naive and even reordered versions of matrix multiplication. The block_size selection is critical; poor choice may worsen performance by introducing unnecessary overhead or causing excessive cache misses.

In all these scenarios, indexing is not inherently the bottleneck. Rather, the way these indices interact with memory layout is the crucial factor that affects performance. Poorly structured indexing leads to inefficient memory access patterns, impacting cache hit rates and execution speed. Effective matrix multiplication demands a careful understanding of memory layouts and the specific architecture being used, employing strategies like loop reordering and blocking to optimize cache utilization.

For further understanding of these concepts, I would recommend exploring works on numerical methods, computer architecture, and high-performance computing. Textbooks on algorithm design, particularly those covering dense matrix computations, often contain detailed sections on optimizing matrix multiplication. Additionally, exploring resources that describe memory hierarchies and caching mechanisms provides a fundamental base for comprehending why certain code optimizations work. Publications focused on BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and its optimized implementations offer insights into how high-performance libraries are constructed. Finally, profiling your code with specialized tools and observing performance under varied matrix sizes and cache sizes is a valuable exercise in optimizing memory access.
