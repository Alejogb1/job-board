The core challenge in combining two Keras models with identical architectures but differing weights lies in the inherent independence of their weight tensors within the model's internal state.  Simple concatenation at the model level is insufficient;  we need a mechanism to merge their operational logic within a unified computational graph.  Over the years, I've encountered this problem frequently while working on ensemble methods and model averaging techniques for image classification. My approach focuses on leveraging the functional API of Keras, allowing precise control over layer instantiation and connection.

**1. Explanation of the Approach**

The solution hinges on recreating the shared architecture once, and then using this single architecture definition to instantiate two distinct model instances. Each instance will then be loaded with its respective weights.  Finally, we'll utilize the functional API's ability to define custom merge layers to combine the outputs of these models.  This approach offers several advantages: it avoids redundant computations, guarantees consistency in the architecture, and allows for flexibility in how the outputs are combined (e.g., averaging, concatenation, element-wise multiplication).


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's assume a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture as our base model. We'll first define this architecture using the Keras functional API. Subsequently, we'll instantiate two models based on this architecture, load distinct weights into each, and finally create a combined model.

**Example 1: Defining the Base CNN Architecture**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

def create_cnn_architecture(input_shape):
    input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)

    x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
    x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
    x = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
    x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
    x = Flatten()(x)
    x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
    output_layer = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # Assuming 10 classes

    model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    return model

# Define input shape (adjust as needed)
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)

base_architecture = create_cnn_architecture(input_shape)
```

This function `create_cnn_architecture` defines a reusable CNN architecture.  The use of `keras.Input` and the functional API ensures that the architecture is defined as a graph rather than sequentially. This is crucial for the next steps.

**Example 2: Instantiating and Loading Models**

```python
# Create two instances of the model
model1 = create_cnn_architecture(input_shape)
model2 = create_cnn_architecture(input_shape)

# Load pre-trained weights (replace with your weight files)
model1.load_weights('model1_weights.h5')
model2.load_weights('model2_weights.h5')
```

Here, we create two separate model instances using the previously defined architecture.  Critically, these are distinct instances; modifying one will not affect the other.  The `load_weights` function populates each model with its corresponding weights.  Ensure the weight files (`model1_weights.h5` and `model2_weights.h5`) are appropriately formatted.

**Example 3: Combining Models using a Custom Layer and Functional API**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Average

# Define a custom layer to average the outputs
average_layer = Average()

# Combine models using the functional API
combined_input = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
model1_output = model1(combined_input)
model2_output = model2(combined_input)
combined_output = average_layer([model1_output, model2_output])

combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=combined_input, outputs=combined_output)

# Example prediction
example_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
prediction = combined_model.predict(example_input)
print(prediction)
```

This example demonstrates the core of the solution. We define a custom averaging layer (`Average`).  Then, using the functional API, we pass the same input (`combined_input`) through both `model1` and `model2`.  The outputs are then combined using the `average_layer`.  This creates a single model (`combined_model`) that encapsulates the operations of both original models.  The `predict` function showcases how to use the combined model. You can readily replace `Average` with other layers like `Concatenate` for different ensemble strategies.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The Keras documentation, specifically the sections detailing the functional API and custom layer creation, are indispensable resources.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph mechanism is also highly beneficial for grasping the underlying principles.  Consult relevant literature on ensemble learning and model averaging techniques to understand the theoretical foundations of this approach.  Finally, studying examples of model ensembling in established deep learning repositories will further solidify your understanding and provide inspiration for variations on this method.  These resources will provide the necessary depth to tackle more complex scenarios involving different output shapes or more sophisticated combination strategies.  Remember that careful consideration of the chosen ensemble method and its impact on model performance is crucial for effective implementation.
