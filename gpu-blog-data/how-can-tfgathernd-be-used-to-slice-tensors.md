`tf.gather_nd` offers a powerful, albeit nuanced, approach to tensor slicing in TensorFlow beyond the capabilities of simpler indexing methods.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines highlighted its utility when dealing with irregularly shaped selections from high-dimensional tensors, a scenario where standard slicing operations proved insufficient.  This response will detail its functionality, focusing on its flexibility and addressing potential pitfalls.


**1.  Explanation of `tf.gather_nd`**

Unlike standard indexing (`tensor[i, j]`) or slicing (`tensor[i:j, k:l]`), `tf.gather_nd` allows for the selection of arbitrary elements from a tensor based on a collection of indices.  This collection is specified as a second input tensor, known as the `indices` tensor, which dictates the elements to be gathered.  The `indices` tensor has a shape of `[N, M]`, where `N` represents the number of elements to gather, and `M` represents the number of dimensions in the original tensor. Each row in `indices` provides a multi-dimensional index into the primary tensor.  The output tensor will have a shape determined by the structure of the `indices` tensor and the shape of the gathered elements from the input tensor. This differs significantly from slicing, which always produces a contiguous sub-tensor.

Crucially, `tf.gather_nd` supports gathering elements from tensors of arbitrary rank, providing flexibility in manipulating complex data structures.  It allows for both single-element selections and the extraction of multi-element sub-tensors based on the specific index patterns defined in the `indices` tensor. This functionality distinguishes it from `tf.gather`, which operates on a single axis, and enhances its applicability to more sophisticated scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Selecting individual elements**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]])  # Selects (0,0), (1,2), (2,1)

result = tf.gather_nd(params, indices)
print(result)  # Output: tf.Tensor([1 6 8], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
```

This example demonstrates the basic functionality.  `indices` specifies three individual elements: `params[0,0]`, `params[1,2]`, and `params[2,1]`. The output tensor `result` concatenates these elements into a 1-D tensor.


**Example 2: Selecting sub-tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 1]]) # Selects [1,2], [7,8]

result = tf.gather_nd(params, indices)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([[1 2] [7 8]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)
```

Here, we gather 2D sub-tensors.  The `indices` tensor specifies selecting the top-left and bottom-right 2x2 sub-tensors, resulting in a 2x2x2 output tensor.  The dimensionality of the output is determined by the combination of the `indices` shape and the shape of each gathered element.


**Example 3: Handling higher-dimensional tensors and batching**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]],
                     [[[9, 10], [11, 12]], [[13, 14], [15, 16]]]])
indices = tf.constant([[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]], [[1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]]) # Example of batching

result = tf.gather_nd(params, indices)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([[ 1  4] [11  6]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)
```

This example showcases the handling of a 4-dimensional tensor.  Note that we are now selecting from each 3D tensor that makes up the batch of the 4D tensor which demonstrates batching in `tf.gather_nd`.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation provides a comprehensive guide to `tf.gather_nd`, including detailed explanations of its parameters and behaviors.  Furthermore, exploring example notebooks and tutorials focusing on tensor manipulation techniques in TensorFlow will significantly enhance understanding of advanced indexing methods.  Consider studying resources on tensor reshaping and manipulation, paying close attention to the interaction of different operations. A deeper study of array broadcasting rules within the context of TensorFlow will also benefit your understanding. Finally, reviewing advanced TensorFlow APIs and functions dealing with tensor indexing and manipulation is recommended.  These resources will provide practical examples and explanations clarifying the intricate aspects of `tf.gather_nd`.
