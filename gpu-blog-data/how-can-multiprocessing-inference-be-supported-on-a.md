TensorFlow 2's inherent support for multiprocessing within a single GPU is limited, primarily due to the GPU's architecture and the nature of CUDA execution.  My experience optimizing large-scale models for deployment has shown that achieving true multiprocessing *on* a single GPU necessitates a different approach than simply spawning multiple Python processes.  Instead, the focus must be on maximizing parallelization *within* the GPU's compute capabilities.  This is best achieved through techniques focusing on data parallelism and efficient kernel design.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The misconception arises from conflating multiprocessing (operating system-level process management) with parallel computation (concurrent execution of tasks).  While multiple Python processes can *interact* with a single GPU,  they don't inherently execute concurrently *on* the GPU.  The GPU's compute resources are managed by the CUDA driver, which presents a single interface to the operating system.  Multiple processes attempting to concurrently access the GPU's memory and compute cores will encounter contention and overhead, frequently leading to performance degradation rather than improvement.

True parallelization on a single GPU is achieved through techniques integrated within TensorFlow's computational graph.  These techniques leverage the GPU's many cores to execute multiple operations simultaneously on different data subsets.  This is generally categorized as data parallelism.  The key is to efficiently distribute the input data across the GPU's available resources, avoiding bottlenecks in data transfer and computational units.  The `tf.distribute.Strategy` API offers the primary mechanism for achieving this type of parallel execution within TensorFlow 2.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate data parallelism using `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`.  Note that these examples assume a suitable GPU is available and TensorFlow is correctly configured.  Error handling and more sophisticated performance optimization strategies are omitted for brevity but are crucial in real-world applications.

**Example 1: Simple Data Parallelism**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Assuming 'x_train' and 'y_train' are your training data
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental use of `MirroredStrategy`.  The model is created within the `strategy.scope()`, ensuring its variables are replicated across all available GPU devices.  The `fit` method then automatically distributes the training data and executes the training process in parallel across the replicated model instances.


**Example 2:  Custom Training Loop with Gradient Accumulation**

For more fine-grained control, a custom training loop can be implemented. This is beneficial when dealing with extremely large datasets that exceed GPU memory capacity or when specialized optimization techniques are required.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([...]) # Your model definition
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

def distributed_train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

@tf.function
def distributed_training_loop(dataset):
    for inputs, labels in dataset:
        strategy.run(distributed_train_step, args=(inputs, labels))

dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(32))
distributed_training_loop(dataset)
```

This code defines a custom training step (`distributed_train_step`) that is executed across all replicas using `strategy.run`. The `@tf.function` decorator compiles the training loop for better performance.  This approach offers greater flexibility in handling data and gradient management.


**Example 3: Using `tf.data` for Efficient Data Pipelining**

Efficient data loading is paramount for achieving optimal performance. `tf.data` provides tools to pre-process and batch data efficiently.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([...]) # Your model definition

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train))
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10000).batch(32, drop_remainder=True).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
distributed_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(dataset)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(distributed_dataset, epochs=10)
```

This example highlights the use of `tf.data.Dataset` to create a highly optimized data pipeline.  `shuffle`, `batch`, and `prefetch` are essential for maximizing data throughput to the GPU. The `prefetch` operation significantly reduces idle time during training.  The `drop_remainder` argument ensures that batches are consistently sized.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.distribute.Strategy`.  Thorough understanding of CUDA programming and GPU architecture is also essential for maximizing performance.  Finally, explore advanced topics like gradient accumulation and mixed precision training to further refine performance within the constraints of a single GPU.  Extensive experimentation and profiling are critical for identifying and addressing bottlenecks.
