The root cause of `cublasCreate` failing with `CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` inside a Docker CUDA image typically stems from a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit version installed within the container and the NVIDIA driver version available on the host system. This isn’t readily apparent because the error suggests an internal issue when, in fact, the problem is external to the cuBLAS library itself. From personal experience debugging similar scenarios across multiple projects, these errors manifest most often when a newly built Docker image is deployed to a host machine with an outdated or incompatible driver.

The `CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` result code from `cublasCreate` is a fairly general error, indicating that cuBLAS encountered an unrecoverable problem. However, the library itself cannot function without properly communicating with the installed CUDA driver. This communication is dependent on ABI compatibility between the CUDA toolkit libraries included within the Docker image and the driver. When this compatibility is absent, initialization routines within cuBLAS will fail, triggering this error. The core issue, therefore, lies not with the cuBLAS API, but with the underlying CUDA infrastructure.

The Docker image isolates the application's dependencies, including the CUDA toolkit, from the host system. However, the application still relies on the host system’s NVIDIA drivers for GPU access. A Docker image typically bundles the CUDA toolkit libraries, such as `libcublas.so`, `libcufft.so`, etc. If the version of these libraries does not align with the host's driver, the loading and initialization sequence of these libraries will fail when an application within the container attempts to utilize them.  The error message does not explicitly state this incompatibility. It hides behind the more generic `CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` because the library itself cannot pinpoint the root cause; it merely observes the failure to establish the required lower-level communication.

To illustrate, consider three scenarios, each with a distinct setup and corresponding code excerpt, which I have encountered.

**Scenario 1: Driver Mismatch**

In the first scenario, I had a Docker image based on `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-base-ubuntu20.04`. This image contained the CUDA 11.8 toolkit. However, the host machine was running an older NVIDIA driver (version 470). The following C++ code, compiled within the container, would trigger the error:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cublas_v2.h>

int main() {
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  cublasStatus_t status = cublasCreate(&handle);
  if (status != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "cuBLAS initialization failed: " << status << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "cuBLAS initialized successfully." << std::endl;
    cublasDestroy(handle);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the `cublasCreate` function would return `CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`. The root cause was the incompatibility between the CUDA 11.8 libraries within the Docker image and the much older 470 driver on the host. This driver lacked the necessary support for the ABI employed by the newer libraries included in the container. Updating the host driver to a version compatible with the CUDA 11.8 toolkit (version 515 or higher) would resolve this error. The error is not in the code itself, which is technically correct, but in the environment it's running within.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Driver Installation**

In another situation, the host machine was technically running a driver compatible with the toolkit within the container (e.g., CUDA 11.6 in the image, and a 510 series driver). However, I found that the driver installation on the host was incomplete, especially with systems that previously had an old or improperly uninstalled driver. This led to missing kernel modules which were essential for CUDA and cuBLAS initialization. In this specific case, the driver version was adequate but parts of its installation were faulty, resulting in similar `CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`. The following code, identical to the first example, would fail in the same way:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cublas_v2.h>

int main() {
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  cublasStatus_t status = cublasCreate(&handle);
  if (status != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "cuBLAS initialization failed: " << status << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "cuBLAS initialized successfully." << std::endl;
    cublasDestroy(handle);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, neither the code nor the toolkit itself were faulty. The driver was the correct *version* but it had installation issues. Fixing this required a complete reinstallation of the NVIDIA driver on the host and ensuring all kernel modules were loaded correctly.

**Scenario 3: Multiple CUDA Installations**

I once experienced this issue when a host system had multiple CUDA installations, including one that was linked to older libraries within the system paths. Even though I verified the Docker image had the correct CUDA toolkit, the initialization of `cublasCreate` failed within the container. I traced the issue to the Docker container, by default, inheriting the system’s LD_LIBRARY_PATH which included locations pointing to older libraries which conflicted with the versions in the container. The following code, consistent with the previous examples, failed due to this environment issue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cublas_v2.h>

int main() {
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  cublasStatus_t status = cublasCreate(&handle);
  if (status != CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "cuBLAS initialization failed: " << status << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "cuBLAS initialized successfully." << std::endl;
    cublasDestroy(handle);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The fix here involved explicitly setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within the container to ensure only the libraries within the Docker image were used, preventing any interference from the host system's libraries. This also meant verifying the Dockerfile built the image to *only* include the toolkit from its container and not system paths.

In summary, the `CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` during `cublasCreate` in a Docker CUDA environment is typically not an issue with the application code but with the environment's configuration. It almost always involves a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit within the Docker image and the NVIDIA driver on the host. The best approach to resolving this issue revolves around ensuring driver compatibility. Specifically, the driver on the host system should be at least as recent (and preferably more recent) than the CUDA toolkit in use within the container. Additionally, it's crucial to ascertain that the driver was installed completely and without issues on the host, and to be careful about inheriting environment variables from the host into the container.

To diagnose these issues, NVIDIA provides resources such as the CUDA Toolkit documentation. This includes information about supported driver versions for various CUDA toolkit releases. Additionally, a thorough review of the host system logs (especially driver-related logs) can be valuable in pinpointing driver installation issues. Furthermore, forums and community discussions specific to NVIDIA's CUDA offerings are valuable for troubleshooting and identifying common problems. Consulting the Docker documentation in respect to container environment variables can help with the understanding of variables being passed into the Docker container during runtime.
