AMD’s Accelerated Parallel Processing (APP), formerly known as ATI Stream, and Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) represent competing parallel computing architectures primarily targeting GPUs. While both enable developers to leverage the substantial processing power of graphics cards for general-purpose computation, their underlying implementations, programming models, and ecosystems differ significantly, affecting performance, portability, and ease of use.

I’ve spent considerable time, perhaps five years, working with both architectures on projects ranging from image processing pipelines to Monte Carlo simulations, and my experience highlights key distinctions. The fundamental difference lies in the architectural philosophy. CUDA, being a proprietary Nvidia offering, benefits from tight vertical integration. Nvidia controls both the hardware and the software stack, resulting in optimized performance and a generally more mature development environment, though it limits compatibility to Nvidia GPUs. In contrast, AMD’s APP, while attempting to maintain openness and compatibility across platforms, has historically faced fragmentation and less streamlined developer tooling.

The programming models also diverge. CUDA relies on a C/C++-based language with extensions for parallel programming, exposing low-level details such as thread block organization, shared memory, and global memory management. This granularity allows skilled programmers to extract maximum performance, but also presents a steeper learning curve. APP, on the other hand, supports a broader range of programming languages and APIs, including OpenCL. OpenCL provides greater portability across different hardware vendors (CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators) but sometimes at the expense of fine-grained control and performance optimization achievable with CUDA’s tight hardware coupling. APP's specific support for its own proprietary language, CAL, has been less widely adopted due to the prevalence of OpenCL and CUDA.

Let me illustrate some practical differences with examples. Let's start with a basic vector addition operation. Here's a CUDA implementation:

```c++
// CUDA kernel for vector addition
__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

// Host code snippet (simplified for clarity)
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c; // Host arrays
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c; // Device arrays
  size_t size = n * sizeof(float);

  // Allocate memory, populate host arrays, etc.

  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size);

  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Free device memory
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);
}
```

In this example, the `__global__` keyword identifies the CUDA kernel, executed on the GPU. Thread indexing is explicitly managed with `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx`. Memory allocation and transfer functions like `cudaMalloc` and `cudaMemcpy` are also specific to the CUDA API.  This illustrates the explicit memory management and low-level control characteristic of CUDA.

Now, consider a similar operation with OpenCL, which can be used with AMD APP:

```c
// OpenCL kernel for vector addition (vectorAdd.cl file)
__kernel void vectorAdd(  __global const float *a,
                         __global const float *b,
                         __global       float *c,
                         const int n) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  if(i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}


// Host code snippet (simplified for clarity)
// ... OpenCL context setup omitted for brevity ...

cl_mem d_a = clCreateBuffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, size, NULL, &err);
cl_mem d_b = clCreateBuffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, size, NULL, &err);
cl_mem d_c = clCreateBuffer(context, CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY, size, NULL, &err);

clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, d_a, CL_TRUE, 0, size, h_a, 0, NULL, NULL);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, d_b, CL_TRUE, 0, size, h_b, 0, NULL, NULL);

cl_kernel kernel = clCreateKernel(program, "vectorAdd", &err);
clSetKernelArg(kernel, 0, sizeof(cl_mem), &d_a);
clSetKernelArg(kernel, 1, sizeof(cl_mem), &d_b);
clSetKernelArg(kernel, 2, sizeof(cl_mem), &d_c);
clSetKernelArg(kernel, 3, sizeof(int), &n);

size_t global_size[1] = {n};
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, kernel, 1, NULL, global_size, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);
clEnqueueReadBuffer(queue, d_c, CL_TRUE, 0, size, h_c, 0, NULL, NULL);

// Release OpenCL resources

```

Here, the OpenCL kernel is written in a separate `.cl` file and compiled at runtime. Instead of `blockIdx` and `threadIdx`, OpenCL uses `get_global_id(0)` to determine the thread’s index. OpenCL APIs for buffer creation (`clCreateBuffer`) and data transfers (`clEnqueueWriteBuffer`, `clEnqueueReadBuffer`) are different from CUDA counterparts. The host setup for OpenCL kernels is typically more verbose than for CUDA, often requiring platform discovery, context and command queue creation, and kernel compilation. This example demonstrates OpenCL’s more abstract approach. While potentially portable, it often introduces complexity in the setup phase.

Finally, a more complex example using image processing filters to highlight performance differences, although a full implementation is extensive.  Consider a simplified convolution operation. This example focuses on kernel invocation, not the algorithm itself, but differences in the setup and invocation of kernel functions would influence performance in a real application.

```c++
// CUDA kernel snippet for convolution
__global__ void convolution(const float *input, float *output, int width, int height, const float *kernel, int kernelSize) {
 int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
 int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

 if (x >= width || y >= height) return;

 float sum = 0.0f;
 int halfKernelSize = kernelSize / 2;
 for(int j = -halfKernelSize; j <= halfKernelSize; ++j) {
    for (int i = -halfKernelSize; i <= halfKernelSize; ++i) {
        int inX = x + i;
        int inY = y + j;
        if (inX >= 0 && inX < width && inY >= 0 && inY < height) {
          sum += input[inY * width + inX] * kernel[(j + halfKernelSize) * kernelSize + (i + halfKernelSize)];
         }
     }
 }

 output[y * width + x] = sum;
}


//Host CUDA code ... simplified
// ... Memory allocation, data transfers, kernel launch parameters,
// are handled similarly as before using cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, etc.

dim3 blockDim(16, 16);
dim3 gridDim((width + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x, (height + blockDim.y - 1) / blockDim.y);

convolution<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_input, d_output, width, height, d_kernel, kernelSize);

```

```c
// OpenCL kernel snippet for convolution
__kernel void convolution(  __global const float *input,
                           __global       float *output,
                           const int width,
                           const int height,
                           __global const float *kernel,
                           const int kernelSize) {

 int x = get_global_id(0);
 int y = get_global_id(1);

 if (x >= width || y >= height) return;

 float sum = 0.0f;
 int halfKernelSize = kernelSize / 2;

 for(int j = -halfKernelSize; j <= halfKernelSize; ++j) {
    for (int i = -halfKernelSize; i <= halfKernelSize; ++i) {
        int inX = x + i;
        int inY = y + j;

        if (inX >= 0 && inX < width && inY >= 0 && inY < height) {
             sum += input[inY * width + inX] * kernel[(j + halfKernelSize) * kernelSize + (i + halfKernelSize)];
        }
     }
 }
  output[y * width + x] = sum;

}

// Host OpenCL code ... simplified
// ... Platform, device, context, queue setup, buffer creation and data transfers are done with OpenCL APIs
// using clCreateBuffer, clEnqueueWriteBuffer, and clEnqueueReadBuffer

size_t global_size[2] = {width, height};
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, kernel, 2, NULL, global_size, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);


```

The CUDA version, due to Nvidia's control over hardware and software, often presents optimized performance, while OpenCL, targeting greater hardware diversity, can sometimes exhibit slightly lower performance.  In real-world scenarios, performance is critically influenced by the developer’s skill in optimizing memory access patterns, kernel launch configurations, and data layout, which is why I say that while the general purpose frameworks exist, expertise is still vital.

Regarding resources, for in-depth CUDA learning, I strongly recommend the official Nvidia CUDA Programming Guide. The book "CUDA by Example" provides practical insights and step-by-step examples. For OpenCL, the Khronos Group’s OpenCL specification document is indispensable, alongside “OpenCL Programming Guide” as a thorough learning resource. Several online repositories with sample codes for both platforms exist and are invaluable for hands-on experience, particularly when specific projects or hardware targets are considered.  Understanding underlying architecture is pivotal to effectively optimize for either environment, and careful consideration of intended deployment is paramount.
