When chaining neural network models, the failure of gradients to propagate from the second model back through the first indicates a disruption in the computational graph connecting the two. This primarily stems from how the output tensor of the first model is being treated within the second model’s forward pass – specifically, whether it’s properly included in the computation that builds the graph used for automatic differentiation. I've encountered this numerous times working with complex image processing pipelines involving separate feature extraction and downstream classification networks.

Essentially, backpropagation requires a continuous, differentiable path. If you use the output of Model A as an input to Model B, but that input is detached from Model A's computational graph, Model B’s loss will not influence Model A's parameters. The root cause is almost invariably unintentional detaching operations. These typically manifest as converting the output tensor to a non-tensor type or, less commonly, manually detaching the tensor via a specific function call.

Let’s examine this scenario in a practical context, using Python with a common deep learning framework: TensorFlow. I've replicated the described issue using simple, fabricated model architectures to better illustrate the behavior.

**Code Example 1: The Detachment Problem**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model A: Simple linear transformation
class ModelA(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ModelA, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, input_shape=(input_dim,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Model B: Another linear transformation
class ModelB(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ModelB, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, input_shape=(input_dim,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Generate Dummy Data
input_dim = 5
output_dim_a = 3
output_dim_b = 2
X = tf.random.normal((10, input_dim))
y = tf.random.normal((10, output_dim_b))

# Create Models
model_a = ModelA(input_dim, output_dim_a)
model_b = ModelB(output_dim_a, output_dim_b)

# Optimizer and Loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(50):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # Forward pass through Model A
        output_a = model_a(X)
        # Detachment! This is the problem point.
        output_a_detached = output_a.numpy()
        # Forward pass through Model B (using the detached output)
        output_b = model_b(output_a_detached)
        # Calculate loss for Model B
        loss = loss_fn(y, output_b)

    # Get gradients for Model B
    grads_b = tape.gradient(loss, model_b.trainable_variables)
    # Apply gradients to Model B
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads_b, model_b.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

In this example, `output_a.numpy()` detaches the tensor `output_a` from the computational graph. While Model B's parameters are updated by its computed loss, the parameters of Model A will remain unchanged during training because there’s no established link between the loss calculated in Model B and the tensors involved in the forward pass of Model A. The gradient tape isn't following the computation path into model A due to this detachment.

**Code Example 2: Correct Backpropagation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model A: Simple linear transformation
class ModelA(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ModelA, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, input_shape=(input_dim,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Model B: Another linear transformation
class ModelB(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ModelB, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, input_shape=(input_dim,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Generate Dummy Data
input_dim = 5
output_dim_a = 3
output_dim_b = 2
X = tf.random.normal((10, input_dim))
y = tf.random.normal((10, output_dim_b))

# Create Models
model_a = ModelA(input_dim, output_dim_a)
model_b = ModelB(output_dim_a, output_dim_b)

# Optimizer and Loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(50):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # Forward pass through Model A
        output_a = model_a(X)
        # Forward pass through Model B (using the output from Model A, intact)
        output_b = model_b(output_a)
        # Calculate loss for Model B
        loss = loss_fn(y, output_b)

    # Get gradients for both models
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model_a.trainable_variables + model_b.trainable_variables)
    # Apply gradients to both models
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model_a.trainable_variables + model_b.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, the essential change is using `output_a` directly as the input to Model B. The tensor remains a part of the computation graph, enabling the gradients to flow back to Model A. Both model's parameters are updated by the loss calculated in Model B. This shows a successful chaining of models.

**Code Example 3: Detachment via an Unintended Conversion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model A: Simple linear transformation
class ModelA(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ModelA, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, input_shape=(input_dim,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Model B: Another linear transformation
class ModelB(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ModelB, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, input_shape=(input_dim,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Generate Dummy Data
input_dim = 5
output_dim_a = 3
output_dim_b = 2
X = tf.random.normal((10, input_dim))
y = tf.random.normal((10, output_dim_b))

# Create Models
model_a = ModelA(input_dim, output_dim_a)
model_b = ModelB(output_dim_a, output_dim_b)

# Optimizer and Loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(50):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # Forward pass through Model A
        output_a = model_a(X)
        # Unintended Detachment by conversion
        output_a_converted = list(output_a.numpy())
        output_a_converted_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(output_a_converted, dtype=tf.float32)
        # Forward pass through Model B (using the detached output)
        output_b = model_b(output_a_converted_tensor)
        # Calculate loss for Model B
        loss = loss_fn(y, output_b)

    # Get gradients for Model B
    grads_b = tape.gradient(loss, model_b.trainable_variables)
    # Apply gradients to Model B
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads_b, model_b.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example showcases another, often less obvious, detachment pattern. Converting the tensor to a NumPy array, then to a Python list, and then back to a TensorFlow tensor using `tf.convert_to_tensor` breaks the link to the original tensor's computational path. The computational graph only captures computations performed with TensorFlow tensors, and not data type conversions between tensor objects and different data structures. This scenario results in the same issue with gradients failing to backpropagate to Model A.

In summary, the crux of the issue is preventing data conversion or detachment of the output tensor between the linked models. Maintaining the tensor object from one model as the input to the subsequent model and making sure it remains part of the computation graph is key for complete backpropagation.

For further study, I recommend reviewing the documentation related to automatic differentiation and gradient computations provided by your chosen framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Focus on sections explaining graph building, tensor tracking and manipulation, specifically how operations on tensors impact the computational graph. Also investigate examples that involve model chaining or multi-stage processes where gradient flow becomes more complex. Pay particular attention to common unintentional detachment situations – such as those arising from converting tensors to NumPy arrays or manipulating them using standard Python functions that aren’t aware of the automatic differentiation process. Careful inspection of your data processing during debugging is crucial to identify where unintended detachments may exist within your models.
