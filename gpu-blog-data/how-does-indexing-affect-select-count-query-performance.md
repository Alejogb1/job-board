My experience optimizing database performance across various projects, including large-scale e-commerce platforms, has repeatedly highlighted the profound impact of indexing, or the lack thereof, on `SELECT COUNT` queries. The performance differential can swing from sub-second to minutes, especially on tables with millions of records.

At its core, a `SELECT COUNT(*)` query without a `WHERE` clause must iterate over every row in a table to compute the total count. This is a full table scan. However, an index can drastically alter the execution path, allowing the database engine to bypass scanning the actual data pages. When a suitable index is in place, the count is retrieved from the index structure, which is typically smaller and faster to traverse than the main data table.

The index structures are optimized for data retrieval, often using B-tree or similar algorithms that store only the indexed columns and a pointer to the full row in the main data table. This means the index itself contains a record of how many entries are in the table. When a count query is issued, the database can read the number of entries directly from the index rather than needing to scan through the entirety of the table. This is especially true for clustered indexes on the primary key or unique constraints, as these often maintain an accurate row count at the root or upper levels of the B-tree structure.

However, the benefit of indexing is not automatic; several factors influence its effectiveness. First, the `COUNT` operation should not be accompanied by a `WHERE` clause that targets a non-indexed column. In that case, the index on a different column becomes less useful, requiring the database to still scan a large portion, if not the entirety of the table. Second, the type of index is also critical. While non-clustered indexes can improve `COUNT` performance in some scenarios, they may require additional lookups to the data table if the count needs to account for data within the columns not present in the index, impacting performance negatively, as the engine needs to look up the relevant records in the main table. Third, data modifications frequently require index maintenance. While indexing dramatically improves read performance, each insert, update, or delete operation might incur additional overhead because the index structures need to be adjusted. This impact of writing needs careful balancing in system design, as an excess number of indexes can hinder write speeds.

Below are three examples showcasing how indexing impacts `SELECT COUNT` performance, using SQL syntax as a reference point:

**Example 1: No Index**

```sql
-- Initial table creation (considerably large table)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Assume the 'orders' table now contains several million rows.

-- Query to get the total number of orders without a 'WHERE' clause:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```
**Commentary:** In this example, the query forces a full table scan as no relevant index exists for the simple `COUNT(*)`. The database engine has to read every row of the `orders` table. This operation becomes increasingly slow as the table size grows. I have seen this type of query take several minutes in a table with hundreds of millions of rows.

**Example 2: Clustered Index on Primary Key**

```sql
-- Initial table creation with Primary Key which is a clustered index
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(255),
  category_id INT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Assume the 'products' table now contains several million rows.

-- Query to get the total number of products
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;

```
**Commentary:** Here, the `product_id` column is defined as the primary key, which, in most relational databases, implicitly creates a clustered index. With the clustered index, the database engine can directly access the metadata associated with the clustered index, which, in most cases, stores a count of the total number of rows. This way, the database does not have to scan through every row of the table and returns a near-instantaneous count result.

**Example 3: Non-Clustered Index**
```sql
-- Initial table creation with a non-clustered index
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Assume the 'users' table now contains several million rows.

-- Create non clustered index on email column:
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);

-- Query to count users in table
SELECT COUNT(*) from users;
```

**Commentary:** In this example, we create a non-clustered index on the email column. While this index is useful for filtering queries on the `email` column it does not aid in speeding up this `COUNT` query. Even if there are no additional conditions specified, the database engine might choose to access the table directly or use the primary key index since the email index won't include any additional column that can help determine the overall number of rows without accessing the main table. The impact will be less severe than in Example 1 where there was no index present but there won't be the near instantaneous effect witnessed in example 2.

Several resources have been invaluable to my understanding of database indexing and their performance implications. Books such as "Database Internals" by Alex Petrov and "SQL Performance Explained" by Markus Winand provide a deep dive into the inner workings of database engines and how indexes are used. The official documentation of relational database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server, also offers comprehensive details on indexing strategies and best practices specific to each platform. Furthermore, online courses focused on database performance tuning often provide hands-on experience with practical techniques that include evaluating the impact of different indexing strategies for optimizing queries including `COUNT(*)`.

In summary, the impact of indexing on `SELECT COUNT` queries is substantial. A strategically placed index, particularly a clustered index on the primary key, can reduce execution time from minutes to milliseconds. Understanding the nuances of index types, their maintenance overhead, and the query patterns is vital for achieving optimal database performance. It's not merely about adding indexes, but intelligently selecting and using the right indexes to efficiently serve specific query needs, striking a balance between read performance improvements and the impact of data modifications.
