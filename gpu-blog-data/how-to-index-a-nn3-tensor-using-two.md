The core challenge in indexing a [n*n*3] tensor using two [n,n] tensors in PyTorch lies in efficiently translating two-dimensional spatial coordinates into the linear indices required for accessing elements within a flattened representation of a three-dimensional tensor.  My experience optimizing rendering pipelines in computer vision has frequently necessitated this type of indexing, particularly when dealing with per-pixel operations on image data represented as tensors.  Directly using the two [n,n] tensors as indices will not work without careful manipulation due to the dimensionality mismatch and PyTorch's indexing conventions.

The solution involves generating linear indices from the two spatial coordinate tensors and then utilizing these linear indices to access the desired elements in the [n*n*3] tensor.  This is accomplished through a combination of broadcasting and advanced indexing capabilities within PyTorch.  Inefficient approaches can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, particularly for large values of 'n'.  The optimal strategy focuses on minimizing redundant calculations and leveraging PyTorch's optimized backend for tensor operations.


**1. Clear Explanation**

Given a [n*n*3] tensor, representing, for example, an image with three color channels, and two [n,n] tensors representing row and column indices respectively, the goal is to access specific elements within the larger tensor.  Let's denote the [n*n*3] tensor as `tensor_3d`, and the row and column index tensors as `row_indices` and `col_indices`.  A naive approach would be to iterate through each element, but this is computationally expensive. The superior method exploits the inherent structure of the data.

First, we need to calculate the linear index for each element.  Assuming a row-major ordering (common in PyTorch), the linear index `i` for an element at row `r` and column `c` within a [n*n*3] tensor is given by:

`i = r * n * 3 + c * 3 + channel`

where `channel` is the channel index (0, 1, or 2 for RGB). We can vectorize this computation using broadcasting. We generate a tensor representing the channel indices, which will be broadcasted during the calculation.

Second, we use the resulting linear indices to access the elements in the `tensor_3d` tensor using advanced indexing. PyTorch allows direct access using these generated linear indices.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**


**Example 1: Basic Indexing**

This example demonstrates the core concept using explicit channel selection.  This approach is suitable for smaller tensors and readily demonstrates the underlying principle.

```python
import torch

n = 5
tensor_3d = torch.randn(n * n * 3)  # Flattened representation
row_indices = torch.randint(0, n, (n, n))
col_indices = torch.randint(0, n, (n, n))

# Explicitly loop through channels
for channel in range(3):
    linear_indices = row_indices * n * 3 + col_indices * 3 + channel
    selected_elements = tensor_3d[linear_indices.flatten()]
    print(f"Channel {channel}: {selected_elements}")
```

This code iterates through each channel, computes linear indices based on row, column and channel, and extracts the corresponding elements.  The `flatten()` method converts the 2D index tensors to 1D to match the flattened `tensor_3d`.


**Example 2: Vectorized Indexing with Broadcasting**

This improved example vectorizes the channel selection using broadcasting, thereby eliminating the explicit loop, leading to considerable performance gains for larger tensors.

```python
import torch

n = 100
tensor_3d = torch.randn(n * n * 3)
row_indices = torch.randint(0, n, (n, n))
col_indices = torch.randint(0, n, (n, n))

channel_indices = torch.arange(3).reshape(1, 1, 3) # Broadcasting tensor
linear_indices = row_indices[:, :, None] * n * 3 + col_indices[:, :, None] * 3 + channel_indices
selected_elements = tensor_3d[linear_indices.flatten()]
print(selected_elements.shape) # Output: torch.Size([15000])
```

Here, `channel_indices` is cleverly designed for broadcasting, allowing the linear index computation to occur simultaneously for all three channels. The `None` in `[:, :, None]` adds a new dimension for broadcasting compatibility. The result is a 3D tensor of linear indices.  Then we flatten it to match the shape of `tensor_3d`.


**Example 3: Reshaping for Improved Readability (Advanced)**

This example leverages reshaping to improve code readability and maintain explicit channel separation, although it involves slightly more operations compared to the fully vectorized approach.

```python
import torch

n = 200
tensor_3d = torch.randn(n, n, 3) # Reshaped for clarity; equivalent to n*n*3
row_indices = torch.randint(0, n, (n, n))
col_indices = torch.randint(0, n, (n, n))

#Advanced Indexing with reshaping
selected_elements = tensor_3d[row_indices, col_indices, :]
print(selected_elements.shape) # Output: torch.Size([200, 200, 3])

# Alternative access of flattened tensor
tensor_3d_flattened = tensor_3d.view(n*n, 3)
linear_indices = row_indices * n + col_indices
selected_elements_flattened = tensor_3d_flattened[linear_indices.flatten(), :]
print(selected_elements_flattened.shape) # Output: torch.Size([40000, 3])
```

This approach first performs advanced indexing directly on the 3D tensor before flattening, offering a potentially more intuitive way to achieve the desired selection. The alternative demonstrates how to perform indexing on a flattened tensor, requiring recalculation of linear indices.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections on tensor indexing and broadcasting, are crucial resources. Understanding NumPy's array indexing will also provide valuable context, as the underlying principles are largely similar.  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook covering matrix operations and vectorization would be beneficial for solidifying the mathematical foundations.  Finally, studying efficient data structure implementations, especially those related to sparse matrices, will enhance your understanding of optimizing memory access patterns for similar tasks.
