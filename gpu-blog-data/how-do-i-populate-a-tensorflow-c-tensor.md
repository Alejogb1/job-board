Tensor population in TensorFlow's C++ API hinges on understanding the underlying memory management and data types.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models for embedded systems highlighted the critical need for efficient tensor creation and population; inefficient methods can significantly impact performance and memory consumption.  The key is selecting the appropriate allocation method and employing optimized data transfer techniques, depending on the source of your data.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's C++ API offers several ways to populate a tensor. The choice depends primarily on the data source:  directly from C++ arrays, from existing TensorFlow tensors, or from file-based data.  Regardless of the method, understanding the tensor's data type (`DT_FLOAT`, `DT_INT32`, etc.) and shape is paramount. Incorrect type specifications will result in runtime errors or unexpected behavior.  Memory management is another crucial aspect; you must handle memory allocation and deallocation correctly to avoid memory leaks and segmentation faults. For large tensors, consider using efficient memory allocation techniques like `aligned_alloc` to improve cache utilization.  Finally,  for performance-critical applications, direct memory copies using `memcpy` are often faster than iterative element-wise assignments.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Populating from a C++ array:**

```c++
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
#include <tensorflow/core/public/tensor.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Define the tensor shape
  tensorflow::TensorShape shape({3, 2});

  // Allocate a tensor of floats
  tensorflow::Tensor tensor(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, shape);

  // Access the tensor data as a flat array
  auto tensor_data = tensor.flat<float>().data();

  // Populate the tensor with data from a C++ array
  float data[] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f};
  memcpy(tensor_data, data, sizeof(data));

  // Print the tensor contents (for verification)
  std::cout << "Tensor contents:\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < tensor.NumElements(); ++i) {
    std::cout << tensor.flat<float>()(i) << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the most direct method: creating a tensor and then copying data from a pre-existing C++ array using `memcpy`. This is highly efficient for large datasets.  Error handling (e.g., checking for successful allocation) is omitted for brevity but is crucial in production code. The `flat<float>()` method provides a convenient way to access the tensor data as a contiguous array.

**Example 2: Populating from another Tensor:**

```c++
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
#include <tensorflow/core/public/tensor.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Create a source tensor
  tensorflow::TensorShape source_shape({2, 2});
  tensorflow::Tensor source_tensor(tensorflow::DT_INT32, source_shape);
  auto source_data = source_tensor.flat<int32>().data();
  int source_array[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
  memcpy(source_data, source_array, sizeof(source_array));

  // Create a destination tensor with a different shape (broadcasting will be handled)
  tensorflow::TensorShape dest_shape({4, 1});
  tensorflow::Tensor dest_tensor(tensorflow::DT_INT32, dest_shape);

  // Copy data from source to destination.  Requires manual element-wise copy as shapes differ.  Alternatively, TensorFlow operations can handle this more efficiently.
  for (int i = 0; i < source_tensor.NumElements(); ++i) {
      dest_tensor.flat<int32>()(i) = source_tensor.flat<int32>()(i);
  }

  // Print the destination tensor contents
  std::cout << "Destination Tensor contents:\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < dest_tensor.NumElements(); ++i) {
    std::cout << dest_tensor.flat<int32>()(i) << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This illustrates populating a tensor from an existing tensor. Note the explicit looping for element-wise copying when the shapes do not match perfectly.  More sophisticated operations within the TensorFlow graph itself (e.g., `tf::ops::Reshape`) are generally preferred for reshaping and data manipulation within a TensorFlow computation graph for performance reasons.  Direct copying is shown here for illustrative purposes only; it's generally less efficient than using TensorFlow's built-in operations for larger tensors.

**Example 3:  Partial Population and Updating:**

```c++
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
#include <tensorflow/core/public/tensor.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  tensorflow::TensorShape shape({3, 3});
  tensorflow::Tensor tensor(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, shape);
  auto tensor_data = tensor.tensor<float, 2>();

  // Initialize a portion of the tensor
  tensor_data(0, 0) = 1.0f;
  tensor_data(0, 1) = 2.0f;
  tensor_data(1, 0) = 3.0f;


  // Update a specific element later
  tensor_data(2,2) = 9.0f;

  // Print the tensor. Note that uninitialized elements will contain garbage values.
  std::cout << "Tensor contents:\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < tensor.NumElements(); ++i) {
    std::cout << tensor.flat<float>()(i) << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

```

This example demonstrates the ability to partially populate a tensor and update individual elements later.  Direct access using `tensor<float, 2>()` provides a multi-dimensional view.  However, note that only initialized elements will contain valid values; uninitialized elements will have unpredictable contents.  For larger tensors, a more structured approach is necessary to avoid this issue.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow C++ API documentation.  A comprehensive book on TensorFlow internals and optimization techniques, focusing on C++ usage. A well-structured tutorial focusing on memory management in C++.  Thorough exploration of the TensorFlow documentation pertaining to `TensorShape`, `Tensor`, and related classes is recommended.


Remember that efficient tensor population is crucial for performance in TensorFlow C++.  Choosing the appropriate method, handling memory carefully, and leveraging TensorFlow's internal operations will significantly improve the speed and stability of your applications. My experience working with TensorFlow in resource-constrained environments underscores the importance of these considerations.  Furthermore, profiling your code to identify bottlenecks is an essential part of optimization.
