Adding a column with a check constraint that references existing columns in a SQL table requires careful consideration of the data already present in the table. Specifically, the existing data must satisfy the conditions defined by the check constraint or the operation will fail. I've encountered this exact scenario several times during database schema migrations, often requiring a multi-step approach to avoid data loss or corruption.

The fundamental issue is that SQL checks all data against the constraint at the time of the column addition. If your existing data violates the planned constraint, the `ALTER TABLE` statement will not execute successfully. Consequently, you cannot simply add the column and the constraint simultaneously in a single step if data inconsistencies exist. The general approach involves a preparatory phase of data cleaning followed by the actual column and constraint addition. I've found it best to handle these tasks separately, rather than attempting complex, potentially risky, compound statements.

Let's examine a typical situation where we need to add a `discount_percentage` column to an `orders` table, where `discount_percentage` must be less than or equal to `100` and only applied when `order_status` is 'completed'. The table already has columns `order_id`, `order_status`, and possibly others. Here's how I approach this problem.

**Phase 1: Data Analysis and Preparation**

Before modifying the table structure, it’s crucial to analyze the existing data and identify potential conflicts. In this case, we need to check for any existing rows where the `order_status` is 'completed' but the intended `discount_percentage` (if a default value of 0 is to be assigned) might cause a conflict.

**Phase 2: Adding the Column Without Constraint**

The first step is to add the new column, typically with a default value, *without* the constraint. I prefer this approach because it separates the column creation from the constraint logic, allowing us to manipulate data as needed before the constraint enforcement.

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN discount_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0;

-- Explanation:
-- This SQL statement adds a new column named `discount_percentage` to the `orders` table.
-- The data type is `DECIMAL(5,2)` which allows storing values with two decimal places, sufficient for percentages.
-- A default value of 0 is applied to all existing rows.
-- This operation should execute without issues assuming no column with this name exists previously.
```

This statement introduces the new column without imposing any restrictions. Now, I can proceed to update the column based on the existing data without fear of a constraint violation.

**Phase 3: Updating the Data Based on Existing Columns**

Following the column addition, update the newly added column if necessary. This is where data migration and conditioning occur. In our context, this means to update any completed orders where a non-zero `discount_percentage` should be applied.

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET discount_percentage = 10
WHERE order_status = 'completed';

-- Explanation:
-- This statement updates the `discount_percentage` column for all rows where `order_status` is 'completed'.
--  In this instance, a 10% discount is applied, however, this is a scenario based action and may be conditional.
-- This update should be specific to the business rules, and other criteria such as order value may dictate the discount.
-- The key point is to modify the new column to reflect business logic before the constraint.
```
The data modification needs to conform to business rules, and careful thought must be given before implementation. After the data is updated and valid, we can then introduce the check constraint.

**Phase 4: Adding the Check Constraint**

With all data now conforming to the anticipated constraint, the final step involves adding the check constraint. This guarantees all new data will adhere to the same rules while all existing data is also in compliance.

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_discount_percentage
CHECK (discount_percentage <= 100 AND (order_status <> 'completed' OR discount_percentage >= 0));

-- Explanation:
-- This SQL statement adds a check constraint named `chk_discount_percentage` to the `orders` table.
-- The constraint ensures that `discount_percentage` must be less than or equal to 100.
-- It also enforces that, when `order_status` is 'completed', the `discount_percentage` should be greater or equal to 0.
--  This constraint now enforces data integrity, ensuring that new data follows these rules, while the updated data already adheres to these restrictions.
```
This statement finalizes the process. Now, any attempt to insert or update rows that violate the constraint will be rejected by the database. The constraint has been applied only after confirming the existing data met its conditions, as well as future data.

**Example Scenarios**

Consider a more complex scenario where an order may be put ‘on hold’ and when on hold, the discount percentage must be zero. This needs to be incorporated into both data update and check constraint steps.

```sql
-- Data Update
UPDATE orders
SET discount_percentage = 0
WHERE order_status = 'on hold';
-- Constraint Addition
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_discount_percentage
CHECK (discount_percentage <= 100 AND ((order_status <> 'completed' AND order_status <> 'on hold') OR (order_status = 'completed' AND discount_percentage >= 0) OR (order_status = 'on hold' AND discount_percentage = 0)));

```
In this modified check constraint, it enforces that discount_percentage is 0 when the order_status is 'on hold.' This shows how the check constraint can combine various existing data points in its logic.

Another example, imagine we want to constrain dates so that a shipment date cannot be prior to an order date, which can be complex with timezones or when order date is nullable.

```sql
-- Data Update
UPDATE orders
SET shipment_date = order_date
WHERE shipment_date is NULL or shipment_date < order_date;

-- Constraint Addition
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_shipment_date
CHECK (shipment_date IS NULL OR (order_date IS NOT NULL AND shipment_date >= order_date));
```

Here we have handled a nullable order date, and only apply a check if an order date is present and a shipment date is supplied. This example illustrates the nuances of combining nullable columns with check constraints.

**Resource Recommendations**

For detailed information on SQL constraints, I recommend consulting resources that focus on database normalization and schema design principles. Texts on relational database theory provide fundamental concepts of constraint management. Additionally, specific documentation pertaining to the database system you use, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or Oracle, will contain precise details about syntax and behavior of constraints in that environment. Online resources from reputable database training companies are also a good avenue to explore. Focusing on principles of referential integrity and data modeling enhances comprehension of the appropriate application of constraints. Remember to always test schema modifications on a development or testing database before implementing them in production.
