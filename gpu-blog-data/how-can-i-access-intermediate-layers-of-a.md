Accessing intermediate layers in a TensorFlow CNN model requires a nuanced understanding of the model's architecture and the TensorFlow API.  My experience debugging complex image recognition pipelines for autonomous vehicle applications has highlighted the critical need for this capability, particularly in scenarios demanding feature visualization or transfer learning.  Simply put, direct access isn't readily available; rather, it necessitates leveraging TensorFlow's functional API or employing a custom layer.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's sequential API, while convenient for building simple models, obscures the internal layer connections.  This makes accessing intermediate activations challenging.  The functional API, however, offers the granularity required.  It allows the explicit definition of a model's structure, specifying inputs and outputs for each layer.  This explicit definition enables the retrieval of activations from any layer within the network.  Alternatively, creating a custom layer allows for integrating custom functionality, including the specific extraction of intermediate representations. This approach is particularly valuable when needing to perform operations on these activations before passing them further down the network.

The key to accessing intermediate layers lies in understanding that a TensorFlow model, regardless of its creation method, ultimately represents a computational graph.  Each layer is a node in this graph, and the activations are the data flowing between these nodes.  To access an intermediate layer, we effectively tap into this data flow at the desired node. This often involves constructing a new model that shares weights with the original but selectively outputs the activations of interest.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accessing Intermediate Layers using the Functional API:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model using the functional API
input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv1)
conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(pool1)
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv2)
dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense)

# Access intermediate layer outputs
intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=conv2)

# Get activations for a sample input
sample_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))
intermediate_activations = intermediate_layer_model(sample_input)

print(intermediate_activations.shape)
```

This example demonstrates how the functional API allows the creation of a new model (`intermediate_layer_model`) that uses the input of the original model and outputs the activations of `conv2`.  This new model effectively extracts the desired intermediate layer's output.


**Example 2: Accessing Intermediate Layers using a Custom Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class IntermediateLayerGetter(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, layer_name):
        super(IntermediateLayerGetter, self).__init__()
        self.layer_name = layer_name

    def call(self, inputs):
        intermediate_layer = self.layer_name
        return intermediate_layer(inputs)


# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Access intermediate layer (assuming layer name is 'conv2d_1')
intermediate_layer_output = IntermediateLayerGetter(model.layers[2])

# Get activations for a sample input
sample_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))
intermediate_activations = intermediate_layer_output(sample_input)

print(intermediate_activations.shape)
```

This example showcases a custom layer (`IntermediateLayerGetter`) that dynamically selects and returns the output of a specified layer within a sequential model. Note that accessing layers by index requires knowing the exact layer's position within the sequential model. This approach offers flexibility for complex scenarios, such as conditionally accessing different layers based on runtime conditions.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Intermediate Layer Outputs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model using the functional API
input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv1)
conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(pool1)
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv2)
dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense)

# Access multiple intermediate layer outputs
intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=[conv1, conv2])

# Get activations for a sample input
sample_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))
activations = intermediate_model(sample_input)

print(activations[0].shape) # Output shape of conv1
print(activations[1].shape) # Output shape of conv2

```

This illustrates how to retrieve activations from multiple intermediate layers simultaneously by specifying them as outputs in the new model. This is particularly useful for comparative analysis or when multiple intermediate representations are required for downstream tasks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a focus on TensorFlow's practical applications;  publications focusing on convolutional neural network architectures and feature extraction techniques.  These resources offer in-depth explanations and diverse perspectives on the subject, enhancing one's understanding beyond the scope of these code examples.  Furthermore, examining open-source code repositories containing well-documented CNN implementations can provide invaluable practical insights.
