TensorBoard's inherent design doesn't directly support merging existing log directories into a single, unified visualization.  This stems from the fundamentally sequential nature of TensorFlow's event file writing: each log directory represents a distinct training run or experiment, preserving its individual metadata and timestamping.  Attempting a naive concatenation of the underlying event files will almost certainly lead to inconsistencies and rendering errors within TensorBoard.  My experience working on large-scale distributed training projects at Xylos Corp. underscored this limitation repeatedly.  We needed to devise robust strategies to manage and compare results across numerous parallel runs.

The solution hinges on constructing a summary of relevant data from individual log directories and then feeding this aggregated information into a fresh TensorBoard run.  This requires careful consideration of the desired metrics and a strategy for resolving potential naming conflicts.  We employed three distinct approaches at Xylos Corp., each tailored to different needs.

**1.  Manual Aggregation and Custom Scripting:**

This method offers the most control and is ideal when dealing with a small number of log directories and specific metrics of interest.  The core idea involves parsing each log directory's event files, extracting the desired scalar summaries (e.g., loss, accuracy), and writing these into a new set of event files representing the combined data.  This requires familiarity with the TensorFlow `Summary` protocol buffer and potentially using libraries like `protobuf` to handle the file parsing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
from google.protobuf import text_format
from tensorflow.core.util import event_pb2

def aggregate_logs(log_dirs, output_dir, metrics):
    """Aggregates scalar summaries from multiple log directories.

    Args:
        log_dirs: A list of paths to log directories.
        output_dir: The path to the directory where the aggregated log will be written.
        metrics: A list of metric names to aggregate.
    """

    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.makedirs(output_dir)

    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(output_dir)

    for log_dir in log_dirs:
        for event_file in os.listdir(log_dir):
            if event_file.endswith(".tfevents"):
                full_path = os.path.join(log_dir, event_file)
                for event in tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(full_path):
                    if event.summary is not None:
                        for value in event.summary.value:
                            if value.tag in metrics:
                                summary = tf.Summary()
                                summary.value.add(tag=value.tag, simple_value=value.simple_value)
                                writer.add_summary(summary, event.step)

    writer.close()

# Example usage
log_directories = ["run1", "run2", "run3"]
output_directory = "aggregated_log"
metrics_to_aggregate = ["loss", "accuracy"]
aggregate_logs(log_directories, output_directory, metrics_to_aggregate)
```

This script iterates through specified log directories, identifies `.tfevents` files, reads events using `tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator`, extracts specified metrics from `event.summary.value`, and writes them into a new summary using `tf.summary.FileWriter`.  Error handling (e.g., for missing files or invalid event formats) is crucial in a production environment, which this example omits for brevity.


**2.  TensorBoard's `--logdir` Flag with Multiple Directories:**

TensorBoard inherently supports visualizing multiple log directories simultaneously using its command-line interface. This avoids data manipulation but presents the data in separate panels, not a merged visualization.  This is a quick solution for comparative analysis, but doesn't technically merge the logs.

```bash
tensorboard --logdir run1:run1_description,run2:run2_description,run3:run3_description
```

This command launches TensorBoard, displaying data from `run1`, `run2`, and `run3` as separate runs, each with an optional description.  The colon separates the log directory path from an optional description.


**3.  Data Preprocessing and Re-training:**

This approach involves loading the model weights and training data from each individual run. This allows recalculation and logging of the metrics within a unified training process. This method is computationally more expensive but offers the most flexibility and allows for consistency in metrics.


```python
#  Illustrative snippet - assumes access to model weights and training data from each run.
import tensorflow as tf

def retrain_and_aggregate(models, data, output_dir):
    # ... Load models and data ...  (This part requires significant code dependent on your specific model and data)
    #  Example:  model1 = tf.keras.models.load_model('run1/model.h5')
    #             data1 = load_data('run1/data.npy')

    # ... Combine models or data appropriately ... (e.g., average weights, concatenate datasets)

    # ... Retrain (or just evaluate) and log results to output_dir ...
    # Example: tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=output_dir)
    #           model.fit(combined_data, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```


This third approach requires substantially more code tailored to the specific model architecture and data format used in the original experiments. The example above is a highly simplified sketch;  robust error handling and considerations for data consistency are essential for a production-ready implementation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on `tf.summary`, `tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator`, and `tf.summary.FileWriter`.  The Protobuf documentation for understanding the event file format.  A general understanding of Python scripting and command-line interfaces.  Thorough familiarity with data structures and manipulation techniques relevant to your data format is crucial for the third approach.  For large-scale operations, explore parallel processing libraries like multiprocessing or Dask.
