TensorFlow's failure to record validation loss and accuracy during training stems most frequently from an incorrect configuration of the `model.fit` method, specifically concerning the `validation_data` argument.  Over the course of my ten years developing and deploying machine learning models, this has been the single most common source of this specific issue.  The problem isn't necessarily a bug within TensorFlow itself, but rather a misunderstanding of how the validation process is integrated into the training pipeline.  Properly specifying the validation data is crucial; otherwise, the framework simply won't have the data it needs to compute these metrics.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `model.fit` function in TensorFlow/Keras accepts several arguments, including `x`, `y`, `batch_size`, `epochs`, and critically, `validation_data`. The `x` and `y` arguments represent the training data and labels respectively.  The `validation_data` argument, however, is where the problem usually originates.  It expects a tuple of NumPy arrays or a TensorFlow `Dataset` object.  This tuple must contain the validation data and corresponding validation labels.  If this argument is missing, or if it contains incorrectly formatted data, TensorFlow will proceed with training but will not calculate and report validation metrics.  Furthermore, the data types and shapes of your validation data must strictly match the training data – inconsistencies here will lead to silent failure.  A common error is supplying validation data with a different number of features than the training data.

Another less frequent, yet equally crucial point, involves the use of custom callbacks. If you are using custom callbacks for monitoring metrics or performing early stopping, these callbacks also need to be correctly configured to access and utilize the validation data provided during training. An incorrectly implemented custom callback could inadvertently override or prevent the recording of validation metrics, even if the `validation_data` argument is correctly specified.  Finally, ensuring that your data preprocessing steps are applied consistently to both training and validation sets is essential. A mismatch in preprocessing can lead to unexpected behavior and inaccurate metric calculations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
x_val = np.random.rand(20, 10)
y_val = np.random.randint(0, 2, 20)

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with validation data
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32,
                    validation_data=(x_val, y_val))

# Access validation metrics
print(history.history['val_loss'])
print(history.history['val_accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage of `validation_data`. The `x_val` and `y_val` arrays are explicitly provided, ensuring TensorFlow calculates and records validation loss and accuracy. The `history` object then provides access to these metrics after training.


**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation (Missing `validation_data`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (Data generation and model definition as in Example 1) ...

# Train the model WITHOUT validation data
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Attempting to access validation metrics will result in a KeyError or empty list
try:
  print(history.history['val_loss'])
  print(history.history['val_accuracy'])
except KeyError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}. Validation metrics not recorded.")
```

This showcases a common error.  Omitting `validation_data` prevents TensorFlow from computing validation metrics.  Attempting to access them after training will raise a `KeyError` because these keys are simply not present in the `history` dictionary.


**Example 3: Incorrect Implementation (Data Shape Mismatch)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (Data generation and model definition as in Example 1) ...

# Introduce a shape mismatch in validation data
x_val_incorrect = np.random.rand(20, 11) # Incorrect number of features
y_val_incorrect = np.random.randint(0, 2, 20)

# Train the model with incorrectly shaped validation data
try:
  history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_val_incorrect, y_val_incorrect))
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}. Validation data shape mismatch.")
```

This example highlights the importance of data consistency. A shape mismatch between training and validation data will raise a `ValueError` during the `model.fit` call, preventing training and metric calculation.  The error message will usually clearly indicate the source of the problem – the incompatibility between input shapes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on the `model.fit` function and the handling of datasets. Carefully reviewing the error messages TensorFlow provides during training is critical;  they often pinpoint the exact location and nature of the problem. Additionally, thoroughly examining the shapes and data types of your training and validation datasets using NumPy's array inspection functions is invaluable for preventing shape mismatches.  Familiarity with Keras callbacks and their proper configuration is also important for advanced monitoring and control over the training process.  Finally, a strong understanding of fundamental data structures and manipulation techniques in Python is essential for data preprocessing and ensuring data consistency.
