The core challenge in selecting elements from a tensor using varying column indices per row lies in efficiently broadcasting the row-specific index information across the tensor's dimensions.  My experience working on large-scale geophysical simulations frequently presented this exact problem, particularly when dealing with irregularly sampled data represented as tensors.  Direct indexing using nested loops is computationally expensive and scales poorly. The optimal solution leverages advanced indexing techniques provided by modern tensor libraries, specifically NumPy in Python.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem necessitates mapping each row of the input tensor to a unique set of column indices.  This mapping can be represented as an index array, where each row in this array corresponds to the column indices for the respective row in the input tensor.  Let's define the input tensor as `A`, with shape (R, C), representing R rows and C columns.  The index array, denoted as `I`, will have a shape (R, N), where N represents the number of elements to select from each row. The values within `I` are the column indices to select from `A`.  The output tensor, `B`, will have a shape (R, N).

The key is to avoid explicit looping. Instead, we use advanced indexing, leveraging NumPy's ability to handle multi-dimensional arrays as indexers. We achieve this by combining row indices with the column indices from `I`. The row indices are generated using NumPy's `arange` function, creating a vector [0, 1, 2, ..., R-1].  This vector, when combined with `I` using broadcasting rules, generates the correct indices for advanced indexing into `A`.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Selection**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input tensor
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
              [5, 6, 7, 8],
              [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Index array: select the 1st and 3rd columns for each row
I = np.array([[0, 2],
              [0, 2],
              [1, 3]])

# Generate row indices
row_indices = np.arange(A.shape[0])

# Advanced indexing
B = A[row_indices[:, None], I]

# Output tensor
print(B)  # Output: [[ 1  3]
          #         [ 5  7]
          #         [10 12]]
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental principle. `row_indices[:, None]` reshapes the row indices to (R, 1), enabling broadcasting with `I` (R, N), resulting in a (R, N) index array that correctly selects elements.

**Example 2: Handling Out-of-Bounds Indices**

During simulations, it's possible to generate column indices that exceed the bounds of the input tensor's columns.  To handle this gracefully, we introduce error handling.

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

I = np.array([[0, 2],
              [1, 3],  # Index 3 is out of bounds
              [2, 1]])

row_indices = np.arange(A.shape[0])

try:
    B = A[row_indices[:, None], I]
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"IndexError: {e}")
    # Implement alternative handling, e.g., clipping indices or filling with default values
    I = np.clip(I, 0, A.shape[1] -1) #Clip to valid indices
    B = A[row_indices[:, None], I]
    print("Result after handling out-of-bounds indices:")
    print(B)


```

This example showcases error trapping and a straightforward method to handle out-of-bounds indices by clipping them to the valid range.  More sophisticated error handling might involve replacing out-of-bounds indices with NaN values or employing a custom filling strategy depending on the specific application.

**Example 3:  Variable Number of Indices per Row**

In some situations, the number of indices per row might vary.  This requires a more flexible approach. While advanced indexing directly doesn't support this, we can utilize masked arrays or list comprehension for a flexible solution.

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
              [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
              [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]])

#Irregular indices: different number of indices per row
I = [np.array([0, 2]), np.array([1, 3, 4]), np.array([0])]

B = np.array([A[i, indices] for i, indices in enumerate(I)])

print(B) #Output: [[ 1  3]
          #         [ 7  9 10]
          #         [11]]

# Handling inconsistent shapes (Padding with NaN for consistent output shape)

max_len = max(len(x) for x in I)
padded_B = np.full((len(I), max_len), np.nan)
for i, indices in enumerate(I):
    padded_B[i, :len(indices)] = A[i, indices]
print("\nPadded Output:")
print(padded_B)


```
This example utilizes list comprehension to handle the variable length of indices. The second part demonstrates padding the output with NaN values to obtain a consistent shape for further processing.  The choice of padding values (NaN, 0, etc.) depends on the downstream processing steps.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of NumPy's array indexing and broadcasting, I recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation and exploring advanced indexing examples in relevant textbooks on scientific computing with Python.  Understanding linear algebra principles, particularly matrix operations, is also beneficial.  Finally, practice is paramount; working through numerous examples involving varying tensor dimensions and index configurations will solidify your understanding.
