The core challenge when converting TensorFlow models to ONNX and subsequently controlling their output lies in understanding the inherent differences between TensorFlow's dynamic graph execution and ONNX's static graph representation. Specifically, TensorFlow often leverages graph optimizations and implicit shape inference that are not directly mirrored in the ONNX specification. This discrepancy requires careful management of input/output node naming and, crucially, the explicit definition of shape and data types. My experience debugging a complex object detection model migration to edge devices revealed these nuances firsthand.

Let’s break down how output control is achieved. Fundamentally, ONNX model outputs are dictated by the nodes that are marked as terminal in the computation graph. When a TensorFlow model is converted, the converter typically identifies the final operations leading to the user-defined outputs. However, during this process, the output names may be altered or the output tensors may be unintentionally optimized away if the conversion settings aren’t explicitly configured. Furthermore, intermediate tensors that could be beneficial to retrieve later are usually ignored by the converter.

Controlling output during conversion therefore hinges on three critical aspects: 1) **explicitly specifying output node names** during the conversion process, 2) **verifying the data type and shape** of the output tensors in the generated ONNX model, and 3) **potentially manipulating the TensorFlow graph** before conversion to expose desired output tensors.

First, regarding specifying output node names, many conversion tools—such as the `tf2onnx` Python package—provide command-line arguments or function parameters to designate which TensorFlow tensors should be mapped as ONNX outputs. These output node names should correspond to the names of specific TensorFlow operations. Without explicitly specifying these names, the converter may select different nodes for its outputs than are intended. This often leads to output tensors with unpredictable shapes or contents. During a prior project involving a multi-task learning model, neglecting explicit output naming resulted in the ONNX output containing intermediate feature maps rather than the intended final classification and bounding box regression outputs. We resolved it by meticulous tracking of the output nodes in the tensorflow graph and then using those names in the conversion.

Next, verifying data type and shape is essential because ONNX requires explicit definition, unlike TensorFlow's often implicit behavior. Often, type mismatches between TensorFlow and ONNX arise subtly when the default conversion behavior is used. This can cause errors during inference execution in the targeted ONNX runtime. To address this, it’s crucial to examine the output node definitions in the generated ONNX model, usually through visualization tools like Netron. These tools show the type and shape attached to each ONNX tensor. If discrepancies are discovered, the appropriate TensorFlow operation that leads to the problematic output should be investigated. In some cases, a data type conversion operation (e.g., `tf.cast`) may need to be inserted into the TensorFlow graph prior to conversion.

Finally, manipulating the TensorFlow graph prior to conversion can be used as a strategy when neither of the previous approaches suffice. For example, in some circumstances, an intermediate tensor is desired for custom post processing or debugging purposes. By using tensorflow operations like `tf.identity` you can create named tensors that the conversion tool will treat like outputs. You should place this operation after the layer you want to have the tensor as output, and then name the new identity tensor appropriately, this makes explicit the tensors that should be converted to outputs and allows to use the named tensor later.

Let's illustrate with three code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Output Specification with `tf2onnx`**

The following example demonstrates how to use the `tf2onnx` Python package to specify the output node names during a conversion. The `output_names` argument dictates what output tensors will exist in the resulting onnx model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tf2onnx
import numpy as np

# Sample TensorFlow model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
input_spec = tf.TensorSpec((1, 20), tf.float32)
model_input = tf.random.normal((1, 20))

# Obtain output node name from the model (careful because the name could change)
# It's better if the output operation has a defined name for the conversion
output_node_name = model.layers[-1].output.name.split(':')[0]

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model, _ = tf2onnx.convert.from_keras(
    model,
    input_signature=[input_spec],
    output_path="simple_model.onnx",
    output_names=[output_node_name]
)

print(f"Onnx output node name: {onnx_model.graph.output[0].name}")

```

In this example, the TensorFlow model is a simple two-layer neural network. The `output_node_name` variable extracts the name of the last layer and uses that as the output for the ONNX model during conversion. This ensures the final output of the model is the one exposed. This code shows the most basic way to specify outputs, however it requires knowledge of the tensorflow model graph.

**Example 2: Verifying Data Type and Shape**

This example uses Netron to visually inspect the produced model. If the produced model had inconsistencies between the desired and observed output, you can use the following approach. Assume that the previous example was run and the output of the onnx model had an issue related to the type. To correct it we can add a cast operation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tf2onnx
import numpy as np

# Sample TensorFlow model (with potential type issues)
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax', dtype=tf.float64)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        x = tf.cast(self.dense2(x), dtype=tf.float32) # Adding type cast
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
input_spec = tf.TensorSpec((1, 20), tf.float32)
model_input = tf.random.normal((1, 20))

# Obtain output node name from the model
output_node_name = model.layers[-1].output.name.split(':')[0]

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model, _ = tf2onnx.convert.from_keras(
    model,
    input_signature=[input_spec],
    output_path="simple_model_cast.onnx",
    output_names=[output_node_name]
)

print(f"Onnx output node name: {onnx_model.graph.output[0].name}")
```

In this revised code, the second dense layer has the datatype `tf.float64` which could cause issues when it is converted to ONNX. By adding an explicit cast to `tf.float32`, we make sure the type on the onnx model is the correct one, this is a common technique when you encounter this type of issues. After conversion, inspection with Netron would reveal the explicit `float32` type of the output.

**Example 3: Manipulating the Graph for Intermediate Outputs**

The following example demonstrates how to use `tf.identity` to expose intermediate tensors as outputs. This is done to get a specific tensor of a model for debugging purposes or for custom processing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tf2onnx
import numpy as np

# Sample TensorFlow model (with desired intermediate output)
class ComplexModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
        self.max_pool = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(2, 2)
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        intermediate_output = tf.identity(x, name="conv_output") # Create named tensor
        x = self.max_pool(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x, intermediate_output

model = ComplexModel()
input_spec = tf.TensorSpec((1, 32, 32, 3), tf.float32)
model_input = tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 3))
# Obtain output node names from the model
final_output_node_name = model.layers[-1].output[0].name.split(':')[0]
intermediate_output_node_name = model(model_input)[1].name.split(':')[0]

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model, _ = tf2onnx.convert.from_keras(
    model,
    input_signature=[input_spec],
    output_path="complex_model.onnx",
    output_names=[final_output_node_name, intermediate_output_node_name]
)
print(f"Onnx output node names: {[output.name for output in onnx_model.graph.output]}")
```

In this example, the convolutional layer output, named `conv_output` is added as an extra output tensor by using `tf.identity` operation. During conversion, we specify both the final model output and the intermediate `conv_output` tensor as the outputs of the ONNX model. This is an important strategy if there is the need to inspect the tensors within the model.

Regarding resources, I would suggest consulting the documentation of `tf2onnx`, the ONNX specification documentation available on the official ONNX website, and TensorFlow documentation related to graph operations. Furthermore, having a good understanding of graph visualization tools, such as Netron, is paramount for identifying and debugging conversion issues. There is also great information on the pytorch and onnx github repositories about the specifics of conversion tools and techniques that are valuable for gaining insights about conversion in general.
