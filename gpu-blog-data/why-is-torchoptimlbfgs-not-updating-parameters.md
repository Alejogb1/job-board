The failure of `torch.optim.LBFGS()` to update parameters often stems from a subtle interplay between the optimizer's line search strategy and the characteristics of the loss function landscape.  My experience debugging similar issues over the years – particularly during development of a Bayesian optimization library – has highlighted the importance of carefully considering several factors, including numerical stability, gradient calculation accuracy, and the choice of function tolerances.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`torch.optim.LBFGS()` is a limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm. Unlike first-order optimizers like SGD, LBFGS uses second-order information (Hessian approximations) to guide the search for minima.  This necessitates more stringent conditions for successful updates.  The core issue behind stalled parameters is frequently a failure of the line search to find a suitable step size that satisfies the Wolfe conditions (or similar criteria used internally by the optimizer).  These conditions ensure sufficient decrease in the objective function and an appropriate level of curvature.  If the line search repeatedly fails to satisfy these conditions, the optimizer concludes that no descent direction is found, resulting in stagnant parameters.

Several scenarios can contribute to this failure:

* **Ill-conditioned loss function:** A poorly scaled or highly non-convex loss function can lead to numerical instabilities during the line search. Gradients might be extremely small or have large variations, causing the line search to oscillate or fail to converge.
* **Inaccurate gradients:** Errors in the gradient computation – often arising from subtle bugs in the automatic differentiation process or numerical limitations – can mislead the line search.  Incorrect gradients can lead to the algorithm believing it is already at a minimum, even when it is far from one.
* **Tight tolerances:** The internal tolerances of the LBFGS algorithm, which control the accuracy of the line search and Hessian approximation, can be overly strict for certain problems.  A more relaxed approach might be necessary.
* **Incorrect parameter initialization:** Poorly initialized parameters can place the optimization process in a region of the loss landscape where the line search repeatedly fails.
* **Function evaluation issues:**  The loss function itself might be unstable or produce `NaN` or `Inf` values, halting the optimization process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Gradient Issues:**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple function with a numerical instability
def unstable_loss(x):
    return torch.exp(x) / (1 + torch.exp(x))  # Sigmoid function can have issues with large x values

x = torch.tensor([100.0], requires_grad=True)
optimizer = optim.LBFGS([x], lr=0.1)

for i in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = unstable_loss(x)
    loss.backward()
    try:
        optimizer.step()
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Optimization failed at iteration {i+1} due to: {e}")
        break
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, x: {x.item()}, loss: {loss.item()}")

```

This example demonstrates how numerical instability in the loss function (`torch.exp(x)` for large `x`) can lead to `RuntimeError` during the optimization. The sigmoid function is used here as an illustrative example of a function that can exhibit numerical problems depending on the input range.


**Example 2:  Demonstrating the Impact of Tolerances:**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
optimizer = optim.LBFGS([x], lr=0.1, max_iter=50, line_search_fn='strong_wolfe') #Explicitly setting line search

#Objective function
def objective(x):
    return x**2

for i in range(50):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = objective(x)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, x: {x.item()}, loss: {loss.item()}")

#Change to a weaker line search
optimizer = optim.LBFGS([x], lr=0.1, max_iter=50, line_search_fn='strong_wolfe')
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
for i in range(50):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = objective(x)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, x: {x.item()}, loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example, while straightforward, highlights that even with a simple quadratic function, the specific `line_search_fn` can influence the convergence behaviour.  Exploring different line search options within LBFGS can sometimes resolve convergence issues. This illustrates the impact of internal tolerances; different line search strategies have different tolerances.


**Example 3:  Addressing Poor Initialization:**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

x = torch.tensor([-100.0], requires_grad=True) # Poor initial value
optimizer = optim.LBFGS([x], lr=0.1, max_iter=100)

def objective(x):
    return x**2

for i in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = objective(x)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, x: {x.item()}, loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Here, initializing `x` to a value far from the minimum (-100.0) can cause the optimizer to struggle, showcasing the role of appropriate parameter initialization.  A better starting point might improve convergence.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd suggest reviewing the PyTorch documentation on `torch.optim.LBFGS()`, paying close attention to the parameters and their impact on the optimization process.  Furthermore, studying numerical optimization texts focusing on line search methods and the Wolfe conditions will provide valuable theoretical background.  Finally, consulting relevant research papers on the LBFGS algorithm and its variants can offer insights into handling challenging optimization problems.  Thorough understanding of these resources should provide a strong foundation for effective debugging and tuning of LBFGS in PyTorch.
