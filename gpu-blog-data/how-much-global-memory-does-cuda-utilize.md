CUDA's global memory usage isn't a fixed quantity; it's dynamically allocated and heavily dependent on the application's needs and the GPU's capabilities.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications, particularly in computational fluid dynamics simulations, has shown that understanding the interplay between kernel configuration, data structures, and GPU architecture is critical for effective global memory management.  The amount of global memory utilized is fundamentally determined by the size of the data allocated within the kernel and the number of blocks launched.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Global memory in CUDA represents the largest, slowest, and most accessible memory space available to all threads within a CUDA application.  It’s distinct from the faster, but more limited, shared and register memories.  The total amount of global memory available is a hardware characteristic, defined by the GPU's specifications.  This capacity is fixed for a given device. However, the *amount* of global memory *used* by a specific program is determined by the application’s data structures and the kernel’s execution.  It's not a case of a program automatically consuming all available global memory; rather, the programmer explicitly allocates and deals with memory usage.  Inefficient allocation strategies can lead to significant performance penalties through excessive memory transfers and potential out-of-memory errors.

Memory allocation in CUDA global memory is handled through `cudaMalloc()`, which reserves a specified amount of memory.  This memory is then accessed by kernels using pointers.  Failure to deallocate this memory using `cudaFree()` after use can lead to memory leaks and eventually program crashes.  Critical to understanding memory usage is the concept of coalesced memory access.  Threads within a warp (a group of threads executed concurrently) ideally access consecutive memory locations to maximize memory bandwidth.  Non-coalesced access significantly reduces performance.  Therefore, careful data structure design is paramount for efficient global memory utilization.  Further, the total memory footprint is not only the sum of the allocations but also depends on the padding and alignment requirements of the GPU architecture. This alignment is often implicitly handled by the compiler and CUDA runtime.  However, understanding these implicit aspects can be crucial for fine-grained optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024 * 1024; // 1 million elements
  size_t size = n * sizeof(int);

  int *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
  int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Allocate host memory
  h_a = (int *)malloc(size);
  h_b = (int *)malloc(size);
  h_c = (int *)malloc(size);

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, size);
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, size);
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, size);

  // Initialize host arrays (omitted for brevity)

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // Copy results from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Free memory
  free(h_a);
  free(h_b);
  free(h_c);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates straightforward allocation and deallocation of global memory.  The memory used is directly proportional to `n`, the size of the vectors.  The `cudaMalloc()` calls allocate the necessary space on the device, and `cudaFree()` releases it.  The total global memory used is approximately 3 * `size` bytes.

**Example 2:  2D Matrix Multiplication**

```c++
__global__ void matrixMul(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  float sum = 0.0f;

  if (row < width && col < width) {
    for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
      sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
    }
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}

// ... (main function similar to Example 1, but with 3 matrices) ...
```

Here, global memory usage scales with `width * width * sizeof(float)` for each matrix. The total usage is approximately 3 * `width * width * sizeof(float)`.  The efficiency of this kernel depends on memory access patterns; optimizations might involve tiling to improve coalescing.


**Example 3:  Handling Larger Datasets**

For datasets exceeding available GPU memory, techniques like pinned memory (`cudaHostAlloc()`) and asynchronous data transfers (`cudaMemcpyAsync()`) become crucial.

```c++
// ... (Allocation of pinned host memory using cudaHostAlloc()) ...

// ... (Asynchronous data transfer using cudaMemcpyAsync()) ...

// ... (Kernel launch)...

// ... (Asynchronous data transfer using cudaMemcpyAsync()) ...

// ... (Deallocation using cudaFreeHost())...
```

This example demonstrates strategies for managing larger-than-memory datasets.  While the *total* memory used by the application might exceed the GPU's global memory capacity, these techniques allow efficient processing by staging data transfers between the host and device.  However, even with these optimizations, effective memory management becomes more complex.

In conclusion, determining the exact global memory utilized by a CUDA program requires analyzing its code, particularly the memory allocations within the kernels and the size of the data being processed.   Experienced CUDA developers constantly strive for efficient memory management, considering not just the raw allocation size but also the effects of data structure design, memory access patterns, and the interplay between host and device memory.  Careful consideration of these factors is essential for achieving optimal performance and avoiding resource exhaustion.
