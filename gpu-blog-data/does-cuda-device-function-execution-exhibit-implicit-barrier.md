CUDA's `__device__` function execution does not inherently involve implicit barrier synchronization at either its start or end.  This is a crucial detail often misunderstood, leading to subtle and difficult-to-debug concurrency issues.  My experience debugging high-performance computing applications, particularly those involving complex stencil operations on large datasets, has repeatedly underscored the necessity of explicit synchronization when managing shared memory or interacting with global memory from multiple threads within a kernel.

The misconception stems from the fact that threads within a warp execute instructions concurrently. However, the launching of a `__device__` function from within a kernel does *not* imply a synchronization point for the calling thread or the other threads within its block.  Each thread independently calls the `__device__` function; the functions execute concurrently, subject only to the usual limitations of thread scheduling and resource contention within the GPU.  There's no global orchestration ensuring all threads reach the beginning or end of the `__device__` call simultaneously.

Consider the following: a kernel launches many threads; each thread calls a `__device__` function.  If that `__device__` function modifies shared memory, and multiple threads within the same block call it concurrently without explicit synchronization, a race condition inevitably results. The final value in shared memory will be unpredictable, determined by the non-deterministic execution order of the threads. Similarly, without explicit synchronization, accessing global memory from multiple threads within a `__device__` function invoked concurrently will lead to unpredictable results and potential data corruption.


**Explanation:**

The execution model is fundamentally asynchronous.  The GPU scheduler manages the threads, distributing them across available stream processors.  A thread invoking a `__device__` function simply pushes that function onto the execution queue for that specific stream processor.  The calling thread then continues its execution, potentially performing other computations, while the called `__device__` function runs concurrently and independently.  Only when the called function completes is its return value available to the calling thread.  Crucially, this completion does not imply any synchronization with other threads.  The calling thread proceeds without waiting for the completion of all concurrently executing `__device__` functions.

This behavior distinguishes `__device__` functions from, for example, kernel launches which (depending on the launch parameters) might implicitly synchronize.  Kernel launches themselves are managed by the CUDA runtime, offering more explicit control over execution and often including implicit synchronization between blocks. This difference is key: the management and control are different for kernel launches compared to the function calls within a kernel.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Race Condition without Synchronization**

```c++
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int size) {
  int i = threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    int sharedValue = myDeviceFunction(i); // Potential race condition
    data[i] = sharedValue;
  }
}

__device__ int myDeviceFunction(int i) {
  static __shared__ int sharedVar; //Shared memory
  int temp = sharedVar;
  sharedVar = temp + i; //Race condition if multiple threads call concurrently
  return sharedVar;
}
```

In this example, `myDeviceFunction` modifies shared memory. If multiple threads call it concurrently, the final value of `sharedVar` is unpredictable due to a race condition.  There's no implicit barrier, so threads might read and write `sharedVar` in an interleaved and unpredictable manner.


**Example 2: Correct Use with Explicit Synchronization**

```c++
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int size) {
  int i = threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    int sharedValue = myDeviceFunction(i);
    data[i] = sharedValue;
  }
}

__device__ int myDeviceFunction(int i) {
  __syncthreads(); // Explicit synchronization before accessing shared memory
  static __shared__ int sharedVar;
  int temp = sharedVar;
  sharedVar = temp + i;
  __syncthreads(); // Explicit synchronization after modifying shared memory
  return sharedVar;
}
```

Here, `__syncthreads()` is used to ensure all threads within a block have finished accessing shared memory before proceeding. This correctly synchronizes access, eliminating the race condition present in Example 1.  Note that `__syncthreads()` only synchronizes threads *within the same block*.


**Example 3: Illustrating Asynchronous Nature**

```c++
__global__ void kernel() {
  int result1 = myDeviceFunction1();
  int result2 = myDeviceFunction2();
  // Processing... result1 and result2 might not be ready in this order
}

__device__ int myDeviceFunction1() {
    //Some computation-intensive task.
    return 10;
}

__device__ int myDeviceFunction2() {
    // Some computation-intensive task.
    return 20;
}
```

In this example, `myDeviceFunction1` and `myDeviceFunction2` are called asynchronously. There's no guarantee that `result1` will be available before `result2`, or vice-versa.  The order depends on the GPU's scheduling decisions.  This highlights the asynchronous nature of `__device__` function calls; no implicit waiting occurs.

CUDA C Programming Guide, CUDA Occupancy Calculator,  Warp Shuffle Instructions documentation.  Understanding these resources will solidify your understanding of thread management and synchronization within the CUDA execution model.  Thorough study of these resources is essential for efficient and correct CUDA programming.  Remember to consult the official NVIDIA documentation for the most up-to-date information.
