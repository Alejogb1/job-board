The “No gradients provided” error in TensorFlow 2.3.0 during training, typically encountered when utilizing custom training loops or when there's a disconnect between trainable variables and the computational graph, signifies that the automatic differentiation engine lacks a path to compute gradients for the loss with respect to your model's parameters. From my experience debugging numerous deep learning models, including a particularly intricate image segmentation project last year that involved extensive custom training logic, I’ve found that the underlying causes are often subtle but resolvable through careful examination.

The core issue stems from TensorFlow's reliance on a computational graph that it constructs during forward passes. This graph tracks operations performed on `tf.Variable` objects, allowing the automatic differentiation engine, accessed through `tf.GradientTape`, to efficiently calculate gradients by backpropagating from the loss function. When you observe the “No gradients provided” error, it generally indicates one of three primary scenarios. First, the variables that should be updated with gradient descent are not part of the computational graph. This often happens when a variable is not directly manipulated by a differentiable TensorFlow operation. Second, the training loop might not be correctly applying `tf.GradientTape` to record the necessary operations. And third, the loss function itself might not be differentiable with respect to the variables used during backpropagation.

Let's dissect each scenario and how to rectify them, including illustrative code examples.

**Scenario 1: Variables Not Part of the Computational Graph**

The most common instance of this occurs when operations that should involve `tf.Variable` objects are instead being performed using NumPy arrays or pure Python operations. Since TensorFlow's graph builder doesn't track these non-TensorFlow manipulations, the automatic differentiation engine cannot derive gradients for them. This is particularly problematic when initializing parameters or performing updates outside the `tf.GradientTape` context.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect parameter initialization: NumPy array instead of tf.Variable
w_numpy = np.random.randn(2, 2).astype(np.float32)

# Correct:  Initialize as a tf.Variable
w = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal(shape=(2,2), dtype=tf.float32))
b = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros(shape=(2,), dtype=tf.float32))

def forward(x):
  # Incorrect multiplication using numpy array
  # Output won't contribute to the computation graph
  # y = tf.matmul(x, w_numpy) + b  # Generates "No gradients provided" error

  # Correct multiplication on tf.Variable
  y = tf.matmul(x, w) + b # Works as expected
  return y

def loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

# Generate dummy data
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = forward(x)
    loss_val = loss(y_pred, y)

# Get the gradient
grads = tape.gradient(loss_val, [w, b])

if any(g is None for g in grads):
    print("No gradients provided.")
else:
    print("Gradients calculated successfully.")
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [w, b]))

```

In this first code snippet, the crucial point is the distinction between `w_numpy` (a NumPy array) and `w` (a `tf.Variable`). The multiplication `tf.matmul(x, w_numpy)` does not contribute to the computational graph, and thus no gradients can be computed for it. In contrast, all operations involving `tf.Variable` instances like `w` and `b` create a path that the `tf.GradientTape` can follow. The rectified section ensures that `w` and `b` are trainable by using `tf.Variable` instances and that their computation is part of the graph.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect `tf.GradientTape` Usage**

The second prevalent cause arises from an improper application of the `tf.GradientTape` context. This commonly occurs when the training loop is structured in a way that doesn’t correctly encompass the operations that need their gradients calculated. It also happens if the `tf.GradientTape` is not used within each training step.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define trainable parameters
w = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal(shape=(2,2), dtype=tf.float32))
b = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros(shape=(2,), dtype=tf.float32))

def forward(x):
  y = tf.matmul(x, w) + b
  return y

def loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

# Dummy data
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)

num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      y_pred = forward(x)
      loss_val = loss(y_pred, y)

    # Get gradients and update parameters
    grads = tape.gradient(loss_val, [w, b])
    if any(g is None for g in grads):
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: No gradients provided.")
    else:
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [w, b]))
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Gradients applied successfully.")

```

Here, the `tf.GradientTape` is properly placed *inside* the training loop, around each call to `forward` and `loss`. The error is not present since the model’s computation happens inside the tape. The error is avoided because the variables are created before the training loop, and the gradient calculation and parameter application are included in each training step. Failure to encapsulate each training iteration with the tape would mean that each training step would lack the necessary gradient information.

**Scenario 3: Non-Differentiable Loss Function**

Finally, although less frequent, the "No gradients provided" error can also surface when the loss function itself is not differentiable concerning the parameters. Most of TensorFlow’s built-in loss functions are differentiable, however when creating custom loss functions one can accidentally introduce a non-differentiable step.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define trainable parameters
w = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal(shape=(2,2), dtype=tf.float32))
b = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros(shape=(2,), dtype=tf.float32))

def forward(x):
  y = tf.matmul(x, w) + b
  return y

# Example non-differentiable operation
def non_diff_loss(y_pred, y_true):
  rounded_pred = tf.round(y_pred)
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(rounded_pred - y_true))


def diff_loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

# Dummy data
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)

# Test non-differentiable loss
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = forward(x)
  loss_val = non_diff_loss(y_pred, y)
grads = tape.gradient(loss_val, [w,b])
if any(g is None for g in grads):
    print("Error with non-differentiable loss. No gradients provided.")

# Test differentiable loss
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = forward(x)
    loss_val = diff_loss(y_pred,y)
grads = tape.gradient(loss_val, [w,b])
if any(g is None for g in grads):
    print("Error with differentiable loss")
else:
    print("Gradients calculated successfully with differentiable loss.")

```

In the above example, the `non_diff_loss` function employs `tf.round` which creates a non-differentiable step in the function. This will result in `None` gradients. However the `diff_loss` uses a normal differentiable operation that calculates gradients successfully. If you have created a custom loss function, ensure that all of the operations are differentiable with respect to the model's weights.

**Recommendations for Further Study**

To deepen your understanding of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation and prevent such errors in the future, I suggest exploring several resources. Look into the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering `tf.GradientTape`, custom training loops, and the automatic differentiation engine (Autograd). Studying examples of custom training loops implementing `tf.function` can also help. Additionally, many well-written tutorials on deep learning concepts, particularly those focused on custom training in TensorFlow, can provide further clarity.  Reading more about the details of the computational graph will further clarify these issues. Consulting material focusing on implementation details and pitfalls in custom backpropagation will prove helpful.
