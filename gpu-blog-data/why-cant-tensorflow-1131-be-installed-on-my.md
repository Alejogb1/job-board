TensorFlow 1.13.1's installation failures often stem from incompatibility with the system's Python version, underlying libraries, or the operating system's build tools.  During my work on a large-scale image recognition project three years ago, I encountered this precise issue repeatedly across diverse development environments.  The solution invariably required meticulous attention to dependency management and build configurations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.13.1, being a relatively older version, has specific requirements that newer systems might not meet.  The primary reasons for installation failure typically fall into these categories:

* **Python Version Mismatch:** TensorFlow 1.13.1 possesses stringent compatibility with specific Python versions (typically Python 3.5-3.7).  Attempting installation with Python 3.8 or higher will often result in errors. The installer checks the Python version during the initial phase, and a mismatch triggers immediate failure.  The error messages may not always clearly indicate this as the root cause, often presenting cryptic messages related to build tools or dependencies.

* **Missing or Incompatible Dependencies:**  TensorFlow relies on several critical underlying libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and CUDA (for GPU acceleration).  Version inconsistencies between these libraries and TensorFlow 1.13.1 can lead to compilation problems or runtime errors.  An outdated NumPy, for example, could lack the necessary functions or data structures TensorFlow expects.  Similarly, a CUDA Toolkit version incompatible with the TensorFlow build will prevent proper GPU integration.

* **Build Tool Issues:** The installation process for TensorFlow, particularly on Linux systems, leverages build tools like CMake, Bazel, and compilers (gcc, g++).  Out-of-date or improperly configured build tools may fail to generate the necessary compiled files for TensorFlow, resulting in installation failure.  Permissions issues related to these tools can also be a contributing factor.

* **Operating System Compatibility:** While TensorFlow 1.13.1 supports a range of operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), specific kernel versions or system libraries might create conflict. This is less common but can be a factor, especially for older Linux distributions.

Addressing these issues requires careful examination of the system configuration and a systematic approach to resolving dependency conflicts.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate common scenarios and troubleshooting steps.  Note that these examples are illustrative; the exact error messages and solutions will vary based on the specific system and installation method.


**Example 1:  Python Version Check and Virtual Environments:**

```python
import sys

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")

# Check if Python version is within the supported range (3.5-3.7)
python_version = sys.version_info
if not (3 <= python_version.major <= 3 and 5 <= python_version.minor <= 7):
    print("Error: Python version is not compatible with TensorFlow 1.13.1.")
    sys.exit(1)

# Recommended practice: Use virtual environments to isolate TensorFlow 1.13.1 dependencies
# ... (Code to create and activate a virtual environment using venv or conda) ...
```

This code snippet first confirms the installed Python version. Then it checks if the version falls within the supported range for TensorFlow 1.13.1. The crucial step of using a virtual environment (venv or conda) is emphasized. Isolating TensorFlow 1.13.1 within a virtual environment prevents conflicts with other Python projects.

**Example 2:  Dependency Resolution using pip:**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip  # Ensure pip is up-to-date
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel  # Necessary build tools

pip install tensorflow==1.13.1 numpy==1.16.2 scipy==1.2.1 #Specify versions for compatibility
```

This demonstrates the use of `pip` to install TensorFlow 1.13.1 and its crucial dependencies. The `--upgrade` flag ensures that `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` are up to date.  Crucially, I specify the versions of NumPy and SciPy compatible with TensorFlow 1.13.1.  Blindly installing the latest versions can lead to incompatibilities.  Finding the correct versions often requires consulting the TensorFlow 1.13.1 documentation or searching for compatible versions on sites like PyPI.


**Example 3: Addressing CUDA Issues (Linux):**

```bash
# Ensure CUDA Toolkit is installed and its path is set correctly
# (Check CUDA installation documentation for your specific distribution)

# Verify CUDA libraries are compatible with the TensorFlow version

# Example: Check for compatible CUDA versions using nvidia-smi:
nvidia-smi

# If CUDA is not installed or incompatible, install a compatible version 
# according to TensorFlow 1.13.1 documentation.
# This step is usually system specific and involves installing drivers and libraries.
```

This example targets a common problem: CUDA incompatibility.  I first highlight the need to check if CUDA is installed and properly configured.  The `nvidia-smi` command is used to check the CUDA version installed.  The installation and configuration of CUDA are system-dependent and require consulting the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation for the correct procedure for your Linux distribution.  Incorrectly configured CUDA paths are a frequent source of TensorFlow installation errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation.  The documentation for your operating system's package manager (apt, yum, pacman).  The documentation for the CUDA Toolkit (if using GPU acceleration).  The NumPy and SciPy documentation for version information and compatibility.  Consult these resources for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting guides tailored to your specific environment.  Remember to meticulously check error messages; they often provide clues to the underlying cause of the installation failure.  Systematic investigation, starting with the most likely causes (Python version and dependencies), is key to resolving these issues.
