The discrepancy in output values between .h5 and .pb models often stems from differing serialization formats and the inherent variations in how these formats handle specific Keras/TensorFlow operations.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects has highlighted this issue repeatedly. While both formats represent trained neural networks, they employ different approaches to storing weights, biases, and the model's architecture, leading to subtle but sometimes significant variations in prediction results. This is particularly true when dealing with custom layers or operations not directly supported by both formats with perfect fidelity.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The .h5 (HDF5) format, commonly used by Keras, is a relatively versatile, hierarchical data format capable of storing diverse data types.  It preserves the model's architecture and weights in a way that's designed to be easily loaded back into a Keras environment.  However, its flexibility can lead to inconsistencies if the loading environment's Keras version or backend (e.g., TensorFlow, Theano) differs significantly from the one used during saving.  Specific custom layer implementations, for example, might be interpreted differently across versions, resulting in divergent computations.

The .pb (protocol buffer) format, typically used for TensorFlow models, is a more rigid, binary format optimized for efficiency and deployment.  It focuses primarily on the model's computational graph, representing operations and their interdependencies. While generally more efficient for deployment in production systems,  the .pb format inherently lacks the rich metadata often present in .h5 files.  This metadata can include crucial information regarding layer configurations and custom operations that influence the overall prediction.  If the conversion from .h5 to .pb is not handled perfectly, this information loss can lead to altered output.

Crucially, the conversion process itself can introduce errors.  Tools used to convert between these formats—particularly those lacking meticulous handling of custom layers or less common TensorFlow operations—might introduce approximations or outright omissions.  These inconsistencies can subtly alter the model's behavior, leading to differences in the final output.  In my experience, conversion issues frequently involved custom activation functions, regularization techniques, or the use of specific optimizers not uniformly handled during the conversion from Keras's internal representation to TensorFlow's graph definition.

Furthermore, differences in floating-point precision during the conversion or subsequent computation can accumulate and contribute to the discrepancy. While seemingly insignificant at the individual operation level, these small differences can propagate through the network, resulting in noticeable variations in the final output, especially in models with deep architectures or numerous layers.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating a potential issue with custom layers:**

```python
# Custom layer in Keras
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  trainable=True)
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# ... Model construction using MyCustomLayer ...
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(32),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# ... Model training and saving to .h5 ...
model.save('my_model.h5')


#Conversion and loading in TensorFlow (potential issues)
# ... Conversion code here, using e.g., tf.saved_model.save ...

# ... Loading the .pb model and prediction ...
#This might require specific techniques to load the converted model.  Inconsistent behaviours can arise here.
```

**Commentary:**  The conversion process from .h5 (containing the `MyCustomLayer`) to .pb might not perfectly replicate the custom layer's behavior. The TensorFlow equivalent might not be precisely the same, leading to output discrepancies.  The `.pb` might use a default implementation of a similar operation if the conversion tool doesn't handle the custom layer explicitly.


**Example 2: Highlighting floating-point precision differences:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Simple model for demonstration
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

# Generate some input data
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10)

# Train model (simplified)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(input_data, np.array([[1.0]]), epochs=1)

# Save model in .h5 and .pb format
model.save('model_h5.h5')
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'model_pb')


#Prediction with .h5
model_h5 = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_h5.h5')
prediction_h5 = model_h5.predict(input_data)

#Prediction with .pb
loaded = tf.saved_model.load('model_pb')
infer = loaded.signatures["serving_default"]
prediction_pb = infer(tf.constant(input_data, dtype=tf.float32))['dense']


print(f"Prediction from .h5: {prediction_h5}")
print(f"Prediction from .pb: {prediction_pb.numpy()}")
```

**Commentary:** Even in this simple model, minor differences in floating-point precision during the conversion or prediction might cause small variations in the output values.  The discrepancies will be more pronounced in complex, deeply layered models.

**Example 3: Demonstrating the impact of different Keras/TensorFlow versions:**

```python
# Keras model creation using a specific Keras version
# ... code that defines and trains a Keras model using a specific version of Keras and TensorFlow...
# ... save as model_v1.h5


# Attempt loading and prediction using a different Keras/TensorFlow version
# ... code to load model_v1.h5 using a different version ...
# ... attempt prediction, noting potential errors or inconsistencies


# Convert model_v1.h5 to .pb and then attempt to load and use it with different Keras/TF versions

# ... conversion code ...
# ... loading and predicting code for the converted .pb file ...

```

**Commentary:** Loading a model saved with a specific Keras/TensorFlow version into an environment with a different version can lead to inconsistencies due to changes in underlying implementations of layers, activation functions, or other components.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on model saving and loading.  The Keras documentation on model serialization.  A comprehensive guide on numerical precision in deep learning. A reference on protocol buffers and their limitations in representing complex model architectures.  A guide on best practices for converting between different deep learning model formats.


In conclusion, the disparity in outputs between .h5 and .pb models underscores the importance of understanding the underlying serialization mechanisms and potential limitations of conversion tools.  Careful attention to custom layers, version compatibility, and potential precision loss during conversion are crucial for ensuring consistency across different model representations.  Rigorous testing and validation are indispensable when working with these different formats, particularly in critical applications.
