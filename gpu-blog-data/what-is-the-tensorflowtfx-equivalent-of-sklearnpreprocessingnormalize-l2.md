The core challenge in finding a direct TensorFlow/TFX equivalent to scikit-learn's `sklearn.preprocessing.normalize` with L2 normalization lies in the differing data handling paradigms. Scikit-learn operates primarily on NumPy arrays, while TensorFlow and TFX are designed for tensor manipulation within computational graphs, often incorporating automatic differentiation and distributed computation.  This difference necessitates a shift in how normalization is implemented.  My experience building and deploying large-scale machine learning models using these frameworks highlights this distinction.  Direct translation isn't feasible; rather, we need to adapt the normalization logic to TensorFlow's operational context.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`sklearn.preprocessing.normalize` performs L2 normalization on a feature vector, scaling each vector to unit norm.  This means the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of each vector becomes 1.  In TensorFlow, we achieve this using tensor operations, leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functions for efficiency and compatibility with the broader TensorFlow ecosystem. Specifically, we exploit the `tf.norm` function to calculate the L2 norm and then perform element-wise division to normalize the input tensor.  The key difference lies in the handling of batches.  Scikit-learn handles this implicitly, while TensorFlow demands explicit batch-wise processing, unless using higher-level APIs like `tf.data`.

Crucially, understanding the input data's shape is vital.  For a dataset with `n_samples` samples and `n_features` features, scikit-learn expects a shape of `(n_samples, n_features)`.  TensorFlow likewise expects a similar shape for its tensors but allows for efficient handling of multi-dimensional tensors (e.g., adding a batch dimension).  The choice between using eager execution or a TensorFlow graph impacts the execution flow, dictating how intermediate results are managed.

Furthermore, while `sklearn.preprocessing.normalize` offers various norms (L1, L2, max), our focus here is strictly on the L2 norm. The TensorFlow implementation must explicitly reflect this selection.  In scenarios involving large datasets, the performance of the implementation will be significantly influenced by data loading and batching strategies.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic L2 Normalization using Eager Execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l2_normalize_tf(tensor):
  """
  Performs L2 normalization on a TensorFlow tensor.

  Args:
    tensor: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (n_samples, n_features).

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor of the same shape as the input, L2-normalized.  Returns None if input tensor is None or empty.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the input tensor has an invalid shape or contains non-numeric values.
  """
  if tensor is None or tf.shape(tensor)[0] == 0:
      return None

  norms = tf.norm(tensor, ord=2, axis=1, keepdims=True)
  # Handle potential division by zero.  Replace with alternative handling as needed for application.
  normalized_tensor = tf.math.divide_no_nan(tensor, norms)
  return normalized_tensor

# Example usage:
tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
normalized_tensor = l2_normalize_tf(tensor)
print(normalized_tensor)
```

This example directly mirrors the functionality of `sklearn.preprocessing.normalize` using eager execution. The `tf.norm` function computes the L2 norm along each row (axis=1), and `tf.math.divide_no_nan` safely handles potential division by zero.  Error handling is included for robustness.


**Example 2: L2 Normalization with Batch Processing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l2_normalize_batch(dataset, batch_size=32):
  """
  Performs L2 normalization on a TensorFlow dataset in batches.

  Args:
    dataset: A tf.data.Dataset object.  Assumed to yield tensors of shape (n_features,).
    batch_size: Batch size for processing.

  Returns:
    A tf.data.Dataset object yielding L2-normalized tensors.  Returns None if input dataset is None or empty.

  Raises:
    TypeError: if input is not a tf.data.Dataset
  """
  if dataset is None or not isinstance(dataset, tf.data.Dataset):
      return None

  def normalize_batch(batch):
      norms = tf.norm(batch, ord=2, axis=1, keepdims=True)
      return tf.math.divide_no_nan(batch, norms)

  batched_dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
  normalized_dataset = batched_dataset.map(normalize_batch)
  return normalized_dataset


# Example usage (assuming 'dataset' is a pre-existing tf.data.Dataset):
# normalized_dataset = l2_normalize_batch(dataset)
# for batch in normalized_dataset:
#   print(batch)
```

This example demonstrates efficient batch processing for large datasets using `tf.data`.  It's crucial for managing memory effectively when dealing with extensive data.  The `map` function applies the normalization to each batch individually.


**Example 3:  L2 Normalization within a Keras Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class L2NormalizationLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        norms = tf.norm(inputs, ord=2, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        return tf.math.divide_no_nan(inputs, norms)

# Example usage within a Keras model:
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),  # Example input shape
    L2NormalizationLayer(),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
])
```

This approach integrates L2 normalization directly into a Keras model as a custom layer. This allows for seamless integration with other layers during model training and inference, providing a clean and efficient solution within the Keras framework.  The `axis=-1` argument handles the normalization appropriately regardless of input tensor dimensionality.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections covering tensor operations, `tf.data`, and Keras custom layers, are invaluable resources.  Comprehensive texts on TensorFlow and deep learning will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and best practices.  Understanding linear algebra fundamentals, especially vector norms, is crucial for a complete grasp of the normalization process.  Finally, exploring example code repositories and online forums focusing on TensorFlow can help in tackling specific challenges and adopting efficient coding strategies.
