The inherent challenge when dealing with multiple Keras models that share a name stems from how TensorFlow's model saving and loading mechanisms operate, particularly when using the default naming strategies. The issue is not simply about duplicate Python object names, but rather the serialized graph structure and how the framework associates weights, biases, and other training parameters with specific layers within that graph. Attempting to load two distinct models that both claim to be, say, "MyModel," leads to namespace collisions. The framework, when restoring, struggles to discern which set of weights belongs to which architectural implementation. I have personally encountered this while attempting a modular model architecture design where independent parts were mistakenly given identical naming conventions. I’ll detail how to mitigate this, covering layer-level custom naming and how it affects both model loading and saving.

Fundamentally, Keras allows for layer-level naming, which we must leverage instead of solely relying on the top-level model name. By default, if we do not supply specific names to layers within a model, TensorFlow automatically assigns them. However, when saving a model that utilizes this default behavior, those automatically generated names are serialized and become part of the model’s definition.  This is precisely why loading two different 'MyModel' instances, each with its own set of auto-generated internal layer names, results in errors. The framework finds itself attempting to apply weights from one architecture to another, and the structures do not align. The solution revolves around explicitly managing these internal layer names, which can be done during model construction.

To combine two models effectively, we don't “combine” them in the traditional sense of merging their graphs into a single model with the same name. Instead, we treat them as modular components, ensuring each model's layer names are unique *within their respective graphs*, which will enable subsequent reuse or sequential application of these components. Consider scenarios where you are reusing a pre-trained feature extractor or using a custom loss function within another model, where both need different layers. The naming issue becomes very apparent and will interfere with model application.

Here are three common scenarios and the corresponding code for managing them:

**Example 1: Named Sub-Models for Sequential Processing**

In this scenario, assume we have two sequential models, one for feature extraction (`FeatureExtractor`) and one for classification (`Classifier`). Both may use similar layer structures, but we intend to apply them sequentially, passing output of one into another for classification.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# --- Define Feature Extractor Model ---
def create_feature_extractor(name_prefix):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
    x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', name=f"{name_prefix}_conv1")(inputs)
    x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name=f"{name_prefix}_pool1")(x)
    x = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', name=f"{name_prefix}_conv2")(x)
    x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name=f"{name_prefix}_pool2")(x)
    x = keras.layers.Flatten(name=f"{name_prefix}_flatten")(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x, name="FeatureExtractor")


# --- Define Classification Model ---
def create_classifier(name_prefix):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(7*7*64,))
  x = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name=f"{name_prefix}_dense1")(inputs)
  x = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name=f"{name_prefix}_output")(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x, name='Classifier')


# Create instances with unique prefixes
feature_extractor = create_feature_extractor('extractor_1')
classifier = create_classifier('classifier_1')


# Connect them in a hybrid model
inputs_hybrid = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
extracted_features = feature_extractor(inputs_hybrid)
outputs = classifier(extracted_features)

hybrid_model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs_hybrid, outputs=outputs, name="HybridModel")

# Model summary will display unique names
hybrid_model.summary()

# Verify layer names
for layer in hybrid_model.layers:
    print(f"{layer.name}")

# Saving and loading can be done without conflict, as the layer names are unique
hybrid_model.save("hybrid_model.keras")
loaded_hybrid_model = keras.models.load_model("hybrid_model.keras")

```

**Commentary:**

In this first example, I define helper functions, `create_feature_extractor` and `create_classifier`, which take a name prefix as input. Within each function, I explicitly name *each layer* using that prefix. This ensures that when we instantiate `feature_extractor` and `classifier`, their layers are guaranteed to have unique names. The final model connects the input of the second model to the output of the first.  Saving and loading works flawlessly because each layer's name is unique. This pattern is beneficial when you intend to apply multiple models sequentially. Note the `name` attribute on the `keras.Model`. While we still give models a name, it is no longer critical, as the layers themselves have unique names.

**Example 2: Shared Feature Extractor with Distinct Output Layers**

Here, assume a common image processing task where you have one feature extractor feeding into multiple, distinct classification models. The feature extractor provides the common input feature set.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def create_feature_extractor(name_prefix):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
    x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', name=f"{name_prefix}_conv1")(inputs)
    x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name=f"{name_prefix}_pool1")(x)
    x = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', name=f"{name_prefix}_conv2")(x)
    x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name=f"{name_prefix}_pool2")(x)
    x = keras.layers.Flatten(name=f"{name_prefix}_flatten")(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x, name="FeatureExtractor")


def create_classifier_output(name_prefix, feature_input):
    x = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name=f"{name_prefix}_dense1")(feature_input)
    x = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name=f"{name_prefix}_output")(x)
    return x


# Create feature extractor instance
shared_feature_extractor = create_feature_extractor('shared_feature')

# Create different classification outputs based on same extracted features
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28,28,1))
features = shared_feature_extractor(inputs)

output1 = create_classifier_output('classifier1', features)
output2 = create_classifier_output('classifier2', features)

model1 = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output1, name="Model1")
model2 = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output2, name="Model2")

model1.summary()
model2.summary()

for layer in model1.layers:
    print(f"Model 1 layer: {layer.name}")

for layer in model2.layers:
    print(f"Model 2 layer: {layer.name}")


model1.save("model1.keras")
model2.save("model2.keras")

loaded_model1 = keras.models.load_model("model1.keras")
loaded_model2 = keras.models.load_model("model2.keras")


```

**Commentary:**

In this example, a single feature extraction is used as the input to two separate classification models. The key is that while the same 'shared_feature' model is *reused*, the naming prefixes for each distinct output are unique: 'classifier1' and 'classifier2'. This avoids collision when saving and loading each model.

**Example 3:  Custom Layer Naming with a Class**

Let us consider a custom model class which needs unique naming of its layers. This demonstrates a class-based model definition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, name_prefix, **kwargs):
      super(CustomModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.conv1 = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', name=f"{name_prefix}_conv1")
      self.pool1 = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name=f"{name_prefix}_pool1")
      self.flatten = keras.layers.Flatten(name=f"{name_prefix}_flatten")
      self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name=f"{name_prefix}_dense1")
      self.output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name=f"{name_prefix}_output")

    def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.conv1(inputs)
      x = self.pool1(x)
      x = self.flatten(x)
      x = self.dense1(x)
      return self.output(x)

# Create model instances
model_a = CustomModel(name_prefix='model_a_')
model_b = CustomModel(name_prefix='model_b_')


inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
output_a = model_a(inputs)
output_b = model_b(inputs)


keras_model_a = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output_a, name="ModelA")
keras_model_b = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output_b, name="ModelB")


keras_model_a.summary()
keras_model_b.summary()

# Verify layer names are unique within their respective models
for layer in keras_model_a.layers:
  print(f"Model A layer: {layer.name}")

for layer in keras_model_b.layers:
  print(f"Model B layer: {layer.name}")

keras_model_a.save('model_a.keras')
keras_model_b.save('model_b.keras')


loaded_model_a = keras.models.load_model('model_a.keras')
loaded_model_b = keras.models.load_model('model_b.keras')


```

**Commentary:**

Here, layer naming occurs within a custom class inheriting from `keras.Model`. The constructor `__init__` explicitly sets unique prefixes in the layer names. The `call` function then applies each layer, in turn. Using the `name_prefix`, we instantiate two distinct model objects (`model_a` and `model_b`).  This class-based approach is suitable for more complex models with multiple operations and is more maintainable as well.

These three examples showcase how explicit layer naming can be used to circumvent the common pitfalls associated with duplicate model names. The key to combining multiple models with similar names is to provide a mechanism to ensure unique layer naming at construction time.

For further study, review TensorFlow's documentation on creating custom layers and models, as well as best practices for saving and loading. Consider also Keras' Functional API documentation which is often used in complex model design for modularity and reusability. An understanding of graph serialization within TensorFlow will clarify why naming collisions are problematic and how to address them proactively. Finally, exploring best practices in modular model design will reinforce how custom naming is often a crucial first step to build large and complex architectures.
