TensorFlow's inherent reliance on differentiable operations presents a challenge when directly incorporating standard Python `if` statements within tensor computations.  The `if` statement, fundamentally a control flow structure, interrupts the graph's smooth flow and breaks differentiability, hindering backpropagation crucial for gradient-based optimization.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models highlighted this limitation early on.  Efficiently handling conditional logic requires alternative approaches leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functionalities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue stems from the static computational graph paradigm of TensorFlow (specifically, the eager execution mode alters this slightly, but the underlying principle remains).  TensorFlow constructs a graph representing the computation before execution.  A standard Python `if` statement's execution depends on runtime values, creating a dynamic branch that the static graph cannot represent directly.  To address this, TensorFlow offers several techniques to manage conditional logic:

* **`tf.cond`:** This function allows for conditional execution of different TensorFlow operations based on a boolean tensor. This boolean tensor is evaluated, determining which branch of the operation executes, creating a conditional subgraph that TensorFlow can manage. The critical aspect is that the condition is a *tensor*, not a Python boolean variable.

* **`tf.where`:**  Provides element-wise conditional selection.  Given a condition tensor and two tensors (of the same shape) representing the results for `True` and `False` conditions, `tf.where` selects elements from one tensor or the other based on the corresponding boolean value in the condition tensor.  This offers vectorized conditional logic, a significant performance advantage over looping.

* **`tf.case`:**  This generalizes `tf.cond` for multiple conditions. It allows selecting one of several operations based on a set of mutually exclusive predicates. This is useful for more complex conditional logic beyond simple binary choices.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: `tf.cond` for simple conditional operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(5)
y = tf.constant(10)

def f1():
  return x + y

def f2():
  return x * y

z = tf.cond(tf.greater(x, 3), f1, f2)  # Condition: x > 3

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(z)) # Output: 15 (because x > 3, f1 is executed)

x_neg = tf.constant(-5)
z_neg = tf.cond(tf.greater(x_neg, 3), f1, f2)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(z_neg)) # Output: -50 (because x_neg <= 3, f2 is executed)

```

This illustrates a fundamental use of `tf.cond`.  The condition `tf.greater(x, 3)` produces a boolean tensor. Based on this tensor's value, either `f1` or `f2` is executed.  Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.Session` for compatibility across TensorFlow versions;  in newer versions, eager execution might eliminate the need for explicit session management.  However, the core concept remains.

**Example 2: `tf.where` for element-wise selection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
condition = tf.greater(x, 2)  # Element-wise comparison
y = tf.where(condition, x * 2, x / 2) # Selects x*2 if True, x/2 if False

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(y)) # Output: [0.5, 1.0, 6, 8, 10]
```

Here, `tf.where` performs element-wise selection.  `condition` is a boolean tensor; for elements where it's `True`, `x * 2` is selected; otherwise, `x / 2` is chosen. This demonstrates its efficiency in handling conditional logic across multiple elements simultaneously.

**Example 3:  `tf.case` for multiple conditions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(2)

def f1():
    return x + 10

def f2():
    return x * 10

def f3():
    return x**2

pred_fn1 = lambda: tf.greater(x, 0)
pred_fn2 = lambda: tf.equal(x, 0)
pred_fn3 = lambda: tf.less(x, 0)

z = tf.case([(pred_fn1, f1), (pred_fn2, f2), (pred_fn3, f3)], default=lambda: tf.constant(-1), exclusive=True)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(z)) # Output: 12 (because x > 0)


x = tf.constant(0)
z = tf.case([(pred_fn1, f1), (pred_fn2, f2), (pred_fn3, f3)], default=lambda: tf.constant(-1), exclusive=True)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(z)) # Output: 0 (because x == 0)
```

This example showcases `tf.case` handling three possible conditions, each with its corresponding function.  The `exclusive=True` argument ensures only one branch executes. The `default` function handles cases where none of the specified predicates are met.  This approach is crucial for more intricate control flows requiring multiple conditional branches.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is an indispensable resource, providing comprehensive details on the functions and operations discussed.  Consult it for the most up-to-date information and detailed explanations.  Furthermore, studying well-structured TensorFlow tutorials and example projects from reputable sources will solidify your understanding and provide practical insights.  Finally, focusing on the core concepts of computational graphs and tensor manipulation will help grasp the underlying mechanics of TensorFlow's conditional logic implementations.  A thorough understanding of these principles forms a strong base for tackling more complex scenarios.  Thorough exploration of these resources is recommended for optimal understanding and mastery of the techniques presented.
