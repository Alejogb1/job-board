Scheduled notebook executions in Vertex AI, specifically those leveraging managed notebooks instances, often fail despite successful manual runs due to discrepancies in the runtime environment configuration and state. I've encountered this issue multiple times while developing ML pipelines at previous roles, finding the root cause rarely within the notebook’s code itself. The core problem generally stems from differences in how the scheduled execution process isolates the environment compared to the interactive, manual environment. These disparities create challenges across several dimensions, all of which I'll explain below.

First, understanding the isolation mechanisms is paramount. When executing a notebook manually, the user interacts directly with the notebook instance through a browser-based interface. This interface runs within a persistent kernel, which preserves variables, packages, and configurations loaded during the session. This stateful environment allows a notebook to accumulate its working condition as you run each cell, especially when packages are installed using `pip` inside the notebook itself. In contrast, scheduled executions initiate within a separate, transient environment. Each scheduled run creates a fresh kernel instance with no memory of previous executions. This means any package installations or environment modifications performed during manual runs are absent.

The second key area involves environment variable discrepancies. My experience shows that many notebooks rely on environment variables to access data sources or configure application behavior, especially when working with cloud-native resources. Manual executions often inherit the environment variables configured for the user's GCP project or specific instance configurations. Scheduled runs, however, use a minimal set of environment variables unless explicitly provided in the scheduled job’s definition. These variables might include project ID or the notebook's execution parameters but rarely include custom values set within the user's interactive shell or during previous manual runs.

Third, resource access and permissions pose a common hurdle. Manual executions operate within the context of the user’s authenticated session, granting access to resources based on their permissions and roles. Conversely, scheduled jobs run using a service account configured specifically for Vertex AI. This service account requires appropriate permissions to access necessary cloud storage buckets, BigQuery tables, or other resources the notebook uses. I've seen frequent failures because the assigned service account didn't possess the required access, even though the user running the notebook manually did.

Fourth, caching and temporary files contribute to the variability. When working manually, the notebook's temporary file system, often located at `/tmp`, provides a readily available location to store downloaded data or intermediate results. These files persist across cells within the same interactive session. In scheduled runs, `/tmp` is cleared between each execution, requiring modifications in the notebook's logic to re-download data or configure the local storage path appropriately.

Now, let me demonstrate these concepts with three practical code examples and commentary.

**Code Example 1: Demonstrating Package Availability Issues**

```python
import subprocess

try:
    import pandas
    print("pandas is installed")
except ImportError:
   print("pandas is not installed")
   subprocess.check_call(["pip", "install", "pandas"])
   import pandas #re-import to reload the module after installing it
   print("pandas has been installed successfully")


df = pandas.DataFrame({"col1":[1,2], "col2":[3,4]})
print(df)
```

**Commentary:**

This code snippet highlights the package installation issue. When run manually, if `pandas` isn’t already installed, it is installed using `pip`, and the notebook proceeds with using it. However, in a scheduled execution, this `pip install` command runs *every time* the notebook is executed, leading to unnecessary delays or, worse, failures if the network configuration restricts external access. In some scenarios, the library installation might be successful but the newly installed module will not be readily available for the first execution. That's why it's important to try and reload the module. The optimal solution is to pre-install packages in a custom container image for Vertex AI, guaranteeing a consistent environment across manual and scheduled runs. The use of `subprocess.check_call` shows how to run shell commands within a notebook context, an often necessary but tricky task.

**Code Example 2: Environment Variable Differences**

```python
import os

try:
    data_bucket = os.environ['DATA_BUCKET']
    print(f"Data bucket is: {data_bucket}")

    # Attempting to read a file. This could fail for other permission reasons though
    with open(f"/gcs/{data_bucket}/test.txt", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
    
except KeyError:
    print("The 'DATA_BUCKET' environment variable is not set.")
except Exception as e:
    print (f"An exception occurred when trying to read file: {e}")
```

**Commentary:**

This example demonstrates a common problem: missing environment variables. If `DATA_BUCKET` is not defined in the scheduled job’s environment, the script will raise a `KeyError`. My experience shows that manually setting environment variables in the interactive notebook session doesn't automatically translate to the scheduled executions. Therefore, it’s crucial to define all necessary environment variables during the scheduled notebook configuration within Vertex AI. Additionally, the `try`/`except` block handles situations where a file can't be found within the storage bucket, a common issue if the service account doesn't have proper storage permissions.

**Code Example 3: File System Issues**

```python
import os
import time

temp_file_path = "/tmp/temp_data.txt"

# writing to a temporary file

with open(temp_file_path, "w") as f:
  f.write("This data is temporary.")
print(f"Temporary file written to: {temp_file_path}")

time.sleep(5)

#reading the temporary file
try:
  with open(temp_file_path, "r") as f:
    content= f.read()
    print(f"The content of the file is:{content}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: {temp_file_path} not found.")
```

**Commentary:**

This example highlights issues with relying on temporary files in `/tmp`. Manually, the file can be successfully written to and read from, because a temporary filesystem is maintained during the interactive session. However, for scheduled execution, each run has a new, clean file system at `/tmp`. This creates an issue, and the program will fail when trying to find the written file. Therefore, It is important to store any intermediate files in a cloud storage bucket to persist data across scheduled runs. When working with temporary files inside Vertex AI notebooks, is also important to keep in mind the local storage limitations of the notebook instances, so to avoid running out of disk space.

To ensure reliable scheduled notebook execution, I would recommend focusing on the following resources for learning:

1.  **Vertex AI Documentation:** Thoroughly explore the official Google Cloud documentation for Vertex AI, specifically the sections on managed notebooks and scheduled executions. This includes learning how to create custom container images, manage service account permissions, and configure schedule settings.

2.  **Google Cloud Skills Boost:**  This platform offers various learning paths related to Vertex AI, including modules on notebook instance management and scheduling. Hands-on labs and learning quizzes help reinforce your understanding.

3.  **Community Forums and Blogs:** Websites such as Stack Overflow, Medium, and the Google Cloud community forums provide a wealth of insights from other practitioners. Searching for specific error messages or problem areas can reveal solutions that might not be directly apparent from the formal documentation.

By addressing these core areas of configuration discrepancies, environment variable differences, resource access, and file management, one can dramatically reduce failures of scheduled notebook executions in Vertex AI and ensure consistent results across both manual and scheduled workflows.
