TensorFlow TextSum's ability to leverage GPU acceleration hinges critically on the underlying TensorFlow installation and the specific configuration of the model.  My experience developing and deploying large-scale NLP models has shown that while TensorFlow TextSum *can* utilize GPUs, successful execution isn't guaranteed without careful attention to several interdependent factors.  A naive approach will often result in CPU-bound execution, negating the performance benefits a GPU provides.

1. **Clear Explanation:** TensorFlow TextSum, itself, is not a standalone executable. Rather, it represents a high-level application built using TensorFlow, which is a flexible framework capable of utilizing various hardware accelerators, including GPUs.  The crucial aspect lies in ensuring that the TensorFlow installation is configured to recognize and utilize the available CUDA-capable GPUs.  This involves several steps:  first, verifying the presence of compatible NVIDIA drivers; second, installing the correct CUDA toolkit and cuDNN libraries matching the driver and TensorFlow version; and third, ensuring that TensorFlow is compiled with GPU support.  Failure at any of these stages will render even the most meticulously crafted TextSum model CPU-bound.  Furthermore, the model's architecture, particularly its layers and the size of its embedding matrices, also directly impacts GPU utilization. Larger models, with many parameters, will naturally benefit more significantly from GPU acceleration, potentially leading to orders of magnitude improvement in training and inference times compared to CPU-only execution.

Beyond hardware and installation, the code itself needs to be written in a way that allows TensorFlow to effectively distribute computations across the GPU's parallel processing units.  Poorly written or inefficient code can lead to bottlenecks that severely limit the benefits of GPU acceleration, even if the infrastructure is correctly configured.  This often manifests as memory limitations, slow training speeds, or outright execution failures.  Finally, the dataset size plays a significant role.  Smaller datasets might not justify the overhead of GPU computation, while extremely large datasets might require sophisticated data-parallel strategies to fully utilize the available GPU resources.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Verifying GPU Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    print("GPU detected. TensorFlow is configured for GPU usage.")
    #Proceed with model creation and training
else:
    print("GPU not detected. TensorFlow will utilize CPU.  Expect significantly slower performance.")
    # Consider alternative strategies or error handling
```

This code snippet, a routine check I always include in my projects, verifies if TensorFlow can locate and access GPUs.  The output provides an immediate indication of the system's configuration.  Lack of GPU detection points to the installation issue discussed earlier.

**Example 2:  Basic TextSum Model with GPU Specification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Embedding, Dense

# Assuming you've preprocessed your data into 'text' and 'summary' tensors

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length), #Vocab size, embedding dimension, max sentence length
    LSTM(units=256, return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(units=128),
    Dense(units=summary_length, activation='softmax') #summary_length defines output length
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Crucial for GPU usage:
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Specifies GPU 0; adjust if multiple GPUs are available
    model.fit(text, summary, epochs=10, batch_size=64)  # Training the model
```

This example demonstrates a rudimentary TextSum model. The critical part is the `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` block.  This explicitly instructs TensorFlow to execute the model training (`model.fit`) on the specified GPU.  Without this line, TensorFlow might default to CPU execution, even if a GPU is available.  Remember to replace placeholders like `vocab_size`, `embedding_dim`, `max_length`, and `summary_length` with your actual values. The choice of `'adam'` optimizer and `'categorical_crossentropy'` loss function are common choices, but alternatives exist.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple GPUs (Data Parallelism):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() #For multi-GPU usage

with strategy.scope():
    # Define the model architecture within the strategy scope.
    # This ensures model replication across GPUs
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
        LSTM(units=256, return_sequences=True),
        LSTM(units=128),
        Dense(units=summary_length, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(text, summary, epochs=10, batch_size=64) #Training occurs across all available GPUs
```

This example showcases a more advanced technique for handling multiple GPUs.  `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` replicates the model across all available GPUs, enabling data parallelism. This significantly accelerates training for large datasets.  However, its correct implementation relies on a correctly configured multi-GPU system and might need adjustments depending on specific hardware.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  A deep understanding of CUDA programming concepts and practices.  Relevant publications and papers focusing on large-scale NLP model training and optimization.  The NVIDIA developer resources on CUDA and cuDNN.  Textbooks on parallel computing and distributed systems.


In summary, running TensorFlow TextSum on a GPU requires careful attention to system configuration, model implementation, and potentially the use of advanced strategies for handling large datasets and multiple GPUs.  Successful execution hinges on correct TensorFlow installation, explicit GPU specification within the code, and an understanding of the underlying parallel computing principles.  Ignoring any of these points often leads to disappointing performance, even if a powerful GPU is readily available.
