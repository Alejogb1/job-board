The challenge of training a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with a multidiscrete action space lies in adapting the standard DQN algorithm, which typically operates on a single discrete action space. In a multidiscrete setting, the agent must choose an action from multiple independent discrete sets simultaneously. This requires restructuring the network output and modifying the Q-value calculation and optimization process. I've encountered this issue in several robotic control projects involving manipulators with multiple joints, each joint having its own set of discrete actions like ‘move forward,’ ‘move backward,’ or ‘stay still’. Directly applying the canonical DQN algorithm would lead to treating each joint movement combination as a single, high-cardinality discrete action, severely hindering learning due to the large state-action space and the need to explore numerous combinations. The correct approach involves handling each discrete action set independently.

The fundamental modification revolves around representing actions as a vector, with each element corresponding to an action from a specific discrete set. This contrasts with a single integer index representing the chosen action in the standard DQN setup. Therefore, instead of a single Q-value output for each state-action pair, the network must output Q-values for each discrete action set individually. During training, each component of the action vector contributes to the overall reward, and the network must learn to select actions that maximize the cumulative Q-value. This independence simplifies exploration and prevents the combinatorial explosion of the state-action space. This modification requires a change to how the network outputs Q-values and also how the loss is calculated.

Let’s illustrate this with a simplified example of a 2D robot with two joints, each with three possible actions (e.g., -1, 0, 1, representing backward, no movement, forward). The action space is thus [ [-1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1] ], or a two dimensional vector where each dimension is an independet discrete set.

**Code Example 1: Modified Network Architecture**

The following code snippet demonstrates how to modify the network’s output layer to accommodate a multidiscrete action space, assuming the rest of the network structure (convolutional or fully connected layers) is defined and assigned to the variable `base_network`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiDiscreteDQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_network, action_dims):
        super(MultiDiscreteDQN, self).__init__()
        self.base_network = base_network
        self.action_dims = action_dims
        self.q_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(base_network.output_size, dim) for dim in action_dims])

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.base_network(x)
        q_values = [layer(x) for layer in self.q_layers]
        return q_values

# Example Usage (assuming base_network is previously defined with an output_size attribute)
#Let base_network be a simple linear network
base_network = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, 64), nn.ReLU())
base_network.output_size=64
action_dims = [3, 3] # Representing two discrete action spaces with 3 actions each
model = MultiDiscreteDQN(base_network, action_dims)

# Example of the forward pass
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
q_values = model(dummy_input)
print(q_values[0].shape) #output should be torch.Size([1, 3]) - Q-values for the first action space
print(q_values[1].shape) #output should be torch.Size([1, 3]) - Q-values for the second action space
```

Here, `MultiDiscreteDQN` creates a separate linear layer for each dimension of the action vector. During the forward pass, it applies `base_network` to the input and then obtains Q-values for each independent action space, resulting in a list of tensors. In our example of the two-joint robot, the model will output two tensors of size (batch_size, 3), representing Q-values for the first joint and Q-values for the second joint.

**Code Example 2: Modified Action Selection**

During action selection, a standard DQN chooses the action with the highest Q-value. In our multidiscrete setting, this must happen for each discrete action set independently:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

def select_action(q_values, action_dims, epsilon=0.1):
    action = []
    for i in range(len(action_dims)):
      if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action.append(np.random.randint(0, action_dims[i])) #Exploration
      else:
        action.append(torch.argmax(q_values[i], dim=1).item()) #Exploitation
    return action

# Example Usage
# Assuming we have q_values from the example above
q_values = [torch.randn(1, 3), torch.randn(1, 3)]
action = select_action(q_values, action_dims)
print(action) #Output will be an array like [1, 2] meaning, select action 1 for the first action space and action 2 for the second
```

The `select_action` function iterates through each action set’s Q-values. It applies epsilon-greedy exploration, either choosing a random action within the bounds of each dimension of the action space or selecting the action with the highest Q-value for that specific dimension. Each output action is therefore chosen independently.

**Code Example 3: Modified Loss Calculation**

The loss function must be adapted to the multidiscrete nature of the action space. Since Q-values are output separately for each discrete set, the loss must be computed independently for each of them and summed together:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

def compute_loss(q_values, target_q_values, actions, discount_factor, optimizer):
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    loss = 0
    for i in range(len(q_values)):
        selected_q_value = q_values[i].gather(1, torch.tensor([[actions[i]]]).long())
        target_value = target_q_values[i].gather(1, torch.tensor([[actions[i]]]).long())
        loss+=criterion(selected_q_value, target_value)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return loss

# Example Usage
#Assuming we have q_values and the next_q_values, and the actions
q_values_example = [torch.randn(1, 3), torch.randn(1, 3)] #Q values for the current state
target_q_values_example = [torch.randn(1, 3), torch.randn(1, 3)] #Q values for the next state
actions_example = [1, 2]  # Selected action
discount_factor=0.99
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

loss = compute_loss(q_values_example, target_q_values_example, actions_example, discount_factor, optimizer)
print(loss)
```

The `compute_loss` function iterates through the predicted Q-values and target Q-values (from the target network, not shown here), calculating a mean squared error (MSE) loss for each action dimension using the specific action selected. The loss is then summed across all dimensions and backpropagated. Crucially, this ensures that each action independently contributes to the loss, allowing the network to effectively learn the optimal policy for each independent action set, without having to try to learn all combinations as a single discrete action. The standard backpropagation mechanism of Pytorch takes care of how the loss is used to update the network weights.

Key elements for successful training in this domain also involve applying techniques such as: experience replay to break correlations in the training data and to improve data efficiency, target networks to stabilize learning, and careful hyperparameter tuning which depends on the environment, and potentially a larger network architecture. The exploration parameter, epsilon, also needs careful handling and gradual reduction, since the agent starts with exploration and moves towards exploitation.

For further exploration, I recommend examining resources on deep reinforcement learning, focusing on: DQN and its variations, the concept of discrete and multidiscrete action spaces, and implementation specifics in PyTorch and Tensorflow. Tutorials on deep reinforcement learning will also help understanding the full training process including exploration strategies, memory replay, and target networks, and their corresponding implementations. These sources usually cover important aspects of training such agents, focusing on practical implementation details as well as the underlying theoretical aspects.
