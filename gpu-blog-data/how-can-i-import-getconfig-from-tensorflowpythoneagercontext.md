The `get_config` function, seemingly available under `tensorflow.python.eager.context` in some TensorFlow environments, is not intended for direct public use and its location is unstable. This function accesses internal configurations related to TensorFlow's eager execution context. Attempting to import it directly is prone to breakage across TensorFlow versions and should be avoided for robust, maintainable code. I've encountered this problem firsthand during a project migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x where legacy code relied on internal access for specific debugging purposes. Direct import paths for internal APIs are subject to change with minimal notice.

The primary problem lies in the fact that `tensorflow.python.eager.context` is an internal module. While you might find tutorials or forum posts demonstrating a direct import from this path, TensorFlow's API explicitly discourages this. Internal modules are designed for TensorFlow's internal workings and are not part of the supported, stable public API. Consequently, their structures, functions, and import paths can shift between patch and minor releases. Thus, any code relying on such imports risks breaking unexpectedly. Instead, the focus should be on utilizing TensorFlow's officially supported mechanisms for accessing and configuring the eager execution behavior.

Direct access to internal configuration details through `get_config`, typically used in some development or debugging scenarios, generally entails querying information about the current eager context, such as device placement strategies, memory management settings, and graph execution options. However, these settings should ideally be controlled through supported configuration functions, environment variables, or through the `tf.config` module when customization is needed.

The core issue Iâ€™ve observed with the `get_config` request is its lack of public interface availability. There is no documented API to access the equivalent information in a guaranteed, forward-compatible manner. This highlights the importance of adhering to the public API contract when working with TensorFlow or any other similar library. Directly accessing internal functions circumvents the careful versioning and stability promises of the public interface.

Furthermore, while you might be tempted to inspect the source code of the `tensorflow.python` module to find a potential replacement for `get_config`, this approach carries similar risks. Internal implementations can be altered or completely removed between different TensorFlow releases. Therefore, relying on internal details exposes your project to the same fragility we are trying to avoid.

Let's explore some examples to highlight the proper approach using public API tools.

**Example 1: Checking Eager Execution Status**

Instead of using `get_config` to check if eager execution is enabled, use `tf.executing_eagerly()`. This provides a supported, guaranteed way to check the execution mode of TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect approach (using internal, unstable API - do NOT use)
# from tensorflow.python.eager.context import get_config #This won't work.

# Correct approach using the public API
if tf.executing_eagerly():
    print("Eager execution is enabled.")
else:
    print("Eager execution is disabled.")

# Example operation under eager execution
a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
print("Result of matrix multiplication:", c.numpy()) # .numpy() is how we get the actual value out

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)
if tf.executing_eagerly():
  print("Eager execution is enabled after setting function to run eagerly")

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(False)
if tf.executing_eagerly():
  print("Eager execution is enabled even after setting function to run not eagerly") # This will print since Eager is still on.
```

This example demonstrates the preferred way of determining whether eager execution is enabled, rather than relying on an internal function that might be removed or changed. The `tf.executing_eagerly()` method is a stable part of the public API.  The ability to set function execution allows for function code to be run eagerly in a hybrid approach, however the global eagerly status is not changed.

**Example 2: Configuring Device Placement**

Another use case for examining configurations might involve device placement. Previously, the `get_config` method might have provided details about device allocation. Instead, use the `tf.config.list_physical_devices()` function to inspect available devices. We can also use the `tf.config.set_visible_devices()` to modify visible devices as needed.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Inspecting available physical devices (e.g., GPUs, CPUs)
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
print("Available Physical Devices:", physical_devices)

# Specifying which physical devices to utilize (here we're grabbing the first gpu and using it)
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
  tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')

# Check to verify we are running on this device
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
  a = tf.constant([[1,2],[3,4]])
  b = tf.constant([[5,6],[7,8]])
  c = tf.matmul(a,b)
  print(c)


```

This example replaces direct configuration queries with the officially supported approach to enumerate and manage device resources within TensorFlow. You should avoid accessing internal configurations directly and prefer using public mechanisms. The example also shows the preferred method for setting device placement via the  `with tf.device()` method.

**Example 3: Enabling/Disabling Eager Execution**

While TensorFlow 2.x defaults to eager execution, if for some reason you wanted to disable it, you would use `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` at the beginning of your code (although this is highly discouraged). Avoid accessing internal configurations, or making modifications using internals.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Use at the VERY beginning of your code to disable eager execution (NOT RECOMMENDED)
# tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

# Check if eager execution is on
if tf.executing_eagerly():
  print("Eager is enabled (normally by default)")
else:
  print("Eager is disabled")

# Here we will get a tf.tensor as an output if eager is not on.
a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
print("Result of matrix multiplication:", c) # This will print a tensor object

# Enable/Disable eagerness in functions
@tf.function
def my_function(x,y):
  c = tf.matmul(x,y)
  return c

a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
c = my_function(a,b)
print("Result of function calculation",c)

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)
c = my_function(a,b)
print("Result of function calculation eager",c)


```
This snippet shows how eager execution can be modified for functions but not globally, and also shows the way to globally disable eager execution in the less common use case. Note again that it is not recommended to disable eager execution in most modern TensorFlow use cases. `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly` shows how a function can be configured for either eager or graph execution.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For understanding TensorFlow best practices, I would strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation. The "Guide" section provides clear explanations of various functionalities and their intended use. Specifically, review the guides on eager execution, device placement, and the `tf.config` module. I find the API reference to be invaluable, so consider familiarizing yourself with that, as well, particularly for the modules you use frequently. Also, checking any tutorials on the official TensorFlow website can be very beneficial. Finally, experiment in a sandbox environment. It is crucial to familiarize yourself by testing the suggested, supported methodologies and seeing how they behave.

In summary, avoid direct access to internal modules like `tensorflow.python.eager.context`. Utilize public API functions and configuration methods offered by TensorFlow. This practice ensures the stability and longevity of your code, minimizing the risk of unexpected breakage during future TensorFlow updates. Accessing internal, unstable functionalities can initially provide a solution, but it inevitably causes headaches later. Sticking to the supported API is the responsible choice when working with frameworks like TensorFlow.
