TensorFlow 2's callback mechanism enables sophisticated model management during training, and the ability to reload models based on performance metrics is crucial for scenarios involving long training runs or resource constraints. I’ve used this approach extensively in deep learning projects requiring continuous, adaptive training. Achieving this requires leveraging the `ModelCheckpoint` callback, and understanding how best to implement it, specifically when aiming to reload from saved checkpoints within the same training loop.

The central idea is to periodically save the model’s weights (and potentially optimizer state) using `ModelCheckpoint`. This callback monitors specified metrics, and saves the model only when an improvement is detected according to the monitor and mode (e.g., minimum loss or maximum accuracy). The mechanism to reload then involves checking for existing checkpoints and loading weights before commencing a new training epoch, thereby enabling training from where it left off. A critical aspect often missed is the potential need to manage the optimizer's state, which is not automatically reloaded unless explicitly requested in the checkpoint configuration.

Let's consider three practical scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Basic Checkpointing and Reloading**

In this case, the objective is to save the model weights whenever a new validation loss minimum is observed. If training stops prematurely and must be restarted, we’ll check for the last saved checkpoint and restore the weights before resuming. This is the most straightforward approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def train_model_with_checkpoint(model, train_data, val_data, checkpoint_dir, epochs=10):
    checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'best_model.h5'),
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        save_weights_only=True,
        mode='min',
        verbose=1
    )
    
    # Check for existing checkpoint
    checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'best_model.h5')
    if os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):
        print(f"Loading weights from: {checkpoint_path}")
        model.load_weights(checkpoint_path)
    
    model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=epochs, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate some dummy data
    train_x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
    train_y = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    train_y = tf.one_hot(train_y, depth=10)
    val_x = tf.random.normal((50, 10))
    val_y = tf.random.uniform((50,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    val_y = tf.one_hot(val_y, depth=10)
    
    model = create_model()
    checkpoint_directory = "./checkpoints"
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_directory, exist_ok=True)

    train_model_with_checkpoint(model, (train_x, train_y), (val_x, val_y), checkpoint_directory, epochs=5)
    print("Training completed 1st run.\n")

    train_model_with_checkpoint(model, (train_x, train_y), (val_x, val_y), checkpoint_directory, epochs=5)
    print("Training completed 2nd run.\n")

```
In this example, `create_model` initializes the neural network structure and compiles it with an optimizer. The `train_model_with_checkpoint` function orchestrates training. The crucial parts are the `ModelCheckpoint` callback instantiated to save the best weights based on validation loss and the conditional loading of saved weights based on file existence. The `save_weights_only` parameter is set to `True` because we're not saving the whole model, only the parameters. This makes loading quicker and is preferred for continued training when the model architecture does not change. If the checkpoint file exists, the script loads the weights before commencing the training. This method does not, however, save or restore the state of the optimizer.

**Scenario 2: Checkpointing and Reloading with Optimizer State**

When dealing with optimizers like Adam or SGD with momentum, it's imperative to restore the optimizer's internal state to maintain training consistency. This usually involves saving and reloading the entire model object using `save_weights_only=False` or using the `save_format='tf'` parameter for the `ModelCheckpoint`. The checkpoint format is crucial here.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def train_model_with_checkpoint_and_optimizer(model, train_data, val_data, checkpoint_dir, epochs=10):
    checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'model_checkpoint'),
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        save_weights_only=False,
        mode='min',
        save_format='tf',
        verbose=1
    )

    # Check for existing checkpoint
    checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'model_checkpoint')
    if os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):
        print(f"Loading model from: {checkpoint_path}")
        model = tf.keras.models.load_model(checkpoint_path)

    model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=epochs, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate some dummy data
    train_x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
    train_y = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    train_y = tf.one_hot(train_y, depth=10)
    val_x = tf.random.normal((50, 10))
    val_y = tf.random.uniform((50,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    val_y = tf.one_hot(val_y, depth=10)
        
    model = create_model()
    checkpoint_directory = "./checkpoint_opt"
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_directory, exist_ok=True)

    train_model_with_checkpoint_and_optimizer(model, (train_x, train_y), (val_x, val_y), checkpoint_directory, epochs=5)
    print("Training completed 1st run.\n")

    train_model_with_checkpoint_and_optimizer(model, (train_x, train_y), (val_x, val_y), checkpoint_directory, epochs=5)
    print("Training completed 2nd run.\n")
```
Here, we set `save_weights_only=False` and `save_format='tf'` which ensures that the model structure, along with its weights and optimizer state, are serialized to a TensorFlow SavedModel format. Then, we load the entire model using `tf.keras.models.load_model`, which reconstructs the architecture and restores both the weights and optimizer’s state. This is vital for continuity in the training process when using optimizers that rely on past gradients.

**Scenario 3: Dynamically Restart Training**

A more nuanced case involves deciding if, and when, to reload a checkpoint from within the training loop based on some criteria other than mere existence of the file, such as user input or a performance monitoring system. This can be implemented by creating a custom callback that can decide on when to load a specific checkpoint or decide when to trigger loading.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

class DynamicReloadCheckpoint(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_dir, monitor='val_loss', mode='min'):
        super(DynamicReloadCheckpoint, self).__init__()
        self.checkpoint_dir = checkpoint_dir
        self.monitor = monitor
        self.mode = mode
        self.best_metric = float('inf') if mode == 'min' else float('-inf')
        self.loaded_checkpoint = False

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        logs = logs or {}
        current_metric = logs.get(self.monitor)
        if current_metric is None:
            return

        if (self.mode == 'min' and current_metric < self.best_metric) or \
           (self.mode == 'max' and current_metric > self.best_metric):
            self.best_metric = current_metric
            self.loaded_checkpoint = False # reset when new best is found
            return # skip checkpoint reload when performance improves

        if not self.loaded_checkpoint:
            checkpoint_path = os.path.join(self.checkpoint_dir, 'model_checkpoint')
            if os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):
                print(f"\nLoading model from: {checkpoint_path}")
                self.model = tf.keras.models.load_model(checkpoint_path)
                self.loaded_checkpoint = True
                print("\nModel Loaded Successfully for this epoch. Resuming from Checkpoint.")

def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def train_model_with_dynamic_checkpoint(model, train_data, val_data, checkpoint_dir, epochs=10):
    checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'model_checkpoint'),
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        save_weights_only=False,
        mode='min',
        save_format='tf',
        verbose=1
    )
    
    dynamic_reload_callback = DynamicReloadCheckpoint(checkpoint_dir=checkpoint_dir)

    model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=epochs, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback, dynamic_reload_callback])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate some dummy data
    train_x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
    train_y = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    train_y = tf.one_hot(train_y, depth=10)
    val_x = tf.random.normal((50, 10))
    val_y = tf.random.uniform((50,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    val_y = tf.one_hot(val_y, depth=10)

    model = create_model()
    checkpoint_directory = "./checkpoint_dynamic"
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_directory, exist_ok=True)

    train_model_with_dynamic_checkpoint(model, (train_x, train_y), (val_x, val_y), checkpoint_directory, epochs=5)
    print("Training completed 1st run.\n")
    train_model_with_dynamic_checkpoint(model, (train_x, train_y), (val_x, val_y), checkpoint_directory, epochs=5)
    print("Training completed 2nd run.\n")
```

Here, the `DynamicReloadCheckpoint` custom callback is used to decide whether or not to reload a model. A new best metric is saved in the `best_metric` attribute of the class. Every epoch end, if there is no improvement in the metric (`val_loss`) then the model is reloaded from the last checkpoint, otherwise training will resume as normal.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation regarding the `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` functions.  Additionally, examining examples related to custom TensorFlow callbacks can deepen the understanding of the framework's flexibility.  Textbooks covering advanced deep learning techniques often dedicate chapters to best practices for training and checkpointing, offering valuable theoretical and practical insights.  Finally, community forums dedicated to TensorFlow and machine learning can be an excellent source for specific use case solutions.
