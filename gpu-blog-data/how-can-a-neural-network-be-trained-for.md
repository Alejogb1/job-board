Negative log-likelihood (NLL) provides a robust framework for training neural networks on regression tasks, particularly when dealing with non-Gaussian output distributions.  My experience working on financial time series prediction highlighted the limitations of mean squared error (MSE) when the target variable exhibited heavy tails or significant skewness.  Switching to NLL, coupled with an appropriate output distribution, yielded substantially improved results.  The core principle lies in maximizing the likelihood of the observed data given the network's parameters, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood.


**1.  Explanation**

The choice of loss function is crucial in neural network training.  While MSE is a popular choice for regression, its assumption of Gaussian noise may not always hold.  NLL, on the other hand, allows for flexibility in modeling the output distribution.  This is achieved by employing a probability distribution function (PDF) that better captures the characteristics of the target variable.  The NLL is defined as the negative logarithm of the likelihood function.  The likelihood function represents the probability of observing the target values given the network's predictions and the chosen PDF parameters.

For a dataset of *n* observations {(xᵢ, yᵢ)}, where xᵢ represents the input and yᵢ the target value, the likelihood function, given a chosen PDF parameterized by θ (which is often the output of the neural network), is:

L(θ|y₁, ..., yₙ) = Πᵢ  p(yᵢ|xᵢ, θ)


where p(yᵢ|xᵢ, θ) is the probability density function evaluated at yᵢ given the input xᵢ and parameters θ.  The negative log-likelihood is then:

NLL(θ|y₁, ..., yₙ) = - Σᵢ log p(yᵢ|xᵢ, θ)


Minimizing this NLL through backpropagation optimizes the network's parameters θ to maximize the likelihood of the observed data.  The selection of the PDF is critical.  Common choices include:

* **Gaussian:**  Suitable for relatively symmetric data with constant variance. While MSE implicitly assumes a Gaussian, using NLL with a Gaussian allows for explicit parameterization of the mean and variance.
* **Laplace:** Robust to outliers compared to Gaussian, suitable for heavy-tailed distributions.
* **Poisson:** Appropriate for count data.
* **Gamma:** Suitable for skewed, positive-valued data.


The specific PDF choice depends entirely on the characteristics of the target variable.  Incorrectly assuming a Gaussian distribution, as is often implicitly done with MSE, can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly if the data violates this assumption.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

These examples illustrate training a neural network for regression using NLL with different probability distributions, using a fictional dataset for illustrative purposes.  I've focused on clarity and avoided unnecessary complexities.

**Example 1: Gaussian Distribution**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Fictional dataset generation (replace with your actual data)
X = torch.randn(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features
y = 2*X[:, 0] + 3*X[:, 1] + torch.randn(100)  # Linear relationship with Gaussian noise

# Neural network model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 50),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(50, 1)
)

# Negative log-likelihood loss for Gaussian
def gaussian_nll(mu, sigma, y):
    return 0.5 * torch.log(2 * torch.pi * sigma**2) + 0.5 * ((y - mu)**2) / sigma**2

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    mu = model(X)
    sigma = torch.ones_like(mu)  # Assume constant variance for simplicity
    loss = torch.mean(gaussian_nll(mu.squeeze(), sigma.squeeze(), y))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```

This example utilizes a simple linear model and assumes a constant variance for the Gaussian distribution.  In real-world applications, the variance could be learned by the network as well.  The `gaussian_nll` function explicitly calculates the negative log-likelihood for a Gaussian distribution.

**Example 2: Laplace Distribution**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (same fictional dataset as Example 1) ...

# Neural network model (same as Example 1)

# Negative log-likelihood loss for Laplace
def laplace_nll(mu, b, y):
    return torch.log(2 * b) + torch.abs(y - mu) / b

# Optimizer (same as Example 1)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    mu = model(X)
    b = torch.ones_like(mu) # Assume constant scale parameter for simplicity
    loss = torch.mean(laplace_nll(mu.squeeze(), b.squeeze(), y))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example demonstrates using the Laplace distribution, which is more robust to outliers than the Gaussian.  The scale parameter `b` is assumed constant here for simplicity, but it can also be learned as a network output for increased flexibility.


**Example 3:  Using a Distribution Family (e.g.,  `torch.distributions`)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.distributions as dist

# ... (same fictional dataset as Example 1) ...

# Neural network model (modified to output parameters for a distribution)
class RegressionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(10, 50),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(50, 2) # Output mu and log(sigma) for Gaussian
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        params = self.linear(x)
        mu = params[:, 0]
        sigma = torch.exp(params[:, 1]) # Ensure sigma > 0
        return mu, sigma

model = RegressionModel()

# Optimizer (same as Example 1)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    mu, sigma = model(X)
    gaussian = dist.Normal(mu, sigma)
    loss = -gaussian.log_prob(y).mean() # Utilize built-in log_prob
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```

This example leverages `torch.distributions` for a more structured approach. The network outputs the parameters of the Gaussian distribution directly, enhancing modularity and readability.  This approach extends easily to other distributions available in `torch.distributions`.
