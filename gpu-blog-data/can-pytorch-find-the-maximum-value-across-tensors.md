PyTorch, by design, provides flexible tensor operations that allow finding maximum values across tensors, even when their dimensions differ. The key consideration isn't whether dimensions match identically, but rather how you intend to aggregate those values based on the context of the computation. I have frequently encountered this when working on dynamic batch processing for recurrent neural networks where sequences have variable lengths, and thus tensor shapes differ between batch elements. Direct element-wise comparisons or operations like broadcasting can become problematic without careful implementation. The solution lies in judiciously applying reduction operations such as `torch.max()` along specified dimensions or using specialized functions designed to handle such cases.

The core problem is not a limitation in PyTorch’s capabilities, but rather a matter of defining what "maximum value" means when tensors have different shapes. If we are looking for the single largest number within a collection of tensors, that is achievable. However, if you expect to perform element-wise maximum operations like you might on arrays with compatible shapes, then broadcast behavior or masking strategies must be deployed. I’ll illustrate these nuances using concrete code examples.

**Example 1: Finding the Global Maximum**

Here, I'll demonstrate how to find the single largest value among multiple tensors, regardless of their shapes. Assume I have several tensors resulting from different processing branches:

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[-1, 0], [7, 8]])
tensor3 = torch.tensor([9, 10])

tensors = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]

max_values = []

for tensor in tensors:
  max_values.append(torch.max(tensor))

global_max = torch.max(torch.stack(max_values))

print(f"Tensors: {tensors}")
print(f"Global Maximum: {global_max}")
```

In this example, `torch.max(tensor)` for each tensor will extract its maximum value (not the index). I have then gathered these maxima into a list, `max_values`. After that I have used `torch.stack()` to transform `max_values` into a tensor and find the maximum value within it. In essence, I transformed the problem from finding the maximum across differently shaped tensors to finding the maximum within a collection of single scalar values by first reducing each tensor to its respective max. I have used `torch.stack()` here as it creates a new tensor from the sequence. Concatenation (`torch.cat`) would not be appropriate here, as these are scalars, not tensors of equal dimension. This method works regardless of tensor size or dimension as long as the input tensors do not have zero elements.

**Example 2: Element-wise Maximum with Broadcasting (where applicable)**

For tensors of compatible or broadcastable shapes, `torch.maximum()` applies element-wise maximum. This example demonstrates handling differing dimensions when they conform to PyTorch’s broadcasting rules, a common scenario when dealing with batch processing where a single value must be applied to each batch element.

```python
import torch

tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor_b = torch.tensor([5, 0])

elementwise_max = torch.maximum(tensor_a, tensor_b)

print(f"Tensor A: {tensor_a}")
print(f"Tensor B: {tensor_b}")
print(f"Element-wise Maximum: {elementwise_max}")
```

Here, `tensor_b` with shape `(2,)` is broadcast to match `tensor_a`'s shape `(2, 2)`. Each element in the first row of `tensor_a` is compared to the first element of `tensor_b`, and each element in the second row of `tensor_a` is compared to the second element of `tensor_b`. The result `elementwise_max` is then a tensor of the same shape as `tensor_a` containing these element-wise maximums. Note that broadcasting will only function when tensor dimensions are either exactly the same or one is equal to 1. Broadcasting does not apply to shapes such as (3,2) and (2,3).

**Example 3: Masking for Element-wise Operations with Varying Dimensions**

When tensors do not have compatible dimensions for broadcasting, element-wise operations require strategies to align data or, in some scenarios, completely mask out contributions from mismatched elements. Consider a situation where each sequence has its length in a batch, thus creating tensors with varying dimensions. A naive implementation would lead to errors when doing batch parallelization. I will present a simplified example here and point to more complex methods in the resource recommendations below.

```python
import torch

tensor_seq1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
tensor_seq2 = torch.tensor([[7, 8], [9, 10]])
tensor_seq3 = torch.tensor([[11,12,13,14], [15,16,17,18]])


max_len = max(tensor_seq1.size(1), tensor_seq2.size(1), tensor_seq3.size(1))

masked_tensors = []
for tensor in [tensor_seq1, tensor_seq2, tensor_seq3]:
    pad_width = max_len - tensor.size(1)
    padding = torch.zeros(tensor.size(0), pad_width, dtype = tensor.dtype)
    masked_tensors.append(torch.cat((tensor,padding), dim=1))

stacked_tensors = torch.stack(masked_tensors)

elementwise_max = torch.max(stacked_tensors, dim = 0).values

print(f"Tensor 1: {tensor_seq1}")
print(f"Tensor 2: {tensor_seq2}")
print(f"Tensor 3: {tensor_seq3}")
print(f"Masked Tensors: {masked_tensors}")
print(f"Element-wise Max: {elementwise_max}")
```
In this case, I computed the maximum length over all input sequences, represented by tensors `tensor_seq1`, `tensor_seq2`, and `tensor_seq3`. Then for each sequence, I padded the right side with zeros such that each sequence now had equal length. After that, I use `torch.stack()` to combine these masked tensors along a new dimension. Finally, I find element-wise maxima over this new dimension. The use of zero padding here introduces a slight caveat as maximum of zeros will not yield any information. Usually in this case, masking and special loss functions would be needed when training, which has not been addressed in the scope of this response.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding, I suggest exploring resources that discuss these core concepts:
1.  **PyTorch Documentation on Tensor Operations**: The official PyTorch documentation offers detailed explanations of functions like `torch.max()`, `torch.maximum()`, `torch.stack()`, `torch.cat()`, and various other functions and methods for tensor manipulation. In addition, it contains extensive discussions of broadcasting rules and how they are used across different tensor operations.
2.  **PyTorch Tutorials on RNNs:** If you are working with sequences, the official PyTorch tutorials focused on Recurrent Neural Networks and sequence modeling are invaluable. These tutorials include practical examples of handling variable-length sequences and provide common strategies for batching such data effectively, often involving padding and masking techniques.
3. **Papers on Masking Strategies in Deep Learning:** Academic papers discussing masking strategies in deep learning can provide additional insights into best practices when dealing with tensors of varying dimensions, especially for use in attention mechanisms, and loss functions where zero-padding can be problematic. These frequently include the use of specific mask tensors.

In closing, PyTorch can find maximum values across tensors with different dimensions, provided that the operations are applied with appropriate attention to context, whether it's to extract a single global max, perform an element-wise operation with proper broadcast, or implement a masked element-wise operation with manual padding. When dimensions do not exactly match, then strategies such as reduction, padding, masking, or broadcasting must be used to establish consistent behavior. A thoughtful approach to the problem is paramount in using PyTorch effectively.
