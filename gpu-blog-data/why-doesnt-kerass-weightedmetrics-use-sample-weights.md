The core issue with Keras's `weighted_metrics` not utilizing sample weights lies in the fundamental difference between how metrics are calculated during training versus evaluation, and the inherent design choices in Keras's API.  My experience debugging similar inconsistencies in large-scale model training pipelines has highlighted this critical distinction.  While sample weights directly influence the loss function's gradient calculation during training, affecting model parameter updates, they are *not* directly incorporated into the calculation of metrics like accuracy or precision during training *or* evaluation.  This is not a bug; rather, it's a consequence of the way metrics are aggregated.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras's `weighted_metrics` argument, usually employed within the `compile` method of a model, serves a distinct purpose related to *class weighting* rather than *sample weighting*.  Class weighting addresses class imbalance by assigning different importance to different classes during the *loss* calculation. This ensures that the model doesn't overemphasize the majority class and underfit the minority class.  Sample weights, on the other hand, assign different importance to *individual data points*.  Each data point contributes to the loss calculation proportionally to its weight.  This is useful when some data points are considered more reliable or informative than others.

The confusion arises because both techniques aim to influence the overall model behavior.  However, their mechanisms differ significantly. Class weighting modifies the contribution of different classes to the *loss function*, while sample weighting modifies the contribution of individual samples to the *loss function*.  Metrics, unlike the loss, are generally aggregated without explicit weighting of individual samples.  The `weighted_metrics` argument in Keras's `compile` method only handles class weighting, achieved by modifying the loss function internally.  It does not provide a mechanism to directly incorporate sample weights into the metric calculations.  This design choice simplifies the metric aggregation process and maintains consistency across training and evaluation phases.  The metric's calculation remains consistent – a straightforward average or other relevant aggregation across all batches – independent of sample weights used in loss calculation.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Demonstrating Class Weighting with `weighted_metrics`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

class_weights = {0: 0.2, 1: 0.8}  # Example class weights
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'],
              weighted_metrics=['Precision', 'Recall'],
              loss_weights=class_weights) # Note: loss_weights, not weighted_metrics

# Sample data generation (replace with your actual data)
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100, 1), maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weights)

```

This example showcases how `class_weight` impacts the loss calculation, influencing model training and indirectly affecting the output of the metrics. Note that `weighted_metrics` doesn't directly use sample weights, but class weights affect the overall model performance, consequently impacting the metric values.


**Example 2:  Implementing Sample Weighting for Loss Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Sample data generation (replace with your actual data)
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100, 1), maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
sample_weights = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0.5, maxval=1.5) #Sample weights

model.fit(x_train, y_train, sample_weight=sample_weights, epochs=10)

```
Here, `sample_weight` directly influences the loss calculation but does not affect the calculation of metrics like accuracy.  Metrics are aggregated across all samples, regardless of their weights.


**Example 3:  Manual Weighted Metric Calculation**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# ... (Model training as in Example 2) ...

y_true = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])
y_pred = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 0])
sample_weights = np.array([0.8, 1.2, 0.5, 1.5, 1.0])

weighted_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weights)
print(f"Weighted Accuracy: {weighted_accuracy}")
```

This demonstrates how to calculate a weighted metric manually using scikit-learn after model training is complete.  This approach offers more direct control,  allowing custom weighting schemes for your specific evaluation needs.  However, this is a post-hoc calculation; it doesn't influence model training itself.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation on model compilation, the TensorFlow documentation on custom metrics and loss functions, and a comprehensive machine learning textbook covering class imbalance and weighted learning techniques.  Additionally, exploring the source code of Keras's metrics implementation can provide deeper insight into its internal workings.

In summary, Keras's `weighted_metrics` does *not* use sample weights because its design focuses on class weighting for loss calculation, not individual sample weighting during metric aggregation. Sample weights affect the loss function and consequently the model parameters, but not the metric calculation itself.  For weighted metric evaluations, post-training calculations using libraries like scikit-learn provide a more appropriate approach.
