The core issue underlying `RuntimeError` exceptions stemming from PyTorch's `torch.view()` function is the incompatibility between the requested view's shape and the underlying tensor's storage.  Specifically, `view()` attempts to reinterpret the existing data without copying, imposing strict constraints on the resulting tensor's dimensions relative to the original tensor's stride information.  This contrasts with operations like `reshape()`, which *can* involve data copying to accommodate arbitrary shape changes.  My experience debugging numerous production models highlighted this subtlety; neglecting the stride implications frequently led to unexpected errors.

**1.  Explanation of Stride and its Relation to `view()`**

A tensor's stride describes the number of elements to jump in the underlying storage to access the next element along each dimension.  Consider a 2D tensor:

```
tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]])
```

Its storage is contiguous – elements are laid out sequentially in memory.  However, the stride isn't solely determined by the shape.  The stride describes how you move through memory: a stride of (1,3) means you move 1 element to get to the next row and 3 elements to get to the next column.  A contiguous tensor of this shape would have a stride of (3,1).


`view()` mandates that the new shape's elements can be accessed via strides that are compatible with the original tensor's underlying storage.  If you request a view with a shape that implies strides that would 'jump over' elements or access memory locations outside the tensor's allocated storage, `view()` will raise a `RuntimeError`. This happens because `view()` attempts to create a new tensor *without copying data*, relying solely on a different interpretation of the existing storage.  An incompatible stride request makes this interpretation impossible.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Successful View**

```python
import torch

x = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Original Tensor:\n", x)
print("Original Stride:", x.stride())

y = x.view(3, 2)  # Compatible stride
print("\nViewed Tensor:\n", y)
print("Viewed Stride:", y.stride())
```

This example showcases a successful `view()`. The original tensor's layout allows a simple rearrangement into (3, 2) without violating stride compatibility.  The underlying data remains the same; only the interpretation of the data’s organization changes.  Observe that the stride changes to accommodate the new shape, reflecting the reinterpretation of data access.

**Example 2: RuntimeError due to Incompatible Stride**

```python
import torch

x = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Original Tensor:\n", x)
print("Original Stride:", x.stride())

try:
    y = x.view(4, 2)  # Incompatible stride – attempt to reshape into 4 rows which is not possible without data copying
    print("\nViewed Tensor:\n", y)
    print("Viewed Stride:", y.stride())
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"\nRuntimeError: {e}")
```

Here, we attempt to view the tensor as a (4, 2) tensor. This is impossible without copying data. The original tensor only contains 6 elements. Attempting to reinterpret it as an 8-element tensor would require accessing memory outside the tensor's allocated space.  `view()` prevents this, throwing a `RuntimeError`.  The error message clearly indicates a mismatch between the expected and available data.

**Example 3:  RuntimeError with Non-contiguous Tensor**

```python
import torch

x = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
x = x.T  # Transpose – creates a non-contiguous tensor
print("Original Tensor:\n", x)
print("Original Stride:", x.stride())

try:
    y = x.view(3, 2)  #Even though shape is compatible, non-contiguous tensor raises error.
    print("\nViewed Tensor:\n", y)
    print("Viewed Stride:", y.stride())
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"\nRuntimeError: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates that even shape compatibility isn't sufficient.  Transposing the original tensor makes it non-contiguous; its elements are no longer laid out sequentially in memory.   The stride changes reflect this.  `view()` cannot reinterpret the non-contiguous storage without copying data. Therefore, attempting `view()` again leads to a `RuntimeError`.  This highlights the importance of the underlying storage's contiguity for the success of `view()`.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I recommend carefully studying the PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation, particularly the sections detailing `view()`, `reshape()`, and tensor strides.  The official tutorials on tensor manipulation and memory management are invaluable.  Furthermore, exploring advanced tensor manipulation techniques and working through detailed examples involving various tensor shapes and strides will solidify your understanding.  Debugging tools like PyTorch's built-in debugging utilities or a dedicated Python debugger (such as pdb) will aid in identifying the precise point where the `RuntimeError` occurs and inspecting the relevant tensor's properties. Finally, referencing external resources focusing on low-level memory management in Python and the underlying data structures in PyTorch can deepen your insight into these operations.  Thorough understanding of these concepts is crucial for proficient PyTorch development, preventing unexpected errors in more complex scenarios.  Failing to account for these factors often manifests in insidious bugs that are challenging to debug in large-scale model training pipelines.
