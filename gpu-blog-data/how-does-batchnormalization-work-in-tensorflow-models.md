Batch Normalization (BN) in TensorFlow significantly improves the training of deep neural networks by addressing the internal covariate shift problem.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects at a previous company highlighted its crucial role in stabilizing training and accelerating convergence.  The core mechanism involves normalizing the activations of a layer across a batch of training examples, effectively reducing the distribution shift between layers and making training less sensitive to the initialization of network weights.  This normalization process is then followed by a learned scaling and shifting operation, enabling the network to learn the optimal activation distribution for each layer.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The BN operation transforms the input tensor `x` (a mini-batch of activations) by first calculating the mini-batch mean and variance along the feature dimension.  This is typically performed across all samples within a mini-batch, excluding the batch size dimension. The formula is as follows:

* **μ<sub>B</sub> = (1/m) Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup> x<sub>i</sub>:**  The mean of the mini-batch (m is the number of samples in the mini-batch).
* **σ<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup> = (1/m) Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup> (x<sub>i</sub> - μ<sub>B</sub>)<sup>2</sup>:** The variance of the mini-batch.  A small constant (e.g., 1e-5) is often added to the variance to prevent division by zero.

Following this, the input is normalized:

* **x̃<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub> - μ<sub>B</sub>) / √(σ<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup> + ε):** Each activation is normalized using the calculated mean and variance.  ε is a small constant for numerical stability.

Finally, the normalized activations are scaled and shifted using learned parameters:

* **y<sub>i</sub> = γx̃<sub>i</sub> + β:**  γ and β are learned scaling and shifting parameters, respectively, allowing the network to learn the optimal representation of the activations even after normalization.  These are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively.

This entire process is differentiable, allowing the network to learn the optimal parameters through backpropagation.  During inference (prediction), the moving average of the mini-batch statistics (mean and variance) are utilized, providing a consistent normalization across different input batches.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Manual Implementation (Illustrative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def batch_norm(x, gamma, beta, epsilon=1e-5):
    mean, variance = tf.nn.moments(x, axes=[0]) # Calculate mean and variance across the batch
    normalized_x = (x - mean) / tf.sqrt(variance + epsilon) # Normalize
    return gamma * normalized_x + beta # Scale and shift

# Example usage:
x = tf.constant(np.random.randn(128, 64), dtype=tf.float32) # Batch of 128 samples, 64 features
gamma = tf.Variable(tf.ones([64])) # Learnable scaling parameters
beta = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([64])) # Learnable shifting parameters
y = batch_norm(x, gamma, beta)

print(y)
```

This code provides a basic illustration of the BN algorithm.  It explicitly computes the mean and variance and performs the normalization and scaling steps.  It is primarily for educational purposes; real-world applications should leverage TensorFlow's built-in functionality.

**Example 2: Using `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, input_shape=(784,)), # Input layer
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(), # Batch Normalization layer
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('relu'), # Activation function
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10) # Output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates the typical way to use BN in a Keras model.  Simply adding the `BatchNormalization` layer after a dense layer applies BN to the layer's output.  The `momentum` parameter (default 0.99) controls the update rate of the moving average statistics used during inference.

**Example 3:  Controlling BatchNorm parameters:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

bn_layer = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(axis=-1, momentum=0.9, epsilon=1e-3, beta_initializer='zeros', gamma_initializer='ones')

# ...rest of the model definition...
model.add(bn_layer)
```

This code segment showcases the customization of Batch Normalization parameters.  `axis` specifies the feature dimension (-1 defaults to the last dimension).  `momentum` controls the moving average update.  `epsilon` adjusts the numerical stability.  Finally, the initializers for `beta` and `gamma` can be specified if needed.  Careful tuning of these parameters can be beneficial for specific tasks.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on Batch Normalization for comprehensive details.  Furthermore, review papers on Batch Normalization's theoretical underpinnings and practical applications to deeply understand its impact and potential limitations.  Finally, explore the numerous blog posts and tutorials focusing on effective usage of Batch Normalization within deep learning models to find practical guidance and examples beyond simple implementations.  These resources will provide a strong foundation for proficient utilization of this technique.
