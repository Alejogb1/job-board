TensorFlow models, specifically when dealing with data pipelines and custom training loops, are prone to `IndexError` exceptions during training primarily due to misaligned tensor shapes between the input data, batching mechanisms, and the model's expected input dimensions. This issue, in my experience developing custom image classification networks, typically arises from a combination of incorrect data preprocessing and subtle discrepancies in batch sizes.

The `IndexError` in this context signifies an attempt to access an element of a tensor or Python sequence using an index that is outside the allowable range for that specific object. In the training loop, TensorFlow performs operations on tensors representing batches of data. If the dimensions of these tensors do not match what the subsequent layer or operation expects, the index used to access data within those tensors can become invalid, resulting in the error. The problem is rarely with TensorFlow itself but more often with how data is prepared and fed to the model.

Let's break this down with specific scenarios. The error tends to occur most often in these areas:

1.  **Data Preprocessing Mismatches:** When data transformations alter the original shape of the input without proper handling during batching. This occurs, for instance, when resizing or cropping images inconsistently. If the resizing operation doesn't uniformly apply to all images or if the shape of resized image does not match what the layers downstream expect, we will run into `IndexError`.

2. **Batching Inconsistencies:** Especially during manual creation of mini-batches from datasets. Manually creating batch using slicing is susceptible to errors if one isn't careful about boundary conditions or if datasets do not have lengths that are multiples of batch sizes resulting in incomplete batches.

3.  **Custom Training Loops with Improper Tensor Reshaping:** If we have custom training loops, these need careful handling with respect to tensor dimensions since we are responsible for ensuring tensor shapes fit expected by the layers during both forward and backward passes.

4. **Loss or Metric Functions with Incompatible Shapes:** Custom loss functions or metrics that are applied incorrectly to the output tensors can cause index errors. This happens when we do not consider the dimensions in which a metric is applied and do not reshape tensors so that metric can be evaluated correctly.

Here are some code examples that I have encountered over the years that illustrate the situation along with solutions:

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Resizing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume 'image_data' is a list or array of images, where shapes aren't consistent
image_data = [np.random.rand(30, 40, 3), np.random.rand(30, 30, 3), np.random.rand(40, 40, 3)]
labels = [0, 1, 0]

def preprocess_image(image, target_size=(32, 32)):
    # Incorrect resizing. Only some images are resized and other just kept as it is.
    if image.shape[0] != target_size[0] or image.shape[1] != target_size[1]:
        resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, target_size)
        return resized_image
    return image

def create_batches(image_data, labels, batch_size=2):
    batches = []
    num_samples = len(image_data)
    for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
        batch_images = [preprocess_image(img) for img in image_data[i:i+batch_size]]
        batch_labels = labels[i:i+batch_size]
        batches.append((tf.stack(batch_images), tf.constant(batch_labels))) # Note the tf.stack
    return batches

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, logits)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

batches = create_batches(image_data, labels)

for images, labels in batches:
    try:
        loss = train_step(images, labels)
        print(f"Batch loss: {loss.numpy()}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this scenario, `preprocess_image` conditionally resizes image based on it's shape. The issue is that the returned list of images after that can potentially have tensors of variable dimensions. Then when we use `tf.stack` to create a tensor of batches, TensorFlow will throw an error because `tf.stack` expects that each tensor along the specified axis will have identical shape. To remedy this issue, we need to ensure that all images in the batch are resized consistently and returned as a tensor of same dimensions.

**Example 2: Improper Batch Slicing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

dataset_size = 7  # Not a multiple of batch_size
batch_size = 3
dummy_images = tf.random.normal((dataset_size, 32, 32, 3))
dummy_labels = tf.random.uniform((dataset_size,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

def create_batches_manual(images, labels, batch_size):
    batches = []
    num_samples = tf.shape(images)[0]
    for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
        batch_images = images[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_labels = labels[i:i+batch_size]
        batches.append((batch_images, batch_labels))
    return batches

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, logits)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

batches = create_batches_manual(dummy_images, dummy_labels, batch_size)

for images, labels in batches:
    try:
        loss = train_step(images, labels)
        print(f"Batch loss: {loss.numpy()}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, the `dataset_size` is 7, and the `batch_size` is 3. When slicing data into batches in `create_batches_manual`, the last batch will only have a size of 1 instead of 3 as expected by the model. This can lead to an `IndexError` in operations that rely on the batch dimension having a specific size. The solution here involves making sure that batches are complete with correct number of elements. This can be achieved by using `tf.data.Dataset` where TensorFlow can automatically pad batches or ignore incomplete batches.

**Example 3: Incorrect Metric Application**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

batch_size = 4
num_classes = 3
dummy_logits = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes))
dummy_labels = tf.random.uniform((batch_size,), minval=0, maxval=num_classes, dtype=tf.int32)

def custom_metric(labels, logits):
  # Incorrect metric application
  predicted_class = tf.argmax(logits, axis=1)
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(predicted_class== labels, tf.float32)) / tf.shape(logits)[1] # Dividing by num_classes

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, logits)
        metric = custom_metric(labels, logits) # applying the custom metric

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss, metric

dummy_images = tf.random.normal((batch_size, 32, 32, 3))

try:
  loss, metric = train_step(dummy_images, dummy_labels)
  print(f"Loss: {loss.numpy()}, metric: {metric.numpy()}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here, the `custom_metric` attempts to compute a metric over incorrect tensor dimension. It attempts to take an average over number of classes, rather than number of samples in batch. This results in `IndexError` when the shapes do not align in the reduction operation. The fix here would be to divide by the batch size (i.e., `tf.shape(logits)[0]`) and not the number of classes.

To effectively resolve these types of `IndexError` exceptions, I would recommend the following:

1. **Thorough Data Inspection:** Rigorously check tensor shapes at each stage of preprocessing and batching. Utilize `tf.shape()` to print and verify dimensions at each step, especially after each transformation. Use a small subset of data to perform these checks without training.
2.  **Leverage `tf.data.Dataset`:** Use `tf.data.Dataset` API for dataset creation, batching and transformations. TensorFlow's dataset API provides well-tested solutions for handling various data types and ensures data consistency. This API handles many edge cases for you reducing manual debugging effort.
3.  **Implement Shape Assertions:** Include assertions using `tf.debugging.assert_equal` to ensure that tensors have the expected shapes at critical points in your code, especially when doing custom manipulations of data. These assertions are better than print statements in that they will always throw error when shape mismatches occur during training.
4.  **Careful custom loss/metric implementation:** Ensure the custom loss functions and metrics handle tensor dimensions correctly. Always visualize shapes of input and output tensors in these functions with test tensors.
5.  **Gradient Debugging**: Verify gradients are not `NaN`. Gradient issues can sometimes manifest as shape discrepancies. Inspect using `tf.debugging.check_numerics`.

By meticulously checking dimensions, employing TensorFlow’s data handling tools, and being careful with tensor operations, one can significantly minimize the incidence of `IndexError` in their TensorFlow projects. The key is to treat tensor shapes as first class citizen in data pipeline.
