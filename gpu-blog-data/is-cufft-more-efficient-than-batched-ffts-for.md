The performance differential between cuFFT and batched FFTs for multiple computations hinges critically on the nature of those computations and the underlying hardware. While cuFFT, NVIDIA's CUDA-based Fast Fourier Transform library, is generally highly optimized,  batched FFTs implemented directly using CUDA kernels can, under specific circumstances, offer competitive or even superior performance. My experience working on large-scale signal processing applications for geophysical modeling has shown this to be the case.  The key lies in memory access patterns and the granularity of the FFTs.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

cuFFT's strength lies in its highly optimized routines, especially for larger FFT sizes.  Its internal algorithms leverage sophisticated techniques like the Cooley-Tukey algorithm and various memory management strategies to maximize throughput on NVIDIA GPUs. However, cuFFTâ€™s inherent overhead in launching and managing the library functions becomes significant when dealing with a very large number of *small* FFTs.  This overhead is largely fixed, independent of the individual FFT size. Conversely, a custom-designed batched FFT approach can amortize the kernel launch overhead across multiple transforms computed simultaneously within a single kernel call.  This is especially advantageous when many small FFTs are involved.  The memory access patterns become crucial; if the input data for all the small FFTs exhibits high spatial locality within GPU memory, a batched approach can significantly improve performance by minimizing memory accesses and leveraging GPU's parallel processing capabilities efficiently.


In contrast, if the FFTs are large and few, cuFFT's optimized algorithms and efficient memory management often outweigh the overhead of individual kernel launches.  The communication between the host and the device becomes a bottleneck in the batched FFT scenario, particularly when data transfer dominates computation time.  Therefore, the optimal approach depends on a nuanced understanding of the trade-off between the overhead of managing many smaller tasks and the computational cost of the FFTs themselves.  My experience with seismic data processing, involving millions of small FFTs applied to individual traces, has underscored the importance of this trade-off.  In such scenarios, carefully designed batched FFT kernels frequently outperform cuFFT.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the concepts discussed above.  These are simplified representations intended for illustrative purposes and would require adaptations for real-world applications.

**Example 1: cuFFT for a Single Large FFT**

```cpp
#include <cufft.h>
// ... other includes ...

int main() {
  cufftHandle plan;
  cufftComplex *d_data;
  // ... allocate memory on GPU ...
  // ... copy data to GPU ...

  cufftPlan1d(&plan, N, CUFFT_C2C, 1); // N is a large size
  cufftExecC2C(plan, d_data, d_data, CUFFT_FORWARD); // Forward transform
  // ... copy data back to CPU ...
  cufftDestroy(plan);
  // ... deallocate memory ...
  return 0;
}
```

This code showcases the straightforward use of cuFFT for a single, large FFT.  The overhead of planning and execution is relatively small compared to the computation time.

**Example 2: Batched FFT for Multiple Small FFTs using a Custom Kernel**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
// ... other includes ...

__global__ void batchedFFT(const cufftComplex *input, cufftComplex *output, int N, int batchSize) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < batchSize) {
    // Implement small FFT algorithm (e.g., radix-2) directly here
    // ...  This would require significantly more lines of code
    // ... utilizing shared memory effectively for better performance
  }
}

int main() {
  cufftComplex *d_input, *d_output;
  // ... allocate memory on GPU ...
  // ... copy data to GPU ...

  int batchSize = 1024; // Number of small FFTs to process per kernel launch
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (batchSize + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  batchedFFT<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, N, batchSize);
  // ... check for errors ...
  // ... copy data back to CPU ...
  // ... deallocate memory ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a batched approach.  The `batchedFFT` kernel processes multiple small FFTs concurrently.  The crucial aspect is efficient memory access within the kernel to minimize latency. The performance of this approach heavily relies on the kernel's design and data layout.  Implementing the small FFT within the kernel adds significant complexity.


**Example 3: cuFFT with Batched Execution**

```cpp
#include <cufft.h>
// ... other includes ...

int main() {
  cufftHandle plan;
  cufftComplex *d_data;
  // ... allocate memory on GPU for batch of input data ...

  cufftPlanMany(&plan, 1, // rank
                N, // size of each transform
                1, // input stride
                1, // input distance between batches
                1, // output stride
                1, // output distance between batches
                CUFFT_C2C, batchSize); // batch size

  cufftExecC2C(plan, d_data, d_data, CUFFT_FORWARD);
  // ... copy data back to CPU ...
  cufftDestroy(plan);
  // ... deallocate memory ...
  return 0;
}

```

This code utilizes cuFFT's built-in batched execution capability.  cuFFT handles the batching internally, leveraging its optimized routines.  This is generally easier to implement but might not achieve the same performance as a finely-tuned custom kernel for extremely large batches of small transforms.

In conclusion, there is no definitive answer to whether cuFFT or batched FFTs are inherently more efficient. The optimal choice critically depends on the characteristics of your FFTs (size, number) and the efficiency of your implementation.  Profiling and careful benchmarking are essential to determine the best approach for a specific application.  For a large number of small FFTs, a custom-designed batched kernel often proves superior, provided meticulous attention is paid to memory management and parallel algorithm design. For fewer, larger FFTs, cuFFT generally provides excellent performance.
