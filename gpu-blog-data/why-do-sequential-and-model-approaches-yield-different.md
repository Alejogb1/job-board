Discrepancies between sequential and model-based approaches in TensorFlow, even with ostensibly identical setups, frequently stem from subtle differences in how the underlying graph is constructed and executed, particularly concerning variable initialization and operation ordering.  My experience debugging similar issues across various TensorFlow versions (1.x through 2.x) points consistently to this core problem.  While superficially using the same layers and hyperparameters, the implicit management of these elements differs significantly.

**1.  Explanation of the Discrepancy:**

The sequential API in TensorFlow (Keras Sequential model) provides a user-friendly, high-level interface for building neural networks.  It implicitly manages the layer connections and variable scopes.  In contrast, the model-based approach using the `tf.keras.Model` class offers a more granular control over the network architecture, allowing for complex topologies and custom training loops.  This increased flexibility, however, demands a more explicit handling of variable creation and weight sharing, which is where subtle errors easily creep in.

The key distinction lies in how variables are initialized and accessed. The Sequential model automatically creates and manages variables within each layer, ensuring proper weight initialization and consistent updates during training.  The model-based approach, however, requires the developer to explicitly define and instantiate variables within the `__init__` method and utilize them within the `call` method.  A common pitfall is inconsistent initialization or accidental sharing of variables between layers, leading to unexpected behaviors.  Further, the execution order, even with seemingly identical operations, can differ due to TensorFlow's internal optimization strategies, potentially impacting the gradient calculations and ultimately the model's outputs.  This is particularly relevant when custom training loops are implemented, where the developer directly manages the gradient computation and application.  Finally, subtle differences in the way regularization or dropout layers are applied can also lead to this divergence. The Sequential API often handles these operations implicitly and consistently, whereas the model-based approach necessitates manual implementation, potentially introducing errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the simplicity of the Sequential API.  Variable creation, weight initialization, and training are handled automatically.  The compiler optimizes the execution graph for efficiency.  This removes ambiguity in variable management, which is a crucial factor in minimizing discrepancies.


**Example 2: Model-Based Approach (Correct Implementation)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example showcases a correct implementation of the model-based approach.  Variables are explicitly declared, but their management remains consistent with the expected behavior.  The `call` method clearly defines the forward pass, ensuring predictable execution.  The compiler still optimizes the graph, minimizing discrepancies.  This is crucial for replicating results across different runs.


**Example 3: Model-Based Approach (Incorrect Implementation â€“ potential source of discrepancy)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyFaultyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyFaultyModel, self).__init__()
        self.w1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((10, 64))) # Incorrect - missing bias
        self.w2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((64, 10))) # Incorrect - missing bias

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = tf.matmul(inputs, self.w1) # No activation
        return tf.matmul(x, self.w2) # No softmax

model = MyFaultyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a potential source of discrepancies.  Missing bias terms in the weight matrices and the lack of activation functions (ReLU and softmax) will dramatically alter the network's behavior.  Furthermore, manually managing weights and biases increases the risk of inconsistent initialization or accidental overwriting, directly leading to differences from the Sequential model. The absence of a proper activation function results in a linear transformation in each layer, which drastically limits the model's capacity to learn complex non-linear relationships in the data.  This highlights the importance of meticulous variable management and layer construction in the model-based approach.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow internals, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on custom models, variable management, and the Keras API.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of computational graphs and automatic differentiation is essential for debugging issues related to execution order and gradient calculations.  Exploring resources on best practices in TensorFlow development and reading through code examples from established projects can also be highly beneficial.  Finally, utilizing debugging tools within TensorFlow and leveraging profiling techniques to analyze execution flow can significantly aid in pinpointing the root cause of such discrepancies.  Understanding the nuances of backpropagation and how different optimization algorithms influence the gradient updates is also crucial.
