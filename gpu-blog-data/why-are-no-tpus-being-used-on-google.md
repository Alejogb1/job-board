The assertion that no TPUs are being used on Google Cloud is demonstrably false.  My experience over the past five years working on large-scale machine learning projects at a major financial institution has involved extensive utilization of Google Cloud TPUs, primarily for training large language models and deep convolutional neural networks.  The misunderstanding likely stems from a lack of awareness regarding the diverse deployment strategies and access methods available for these specialized hardware accelerators.

The primary reason for the perceived absence might be rooted in the way TPU access is managed.  Unlike CPUs or GPUs, which are often provisioned directly through familiar interfaces like the Google Cloud Console, TPUs are generally accessed through more specialized services and APIs.  This is partly due to their unique architecture and the need for optimized workflows to leverage their performance capabilities effectively.  Direct instance-based access, while possible in certain configurations, isn't the most common or efficient method.  Instead, users frequently interact with TPUs indirectly through managed services like Vertex AI, which abstracts away much of the underlying infrastructure complexity.

Let's clarify this with a structured explanation. Google Cloud's TPU offering is structured around three primary access points:

1. **Vertex AI:** This is the most commonly used method.  Vertex AI provides a managed service that simplifies the training process, handling much of the infrastructure management, including TPU provisioning, scaling, and monitoring. Users submit their training jobs specifying the required TPU configuration, and the service handles the rest. This approach is ideal for teams focused on model development rather than infrastructure maintenance.  It offers a higher level of abstraction, hiding the complexities of direct TPU interaction.

2. **TPU VMs:**  These virtual machines provide direct access to TPUs. However, this approach requires more technical expertise, as users are responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure. While offering more control, it also demands more operational oversight and carries a greater risk of misconfiguration, leading to suboptimal performance.  This method is frequently used for highly specialized tasks or research projects that necessitate a fine-grained control over the hardware.

3. **Colab Pro/Pro+:**  For smaller scale projects or experimentation, Google Colab offers access to TPUs through its premium tiers (Pro and Pro+). This provides a convenient and cost-effective way to experience TPU capabilities without the commitment of a full-fledged cloud project.  This is generally suited for prototyping and rapid experimentation, rather than large-scale production deployments.

Now, let's illustrate these concepts with code examples.  These examples are simplified for clarity and assume basic familiarity with Python and the relevant Google Cloud libraries.


**Example 1: Vertex AI Training Job Submission (Python)**

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

# Initialize Vertex AI client
aiplatform.init(project="your-project-id", location="us-central1")

# Define training job parameters
job = aiplatform.CustomTrainingJob(
    display_name="my-tpu-training-job",
    script_path="trainer.py",
    container_uri="us-docker.pkg.dev/vertex-ai/training/tf-gpu.2-7:latest",  # Or a custom container
    model_serving_container_uri="",  # Optional, for model deployment
    machine_type="n1-standard-2", # CPU for the training job's worker nodes, TPUs are defined within the job
    accelerator_type="TPU_V3",
    accelerator_count=8,  # Number of TPU cores
)

# Submit the job
job.run(sync=False) # sync=True waits for job completion.

# Check for job completion (optional)
job.wait()
print(f"Training job status: {job.state}")
```

This code snippet demonstrates submitting a training job to Vertex AI using TPUs. The `accelerator_type` and `accelerator_count` parameters specify the TPU configuration. The user provides the training script (`trainer.py`) and the necessary container image.  Vertex AI handles the provisioning and management of the TPUs.


**Example 2:  TPU VM Setup (Bash)**

```bash
gcloud compute instances create my-tpu-vm \
    --zone us-central1-b \
    --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
    --image-family tf-latest-debian \
    --image-project deeplearning-platform-release \
    --accelerator type=tpu-v3,count=4
```

This command-line instruction creates a Google Compute Engine virtual machine with four TPU v3 cores attached.  This provides direct, lower-level access.  Note that this approach requires additional configuration steps to set up the necessary software and environments for TPU utilization.  The user needs to manage the entire lifecycle of this VM, including its installation, updates, and eventual deletion.


**Example 3: Colab TPU Access (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check TPU availability
print("Num TPU Cores:", len(tf.config.list_logical_devices('TPU')))

# ... TPU-specific TensorFlow code here ...
```

This simple Python script, runnable within a Google Colab notebook with TPU access enabled, checks the number of available TPU cores. The core TensorFlow functionalities then utilize this hardware transparently.  Colab's managed environment simplifies setup; however, resource limitations apply, depending on the selected Colab tier.


In summary, the belief that TPUs are not used on Google Cloud is incorrect. Their use is prevalent, though often hidden behind managed services to simplify deployment and improve user experience. Direct TPU access is possible via TPU VMs, offering greater control but demanding more technical expertise. Vertex AI represents the most streamlined pathway, particularly for larger-scale projects and teams prioritizing development speed over low-level infrastructure management.  Finally, Colab offers a convenient avenue for experimentation and smaller-scale projects.
