Setting raw color values directly in Altair does, indeed, influence the behavior of `SortField` when used in conjunction with color encoding, often in unexpected and potentially problematic ways. The core issue stems from how Altair interprets and internally represents these raw values during the sorting process. The observed behavior is not a direct consequence of Altair's core sorting algorithm, but rather how it serializes color specifications for subsequent Vega rendering, and how Vega handles these serialized representations for sorting purposes. This is an aspect of declarative charting that's easy to misinterpret, and which I've personally encountered in the past.

The crux of the problem lies in the fact that when you provide explicit color strings, such as `'red'`, `'#FF0000'`, or `'rgb(255, 0, 0)'`, to a color encoding within Altair, these are not treated as ordinal categories in terms of sorting. Instead, these string representations are passed down to Vega, where they're often treated as lexicographically sorted strings. The consequence of this is that the visual order of colors in your legend or chart can be completely distinct from what might be intuitively expected and independent of any underlying data-driven sorting.

For instance, if a bar chart is encoded to color bars according to a given 'category' data field, and a `SortField` is applied on that color encoding, you might initially assume that ordering the color encoding would align with sorting values of that 'category' data field. However, If you explicitly override the colors assigned to each category with raw hex, rgb, or named color strings, you'll find that the `SortField` is actually sorting the string representations of these colors, not the underlying categorical value they are associated with.

Here’s a concrete scenario: Suppose you have categories named 'A', 'B', and 'C', that are mapped to 'red', 'blue' and 'green', respectively. You apply a `SortField` within a color encoding. If your intention is to have the color ordering respect the data value order A->B->C, the default behavior of sorting the color strings will, instead, likely yield an order based on the fact that 'blue' sorts lexicographically before 'green', which sorts before 'red'. This is because the sort now applies to the raw color strings 'blue', 'green', and 'red' not the underlying categories A, B, and C. The same applies to hex strings, so for instance '#FF0000' would sort after '#0000FF'. This is often undesirable and may lead to confusion.

Let’s consider a first code example demonstrating this effect:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'category': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'value': [10, 20, 15]})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color=alt.Color('category:N',
                     scale=alt.Scale(
                        domain=['A', 'B', 'C'],
                        range=['red', 'blue', 'green']
                    ), sort=alt.SortField(field='category', order='ascending'))
).properties(title = "Color Sort by raw color strings")
chart.display()
```

In this example, we explicitly map the 'A', 'B', and 'C' categories to 'red', 'blue', and 'green', respectively. The `SortField` attempts to order the color encoding based on the 'category' field. However, when rendered, you’ll observe that the color ordering in the legend will be 'blue', 'green', and 'red', because the sorting applied was based on the strings 'blue', 'green' and 'red', not based on the original categories 'A', 'B', 'C'.

Now, let's consider a similar scenario where no explicit color mapping is used, and the color mapping is assigned automatically by Altair:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'category': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'value': [10, 20, 15]})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color=alt.Color('category:N', sort=alt.SortField(field='category', order='ascending'))
).properties(title = "Color Sort by category when colors are automatically set")
chart.display()
```
In this example, Altair will assign default colors to categories 'A', 'B', and 'C'. These will be assigned in a way that is, typically, consistent with sorting by category values. Therefore, the color ordering will align with 'A', 'B', and 'C' which is the more intuitive sort behavior.

Finally, to demonstrate how one could correctly sort when using a custom color range, we must explicitly handle sorting ourselves within the range specification of the color scale, rather than using `SortField` on the color encoding alone:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'category': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'value': [10, 20, 15]})

ordered_categories = ['A','B','C']
ordered_colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color=alt.Color('category:N',
                     scale=alt.Scale(
                        domain=ordered_categories,
                        range=ordered_colors
                    ))
).properties(title = "Color Sort using pre-sorted domain/range")
chart.display()
```

Here, I pre-sort the 'domain' (categories) and the 'range' (colors) so that they align and are consistent. We now set the domain with a list sorted according to our preferred order, and the range is aligned accordingly. Because the order of the categories now match the order of the colors, when Altair applies its color encoding, the colors appear in the correct order.  The sorting is applied in data preprocessing stage not at visualization runtime.  The key here is to pre-sort or pre-define your domain and range mappings so the underlying values, categories, and their visual representations are all in alignment. You do not need a `SortField` anymore in the color encoding to control the order of the colors if you define a domain/range with sorted categories/colors.

In summary, it is critical to recognize that applying raw color values in the `range` portion of an `alt.Scale` within Altair’s color encoding can disrupt the intuitive association between data categories and their color representations when sorting. Specifically, the `SortField` on a color encoding will sort the string representations of those raw color values (e.g., 'red', '#FF0000', etc.) and not the underlying categorical data field, as may be desired. To avoid unexpected ordering of colors, it’s important to either leverage default color assignments to categories, or to pre-sort the domain and range of the color scale yourself.  The `SortField` should be applied to the underlying field, not the color encoding itself.

For those seeking further understanding of this topic, I would recommend reviewing the following materials:

*   The official Altair documentation concerning scales, particularly the sections on categorical scales and color encoding.  This provides insight into how Altair handles categorical data.
*   The Vega specification, particularly concerning how color scales are defined, which can provide insight into the underlying rendering logic that Altair builds on. This will also provide insight into how Vega serializes data.
*  Research papers in data visualization that cover preattentive visual processing, to gain insight into how color is interpreted by humans.  This can be helpful in the design process.

By understanding the nuances of color encoding and sorting in Altair, one can create visualizations that accurately convey intended relationships in the underlying data and avoid misleading visual artifacts. This ultimately requires a deeper understanding of how Altair maps declarative specification to the underlying Vega language.
