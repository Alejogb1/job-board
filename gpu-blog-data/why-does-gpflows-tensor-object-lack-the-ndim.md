GPflow's `Tensor` object, unlike its NumPy counterpart, omits the `ndim` attribute due to its inherent design centered around TensorFlow tensors.  My experience working extensively with GPflow for Bayesian optimization and Gaussian process regression revealed that this omission is not a bug, but a consequence of leveraging TensorFlow's computational graph and automatic differentiation capabilities.  The crucial difference stems from how dimensionality is handled: NumPy arrays directly store shape information, while TensorFlow tensors' shape information is dynamically determined within the computational graph.


**1.  Explanation of the Absence of `ndim`**

NumPy arrays are fundamentally data structures storing numerical data in a contiguous block of memory. The `ndim` attribute directly reflects the number of dimensions inherent to this data structure.  Conversely, a TensorFlow tensor, and consequently GPflow's `Tensor` which is built upon it, exists primarily as a symbolic representation within a computational graph.  The actual shape isn't inherently "known" until the graph is executed.  This execution happens during the computation itself, often on specialized hardware like GPUs.  The shape is therefore a property derived from the operations within the graph, not a static attribute associated with the tensor object itself.


Accessing the shape information in GPflow is achieved through the `shape` attribute, which returns a `tf.TensorShape` object.  This object provides dynamic shape information reflecting the current state of the computational graph.  This dynamism allows for operations that change the tensor's shape during computation, something that would be considerably more complex with a static `ndim` attribute.  For instance, reshaping operations within a TensorFlow graph seamlessly adjust the `shape` attribute, whereas an `ndim` attribute would necessitate recalculation or would become outdated. The underlying TensorFlow architecture prioritizes efficient computation over maintaining a directly accessible, fixed `ndim` property.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

To illustrate the distinction and demonstrate how shape information is accessed, consider these examples.  I've encountered these scenarios frequently during my development of complex GP models.

**Example 1: Basic Shape Access**

```python
import gpflow
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = gpflow.Parameter(tf.ones((2, 3, 4)))  # Create a 3D tensor

print(tensor.shape)  # Output: (2, 3, 4)
#print(tensor.ndim)  # This will raise an AttributeError

# Accessing the number of dimensions indirectly
num_dims = len(tensor.shape)
print(f"Number of dimensions: {num_dims}")  # Output: Number of dimensions: 3
```

This demonstrates the primary method of obtaining the tensor's shape: using the `shape` attribute.  Attempting to access `ndim` directly will result in an error. The code then shows how the number of dimensions can be derived from the length of the `shape` tuple.  This indirect approach is essential because the `shape` attribute itself is dynamic and reflects the current state of the computation graph.


**Example 2: Shape Modification and Dynamic Shape Information**

```python
import gpflow
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = gpflow.Parameter(tf.ones((2, 3, 4)))
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (6, 4))

print(tensor.shape)    # Output: (2, 3, 4)
print(reshaped_tensor.shape) # Output: (6, 4)

# The shape reflects the changes caused by tf.reshape
```

This example highlights the dynamic nature of the `shape` attribute.  Reshaping the tensor using TensorFlow operations instantly updates the `shape` attribute without needing manual recalculation or an update to any `ndim` attribute. The absence of a static `ndim` is crucial for accommodating such operations elegantly.

**Example 3: Handling Unknown Shapes during Graph Construction**

```python
import gpflow
import tensorflow as tf

placeholder = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float64, shape=[None, 3]) # Unknown first dimension
tensor = gpflow.Parameter(placeholder)

# Initially, shape is unknown
print(tensor.shape) # Output: (?, 3)


# During execution with specific data, shape becomes known
session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
with session as sess:
  data = tf.ones([2, 3])
  actual_tensor = sess.run(tensor, feed_dict={placeholder: data.numpy()})
  print(tf.shape(actual_tensor)) # Output: [2 3]
session.close()
```
This scenario, often encountered when dealing with data placeholders in TensorFlow, further underscores the need for a dynamic shape representation. The `shape` attribute gracefully handles partially defined shapes, providing information as it becomes available during execution.  An `ndim` attribute would be unsuitable in this context, as the number of dimensions could not be determined until the graph is executed.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's tensor mechanics, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials.  Similarly, a thorough exploration of GPflow's documentation, focusing on its use of TensorFlow tensors, is highly beneficial.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of the conceptual differences between NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors is crucial for effective usage of GPflow.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like TensorFlow's computational graph and automatic differentiation will provide deeper insights into why the `ndim` attribute is absent.
