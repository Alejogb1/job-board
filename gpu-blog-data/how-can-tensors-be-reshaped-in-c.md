Tensor reshaping in C necessitates a deep understanding of memory layout and pointer arithmetic.  My experience optimizing deep learning libraries has underscored the crucial role of efficient memory management in tensor operations; naive reshaping can lead to significant performance bottlenecks.  The key is to avoid unnecessary data copying whenever possible.  Instead, we leverage the existing memory arrangement and adjust the stride information—the number of bytes to jump to access the next element along each dimension.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A tensor, fundamentally, is a multi-dimensional array.  Reshaping involves rearranging the elements of this array into a different shape, while preserving the underlying data. In C, this is accomplished primarily through pointer manipulation and careful calculation of strides. We define a tensor structure to encapsulate the necessary information: data pointer, dimensions, and strides.

```c
typedef struct {
  float *data;
  int *dims; // Array of dimensions (e.g., {2, 3, 4} for a 3D tensor)
  int ndims; // Number of dimensions
  int *strides; // Array of strides (bytes per element * bytes per dimension)
} Tensor;
```

Reshaping involves changing the `dims` array and recalculating the `strides` array accordingly.  The total number of elements must remain consistent before and after reshaping.  Crucially, the reshaping operation doesn't inherently move data; it simply modifies how the data is accessed.  This is a key efficiency consideration. If a new shape requires a different memory layout which is incompatible with the existing contiguous memory layout, then data copying becomes inevitable.

The calculation of strides is fundamental.  Assuming a data type of `float` (4 bytes), the stride for each dimension `i` is calculated as:

`strides[i] = (i < ndims - 1) ? strides[i+1] * dims[i+1] * sizeof(float) : sizeof(float);`

This recursive definition ensures that the stride correctly accounts for the number of elements that must be skipped to reach the next element along the relevant dimension.  The base case (`i == ndims - 1`) represents the last dimension, where the stride is simply the size of a single element.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Reshape (No Data Copying):**

This example reshapes a 2x3 tensor into a 3x2 tensor.  Since the underlying memory remains the same, no data copying occurs.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// ... (Tensor struct definition from above) ...

int reshape_tensor(Tensor *tensor, int *new_dims, int new_ndims) {
  if (tensor->ndims == 0) return 1; //Handle empty tensor
  int total_elements = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < tensor->ndims; i++) total_elements *= tensor->dims[i];
  int new_total_elements = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < new_ndims; i++) new_total_elements *= new_dims[i];

  if (total_elements != new_total_elements) return 1; // Dimensions incompatible

  free(tensor->dims);
  free(tensor->strides);
  tensor->dims = (int*)malloc(new_ndims * sizeof(int));
  tensor->strides = (int*)malloc(new_ndims * sizeof(int));
  tensor->ndims = new_ndims;
  for (int i = 0; i < new_ndims; i++) tensor->dims[i] = new_dims[i];

  tensor->strides[new_ndims - 1] = sizeof(float);
  for (int i = new_ndims - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    tensor->strides[i] = tensor->strides[i + 1] * tensor->dims[i + 1];
  }

  return 0;
}

int main() {
  float data[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0};
  int dims[] = {2, 3};
  int strides[] = {12, 4}; // 3 * 4 bytes each element (float)
  Tensor tensor = {data, dims, 2, strides};


  int new_dims[] = {3, 2};
  reshape_tensor(&tensor, new_dims, 2);

  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      printf("%f ", tensor.data[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
```

**Example 2: Reshape with Data Copying:**

When the reshaping necessitates a change in memory layout—for instance, going from row-major to column-major order—data copying is unavoidable for maintaining data integrity.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
// ... (Tensor struct definition) ...

//Function to allocate and copy memory for reshape
Tensor* reshape_copy(Tensor* tensor, int* new_dims, int new_ndims){
    int total_elements = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < tensor->ndims; i++) total_elements *= tensor->dims[i];
    int new_total_elements = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < new_ndims; i++) new_total_elements *= new_dims[i];
    if (total_elements != new_total_elements) return NULL;

    Tensor* new_tensor = (Tensor*)malloc(sizeof(Tensor));
    new_tensor->data = (float*)malloc(total_elements * sizeof(float));
    new_tensor->dims = (int*)malloc(new_ndims * sizeof(int));
    new_tensor->strides = (int*)malloc(new_ndims * sizeof(int));
    new_tensor->ndims = new_ndims;

    for (int i = 0; i < new_ndims; i++) new_tensor->dims[i] = new_dims[i];
    //Copy data (adjust index calculation as per original and new dims and strides)
    for(int i = 0; i < total_elements; i++){
        //Implementation for copying data needs to account for original and new strides
    }
    //Calculate strides for the new tensor
    // ... (Stride calculation similar to Example 1) ...

    return new_tensor;
}
```

This example requires a more complex data copying mechanism to handle arbitrary reshaping.  The specific indexing logic during copying would depend on the original and new shapes and strides.

**Example 3: Handling Higher-Dimensional Tensors:**

The principles extend seamlessly to higher-dimensional tensors.  The core logic remains the same: calculate the strides based on the new dimensions and ensure data consistency if copying is required.

```c
// Example usage with a 3x4x2 tensor reshaped to 24x1 tensor.
//  Requires the implementation of reshape_copy or similar function from example 2.

// ... (Tensor struct definition) ...

int main(){
    //Initialize a 3x4x2 tensor
    float data[24] = {/* Initialize with some values */};
    int dims[] = {3,4,2};
    Tensor tensor = {data,dims,3,/*Calculate appropriate strides*/};

    int new_dims[] = {24,1};
    Tensor* reshaped_tensor = reshape_copy(&tensor, new_dims,2); //Use reshape_copy for memory allocation and copying

    //... access and use the reshaped tensor ...

    free(reshaped_tensor->data);
    free(reshaped_tensor->dims);
    free(reshaped_tensor->strides);
    free(reshaped_tensor);
    return 0;
}
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie.  A comprehensive guide to C programming fundamentals, including memory management and pointer arithmetic, crucial for tensor manipulation.  "Understanding Pointers in C" by any reputable author offers a focused treatment of pointer-related concepts.  Any textbook focusing on data structures and algorithms would enhance understanding of multidimensional arrays and efficient data manipulation. A book dedicated to Linear Algebra principles will help in understanding tensor operations from a mathematical perspective.


This response provides a robust foundation for tensor reshaping in C.  The efficiency of the implementation hinges on careful consideration of memory layout and the optimization of data copying to minimize performance overhead.  Always remember to handle memory allocation and deallocation properly to avoid memory leaks.  The examples provided demonstrate basic techniques; however, more advanced scenarios may necessitate more intricate logic to handle edge cases and optimize for specific architectures.
