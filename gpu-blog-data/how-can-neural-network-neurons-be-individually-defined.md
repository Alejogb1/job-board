Defining individual neurons within a neural network architecture necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical representations and the chosen framework for implementation.  My experience building custom recurrent networks for time-series anomaly detection highlighted the crucial role of granular neuron control, particularly when optimizing for specific feature extraction and sensitivity.  The direct insight here is that individual neuron definition isn't directly achieved through a single, universal parameter; instead, it's a consequence of carefully managing weights, biases, activation functions, and, in certain network architectures, even the neuron's connectivity.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The concept of defining an "individual neuron" within a neural network is somewhat nuanced.  A standard neuron, at its core, is a mathematical function.  It receives inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ), applies weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ) to those inputs, sums them, adds a bias (b), and then applies an activation function (σ) to produce an output (y). This can be expressed as:

y = σ(w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b)

While we don't directly *define* a neuron in terms of a separate, unique object in many common frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, we effectively define its behavior by specifying its weights (wᵢ), bias (b), and activation function (σ).  These parameters control the neuron's responsiveness to different input patterns and its contribution to the overall network output.  Therefore, modifying these parameters for a specific neuron allows for the manipulation of its individual characteristics.

Furthermore, in more complex architectures like those employing custom connection patterns or specialized neuron types (e.g., spiking neurons), the definition becomes even more granular.  Here, individual neuron properties might extend beyond weights, biases, and activation functions to include parameters governing their temporal dynamics, refractory periods, or connection rules.

Modifying these characteristics is typically achieved during the network's construction phase or through targeted parameter updates during training.  The latter is often facilitated by techniques like weight pruning or regularization, indirectly influencing individual neuron behavior by altering their weights and promoting sparsity.  It's crucial to understand that these techniques are indirect; they don't allow us to specify individual neurons by name but manipulate their properties based on their learned weights.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate how control over individual neurons is achieved indirectly, focusing on manipulating weights, biases, and activation functions.  Note that these snippets are illustrative and might require adjustments based on the specific framework employed.

**Example 1:  Modifying Weights in a Dense Layer (PyTorch):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple neural network
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),  # Input layer with 10 features, 5 neurons
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(5, 1)   # Output layer
)

# Access and modify weights of the first neuron in the first layer
first_neuron_weights = model[0].weight[0]  # Access the weights of the first neuron (row 0)
with torch.no_grad():  # Ensure gradients aren't computed during this modification
    first_neuron_weights[:] = 0.5  # Set all weights of the first neuron to 0.5

print(model[0].weight)
```

This code demonstrates how to directly access and alter the weights of a specific neuron (the first neuron) within a dense layer using PyTorch.  This is achieved by directly manipulating the weight matrix. The `with torch.no_grad():` block prevents accidental gradient calculations, crucial when manually altering model parameters during training.

**Example 2:  Modifying Biases (TensorFlow/Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5, input_shape=(10,), bias_initializer='zeros'),
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, bias_initializer='ones')
])

# Access and modify the bias of the third neuron in the first layer.
bias_vector = model.layers[0].bias
bias_vector = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(bias_vector, [[2]], [10.0]) # Sets the bias of the 3rd neuron to 10.0

model.layers[0].set_weights([model.layers[0].get_weights()[0], bias_vector.numpy()])
model.summary()
```

This example shows bias manipulation within a Keras model.  We explicitly access the bias vector and then modify a specific neuron's bias using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  This provides finer-grained control compared to simply changing the initializer.  Remember that we need to update the model's weights explicitly, as Keras doesn't automatically synchronize the modifications in its internal representations.


**Example 3:  Custom Neuron Implementation (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

class CustomNeuron:
    def __init__(self, weights, bias, activation):
        self.weights = np.array(weights)
        self.bias = bias
        self.activation = activation

    def forward(self, inputs):
        weighted_sum = np.dot(self.weights, inputs) + self.bias
        return self.activation(weighted_sum)

# Example usage:
weights = [0.2, 0.5, -0.1]
bias = 0.1
activation = lambda x: max(0, x) # ReLU activation

neuron = CustomNeuron(weights, bias, activation)
inputs = np.array([1, 2, 3])
output = neuron.forward(inputs)
print(output)
```

This illustrates complete control by building a neuron from scratch using NumPy.  This approach offers maximum flexibility but requires a more manual implementation of backpropagation and network architecture compared to higher-level frameworks.  This example is more suitable for research purposes or specialized situations where the flexibility outweighs the added complexity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop;  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen (online book); relevant documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch.  These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of neural network architectures, training algorithms, and mathematical foundations.  Further research into specialized network types, such as spiking neural networks, is advisable for deeper understanding of granular neuron control in more advanced architectures.
