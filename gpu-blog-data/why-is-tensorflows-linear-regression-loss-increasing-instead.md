TensorFlow's linear regression loss increasing during training almost invariably points to a problem with the optimization process, rather than a fundamental flaw in the model itself.  My experience debugging similar issues over the past five years, predominantly involving large-scale time-series forecasting projects, has consistently highlighted three primary culprits: improperly scaled data, an inappropriate learning rate, or a subtle bug in the model's architecture or data pipeline.


**1. Data Scaling and its Impact on Gradient Descent:**

Linear regression, at its core, relies on gradient descent or a variant thereof to minimize the loss function.  Gradient descent is sensitive to the scale of features. If features possess vastly different magnitudes, the gradients will be dominated by the features with larger scales, causing instability and hindering convergence.  This manifests as oscillations or, as in the question's case, an increasing loss.  The algorithm essentially gets "lost" in the feature space, unable to effectively navigate towards the minimum.  Standardization or normalization, transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance or a similar range, is crucial for mitigating this issue.  Failure to do so can lead to exploding gradients or extremely slow convergence, resulting in a seemingly increasing loss because the algorithm is unable to effectively learn from the noisy gradients.


**2. Learning Rate Selection: A Delicate Balance:**

The learning rate dictates the step size taken during each iteration of gradient descent.  Too large a learning rate can lead to divergence, where the optimizer overshoots the minimum and the loss oscillates wildly, often appearing to increase overall. A learning rate that's too small, conversely, leads to painfully slow convergence, making it appear as though the loss isn't decreasing, especially during early training epochs.  It's essential to carefully select the learning rate, often through experimentation or using techniques like learning rate scheduling.  My personal preference, especially for challenging datasets, involves employing a learning rate scheduler that gradually decays the learning rate as training progresses.  This allows for larger steps initially, accelerating early learning, while ensuring stable convergence later on.


**3. Architectural and Data Pipeline Errors: The Silent Killers:**

While less common, subtle bugs in the model architecture or the data pipeline can also result in an increasing loss.  These often involve unexpected data transformations, incorrect weight initializations, or even numerical instability within the TensorFlow computations.  For example, a misplaced operation or an incorrect indexing scheme within a custom layer could introduce errors that progressively amplify during training, ultimately leading to an increasing loss.  Similarly, an error in the data preprocessing pipeline might introduce noise or inconsistencies that confound the optimizer.  I've encountered situations where incorrect data loading caused incremental biases during each training epoch.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to address these issues.  These are simplified for clarity, but highlight crucial elements of robust implementation.

**Example 1: Data Scaling with Scikit-learn**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assuming 'X_train' and 'y_train' are your training data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],))
])
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100)
```

This example uses `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn to standardize the training data before feeding it into the TensorFlow model. This ensures that all features have comparable scales, preventing the issues described earlier.  Replacing `'sgd'` with `'adam'` might further improve performance.

**Example 2: Learning Rate Scheduling with tf.keras.optimizers.schedules**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

initial_learning_rate = 0.1
lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=1000,
    decay_rate=0.96,
    staircase=True
)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=lr_schedule)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],))
])
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

This example demonstrates the use of an exponential learning rate decay schedule.  The learning rate starts at `initial_learning_rate` and decreases exponentially over time. The `staircase=True` parameter ensures that the learning rate changes only at the end of each `decay_steps` number of steps.  Experimentation with different decay rates and schedules is crucial to find the optimal setting.

**Example 3:  Debugging a Custom Layer (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units):
    super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal') # Careful with initialization!

  def call(self, inputs):
    # Check for potential errors here - ensure dimensions align!
    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  MyCustomLayer(units=1),
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# Add print statements to inspect intermediate values within MyCustomLayer's call method for debugging.
```

This example highlights a scenario where a custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`) might introduce subtle errors. It is vital to meticulously check for potential dimension mismatches, incorrect operations, or numerical instabilities within the layer's `call` method. Thorough testing and the inclusion of print statements to monitor intermediate values are crucial for identifying and resolving such issues.  Incorrect weight initialization can also be a source of problems.  Using `tf.debugging.check_numerics` can help detect numerical instabilities during training.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, comprehensive guides on numerical optimization, and advanced deep learning textbooks offer invaluable resources for addressing these kinds of challenges.  Focusing on sections detailing gradient descent, learning rate optimization, and data preprocessing will prove especially beneficial.  A strong understanding of linear algebra and numerical methods is also highly advantageous.
