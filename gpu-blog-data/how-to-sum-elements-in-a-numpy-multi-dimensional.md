The crux of efficiently summing elements in a NumPy multi-dimensional array using specified indices lies in leveraging NumPy's advanced indexing capabilities rather than resorting to explicit looping.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing tasks within scientific simulations frequently highlighted this approach as crucial for scalability.  Improper indexing can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large datasets.  Therefore, understanding the nuances of indexing within NumPy is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core concept involves using arrays of indices to select specific elements from the multi-dimensional array. NumPy's broadcasting rules then enable concise and efficient summation operations on these selected elements.  This contrasts with iterative approaches, which are generally far less performant for larger arrays.  The process can be broken down into these steps:

a) **Index Generation:**  Create one or more NumPy arrays representing the indices of the elements to be summed along each dimension.  These index arrays should be of the same shape and datatype, typically `int64`.

b) **Advanced Indexing:** Use these index arrays to select the desired elements from the source array using advanced indexing.  Advanced indexing creates a view into the original array, avoiding unnecessary data copying.

c) **Summation:**  Utilize NumPy's built-in `sum()` function or equivalent operations (e.g., `np.sum()`) on the result of the advanced indexing operation to compute the total sum.

Consider a scenario where we have a 3D array representing sensor readings from a grid, and we need to sum readings at specific locations.  Direct looping through this array would be inefficient; advanced indexing coupled with vectorized operations provides a significantly faster solution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Summing along a single axis with specified indices:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample 3D array representing sensor data
sensor_data = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))

# Indices along the second axis (axis=1) to sum
indices_axis1 = np.array([1, 2])

# Advanced indexing to select elements and summation
sum_result = np.sum(sensor_data[:, indices_axis1, :], axis=1)

print(sensor_data)
print(sum_result)
```

This example demonstrates summing elements along the second axis (axis=1) using specified indices.  `sensor_data[:, indices_axis1, :]` selects slices across the first and third axes, while the indices in `indices_axis1` specify the elements along the second axis to be included in the sum. The final `np.sum(..., axis=1)` performs the summation along the newly created axis introduced by advanced indexing. The output clearly shows the summed results.


**Example 2: Summing elements at specific locations in a multi-dimensional array:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample 2D array
array_2d = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))

# Indices for specific elements to sum (row, column)
row_indices = np.array([0, 2])
col_indices = np.array([1, 3])

# Advanced indexing to select and sum
sum_result = np.sum(array_2d[row_indices, col_indices])

print(array_2d)
print(sum_result)
```

Here, we use separate arrays `row_indices` and `col_indices` to specify the row and column indices of the elements to sum.  `array_2d[row_indices, col_indices]` directly selects the corresponding elements, and `np.sum()` computes their sum. This approach avoids loops and leverages NumPy's vectorized operations, providing substantial performance benefits, particularly for large arrays.


**Example 3: Handling broadcasting for non-uniform index selection:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample 3D array
array_3d = np.arange(27).reshape((3, 3, 3))

# Indices for specific elements (not all same length)
indices = [np.array([0, 1]), np.array([1, 2]), np.array([0, 2])]

# Summation requires careful handling for broadcasting (less efficient in this case, but illustrative)
total_sum = 0
for i in range(len(indices[0])):
    total_sum += np.sum(array_3d[indices[0][i], indices[1][i], indices[2][i]])

print(array_3d)
print(total_sum)
```

This example highlights a scenario where the indices are not consistently shaped across dimensions.  While advanced indexing can technically handle this, the approach shown uses a loop for clarity.  For such cases, reshaping or careful use of broadcasting rules might be necessary, though potentially at a computational cost.  Alternatively, a more efficient method might involve generating a linear index using `np.ravel_multi_index` and then selecting via `array_3d.flatten()[linear_indices]`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official NumPy documentation.  It’s essential for in-depth understanding of array manipulation and advanced indexing.
* A good introductory text on linear algebra. This enhances comprehension of the underlying mathematical operations.
* A comprehensive guide to Python for scientific computing, covering NumPy extensively.


Remember to profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks.  For extremely large datasets, consider using specialized libraries like Dask for parallel computation.  The core principle remains the same—efficiently utilizing NumPy’s advanced indexing to minimize explicit loops and maximize computational performance.
