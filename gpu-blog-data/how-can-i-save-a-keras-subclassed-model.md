Saving Keras subclassed models with positional arguments in their `call()` method requires careful consideration of how the model's architecture and weights are serialized.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the importance of consistent argument handling throughout the model's lifecycle.  The core challenge stems from the fact that Keras' standard saving mechanisms primarily handle models defined using functional or sequential APIs, where argument passing is implicitly managed. Subclassed models, by contrast, require explicit management.

The standard `model.save()` method, while convenient for models with straightforward architectures, often falls short when dealing with positional arguments in the `call()` method.  This is because the saving process doesn't inherently capture the argument signature. Attempting a direct save will likely lead to errors during loading, as the reloaded model won't know how to interpret the positional arguments during inference.  The solution lies in using a custom saving and loading mechanism, leveraging the `get_weights()` and `set_weights()` methods alongside a mechanism to store and retrieve the necessary positional argument information.

This strategy avoids relying on the automatic serialization offered by `model.save()`, providing finer-grained control over the persistence of both the model's weights and its functional specifications.  The key is to decouple the model's architecture (defined by its weights and layers) from its input handling logic (defined by the `call()` method's arguments).

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three steps:  (a)  saving the model's weights using `get_weights()`; (b) saving the positional argument configuration (e.g., their names and default values) as a separate JSON or YAML file; (c) creating a custom loading function that reconstructs the model architecture and then loads the saved weights using `set_weights()`, while simultaneously parsing the argument configuration file to correctly define the `call()` method's behavior.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: A Simple Model with Positional Arguments:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json

class PositionalModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(PositionalModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
        self.units = units #Store units for later reconstruction

    def call(self, inputs, training, activation='relu'): # Positional argument 'activation'
        x = self.dense1(inputs, training=training)
        if activation == 'relu':
            x = tf.nn.relu(x)
        elif activation == 'sigmoid':
            x = tf.nn.sigmoid(x)
        return self.dense2(x)

    def save_model(self, path):
        weights = self.get_weights()
        config = {'units': self.units, 'activation': 'relu'} #Default Activation
        with open(path + '/config.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(config, f)
        np.save(path + '/weights.npy', weights)

    @classmethod
    def load_model(cls, path):
        with open(path + '/config.json', 'r') as f:
            config = json.load(f)
        model = cls(**config)
        weights = np.load(path + '/weights.npy', allow_pickle=True)
        model.set_weights(weights)
        return model

import numpy as np
model = PositionalModel(64)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save_model('my_positional_model')

loaded_model = PositionalModel.load_model('my_positional_model')
```

This example showcases a basic model with a positional argument `activation` in the `call()` method.  The `save_model` method saves both the weights and the model configuration (including the `units` parameter crucial for reconstruction).  The `load_model` class method reconstructs the model and loads the weights.  Note the handling of the `activation` argument, using a default value for consistent behavior.

**Example 2:  Handling Multiple Positional Arguments:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json

class MultiPositionalModel(tf.keras.Model):
    # ... (similar __init__ as before) ...

    def call(self, inputs, training, activation='relu', dropout_rate=0.1):
        # ... (process inputs, using activation and dropout_rate) ...

    def save_model(self, path):
        # ... (save weights as before) ...
        config = {'units': self.units, 'activation': 'relu', 'dropout_rate': 0.1}
        # ... (save config as before) ...

    @classmethod
    def load_model(cls, path):
        # ... (load config as before) ...
        model = cls(**config)
        # ... (load weights as before) ...
        return model
```

This expands on the previous example by including multiple positional arguments (`activation` and `dropout_rate`).  The configuration file now stores values for all these parameters.


**Example 3:  Model with Custom Layer and Positional Arguments:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json
import numpy as np

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=activation)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

class ModelWithCustomLayer(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, activation):
        super(ModelWithCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.custom_layer = CustomLayer(units, activation)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = activation

    def call(self, inputs, training, scale_factor=1.0):
        x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
        x = x * scale_factor
        return self.dense(x)

    # ... (save_model and load_model methods similar to previous examples, including units and activation) ...
```

This example incorporates a custom layer with its own positional arguments, demonstrating the flexibility of this approach.  The `save_model` and `load_model` methods need to be adapted accordingly to save and restore the custom layer's configuration, ensuring consistency.

Throughout my career, I've encountered numerous scenarios requiring the serialization of models with unconventional architectures.  This rigorous approach, separating model weights from configuration details, provides a robust solution for handling subclassed Keras models with positional arguments in their `call()` methods.  The careful attention to detail in reconstructing the model and its argument handling ensures consistent behavior between training, saving, and loading.  The modularity of this approach allows for easy adaptation to diverse models and complex configurations.
