TensorFlow memory management, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex models, frequently becomes a bottleneck. I've encountered this repeatedly in my experience training convolutional neural networks for high-resolution imagery and large language models, and addressing it is crucial for efficient model development. The root of many TensorFlow memory issues stems from the interplay between eager execution, graph execution, and the underlying hardware resources, specifically GPU and host memory.

One primary contributor is unoptimized data loading. Using `tf.data` API efficiently is paramount; inefficient pipelines can result in large chunks of data being loaded into memory simultaneously, exceeding available capacity. This is particularly evident when dealing with image or text datasets that require preprocessing. Consider a situation where image resizing is done without batching or parallelization. Each image might be loaded and resized individually, resulting in spikes of memory usage. Such practices are exacerbated during the early stages of training, where larger input images might be used, or when training with very large batch sizes.

Another major issue is improper resource allocation in graph execution mode. TensorFlow, despite eager execution’s convenience, defaults to graph mode when tracing functions with `@tf.function`. If memory-related issues were not properly accounted for when a function is traced into a graph, the program can rapidly exhaust GPU memory, leading to OOM (Out of Memory) errors. This frequently manifests when operations that create large intermediary tensors aren’t explicitly managed. A common mistake, for instance, is to perform a complex transformation on the entire dataset within a graph operation without using batched operations to mitigate the intermediate memory usage. Furthermore, TensorFlow may also retain tensors that are no longer needed if they are defined outside a relevant scope, or are created repeatedly in a loop, effectively resulting in a memory leak even during eager execution.

Here are three specific scenarios, showcasing memory issues and their resolutions, based on situations I've personally debugged:

**Example 1: Inefficient Image Loading with Eager Execution**

Initial Code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_and_resize_images(image_paths, target_size):
    images = []
    for path in image_paths:
        image = tf.io.read_file(path)
        image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
        image = tf.image.resize(image, target_size)
        images.append(image)
    return tf.stack(images)

image_paths = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg'] # Assume these exist
target_size = (224, 224)
images = load_and_resize_images(image_paths, target_size)
```

This code loads and resizes each image individually before stacking them, leading to a memory spike that scales with the number of images, especially if the image sizes are large.

Improved Code using `tf.data` API:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_and_preprocess_image(path, target_size):
    image = tf.io.read_file(path)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
    image = tf.image.resize(image, target_size)
    return image

def create_dataset(image_paths, target_size, batch_size):
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(image_paths)
  dataset = dataset.map(lambda path: load_and_preprocess_image(path, target_size), num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  return dataset

image_paths = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']  # Assume these exist
target_size = (224, 224)
batch_size = 2 # Added for proper batching
dataset = create_dataset(image_paths, target_size, batch_size)
for batch in dataset:
    print(batch.shape)
```

The revised code utilizes `tf.data` to stream data, preprocess in parallel, batch the images, and prefetch data, preventing large memory spikes. `num_parallel_calls` ensures the processing uses multiple threads and `prefetch` pipelines the next batch of data for seamless transitions during model training. The key here is that the entire dataset is never loaded into memory at once.

**Example 2: Unoptimized Custom Training Loop with Graph Execution**

Initial Code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

x = tf.random.normal((100, 50))
y = tf.random.normal((100, 10))

for i in range(1000):
    loss = train_step(x, y)
    print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

The code, while functional, trains on the entire dataset within the traced `train_step` function. If `x` and `y` were extremely large datasets, this would overwhelm the available GPU memory. The issue is that the graph compiled by `tf.function` implicitly holds intermediate tensors associated with `x` and `y` during backpropagation.

Improved Code Using Batching:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

@tf.function
def train_step(x_batch, y_batch):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x_batch)
        loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

x = tf.random.normal((100, 50))
y = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
batch_size = 32

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y)).batch(batch_size)

for x_batch, y_batch in dataset:
    loss = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
    print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

By introducing batching with `tf.data`, we ensure that only a small portion of the data is present in memory during each training iteration. The `train_step` function now only processes a `batch_size` number of examples at a time, thereby reducing the memory footprint. The key change is how data is fed into the `train_step` function.

**Example 3: Improper Tensor Management within a Custom Layer**

Initial Code (Conceptual):

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(1, self.units))

    def call(self, x):
      accumulator = tf.zeros_like(x)
      for i in range(100): # Conceptual loop simulating memory issue
        intermediate = tf.matmul(x, self.kernel)
        accumulator = accumulator + intermediate
      return accumulator
```
This layer accumulates intermediary tensors (`intermediate`) in a loop without clearing up, potentially leading to memory accumulation. In a real-world scenario, such accumulation can occur due to incorrect implementations of recurrent or attention layers.

Improved Code using reduction operation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(1, self.units))

    def call(self, x):
      intermediate = tf.matmul(x, self.kernel)
      return tf.reduce_sum(tf.stack([intermediate] * 100), axis=0)
```
By using a `tf.stack` followed by a `tf.reduce_sum` we achieve the same mathematical result as the accumulation, but in a computationally more efficient way that reduces memory consumption by not retaining intermediary values. We perform the operation in a way that TensorFlow can trace and optimize appropriately without creating explicit intermediary tensors.

For deeper investigation into memory management, I would strongly recommend exploring TensorFlow's profiling tools; they provide detailed insights into memory allocation and usage. Furthermore, understanding the concept of graph optimization and leveraging data pipelines is vital for addressing these issues. Publications on large-scale training methodologies, alongside TensorFlow's own official documentation, provide crucial information regarding resource utilization best practices.
