The consistent prediction of a linear output from a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, despite the inherent capacity for non-linearity, typically stems from insufficient training or architectural limitations.  In my experience debugging recurrent neural networks over the past decade, I've observed this issue repeatedly, frequently tracing it to improper scaling of input data, inadequate model depth, or inappropriate activation functions.  Let's examine the underlying causes and potential solutions.

1. **Data Scaling and Normalization:**  LSTMs, like most neural networks, are highly sensitive to the scale of their input data.  Features with significantly larger magnitudes can dominate the gradient updates, effectively masking the influence of other features and preventing the network from learning complex non-linear relationships.  If your input data has wildly varying scales – for example, one feature ranging from 0 to 1, while another spans 0 to 1000 – the network will struggle to discern intricate patterns.  My work on financial time series forecasting highlighted this acutely;  failure to standardize prices and trading volumes led to a precisely linear output, irrespective of the complexity of the LSTM architecture.

2. **Activation Functions:**  The choice of activation functions within the LSTM architecture profoundly impacts its ability to model non-linearity. While LSTMs inherently possess non-linear gates (input, forget, output), employing a linear activation function in the output layer directly prevents the model from producing non-linear predictions. Even within the hidden layers, inappropriate activation function selection can limit the network's expressiveness.  A linear output layer effectively transforms the potentially complex non-linear representation learned in the hidden layers into a simple linear projection.  Sigmoid and tanh functions are commonly used within LSTM cells, but the output layer frequently benefits from a more suitable alternative like a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for its ability to represent positive non-linearity better.

3. **Model Architecture:**  An insufficiently complex LSTM architecture may lack the capacity to capture the underlying non-linear dynamics of your data.  This manifests as a simplification of the output to a linear approximation.  A shallow LSTM with few hidden units or a small number of layers will struggle to learn intricate relationships, leading to a linear projection that serves as a rudimentary approximation of the true underlying function.  In one project involving natural language processing, a single-layered LSTM with only 64 hidden units produced consistently linear sentiment predictions; augmenting the architecture to a two-layered network with 128 and 256 hidden units, respectively, resolved the issue.

4. **Training Parameters:**  Insufficient training iterations, an inappropriate learning rate, or suboptimal optimization algorithms can all contribute to the network failing to converge to a solution capable of capturing non-linear behavior.  A low learning rate may result in slow convergence or the network getting stuck in a local minimum where the output is approximately linear.  Conversely, a high learning rate might lead to unstable training and prevent the network from learning effectively.


Let's illustrate these points with code examples using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  Assume we are predicting a target variable 'y' based on a time series input 'x'.

**Example 1: Improper Data Scaling**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Unscaled data leading to linear output
x_unscaled = np.linspace(0, 1000, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y_unscaled = x_unscaled**2  # Non-linear relationship

# Create and train an LSTM model on unscaled data
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_unscaled, y_unscaled, epochs=100)

# Predictions will be approximately linear due to the scale difference
predictions_unscaled = model.predict(x_unscaled)


# Scaled data
scaler_x = MinMaxScaler()
scaler_y = MinMaxScaler()

x_scaled = scaler_x.fit_transform(x_unscaled)
y_scaled = scaler_y.fit_transform(y_unscaled)

#Retrain with scaled data
model_scaled = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model_scaled.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_scaled.fit(x_scaled, y_scaled, epochs=100)

predictions_scaled = scaler_y.inverse_transform(model_scaled.predict(x_scaled))
```

This example demonstrates how scaling the input data can dramatically improve the model's ability to learn the non-linear relationship.

**Example 2:  Linear Activation Function in Output Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate non-linear data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1, 1)
y = np.sin(x)

# Model with linear activation in the output layer
model_linear = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear') #Linear activation
])
model_linear.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_linear.fit(x, y, epochs=100)
predictions_linear = model_linear.predict(x)

#Model with non-linear activation
model_relu = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='relu') #Non-linear activation
])
model_relu.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_relu.fit(x, y, epochs=100)
predictions_relu = model_relu.predict(x)

```
Here, the model with a linear activation function will likely produce a poorer fit compared to the model using a ReLU activation.


**Example 3:  Insufficient Model Depth**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate a complex non-linear dataset (example)
x = np.random.rand(1000, 10, 1)
y = np.sin(x[:,0,0] * 2 * np.pi) + np.cos(x[:, 1, 0] * 2 * np.pi) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 1000)

# Shallow LSTM
model_shallow = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(10, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model_shallow.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_shallow.fit(x, y, epochs=100)
predictions_shallow = model_shallow.predict(x)


# Deeper LSTM
model_deep = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(10, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model_deep.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_deep.fit(x, y, epochs=100)
predictions_deep = model_deep.predict(x)

```

The deeper LSTM, with multiple layers, is more likely to capture the underlying non-linearity.
