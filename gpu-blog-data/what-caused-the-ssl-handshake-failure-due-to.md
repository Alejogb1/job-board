The root cause of an SSL/TLS handshake failure due to a wrong protocol version invariably stems from a mismatch between the client's offered cipher suite and the server's supported cipher suite list.  This mismatch often manifests as a failure to negotiate a shared cipher suite that utilizes a mutually understood TLS protocol version (e.g., TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3). My experience debugging numerous enterprise-level applications has consistently revealed this as the primary culprit.  While seemingly simple, the issue's complexity arises from the intricate interplay of client-side configurations, server-side settings, and intermediary network devices (proxies, firewalls).

**1. Explanation:**

The SSL/TLS handshake is a critical process where the client and server authenticate each other and agree upon the security parameters for the upcoming communication session.  A crucial aspect of this negotiation is the selection of a cipher suite.  A cipher suite specifies the encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256-GCM), hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256), and the key exchange mechanism (e.g., ECDHE) to be used. Critically, it also implicitly defines the TLS protocol version.  

If the client attempts to initiate the handshake using a protocol version (e.g., TLS 1.0) not supported by the server, the handshake will immediately fail.  Similarly, if the server only offers cipher suites using a protocol version not understood by the client, the negotiation will break down.  This failure often results in cryptic error messages, making accurate diagnosis challenging without careful examination of logs and network traces.  Furthermore, the problem can be exacerbated by the presence of intermediate devices which might filter or alter the handshake process.  For instance, a firewall configured to block outdated protocols could prevent a client using TLS 1.0 from successfully connecting to a server supporting only newer versions.

Several factors contribute to this mismatch.  Outdated client software, restrictive server configurations, network policies enforcing specific cipher suites, and the presence of man-in-the-middle attacks are all possible causes.  Effective troubleshooting requires a systematic approach, carefully analyzing both client and server configurations, as well as scrutinizing network traffic.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios leading to handshake failures.  These are simplified examples and may require adjustments depending on the specific environment and programming language.

**Example 1: Python (Client-Side with outdated protocol preference):**

```python
import ssl
import socket

context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT) # Default context, may include outdated protocols
# Note: Explicitly specifying TLSv1_0/1_1 here would exacerbate the problem.  This is left as is to reflect a situation where it is implicit in the default context

context.check_hostname = True
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

try:
    with socket.create_connection(('example.com', 443)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname='example.com') as ssock:
            # Perform secure communication
            print("Connected successfully!")
except ssl.SSLError as e:
    print(f"SSL handshake failed: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

**Commentary:** This Python code snippet demonstrates a potential client-side issue. If the `create_default_context()` uses an outdated protocol that the server does not support, the connection will fail. The `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` might include outdated protocols by default, depending on the OS and Python version.  This code should include explicit protocol version selection and should restrict the protocol selection to only those known to be supported by the server.  Explicitly setting protocol versions is highly recommended.


**Example 2: OpenSSL (Server-Side with restrictive configuration):**

```bash
# OpenSSL server configuration file (openssl.cnf)
[ssl]
 cipher=ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
 min_proto=TLSv1.2
 max_proto=TLSv1.3
 #Other relevant SSL settings...
```

**Commentary:**  This OpenSSL configuration restricts the server to only support TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3, using specific cipher suites.  A client attempting to connect using TLS 1.0 or 1.1 would fail. This highlights the importance of server-side configuration in controlling which protocols are accepted.  Carefully adjusting `min_proto` and `max_proto` and specifying allowed cipher suites is vital to compatibility while maintaining security.

**Example 3: Nginx Configuration (Server-Side restricting outdated ciphers):**

```nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_ciphers TLS13-AES-256-GCM-SHA384:TLS13-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256:TLS12-AES-256-GCM-SHA384:TLS12-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256;
```

**Commentary:** This Nginx configuration explicitly allows only TLS 1.2 and 1.3,  with specific strong cipher suites.  Any attempt to use older protocols or ciphers will result in a failure.  Modern web servers like Nginx provide extensive configuration options for fine-grained control over SSL/TLS parameters.  The use of `ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;`  means that the server prioritizes the cipher suites it offers, but in a secure manner.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of SSL/TLS handshakes, I recommend consulting the official RFCs related to TLS 1.2 and 1.3.  Additionally, studying the documentation for your specific web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS) and client libraries is crucial.  Finally, a good networking textbook covering TCP/IP and network security will provide a strong foundational knowledge.  Examining detailed network traces using tools like Wireshark is invaluable for diagnosing these types of connection issues.  The official documentation for your operating system's SSL/TLS implementation will be essential for understanding system-level configurations.  Understanding the nuances of cipher suite selection and its relationship to protocol versions is critical for effective debugging. Remember to always prioritize security best practices when configuring SSL/TLS.
