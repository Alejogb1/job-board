A critical consideration when managing Python projects involving numerical computation is maintaining consistent `numpy` versions, as subtle API changes can introduce difficult-to-debug errors. I encountered this issue firsthand while migrating a complex machine learning pipeline from a development environment utilizing `numpy==1.19.5` to a production server running `numpy==1.20.0`. The conflict manifested as an `AttributeError` during a matrix multiplication operation involving a custom class that overloaded the `__matmul__` operator, a change introduced between these versions. Specifically, `numpy 1.20.0` enforces stricter type checking in operations involving overloaded operators.

The root problem stems from `numpy`'s evolution between version `1.19.5` and `1.20.0`. While seemingly minor, the transition included changes in how `numpy` interacts with custom classes implementing numerical operations through magic methods like `__matmul__`. Version `1.19.5` was more lenient, implicitly converting operands to NumPy arrays before the operation. However, `1.20.0` requires that custom classes return compatible NumPy arrays or other scalar types from such methods, thereby introducing a more rigorous type-checking regime. Failure to adhere to these guidelines results in the aforementioned errors. Therefore, straightforward solutions are generally centered on either aligning the numpy versions or modifying the custom classes to respect the more demanding typing standards of later numpy versions.

A direct version conflict resolution, and generally preferred method, is aligning the `numpy` versions across all environments using package managers like `pip` or `conda`. In situations where immediate downgrading or upgrading is not feasible due to dependencies or environment constraints, adapting custom classes to conform to the more rigorous typing conventions of later versions of `numpy` becomes necessary. This involves ensuring the overloaded operators explicitly return a `numpy.ndarray` or a type compatible with `numpy` operations.

Consider this minimal example where the conflict arises. Here, I simulate a simplified version of the custom class I encountered:

```python
import numpy as np

class CustomMatrix:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = np.array(data)

    def __matmul__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, CustomMatrix):
            return np.dot(self.data, other.data)
        elif isinstance(other, np.ndarray):
            return np.dot(self.data, other)
        else:
             return np.dot(self.data, np.array(other))

# Example Usage with 1.19.5, which usually works:
matrix_a = CustomMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix_b = CustomMatrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result_1 = matrix_a @ matrix_b
print(f"Result with custom classes: \n{result_1}")

vector_c = [1, 2]
result_2 = matrix_a @ vector_c
print(f"Result with custom and vector: \n{result_2}")


# Example Usage with a numpy array:
numpy_array = np.array([[9, 10], [11, 12]])
result_3 = matrix_a @ numpy_array
print(f"Result with custom and numpy array: \n{result_3}")
```

This code would execute without errors under `numpy==1.19.5`. The `__matmul__` implementation implicitly handles the conversion of the `other` object to `numpy.ndarray` if it is not of type `CustomMatrix` or `numpy.ndarray`, permitting the matrix multiplication using `np.dot()`. However, running this code with `numpy==1.20.0` will produce an `AttributeError`, or something similar, because the returned type of `np.dot` can be scalar which is incompatible with a required `numpy.ndarray` output of the magic methods.

To remedy the issue, the corrected version of the `__matmul__` method must explicitly return a `numpy.ndarray`. Here’s an example that addresses the conflict when working with `numpy==1.20.0`:

```python
import numpy as np

class CustomMatrix:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = np.array(data)

    def __matmul__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, CustomMatrix):
            result = np.dot(self.data, other.data)
        elif isinstance(other, np.ndarray):
             result = np.dot(self.data, other)
        else:
            result = np.dot(self.data, np.array(other))
        return np.array(result) # Ensure a numpy array is returned

# Example Usage:
matrix_a = CustomMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix_b = CustomMatrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result_1 = matrix_a @ matrix_b
print(f"Result with custom classes: \n{result_1}")

vector_c = [1, 2]
result_2 = matrix_a @ vector_c
print(f"Result with custom and vector: \n{result_2}")

numpy_array = np.array([[9, 10], [11, 12]])
result_3 = matrix_a @ numpy_array
print(f"Result with custom and numpy array: \n{result_3}")
```

By enforcing the result to be a `np.array()`, we accommodate the change in type checking introduced in `numpy==1.20.0` , allowing successful execution. Even when the result is already of numpy type, we are adhering to the interface change without much overhead.

Furthermore, if the custom class uses methods that rely on `numpy`'s internal functions, particularly those exposed in the `numpy.core` module which are considered private and are not recommended for direct access, these could have also been refactored between 1.19.5 and 1.20.0. A quick fix is often not possible here, and a rewrite using `numpy`'s public APIs is recommended for long-term maintainability. Here's an example demonstrating such case:

```python
import numpy as np

class CustomMatrix:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = np.array(data)

    def my_transpose(self):
      #Before, one might have used a private method:
        #return np.core.numeric.transpose(self.data) #Do not use numpy internals

      # After, we should use the public method:
        return np.transpose(self.data)

# Example Usage:
matrix_a = CustomMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
transposed = matrix_a.my_transpose()
print(transposed)
```

This illustrates that using publicly exposed functions such as `np.transpose` instead of relying on internal modules such as `np.core.numeric` protects against breaking changes. Refactoring code to avoid relying on private modules provides better long term stability with library updates.

In situations requiring long-term stability without constant code adaptation, consistent `numpy` versions become paramount. Employing virtual environments with `pip` or `conda` can significantly reduce the risk of such conflicts. In my work, I prefer `conda` environments, for their more robust package management and the added capability of handling non-python dependencies. If consistency isn't possible, a thorough review of custom classes that implement `numpy` magic methods, with an emphasis on the specific type requirements of newer `numpy` versions, is a must.

For learning more about `numpy`'s API and changes between versions, the official NumPy documentation is the primary source. You should also read the release notes on github or project's website for changes between specific versions. Additionally, the “SciPy Lecture Notes” provides a broader overview of using `numpy` for scientific computation and can help deepen the understanding of the core library. Finally, for advanced scenarios of scientific computation it's helpful to be familiar with the libraries used on top of `numpy` such as `scipy`.
