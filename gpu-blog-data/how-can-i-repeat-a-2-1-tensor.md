TensorFlow 1.10's lack of a direct `repeat` function for tensors necessitates a workaround leveraging `tf.tile` or `tf.concat`.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines in that era highlighted the importance of efficient tensor manipulation, particularly when dealing with repetitive operations on relatively small tensors.  Direct repetition using broadcasting wasn't readily available, thus requiring explicit reshaping and concatenation or tiling operations.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge involves increasing the number of rows in a (2, 1) tensor to 50 rows while retaining the single column structure.  Directly replicating the data necessitates the use of tiling or concatenation techniques.  Tiling involves replicating the existing tensor multiple times to form the desired shape. Concatenation involves repeatedly appending copies of the original tensor to itself. The selection between these methods hinges on performance considerations and the desired memory footprint. For tensors of this size, the difference might be negligible; however, for significantly larger tensors, tiling might offer a speed advantage.

To achieve the desired (50, 1) tensor, we need to determine how many times the (2, 1) tensor must be replicated to reach, or exceed, 50 rows.  Integer division (`//`)  provides this repetition count, handling cases where 50 isn't an exact multiple of 2. Any remaining rows are filled by appending the necessary rows from the original (2,1) tensor.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.tile`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the original tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0]])

# Calculate the number of repetitions needed
repetitions = 50 // 2  # Integer division

# Tile the tensor
tiled_tensor = tf.tile(original_tensor, [repetitions, 1])

# Check the shape
print(tiled_tensor.shape)  # Output: (50, 1)

# Handle potential leftover rows (in this case, none)
remainder = 50 % 2
if remainder > 0:
  remainder_tensor = tf.slice(original_tensor, [0, 0], [remainder, 1])
  tiled_tensor = tf.concat([tiled_tensor, remainder_tensor], axis=0)

#Verify shape again after handling remainder (optional)
print(tiled_tensor.shape) #Output: (50, 1)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(tiled_tensor))
```

This approach utilizes `tf.tile` to directly replicate the tensor. The calculation of `repetitions` ensures we tile enough times to cover at least 50 rows. The `remainder` handling adds the necessary rows to fill the remaining rows in the resultant tensor. This method is efficient for larger tensors as it avoids multiple concatenation operations.

**Example 2: Using `tf.concat` and looping**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

original_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0]])
final_tensor = original_tensor

for i in range(24): # 25 iterations to reach 50 rows (25*2 = 50)
  final_tensor = tf.concat([final_tensor, original_tensor], axis=0)

final_tensor = tf.slice(final_tensor, [0,0], [50,1]) #Slice to ensure exactly 50 rows

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(final_tensor))
    print(final_tensor.shape) # Output: (50, 1)
```

This example demonstrates the use of `tf.concat` within a loop.  This iterative approach is less efficient than tiling for large tensors but may be more intuitive for understanding the repetition process.  It directly concatenates the original tensor repeatedly, though it requires explicit slicing to handle the exact row count. The looping approach can be less efficient for very large tensors due to the repeated concatenation operations.

**Example 3:  Combining `tf.tile` and `tf.concat` for optimized handling of remainders**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

original_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0]])
target_rows = 50

repetitions = target_rows // 2
remainder = target_rows % 2

tiled_tensor = tf.tile(original_tensor, [repetitions, 1])

if remainder > 0:
  remainder_tensor = tf.slice(original_tensor, [0, 0], [remainder, 1])
  final_tensor = tf.concat([tiled_tensor, remainder_tensor], axis=0)
else:
  final_tensor = tiled_tensor

with tf.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(final_tensor))
  print(final_tensor.shape) # Output: (50, 1)
```

This example combines the efficiency of `tf.tile` for the bulk of the repetition with the precision of `tf.concat` for handling the remainder. This hybrid approach offers a balance between performance and clarity, effectively addressing the potential for leftover rows. This approach often offers the best balance between speed and code readability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow 1.x documentation (specifically the sections on tensor manipulation functions like `tf.tile`, `tf.concat`, and `tf.slice`) provides crucial information.  Reviewing examples of tensor reshaping and manipulation within the broader TensorFlow documentation will further enhance understanding.  Exploring resources on efficient tensor operations within TensorFlow (particularly for large-scale data processing) is also highly valuable.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with Python's numerical operations and array manipulation techniques will further support efficient tensor operations within TensorFlow.
