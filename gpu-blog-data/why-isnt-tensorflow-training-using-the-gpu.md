TensorFlow not utilizing the available GPU during training is a common issue, often stemming from a mismatch in software configurations or underlying hardware dependencies. Based on my experience troubleshooting high-performance computing environments, the root causes generally fall into three major categories: TensorFlow installation issues, CUDA driver or toolkit incompatibilities, and incorrect device placement within the TensorFlow code itself.

**1. TensorFlow Installation and GPU Support:**

The most basic reason for TensorFlowâ€™s inability to leverage a GPU is an improper installation. There are two main TensorFlow packages: `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-gpu`. The former, the CPU-only version, will obviously not utilize a GPU. Using `pip list` to verify package installation is a critical first step. A simple `pip install tensorflow` will install the CPU version even if a GPU exists, due to the default installation behavior. Therefore, `pip install tensorflow-gpu` should have been executed during installation to enable GPU utilization.

However, installing `tensorflow-gpu` does not automatically guarantee GPU use. TensorFlow requires a specific version of the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN library, which must be compatible with the specific version of TensorFlow installed. These libraries handle the low-level communication between TensorFlow and the GPU. If these components are missing or incompatible with one another, TensorFlow will silently default to using the CPU.

To check whether a GPU is detectable by TensorFlow, you should execute the following python code within a python environment with tensorflow installed.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices())
```
This will display the number of GPUs that tensorflow detects as well as detailed information about each discovered device. If the first line outputs 0 and the list is empty or does not contain a physical GPU then tensorflow is not setup to access it.

**2. CUDA Driver and Toolkit Incompatibilities:**

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and API created by NVIDIA. The CUDA toolkit includes the necessary libraries, headers, and tools that allow for GPU computing in TensorFlow. NVIDIA GPU drivers also need to be installed separately and are essential for the operating system to interface with the physical GPU hardware. Furthermore, the CUDA Toolkit needs to be compatible with the NVIDIA driver version which often leads to compatibility issues.

It is imperative that the versions of the CUDA driver, CUDA Toolkit, and TensorFlow are compatible. NVIDIA regularly releases driver updates and CUDA Toolkit patches while TensorFlow also gets updated regularly. If these are not aligned according to the supported configurations of each package, the GPU will remain idle. Consulting the TensorFlow release notes and NVIDIA's compatibility matrix is crucial to resolve such issues.

Using the command line tools such as `nvidia-smi` can help to determine the current CUDA driver version. After, this needs to be compared to the version that the installed version of tensorflow expects.

```bash
nvidia-smi
```
This will display a table of information about your NVIDIA GPU, including the current driver version.

**3. Incorrect Device Placement in TensorFlow Code:**

Even when TensorFlow is correctly installed and the correct NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are installed, device placement errors within the TensorFlow code can cause the model to be trained using only the CPU. TensorFlow automatically attempts to place operations on available devices. However, explicit device specification, either by default or through explicit `tf.device` context managers is often required. Without these, TensorFlow may default to using CPU even if GPU support is present.

For example, consider a simple model that defines a single variable, the following code will create this variable on the CPU despite a GPU existing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

start_time = time.time()
a = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(10000, 10000)))
print(f"CPU time to create variable {time.time() - start_time}")
```

The code above will create variable `a` on the CPU, this is because we did not specify a device to perform the action on. To allocate this variable on the GPU we need to utilize `tf.device` as in the following example.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

start_time = time.time()
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    a = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(10000, 10000)))
print(f"GPU time to create variable {time.time() - start_time}")
```
This will create the variable `a` on the first GPU. The index of the GPU can also be chosen when multiple are available and can be used to split training across GPUs. While this is a trivial example, the same concept applies to entire model definitions, layers, operations, and training loops.

Often, TensorFlow models will not explicitly define the device, but for model training or deployment on specific hardware it is essential to ensure model operations are performed on the desired device. Device placement can also become an issue when using distribution strategies in TensorFlow, as device placement must be correctly set so that distributed models will work correctly with the distributed hardware.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To gain a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow and its GPU utilization, consult the official TensorFlow documentation. This is a critical resource, providing detailed information on installation, device placement, distribution strategies, and compatibility requirements. In addition, NVIDIA's developer documentation, accessible from their developer portal, gives in-depth guides on CUDA Toolkit and driver configurations. Further, a variety of community forums and online tutorials for model training exist and are helpful for providing insights into real-world scenarios and practical solutions for model training using GPU hardware. Reading the release notes and package information of these packages is crucial for understanding the supported configurations. Finally, searching for solutions to common problems relating to Tensorflow with respect to GPU usage can often lead to relevant stack overflow posts which can be very valuable.
