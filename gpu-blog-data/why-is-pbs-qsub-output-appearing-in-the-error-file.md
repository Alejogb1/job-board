The primary reason output from PBS (Portable Batch System) `qsub` jobs can unexpectedly appear in the error file, rather than the intended standard output file, stems from how PBS redirects and captures streams. By default, PBS uses file descriptors, specifically file descriptor 2 for standard error (stderr) and file descriptor 1 for standard output (stdout). While we often perceive standard output as the "normal" output and standard error as representing problems, the system treats them as distinct streams that require explicit direction. When a job script doesn't actively manage these streams, PBS's default behavior dictates where the output lands, which can lead to the described scenario.

The standard scenario involves the `qsub` command submitting a script to the batch system. This script, during its execution on a compute node, generates both standard output and standard error streams. These are then, based on the `qsub` arguments or the system's default behavior, redirected to specified files. If redirection is not adequately defined, both streams can be captured in the error file. This occurs particularly when the job script doesn't explicitly direct the standard output stream (stdout) to a specific location.

My experience in managing a cluster has highlighted several common culprits behind this behavior. These typically involve how the `qsub` command is invoked, the structure of the submitted job script, and default system configurations. If you examine the submitted job script, the commands executed and the presence, or absence, of specific redirection operators play a crucial role. Consider the following aspects:

1. **Implicit Redirection:** When `qsub` is used without specifying `-o` (output file) or `-e` (error file) options, PBS employs system-wide default settings. These settings often direct both standard output and standard error to the same location, most commonly the error file, if an explicit output file is not defined. The rationale is to ensure all job-related information is captured, even if it's not neatly categorized. This is a common setup to avoid data loss in case of unexpected job termination.

2. **In-Script Redirection Overrides:** Inside the submitted script, you might have commands that explicitly redirect output using shell redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, `&>`, etc.). If you accidentally redirect standard output to standard error's descriptor or file, or redirect both to the error file, then your desired standard output will indeed show up in the error file. This is frequently caused by typos in the redirection syntax or by a misunderstanding of the redirection operators.

3. **PBS Configuration:** The PBS system itself might be configured to capture both output streams to a shared file path, potentially for monitoring or administrative purposes. Although less common in more mature environments, I have seen systems where the default behavior is set such that all output, irrespective of whether it's standard out or error, is captured in a single log file.

To clarify, let’s review code examples that illustrate these scenarios. I'll provide the `qsub` command, the content of the job script being submitted, and a brief explanation of the resulting behavior.

**Example 1: Implicit Redirection to Error File**

Here’s the `qsub` command:

```bash
qsub my_job.sh
```

Here’s the content of `my_job.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a standard output message"
echo "This is an error message" >&2
```

In this example, no `-o` or `-e` options are used in the `qsub` command. In many PBS setups, this will lead to both messages being recorded in the default error file, as PBS’s implicit behavior directs standard output to the same destination as standard error when no specific output file is defined. The first `echo` command's output goes to stdout, but PBS redirects this to the error file due to the default configuration. The second `echo` command explicitly directs its output to stderr. The result is that the default error file will contain both lines of text.

**Example 2: Explicit Redirecting of Standard Output to Standard Error File**

Here’s the `qsub` command:

```bash
qsub my_job.sh -e my_err.log
```

Here’s the content of `my_job.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a standard output message" >&2
echo "This is an error message" >&2
```

In this scenario, while the `qsub` command specifies an error file `my_err.log`, the job script itself redirects *all* of its output to the standard error stream via `>&2`. The redirection `>&2` redirects all output (both standard out and error) to standard error. Consequently, both "This is a standard output message" and "This is an error message" are written to `my_err.log`. This exemplifies how in-script redirection can override the typical expectation of distinct output files, causing unexpected content in the specified error file.

**Example 3: Explicit Separation of Output and Error Files**

Here’s the `qsub` command:

```bash
qsub my_job.sh -o my_out.log -e my_err.log
```

Here’s the content of `my_job.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a standard output message"
echo "This is an error message" >&2
```

This example demonstrates the proper way to separate the two streams. The `qsub` command specifies that standard output should be placed into `my_out.log`, using `-o`, and standard error into `my_err.log`, using `-e`. The script emits output to stdout and stderr appropriately. In this case, you would correctly find "This is a standard output message" in `my_out.log` and "This is an error message" in `my_err.log`. This is the ideal scenario where output is properly categorized and routed to the expected locations.

To diagnose similar issues effectively, I recommend several resources for further study. First, thoroughly review the documentation for your specific PBS implementation, such as PBS Professional or OpenPBS. Consult the section on job submission options, redirection behavior, and default configurations. Additionally, research shell redirection operators to fully understand how your job scripts can be affecting the output streams. Textbooks covering Unix shell scripting can be particularly useful here. Finally, consider studying system administration textbooks or guides which discuss batch systems in more detail. Learning the fundamental concepts of file descriptors and output streams will significantly help in troubleshooting these kinds of issues. By diligently analyzing your `qsub` invocations, the code within your job scripts, and your PBS system’s configuration, you can effectively pinpoint why your PBS job's output is appearing in the error file.
