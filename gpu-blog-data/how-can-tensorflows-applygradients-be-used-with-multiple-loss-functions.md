Divergent loss functions, a situation frequently encountered in multi-task learning or complex model architectures, necessitate careful gradient application within the TensorFlow ecosystem. Directly combining gradients from distinct loss sources using `apply_gradients()` requires a structured approach rather than a naive aggregation, which could lead to undesirable training behavior. Having implemented several multi-objective models, I've found that managing gradients effectively for different loss contributions is crucial for convergence and desired performance.

The core challenge lies in the fact that `apply_gradients()` expects a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a gradient tensor and a corresponding variable. When multiple loss functions are present, each loss function will compute its own set of gradients with respect to the same or overlapping sets of trainable variables. Therefore, we need to: a) compute each set of gradients separately, b) potentially adjust gradients before applying them, c) accumulate or apply these gradients in a consistent manner. Simply summing all gradients originating from different loss functions before feeding them into `apply_gradients()` might not be optimal, especially if loss scales vary significantly.

The standard practice involves computing gradients per loss function, and then, before applying them using `apply_gradients()`, the gradients might be scaled, weighted, or even clipped based on a strategy chosen according to the specific multi-objective learning task. The process typically involves using `tf.GradientTape` to compute the gradients for each loss function. The resulting gradient lists from each tape then need to be consolidated before application.

Below are three code examples illustrating common approaches for handling multiple loss functions in TensorFlow:

**Example 1: Simple Weighted Combination**

This is the most basic scenario, where we directly weight and combine gradients. This assumes that the underlying tasks are relatively comparable and the weighting strategy can effectively guide model optimization.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model():
  # Simplified model for demonstration
  return tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(2) # Two outputs, one for each task
  ])

def loss_fn_1(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true[:, 0] - y_pred[:, 0])) # Example regression loss

def loss_fn_2(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_true[:,1], logits=y_pred[:,1])) # Example binary cross entropy loss

model = create_model()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape1:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss1 = loss_fn_1(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients1 = tape1.gradient(loss1, model.trainable_variables)

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape2:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss2 = loss_fn_2(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients2 = tape2.gradient(loss2, model.trainable_variables)

    # Apply weighting to gradients
    loss_weights = [0.7, 0.3] # arbitrary weights, tuned
    weighted_gradients = [grad1*loss_weights[0] + grad2*loss_weights[1] if grad1 is not None and grad2 is not None else grad1 if grad1 is not None else grad2 for grad1, grad2 in zip(gradients1,gradients2)]

    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(weighted_gradients, model.trainable_variables))

x = tf.random.normal((32, 5)) # Example data
y_true = tf.random.normal((32, 2)) # Example targets

train_step(x, y_true)
```

In this example, we establish two separate gradient computation contexts using `tf.GradientTape`. We then compute gradients for both `loss_fn_1` and `loss_fn_2`. A weighting scheme using `loss_weights` is applied *after* gradient calculation, reflecting a strategy where the losses have an assigned influence on parameter updates. The weighted gradients are then combined using zip, handling potential None gradients from layers used only in one of the two loss calculations, before application.

**Example 2: Gradient Clipping per Task**

This example introduces gradient clipping, which can help stabilize training and mitigate the effect of outlier gradients originating from any single loss. This approach is particularly valuable when the loss functions exhibit very different magnitudes or sensitivities to parameter updates.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model():
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(2) # Two outputs, one for each task
    ])

def loss_fn_1(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true[:, 0] - y_pred[:, 0])) # Example regression loss

def loss_fn_2(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_true[:,1], logits=y_pred[:,1])) # Example binary cross entropy loss

model = create_model()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape1:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss1 = loss_fn_1(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients1 = tape1.gradient(loss1, model.trainable_variables)

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape2:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss2 = loss_fn_2(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients2 = tape2.gradient(loss2, model.trainable_variables)

    # Clip gradients per task
    clipped_gradients1 = [tf.clip_by_norm(grad, clip_norm=0.5) if grad is not None else grad for grad in gradients1]
    clipped_gradients2 = [tf.clip_by_norm(grad, clip_norm=1.0) if grad is not None else grad for grad in gradients2]

    # Combine clipped gradients
    loss_weights = [0.7, 0.3]
    weighted_gradients = [grad1*loss_weights[0] + grad2*loss_weights[1] if grad1 is not None and grad2 is not None else grad1 if grad1 is not None else grad2 for grad1, grad2 in zip(clipped_gradients1,clipped_gradients2)]


    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(weighted_gradients, model.trainable_variables))

x = tf.random.normal((32, 5))
y_true = tf.random.normal((32, 2))

train_step(x, y_true)
```

Here, after the gradient calculation for each loss, we clip the gradients separately using `tf.clip_by_norm`. The clipping threshold can be set according to individual loss behavior, which would be determined through prior experiments or theoretical justification. After clipping each gradient set, these are weighted, and then combined, before parameter update.

**Example 3: Loss-Specific Updates (Conditional Updates)**

This example outlines an approach where, instead of combining all the gradients before updating the trainable parameters, we update parameters associated with a particular loss, selectively. This selective parameter update is achieved by computing the gradients for all losses but only using some of them in each update. This strategy is useful in scenarios where tasks are highly disparate or for specific optimization algorithms where the training procedure might alternate parameter updates.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model():
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(2) # Two outputs, one for each task
    ])

def loss_fn_1(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true[:, 0] - y_pred[:, 0])) # Example regression loss

def loss_fn_2(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_true[:,1], logits=y_pred[:,1])) # Example binary cross entropy loss

model = create_model()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

def train_step(x, y_true, update_idx):

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape1:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss1 = loss_fn_1(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients1 = tape1.gradient(loss1, model.trainable_variables)

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape2:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss2 = loss_fn_2(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients2 = tape2.gradient(loss2, model.trainable_variables)

    if update_idx == 0:
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients1, model.trainable_variables))
    elif update_idx == 1:
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients2, model.trainable_variables))

x = tf.random.normal((32, 5))
y_true = tf.random.normal((32, 2))

# alternating updates, only one at a time.
train_step(x, y_true, update_idx = 0)
train_step(x, y_true, update_idx = 1)
```

In this setup, the `train_step` method accepts an `update_idx` argument. Based on this index, parameters are updated by applying either `gradients1` or `gradients2` to the trainable variables. This demonstrates a conditional update scheme where different losses affect different parameters in different steps. A practical implementation would involve iterating over such updates in a predefined or dynamically changing strategy.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of multi-objective optimization and gradient manipulation, I would recommend exploring advanced topics in neural network training. The following resources, available across various platforms, can prove useful. Specifically, look for material on:
