The core misunderstanding underlying the question of converting a TensorFlow Keras model to a Keras model stems from a semantic ambiguity.  TensorFlow Keras *is* Keras.  The `tf.keras` API is the TensorFlow implementation of the Keras API.  Therefore, a model built using `tf.keras` is already a Keras model.  The question, then, is likely about converting a model *saved* in a format associated with TensorFlow Keras to one usable by a different backend, such as a standalone Keras installation (without TensorFlow dependency) or a different deep learning framework entirely.  This conversion process involves careful consideration of serialization formats and potential backend incompatibilities.

My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects has frequently involved model deployment across different environments, including embedded systems with limited TensorFlow support.  This necessitates the ability to seamlessly transfer models built and trained within the convenient TensorFlow Keras ecosystem to these resource-constrained environments.  This usually translates to converting the saved model into a more portable format or even into a different framework's native representation.

**1.  Explanation of Conversion Strategies:**

The most straightforward approach avoids any actual conversion.  If the target environment supports TensorFlow, loading the model directly using `tf.keras.models.load_model()` suffices.  This function handles the loading of the model architecture and weights efficiently.  However, if the target environment lacks TensorFlow or requires a different deep learning framework, a more involved process is needed.

The standard approach involves saving the model in a format independent of the specific Keras backend.  The `HDF5` format (`*.h5`) is a common choice.  Saving the model in this format using `model.save('my_model.h5')` preserves the model architecture and weights.  This file can then be loaded in other Keras environments using the same function, provided that the necessary layers and custom components are available in the new environment.  Discrepancies in custom layer implementations are a potential source of errors during this process.  Careful consideration of custom layers and ensuring their availability in the target environment is crucial.

For more compatibility and potentially improved portability,  the `SavedModel` format, managed by TensorFlow, is another option.  While `SavedModel` is primarily associated with TensorFlow, it allows for a degree of backend-agnostic representation, provided no TensorFlow-specific operations are embedded within the model architecture.  This format is saved using `tf.saved_model.save(model, 'my_model')`.  Loading requires utilizing the `tf.saved_model.load` function.  This path is often preferred for greater robustness across different deep learning infrastructures.

Finally, a more comprehensive conversion may be needed if migrating to an entirely different deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch).  This involves recreating the model architecture manually in the target framework and then loading the weights from the saved TensorFlow Keras model.  This is the most laborious approach and requires detailed understanding of both frameworks.  It often entails mapping layer types and parameter names between the two frameworks, a process that can be intricate and prone to errors.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Saving and Loading using HDF5:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Build a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Save the model to HDF5
model.save('my_model.h5')

# Load the model from HDF5
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

# Verify that the loaded model is identical (optional)
# ... comparison logic ...
```

This example showcases the basic saving and loading using HDF5.  The comment "// ... comparison logic ..." highlights that one might add verification steps to ensure data integrity during the load process, especially in critical applications.


**Example 2: Saving and Loading using SavedModel:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Model building as in Example 1) ...

# Save the model using SavedModel
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'my_saved_model')

# Load the model from SavedModel
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_saved_model')

# Access the loaded model's layers
# ... access and verification logic ...
```

Here, the `SavedModel` format is used, offering enhanced portability.  Again, verification steps are crucial for ensuring model integrity after loading.  Note the subtle difference in how the model is accessed after loading.


**Example 3:  Illustrative (Partial) Conversion to a Hypothetical Framework:**

```python
# Assuming a hypothetical framework 'MyFramework'

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import myframework as mf # Hypothetical framework

# ... (Model building and saving to HDF5 as in Example 1) ...

# Load weights from HDF5 (this part is framework-specific)
weights = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5').get_weights()

# Recreate the model in MyFramework
my_model = mf.Sequential([
    mf.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    mf.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Set weights in MyFramework model (this part is framework-specific)
my_model.set_weights(weights)

# ... further processing within MyFramework ...
```

This example illustrates the fundamental steps of manual conversion.  The specifics of weight loading and model recreation are highly dependent on the target framework's API and might require significant adjustments based on the intricacies of each framework's layer implementation.  This example is skeletal; a full conversion would require a much more thorough mapping of layers and parameters.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for TensorFlow and Keras is an indispensable resource.  Thorough understanding of the serialization formats (HDF5, SavedModel) and the underlying mechanisms of model saving and loading is crucial.  Furthermore, the documentation for any target framework (if conversion beyond TensorFlow is needed) is equally important.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with best practices for model deployment and version control is highly beneficial in managing the complexities of model transfer across different environments.
