The primary advantage of directly utilizing Keras backend commands stems from the need for granular control over tensor manipulation, custom layer implementations, and low-level optimization scenarios often not directly exposed through the higher-level Keras API. I've frequently encountered situations, particularly when experimenting with novel activation functions or loss landscapes, where the abstracted nature of Keras hinders rather than helps. It’s in these cases that accessing the underlying tensor operations provided by the backend, be it TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK (though TensorFlow is the primary backend today), becomes essential.

The core Keras API is designed for model definition, training, and evaluation using pre-built layers and loss functions. However, research or highly specific applications often require modifications or creations beyond the provided components. Imagine needing an activation function with a dynamic parameter dependent on the input tensor’s statistical distribution. Implementing such a feature isn’t feasible solely through Keras’ layer definitions. Instead, it necessitates leveraging backend tensor operations to perform the necessary calculations and incorporate the parameter into the function's output during the forward pass.

This capability is not just about implementing new functional components. It often becomes vital during debugging and optimization. The high-level Keras API abstracts many of the numerical operations, which can obscure bottlenecks or unexpected behaviors. By using backend commands, I can examine tensor shapes at arbitrary points during model execution, trace gradients to find sources of vanishing or exploding behavior, and manipulate tensors to enforce constraints or apply custom regularizations. These low-level interventions allow for targeted optimizations that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.

Another critical use case arises when needing to implement custom gradients for a specific layer or operation. While Keras provides some avenues for this, they might not suffice for complex scenarios. If, for instance, one needs a gradient that is not a direct derivative of the forward pass or requires specialized handling of non-differentiable regions, direct access to the backend's gradient functions becomes unavoidable.

Furthermore, the backend's functions are essential when building custom layers with state variables that persist across multiple training batches, a feature not readily available through standard Keras layers. If one desires to implement a memory cell with its internal, learnable parameters that must evolve over multiple inputs, backend operations allow the definition of that state and its update mechanisms.

Here are several illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Custom Activation Function with Backend Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.layers import Layer

class CustomActivation(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomActivation, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.alpha = self.add_weight(name='alpha', shape=(1,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True)
        super(CustomActivation, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, x):
        return K.relu(x) + self.alpha * K.sigmoid(x)

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return input_shape

# Example Usage within a Keras Model
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation=CustomActivation()))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

```

In this example, I've defined a custom activation function that combines a ReLU activation with a scaled sigmoid, controlled by a learnable parameter *alpha*. This entire functionality is reliant on accessing `K.relu` and `K.sigmoid` from the TensorFlow backend within the `call` method. Attempting this through standard Keras layers would not allow for incorporating the learnable 'alpha' parameter in such a fine-grained manner.

**Example 2: Gradient Manipulation with Backend**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.layers import Layer

class GradientClippingLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, clip_value, **kwargs):
        super(GradientClippingLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.clip_value = clip_value

    def call(self, x):
       return x # No transformation, acts purely on backprop
   
    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return input_shape
    
    def get_updates(self, inputs, trainable_weights):
        grads = self.optimizer.get_gradients(self.loss, trainable_weights)
        clipped_grads = [K.clip(g, -self.clip_value, self.clip_value) for g in grads]
        return self.optimizer.updates_with_grads(clipped_grads, trainable_weights)

# Example Usage within a custom training loop
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Model, Input
from keras.optimizers import Adam

input_tensor = Input(shape=(10,))
x = Dense(10)(input_tensor)
x = GradientClippingLayer(1.0)(x) # Apply clipping
output_tensor = Dense(1)(x)

model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
optimizer = Adam()
model.optimizer = optimizer
model.loss = 'mse' # Assign the loss
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)


for i in range(100): # Custom Training loop example
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x_train)
        loss = K.mean(tf.keras.losses.mse(y_train, y_pred))

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    clipped_grads = [K.clip(g, -1.0, 1.0) for g in grads]
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example demonstrates gradient manipulation. While Keras has a `clipnorm` parameter for optimizers, this example illustrates how `K.clip` can enforce more specific gradient control or even apply different clipping values per layer. The `get_updates` method is overridden to modify the back-propagated gradients using `K.clip`. A simpler approach using a gradient tape is shown in the training loop, illustrating the flexibility of backend access to tensor operations in training.

**Example 3: Custom Layer with Internal State**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.layers import Layer

class StatefulLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(StatefulLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.state = self.add_weight(name='state', shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='zeros', trainable=False)
        self.W = self.add_weight(name='W', shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        super(StatefulLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, x):
        self.state.assign(K.dot(x, self.W) + self.state ) # State update
        return self.state

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
       return (input_shape[0], self.units)

# Example Usage
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Input

model = Sequential()
model.add(Input(shape=(10,)))
model.add(StatefulLayer(10))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

x_train = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
model.predict(x_train)
print(model.layers[1].get_weights())
model.predict(x_train) # Check state after second prediction
print(model.layers[1].get_weights()) # State changed
```

Here, a `StatefulLayer` is constructed. This layer maintains an internal state variable that accumulates weighted input over successive calls to the layer. This behavior is not directly achievable with standard Keras layer definitions as they are generally stateless. The `self.state.assign` operation allows for manipulating the tensor via the backend, allowing for persistent state between calls to the layer. This persistent state can be used for many unique applications, like recurrent networks and self-referential models.

To further strengthen ones understanding of this topic, I recommend exploring the Keras documentation directly, focusing on the backend section. Additionally, reviewing specific backend documentation, such as the TensorFlow API guide for core operations, will provide a more comprehensive insight. Studying research papers that involve specialized gradient techniques or unique layer constructions will reveal concrete examples of where backend commands become essential in real-world, advanced contexts. Further practice in implementing custom layers with varying functionalities provides deeper comprehension of the subject.
