The discrepancy observed when overlaying a global mean onto a histogram generated using Altair's `transform_aggregate` often stems from a misunderstanding of how Altair handles data aggregation and the inherent limitations of its `transform_aggregate` function within the context of generating overlaid statistics.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale data visualization projects for financial modeling highlighted this precise problem. The key lies in correctly specifying the aggregation scope and ensuring the aggregated value is properly integrated into the visualization.  Simply adding a mean calculated independently will almost always result in an incorrect overlay.

The root cause generally lies in how Altair handles binning.  `transform_aggregate` performs aggregations *within* each bin created by the histogram's `bin` operator.  This means that if you calculate the global mean separately and attempt to overlay it, you're comparing a single global value against the binned means produced by `transform_aggregate`.  These values will only coincide if the data distribution is perfectly uniform across the bins â€“ a highly improbable scenario in real-world datasets.

Let me illustrate this with code examples.  Assume we have a Pandas DataFrame named `df` with a column called 'values'.


**Example 1: Incorrect Overlay Attempt**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({'values': np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=3, size=1000)})

# Incorrect approach: Calculating global mean separately
global_mean = df['values'].mean()

# Histogram with incorrect overlay
alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('values:Q', bin=True),
    alt.Y('count():Q'),
).properties(
    title='Incorrect Global Mean Overlay'
).encode(
    alt.Y('count():Q'),
    tooltip=['count()', 'values']
).layer(
    alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'mean': [global_mean]})).mark_rule(color='red').encode(
        y='mean:Q'
    )
)
```

This code generates a histogram and attempts to overlay a horizontal line representing the global mean. The problem? The global mean is a single value, unrelated to the binned data within the histogram.  The line will likely not align with the peak or central tendency shown in the histogram's bars.

**Example 2: Correct Overlay using `transform_aggregate`**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({'values': np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=3, size=1000)})


# Correct approach: Calculating mean within the binning process
alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('values:Q', bin=True),
    alt.Y('count():Q'),
).properties(
    title='Correct Global Mean Overlay'
).transform_aggregate(
    mean_values='mean(values)',
    groupby=['values:Q']
).encode(
    alt.X('values:Q', bin=True),
    alt.Y('count():Q'),
    tooltip=['count()', 'mean_values']
).layer(
    alt.Chart(df).mark_line(color='red').encode(
        alt.X('values:Q', bin=True),
        alt.Y('mean_values:Q'),
    )
)

```

This improved version calculates the mean *within each bin*.  The `transform_aggregate` calculates the mean ('mean_values') for each bin defined by the `bin` operator on the 'values' column. This method correctly overlays the mean for each bin, giving a clearer representation of central tendency across the data's distribution. However, note that the mean line is step-wise due to the nature of binning.


**Example 3:  Addressing the Step-Wise Mean Line**

The step-wise appearance of the mean line in Example 2 may be undesirable. To get a smoother mean line representation, consider using a different aggregation method that operates on the underlying raw data and uses a smoother visual representation, such as a line rather than a bar.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({'values': np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=3, size=1000)})

# Calculate global mean and add to dataframe
global_mean = df['values'].mean()
df['global_mean'] = global_mean

# Overlay as a separate line chart
alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('values:Q', bin=True),
    alt.Y('count():Q'),
).properties(
    title='Smoother Global Mean Overlay'
).encode(
    alt.X('values:Q', bin=True),
    alt.Y('count():Q'),
    tooltip=['count()', 'values']
).layer(
    alt.Chart(df).mark_rule(color='red').encode(
        alt.Y('global_mean:Q')
    )
)
```

This approach shows a horizontal line at the global mean, providing a clear reference point for the overall average.

In summary, while `transform_aggregate` is a powerful tool, it's crucial to understand its behavior regarding aggregation scope. Directly overlaying a separately calculated global mean onto a histogram created with `transform_aggregate` is generally incorrect because they operate on different levels of aggregation.  The most suitable solution depends on the desired visual representation.  If the intent is to see the mean within each bin, the second example is preferred. If a clear visualization of the overall global mean is needed in relation to the distribution, the third approach provides a clearer representation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Altair's official documentation.  The relevant chapters on data transformations and encoding are critical for a solid understanding. A dedicated textbook on data visualization principles will offer valuable context for effective chart design and interpretation.  Finally, exploring examples and tutorials available online (outside of Stack Overflow)  will offer diverse strategies for data visualization.
