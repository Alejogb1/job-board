The core issue behind the `TypeError` encountered when loading a TensorFlow Keras `SavedModel` twice stems from the model's internal state management and the way TensorFlow handles object references, particularly within custom layers or callbacks.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects involving complex model architectures and custom training loops, I've observed that this error frequently arises when the `SavedModel` contains references to objects that are not properly serialized or deserialized, leading to inconsistencies on subsequent loads.  This often manifests as attempts to access attributes or methods of objects that no longer exist in the Python environment after the initial model load.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `SavedModel` format primarily saves the model's architecture, weights, and optimizer state. However, it doesn't inherently persist all Python objects associated with the model during training. Custom layers, for instance, might contain internal state variables or callbacks might reference external data structures.  When you load the `SavedModel`, TensorFlow attempts to reconstruct the model based on the stored information.  If the model relies on objects that are not directly part of the model's core structure – objects that are not saved and restored by the `save` and `load` methods – their absence after the first load can cause the error. This is exacerbated on the second load because the attempt to recreate these absent objects results in a failure to find them and subsequent `TypeError` exceptions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Custom Layer with Unsaved State**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, initial_value=0):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.my_variable = tf.Variable(initial_value, trainable=False)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs + self.my_variable

model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(5), tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.save('my_model')

loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model')
loaded_model.predict([1]) # works fine

loaded_model2 = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model')  # attempts to reload causing error
loaded_model2.predict([1]) # fails, as the MyCustomLayer attempts to recreate its state.

```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates a `TypeError` arising from a custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`). The `my_variable` is not explicitly handled during saving.  While the layer's structure is saved, the specific value of `my_variable` is not consistently restored across loads. On the second load, TensorFlow attempts to recreate the layer without the initial value, leading to unpredictable behavior.  This highlights the necessity of explicit serialization for custom objects.

**Example 2: Callback referencing external data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class MyCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, external_data):
        super(MyCallback, self).__init__()
        self.external_data = external_data

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Using external data {self.external_data}")

external_data = np.array([1,2,3])
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(np.random.rand(10,5), np.random.rand(10,10), epochs=2, callbacks=[MyCallback(external_data)])
model.save('model_with_callback')

loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_with_callback') # loads fine
#loaded_model.fit(...) # further training may or may not throw an error depending on the callback implementation

loaded_model2 = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_with_callback') # potential TypeError
#loaded_model2.fit(...) # further training may or may not throw an error depending on the callback implementation

```

**Commentary:** This example showcases a callback (`MyCallback`) relying on external data (`external_data`).  While the model itself loads correctly, the callback's state is not saved within the `SavedModel`. During the second load, the callback is recreated, but `external_data` is not restored, leading to either a runtime error or unexpected behavior if the callback attempts to access the missing data.  This requires careful management of external data dependencies within callbacks.


**Example 3:  Handling Custom Objects Correctly**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomObject:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __getstate__(self):
        return {'value': self.value}

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        self.value = state['value']

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, custom_object):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.custom_object = custom_object

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs * self.custom_object.value

my_object = MyCustomObject(2)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(my_object)])
model.save('correct_model', custom_objects={'MyCustomObject':MyCustomObject,'MyCustomLayer':MyCustomLayer})

loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('correct_model', custom_objects={'MyCustomObject':MyCustomObject,'MyCustomLayer':MyCustomLayer})
loaded_model.predict([1]) # works correctly

loaded_model2 = tf.keras.models.load_model('correct_model', custom_objects={'MyCustomObject':MyCustomObject,'MyCustomLayer':MyCustomLayer}) # works correctly
loaded_model2.predict([1]) # works correctly

```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a best practice for handling custom objects.  The `MyCustomObject` class implements `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods, ensuring proper serialization and deserialization. The custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`) uses this object, and the model is saved with the `custom_objects` argument, providing TensorFlow the necessary information to reconstruct the entire model, including the custom object, during both the first and subsequent loads, preventing the `TypeError`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models.  A comprehensive guide on creating and using custom Keras layers and callbacks.  Relevant Stack Overflow threads and discussions focusing on similar error types within the context of Keras and TensorFlow.  Exploring the source code of various TensorFlow components can also be beneficial in understanding the underlying mechanisms of model serialization and deserialization.  Finally, consider leveraging a debugger to systematically investigate the object references during the loading process.
