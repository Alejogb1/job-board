My experience with GEKKO, particularly in complex process modeling scenarios, has shown that discrepancies between expected and achieved objective function values in constrained nonlinear optimization often stem from a convergence issue, a subtle formulation problem, or a numerical precision limitation. It's rarely a direct bug in the solver itself but rather an interaction between model complexities and the solver's heuristic algorithms.

Let's dissect the possible root causes, focusing on what I've repeatedly encountered in practice. GEKKO, while powerful, doesn't magically solve all problems. The success hinges on how well the model is represented and how effectively the solver navigates the solution space. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

**1. Convergence to a Local Minimum:**

Nonlinear optimization problems, by their nature, often possess multiple local minima. GEKKO's solvers, typically variants of Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) or Interior Point methods, are iterative. They attempt to move from an initial guess to a better solution. However, they can get "stuck" in a local minimum that is far from the globally optimal solution. This is probably the single most common reason for an unexpected objective function value. The solver reaches a point where no small change improves the objective, despite it not being the best overall solution.

Key indicators of this problem are an objective function value that seems “too high” or “too low” compared to what you would logically expect and, especially, a strong dependence on the initial guess for the optimization variables. A good initial guess, which is in the vicinity of the global minimum, can be crucial. Sometimes, a very poor initial guess can even lead to the solver finding a non-physical or meaningless solution, resulting in wild objective function values.

**2. Model Formulation Issues:**

The way the model is formulated can dramatically impact the solver’s ability to find an optimal solution. Common formulation issues include:

   *   **Non-Smooth Functions:** GEKKO relies on gradient-based optimization. If your model contains non-smooth functions (e.g., absolute values, if statements used improperly with variable comparisons, or signum functions), the gradients can be discontinuous or zero at critical points, hindering the solver's progress. When feasible, reformulate those functions into smooth approximations using piecewise linearizations or other techniques.
   *   **Unbounded Variables or Constraints:** If your model has variables that are theoretically unbounded or constraints that are too loose, the solver might explore unrealistic areas of the solution space or even diverge. Always impose sensible bounds on all variables. If a variable should never be negative, ensure this is explicitly stated in the model. Similarly, if there is a maximum physical constraint, put that in as well.
   *   **Scaling Problems:** Variables with very different orders of magnitude can cause numerical instability. If one variable is in the range of 1e-6 while another is around 1e6, numerical errors can dominate. Consider scaling the variables so that their typical values have comparable magnitudes. Scaling can be applied by rescaling the variables themselves, by rescaling the equations, or by using the `scale` option of the `GEKKO.Var` function.
   *   **Redundant Constraints:** Over-constraining the problem (having redundant constraints) can sometimes cause issues. For example, two constraints that effectively represent the same limitation can cause the solver difficulty. Simplify your model to eliminate any logical redundancies.
   *  **Hidden or Incorrect Assumptions:** Errors in the equations due to incorrect assumptions can cause the solver to reach the wrong point. This can be due to things like incorrect units or parameters used in the equation that lead to incorrect solutions.

**3. Numerical Precision Limitations:**

Computers represent numbers with finite precision. This can become critical when dealing with very small or very large numbers, especially during iterative calculations. The solver may "converge" when it cannot find a better solution within the limits of numerical precision, even if a better solution theoretically exists. These precision issues can manifest as plateaus in the objective function value or solutions that are only marginally better with each iteration. These issues are often encountered in dynamic optimization problems with fine time resolution and small or large rate of change magnitudes. This also can be an issue when using very large scale problems which is very common in industrial processes.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are some examples that illustrate common issues and potential mitigation strategies:

**Example 1: Local Minimum Trap**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

# Define the objective function with multiple minima
def obj(x):
    return (x[0] - 2)**2 + (x[0] - 4)**2 + (x[1] - 3)**2

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
x = m.Array(m.Var, 2, lb=-10, ub=10, name='x')
m.Equation(m.Intermediate(obj(x)) == m.Obj())

# Solve with a poor initial guess
x[0].value= -1
x[1].value= -1
m.options.SOLVER = 3
m.solve(disp=False)
print(f"Objective value with poor initial guess: {m.options.objfcnval}")
print(f"x0: {x[0].value}, x1: {x[1].value}")

# Solve with a better initial guess
x[0].value = 3
x[1].value = 3
m.solve(disp=False)
print(f"Objective value with better initial guess: {m.options.objfcnval}")
print(f"x0: {x[0].value}, x1: {x[1].value}")
```

**Commentary:** This code demonstrates how different initial guesses lead to different objective function values. The first solve converges to a suboptimal local minimum because its starting point is far from the actual global optimum. The second solve, with a better initial guess closer to the global optimum, achieves a lower objective function value. Experimenting with initial conditions is necessary in such instances.

**Example 2: Non-smooth Objective Function**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
x = m.Var(lb=-5, ub=5, name='x')

# Non-smooth objective function
y = m.abs(x - 2)

m.Obj(y)
m.options.SOLVER = 3
m.solve(disp=False)
print(f"Objective value with abs(): {m.options.objfcnval}")
print(f"x: {x.value}")

# Piecewise Linear Approximation
y2 = m.Var(name='y2')
m.Equation(y2>=x-2)
m.Equation(y2>=-x+2)
m.Obj(y2)
m.solve(disp=False)
print(f"Objective value with piecewise linear: {m.options.objfcnval}")
print(f"x: {x.value}")
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the problems created by using non-smooth functions.  The `abs()` function introduces a kink in the objective function which the solver may struggle to navigate.  The use of a piecewise linear approximation instead allows the solver to work better. However, this formulation introduces an extra variable and two inequalities which may result in slower solve times and is not always feasible for more complex equations.

**Example 3: Scaling Issues**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
x1 = m.Var(lb=0.1, ub=1000, name='x1')
x2 = m.Var(lb=1e-6, ub=1e-2, name='x2')

# Objective function with different variable scales
y = (x1 - 10)**2 + (x2 - 1e-4)**2
m.Obj(y)
m.options.SOLVER = 3
m.solve(disp=False)
print(f"Objective value without scaling: {m.options.objfcnval}")
print(f"x1: {x1.value}, x2: {x2.value}")

# Scaling x2 and objective
x2_scaled = m.Var(value = 0.0001, lb = 0.1, ub=10,name = 'x2_scaled')
m.Equation(x2 == x2_scaled/10000)
y_scaled = (x1 - 10)**2 + (x2_scaled - 1)**2
m.Obj(y_scaled)
m.solve(disp=False)
print(f"Objective value with scaling: {m.options.objfcnval}")
print(f"x1: {x1.value}, x2: {x2.value}")
```

**Commentary:** Here, `x1` and `x2` have vastly different scales. This can lead to inaccurate gradient calculations and potentially poor performance. Rescaling `x2` to be on a similar scale and also scaling the objective helps the solver move towards an improved minimum.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a better grasp of nonlinear optimization techniques, I recommend exploring the following:

*   **Numerical Optimization:** Textbooks on numerical optimization provide a comprehensive understanding of optimization algorithms, including SQP, interior point methods, and others. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each technique helps diagnose and fix issues.
*   **Scientific Computing Tutorials:** Materials focusing on scientific computing often contain modules on how solvers function, how numbers are represented in computers, and ways to mitigate numerical issues like scaling and precision errors.
*   **Software Documentation:** Carefully study the documentation of the GEKKO library, especially sections detailing solvers, variable bounds, constraints, and options. Understanding all configurable options of GEKKO helps diagnose and customize the solution behavior.

In conclusion, unexpected objective function values in GEKKO are seldom due to a solver failure. Rather, they usually indicate a modeling issue. By diligently addressing convergence, formulation, and numerical issues through careful analysis of model behavior, one can often achieve reliable and accurate optimization results.
