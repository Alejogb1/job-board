The recurrent failure of custom reinforcement learning environments to train using standard algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or REINFORCE often stems from a critical mismatch between the environment's characteristics and the assumptions embedded within those algorithms. Over my experience fine-tuning various RL models for robotic manipulation and resource allocation tasks, I've frequently encountered these pitfalls, which typically involve reward sparsity, inappropriate state representation, or non-Markovian environment dynamics. It is essential to meticulously examine each component rather than simply adjusting hyperparameters, as that is not a sustainable problem-solving method.

Firstly, consider the role of reward sparsity. DQN, relying on learning action-values through temporal difference errors, struggles immensely when rewards are infrequent and delayed. In my robotics work, a robot might receive a positive reward only after successfully assembling a complex structure; until then, all actions lead to a zero or negative reward. When an agent experiences only sporadic signals, the training becomes extremely inefficient. The agent might make a sequence of correct steps leading to success, but only the final action is associated with a positive value, making it challenging to backpropagate credit. Similarly, REINFORCE, being a Monte Carlo method, depends on receiving rewards at the end of each episode and struggles in environments where the reward signal is not well distributed. In my resource management scenario, an agent controlling access to shared memory in a multi-core system, might only receive a reward if the overall system throughput increases above a certain level at the end of a multi-step process. This delay makes direct credit assignment exceptionally difficult for the policy gradient method and leads to high variance in the updates and very slow convergence.

Secondly, the environment’s state representation is pivotal. DQN and REINFORCE typically assume a Markovian property, where the current state encapsulates all the information needed for an optimal decision. However, if the environment's history affects the outcomes in a way not captured by the state variables, these algorithms falter. Imagine an autonomous vehicle driving through a city with varying weather conditions. If the agent only receives the current visual data without information about past driving conditions, such as if it is in a wet or dry area, it might not be able to adapt properly to changing circumstances. It's crucial to include any contextual data into the state space to make the decision-making process reliable. With REINFORCE, the situation can be equally problematic since it utilizes complete trajectories and still struggles with a state not fully representing history.

Finally, algorithm assumptions can be problematic when the environment itself isn’t well-behaved. While a lot of RL agents try to find the optimal policy, the very structure of the underlying environment can hinder this goal. If the environment is not stochastic in a good way, it might be difficult for DQN and REINFORCE to converge to optimal policy since they are built with the assumption that the stochastic nature will help learning. In my experience with complex simulations, this is also affected by the nature of the physics behind the environment and it requires carefully modeling all underlying parameters.

To demonstrate these issues with examples, consider a simple navigation problem, where the goal is to reach a target location.

**Example 1: Reward Sparsity**

Here's a Python snippet, using TensorFlow, of a basic environment setup and reward function that leads to sparse rewards:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class SparseGridEnv:
    def __init__(self, size=5):
        self.size = size
        self.position = np.array([0, 0])  # Start at top-left
        self.target = np.array([size - 1, size - 1])  # Target at bottom-right

    def reset(self):
        self.position = np.array([0, 0])
        return self.position

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0:  # Move up
            self.position[1] = max(0, self.position[1] - 1)
        elif action == 1:  # Move down
            self.position[1] = min(self.size - 1, self.position[1] + 1)
        elif action == 2:  # Move left
            self.position[0] = max(0, self.position[0] - 1)
        elif action == 3:  # Move right
            self.position[0] = min(self.size - 1, self.position[0] + 1)

        if np.array_equal(self.position, self.target):
            reward = 10  # Sparse reward
            done = True
        else:
            reward = -1 # Small negative to encourage moving
            done = False
        return self.position, reward, done

env = SparseGridEnv()
# Training with DQN using TensorFlow Agents will struggle here due to the delayed reward.
```
In this environment, the agent receives a reward of 10 only when it reaches the target. This setup will pose difficulties for both DQN and REINFORCE since the only feedback they receive to improve their policy happens when the goal is reached. Without good exploration and credit assignment, these algorithms are inefficient.

**Example 2: Inadequate State Representation**

Assume an agent controls a simplified inventory system with the current inventory and the last demand as the state; consider that the demand follows seasonality, which is missing from the state.
```python
class SeasonalityEnv:
    def __init__(self):
       self.inventory = 50
       self.last_demand = 0
       self.current_time = 0

    def reset(self):
        self.inventory = 50
        self.last_demand = 0
        self.current_time = 0
        return self.get_state()

    def get_state(self):
      return np.array([self.inventory, self.last_demand])

    def step(self, action):
        self.current_time += 1
        seasonal_demand = 20 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * self.current_time / 30) + 30 # Seasonal demand
        demand = int(np.clip(seasonal_demand + np.random.normal(0,5), 0, 100))

        self.inventory = self.inventory + action - demand
        self.inventory = np.clip(self.inventory, 0, 100)

        self.last_demand = demand # Update last demand
        if self.inventory <= 5:
          reward = -10 # Penalty for low inventory
          done = True
        else:
          reward = 1 # Small reward for each step
          done = False
        return self.get_state(), reward, done

env = SeasonalityEnv()

# Training with DQN will fail because important seasonality information is missing from the state
```
This illustrates the importance of including all relevant context within the state. The agent does not have a representation of time or seasonality, making it unable to learn the optimal policy using only the last demand and inventory level.

**Example 3: Non-Markovian Dynamics due to Hidden Variables**
Consider an environment in which the underlying conditions of the environment are not available to the agent. Assume there is a hidden variable that impacts how effective an action is in a given state.

```python
class HiddenVariableEnv:
    def __init__(self):
      self.hidden_state = np.random.choice([0, 1])  # Hidden state 0 or 1
      self.position = 0

    def reset(self):
       self.hidden_state = np.random.choice([0, 1])
       self.position = 0
       return self.get_state()

    def get_state(self):
      return np.array([self.position])

    def step(self, action):
      if self.hidden_state == 0:
        if action == 1: # Effective action
          self.position += 1
        else:
          self.position -= 0.5
      else:
        if action == 0:
          self.position += 1 # Effective action
        else:
          self.position -= 0.5

      if self.position >= 10:
          reward = 10
          done = True
      else:
          reward = -0.1
          done = False
      return self.get_state(), reward, done

env = HiddenVariableEnv()

# DQN and REINFORCE will fail since there are hidden environment parameters
```

Here, a hidden state changes how actions are applied to the position of the agent. This makes it difficult for DQN and REINFORCE to learn since they assume the environment is Markovian given the state.

To address these challenges, several strategies can be used. For reward sparsity, I have successfully utilized techniques like shaping rewards and using Hindsight Experience Replay. When dealing with inadequate state representations, careful feature engineering, use of recurrent layers to capture temporal dependencies or using some forms of attention mechanisms can help. Lastly, when dealing with non-Markovian properties due to hidden parameters, techniques such as recurrent networks or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) should be considered.

For resources, I recommend focusing on academic publications and textbooks concerning reinforcement learning, especially those focused on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Open-source courses from reputable universities and online learning platforms also offer very comprehensive and hands-on training that can help better understand the topic. Experimenting on benchmark environments like the OpenAI Gym can help one fully understand these algorithms before diving into the complexities of custom environments. I advise practitioners to move step-by-step and learn from any failures before making changes that may complicate the problem further.
