Augmenting datasets with blur and motion blur significantly impacts model performance, primarily by influencing the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. My experience working on autonomous driving perception systems has consistently shown that the impact is non-monotonic and highly dependent on the specific model architecture, dataset characteristics, and the application's tolerance for uncertainty.  While naive application can degrade performance, carefully considered augmentation strategies can lead to substantial improvements.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core impact stems from how blur and motion blur affect the model's feature extraction process.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), commonly used in image-related tasks, rely on localized patterns and gradients to identify features. Blurring introduces noise and smooths these gradients, making feature extraction more challenging.  A model trained solely on sharp images may struggle to generalize to blurry real-world scenarios.  Conversely, introducing carefully controlled blur and motion blur during training forces the model to learn more robust representations, less sensitive to these variations. This improved robustness is especially critical in applications where variations in image quality are expected, such as those involving low-light conditions, varying weather, or fast-moving objects.

Motion blur, specifically, adds a temporal dimension to the augmentation. It simulates the effect of camera motion during exposure, resulting in smeared features along the direction of movement. This is particularly valuable for applications involving video processing or situations where objects are moving quickly relative to the sensor.  A model trained with motion blur augmentation is better equipped to handle real-world scenarios where similar blur is present.

However, over-augmentation can be detrimental. Excessive blurring can lead to the loss of crucial information, hindering the model's ability to learn discriminative features.  This results in decreased accuracy on sharp images, the primary scenario the model might encounter during deployment.  The optimal level of augmentation must be determined empirically through rigorous experimentation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate how blur and motion blur augmentation can be implemented using Python and common image processing libraries.  I have designed these examples to be concise and illustrative, focusing on the core augmentation techniques rather than comprehensive data pipeline implementations.  Assume the necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) are already imported.


**Example 1: Gaussian Blur Augmentation**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def gaussian_blur_augmentation(image, kernel_size=(5,5), sigma=0):
    """Applies Gaussian blur to an image.

    Args:
        image: The input image (NumPy array).
        kernel_size: The size of the Gaussian kernel (tuple).
        sigma: Standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel. If 0, it's computed automatically.

    Returns:
        The blurred image (NumPy array).
    """
    blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, kernel_size, sigma)
    return blurred_image

# Example usage:
image = cv2.imread("image.jpg")
blurred_image = gaussian_blur_augmentation(image)
cv2.imwrite("blurred_image.jpg", blurred_image)
```

This function utilizes OpenCV's `GaussianBlur` function for applying Gaussian blur.  The `kernel_size` parameter controls the extent of blurring, while `sigma` controls the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.  A larger kernel size or sigma results in more significant blurring.  The automatic sigma calculation (sigma=0) provides a default, generally sufficient blurring level.  Careful selection of kernel size and sigma is crucial in controlling the severity of the augmentation.


**Example 2: Motion Blur Augmentation**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def motion_blur_augmentation(image, length=15, angle=45):
    """Applies motion blur to an image.

    Args:
        image: The input image (NumPy array).
        length: The length of the motion kernel.
        angle: The angle of motion in degrees.

    Returns:
        The motion-blurred image (NumPy array).
    """
    M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((length/2,length/2),angle,1)
    motion_kernel = np.zeros((length,length))
    motion_kernel[int(length/2),:] = np.ones(length)
    motion_kernel = cv2.warpAffine(motion_kernel,M,(length,length))
    motion_kernel = motion_kernel/np.sum(motion_kernel)
    blurred_image = cv2.filter2D(image,-1,motion_kernel)
    return blurred_image

# Example usage:
image = cv2.imread("image.jpg")
blurred_image = motion_blur_augmentation(image)
cv2.imwrite("motion_blurred_image.jpg", blurred_image)

```

This function creates a motion blur kernel, a line of ones representing the direction of motion, then applies it using `filter2D`. The `length` parameter determines the kernel's size (and the blur length) and `angle` controls the direction.  This method is more computationally intensive than Gaussian blur.


**Example 3:  Augmentation Pipeline Integration (Conceptual)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... other imports and data loading ...

def augment_image(image):
    # Randomly choose whether to apply blur or motion blur.
    if tf.random.uniform(()) < 0.5:  # 50% chance of applying blur
        image = gaussian_blur_augmentation(image, kernel_size=(3,3), sigma=1)
    else:
        image = motion_blur_augmentation(image, length=10, angle=tf.random.uniform((), minval=0, maxval=360))
    return image

# In the TensorFlow data pipeline:
data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Lambda(augment_image)
])

# Example use within a tf.data.Dataset:
train_dataset = train_dataset.map(lambda image, label: (data_augmentation(image), label))
```

This illustrates how to integrate these augmentation functions into a TensorFlow data pipeline.  The `augment_image` function randomly selects between Gaussian and motion blur.  The `tf.keras.Sequential` model is used for ease of integration with the data pipeline.  This demonstrates a realistic approach to incorporating the augmentations into a training workflow. The randomness ensures variation across training iterations, further bolstering model robustness.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  "Programming Computer Vision with Python" by Jan Erik Solem.  These texts provide a solid foundation in the necessary concepts for understanding and implementing these techniques.  Furthermore, reviewing research papers on data augmentation techniques within the specific domain of application is crucial for optimizing results.  Consulting relevant TensorFlow and OpenCV documentation is also essential for effective implementation.
