My experience with Vertex AI pipelines, particularly when employing custom containers, has revealed that precise configuration and a thorough understanding of the underlying architecture are essential for success. Standard training and serving routines often fall short when dealing with unique dependencies or complex model architectures. The ability to define custom containers affords complete control over the execution environment, but this flexibility introduces a higher degree of complexity.

Building a Vertex AI pipeline utilizing custom containers primarily involves defining container specifications within your pipeline's component definitions. The typical workflow entails building Docker images that encapsulate your training logic and serving endpoint respectively. You then reference these images within your pipeline definition using the `CustomTrainingJob` or `Model.deploy` methods, ensuring that Vertex AI can access and execute them. The pipeline orchestrator handles the data passing, versioning, and execution management, making this approach powerful for creating repeatable and scalable machine learning workflows.

The process is not just about wrapping your existing code in containers, rather, it requires ensuring compatibility with Vertex AI's environment and structure. For example, your training container must be able to fetch data provided by the pipeline, write output models to specific locations, and report relevant metrics through standard mechanisms understood by Vertex AI. Similarly, your serving container needs to expose an HTTP endpoint suitable for model prediction requests, using a format compatible with the deployed model schema and Vertex AI's prediction service.

Let's examine the typical structure using Python and the Vertex AI SDK. First, I will define a custom training component. The training Docker image needs to contain all the necessary dependencies, the training script, and an entrypoint defined to trigger the training. Assume this image is built and pushed to a container registry accessible by Vertex AI, for example, `gcr.io/my-project/my-training-image:v1`.

```python
from kfp import dsl
from google_cloud_pipeline_components import aiplatform as gcc_aip

@dsl.component
def custom_training_component(
    project: str,
    location: str,
    training_image_uri: str,
    model_display_name: str,
    data_path: str,
    output_model_path: str,
    machine_type: str = "n1-standard-4"
):

    training_job = gcc_aip.CustomTrainingJob(
        display_name = "custom-training-job",
        worker_pool_specs = [
            {
                "machine_spec": {
                    "machine_type": machine_type
                },
                "container_spec": {
                     "image_uri": training_image_uri,
                     "command": [],
                     "args": [
                       "--data_path", data_path,
                        "--output_model_path", output_model_path
                    ]
                }
            }
        ],
        model_display_name = model_display_name
    )
    return training_job

```

In this example, `custom_training_component` defines a pipeline step that executes a training job using the custom Docker image. Crucially, the `container_spec` section defines which image to use and the arguments to pass to the container's entrypoint. The `--data_path` and `--output_model_path` are expected arguments for the training script within the Docker image. This approach enables parameterized training jobs directly from the pipeline. Furthermore, the component also returns the training job resource for subsequent steps. Note that error handling and more robust parameter passing strategies might be necessary for practical applications.

Next, consider building the custom serving component. Just like the training step, we need a Docker image for serving. Let's assume that image is hosted at `gcr.io/my-project/my-serving-image:v1`. This image should contain a server, such as Flask, and code for model loading and prediction logic. The serving component will deploy the trained model artifact from the previous training job using the Vertex AI Model deployment endpoint.

```python
from kfp import dsl
from google_cloud_pipeline_components import aiplatform as gcc_aip

@dsl.component
def custom_serving_component(
    project: str,
    location: str,
    serving_image_uri: str,
    model: str,
    endpoint_name: str = "my-endpoint",
    machine_type: str = "n1-standard-2",
    min_replica_count: int = 1
):
    deployed_model = gcc_aip.ModelDeploy(
        model = model,
        endpoint = endpoint_name,
        deployed_model_display_name="my-deployed-model",
        machine_type = machine_type,
        min_replica_count = min_replica_count,
        container_spec={
          "image_uri": serving_image_uri
        }

    )
    return deployed_model
```

Here, `custom_serving_component` takes the output model resource from the training component, as well as the serving container image, and orchestrates model deployment to an endpoint. The `container_spec` specifies the custom image to use for serving predictions. Vertex AI automatically sets the port for incoming requests based on internal conventions. The assumption here is that the serving container is configured to expose a port for receiving prediction requests as defined by the Vertex AI prediction contract. The `machine_type` and `min_replica_count` allow flexibility in scaling and serving requirements.

Finally, let us define a simplified pipeline definition, linking both training and serving components. This pipeline will use some placeholder values and make use of the components defined above.

```python
from kfp import dsl
from google_cloud_pipeline_components import aiplatform as gcc_aip

@dsl.pipeline(
    name="custom-container-pipeline",
    description="Pipeline using custom training and serving containers"
)
def custom_container_pipeline(
        project: str = "my-project",
        location: str = "us-central1",
        training_image_uri: str = "gcr.io/my-project/my-training-image:v1",
        serving_image_uri: str = "gcr.io/my-project/my-serving-image:v1",
        model_display_name: str = "my-model",
        data_path: str = "gs://my-bucket/training_data",
        output_model_path: str = "gs://my-bucket/output_model"
    ):
    training_op = custom_training_component(
        project=project,
        location=location,
        training_image_uri=training_image_uri,
        model_display_name = model_display_name,
        data_path=data_path,
        output_model_path=output_model_path
    )

    serving_op = custom_serving_component(
        project=project,
        location=location,
        serving_image_uri = serving_image_uri,
        model = training_op.outputs["model"],
        endpoint_name = "my-endpoint"
    )

    return
```

This pipeline defines a simple flow, first executing the training using the custom container, and then deploying the trained model using a separate serving container. The `training_op.outputs["model"]` passes the model resource to the serving component ensuring the deployed model is the product of the training step. This encapsulates a basic pipeline structure for a machine learning process.

When implementing such a pipeline, meticulous attention to detail becomes indispensable. For instance, ensure that Docker images are built with necessary dependencies and that the entrypoints of the images work correctly. Additionally, carefully consider resource allocation and security implications. Robust logging and monitoring are essential for debugging failures and ensuring the smooth operation of the pipeline. Data versioning strategies must also be implemented to maintain reproducible results.

For further exploration, I recommend investigating the official documentation for Vertex AI Pipelines and the Google Cloud Pipeline Components. Specific attention to the sections detailing CustomTrainingJob, ModelDeploy and the ContainerSpec within these objects is essential. Examining examples provided by Google's developer programs and community forums can also prove valuable for understanding best practices. Furthermore, studying container orchestration concepts in general provides a deeper grasp of how containers operate within the pipeline.
