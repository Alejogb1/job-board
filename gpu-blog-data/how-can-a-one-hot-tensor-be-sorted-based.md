A common challenge when working with encoded categorical data in machine learning is to reorder a one-hot tensor according to a given sequence of indices. This frequently arises after operations like attention mechanisms or sequence processing where a permutation of the original data is desired. The crucial aspect lies in understanding how to efficiently map the index tensor to the corresponding positions in the one-hot representation.

The core idea is to use the index tensor to create a mapping that can be applied to the one-hot tensor. We avoid explicit iterative operations, which are typically slower and less idiomatic in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. Instead, we leverage the inherent vectorized nature of these tensor libraries. I've personally faced this several times when dealing with dynamic batching of tokenized input and the need to rearrange embeddings after applying an attention mask.

Let's break down the process. Assume we have a one-hot tensor of shape `(B, N, C)`, where `B` represents the batch size, `N` the sequence length, and `C` the number of categories. We also have an index tensor of shape `(B, N)` which specifies how the *N* elements should be reordered for each batch. Each element in the index tensor is an integer between 0 and *N* - 1. To perform the reordering, we will create an intermediate tensor of indices, with three dimensions that correspond to the batch, the reordered sequence, and the category dimension.

Here is the first code example, in PyTorch, demonstrating the reordering process:

```python
import torch

def sort_one_hot(one_hot_tensor, index_tensor):
    """
    Sorts a one-hot tensor based on an index tensor.

    Args:
        one_hot_tensor (torch.Tensor): A one-hot tensor of shape (B, N, C).
        index_tensor (torch.Tensor): An index tensor of shape (B, N).

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The sorted one-hot tensor of shape (B, N, C).
    """
    B, N, C = one_hot_tensor.shape
    batch_indices = torch.arange(B).view(B, 1).repeat(1, N)
    #  This creates batch indices to ensure we pick from correct batches.
    intermediate_indices = torch.stack((batch_indices, index_tensor), dim=-1)
    #  Combines batch indices with the provided indices. Shape is (B, N, 2)

    sorted_one_hot = one_hot_tensor[intermediate_indices[..., 0],
                                    intermediate_indices[..., 1]]
    #  This performs the reordering.

    return sorted_one_hot
```

The function `sort_one_hot` takes the one-hot tensor and index tensor as inputs. It starts by generating batch indices, creating a 2D tensor where each row corresponds to a batch index, allowing us to select the right sequences within the batch. Subsequently, it stacks the batch indices with the provided indices, creating a three-dimensional intermediate index tensor used to gather values.

This method leverages PyTorch's advanced indexing feature, which allows us to select elements from a tensor using multi-dimensional indexing. Effectively, the `intermediate_indices` act as a roadmap to map the original sequence positions to the desired positions given by the `index_tensor`. Note that I've used the `repeat` functionality which, in my experience, can be computationally preferable to `torch.tile` for simpler replication cases.

The second example, using TensorFlow, shows essentially the same logic:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sort_one_hot_tf(one_hot_tensor, index_tensor):
    """
    Sorts a one-hot tensor based on an index tensor (TensorFlow version).

    Args:
        one_hot_tensor (tf.Tensor): A one-hot tensor of shape (B, N, C).
        index_tensor (tf.Tensor): An index tensor of shape (B, N).

    Returns:
        tf.Tensor: The sorted one-hot tensor of shape (B, N, C).
    """
    B, N, C = one_hot_tensor.shape
    batch_indices = tf.reshape(tf.range(B), (B, 1))
    batch_indices = tf.tile(batch_indices, [1, N])
    #  This creates batch indices to ensure we pick from correct batches.

    intermediate_indices = tf.stack([batch_indices, index_tensor], axis=-1)
    #  Combines batch indices with the provided indices. Shape is (B, N, 2)

    sorted_one_hot = tf.gather_nd(one_hot_tensor, intermediate_indices)
    # This performs the reordering.

    return sorted_one_hot
```

The TensorFlow version follows a similar approach, using `tf.range` and `tf.reshape` to create batch indices and `tf.tile` to replicate them across the sequence dimension. It then employs `tf.stack` to combine these batch indices with the original index tensor. Crucially, rather than advanced indexing, we utilize `tf.gather_nd` for reordering. The core logic remains the same: we're constructing indices that map the current one-hot sequence positions to the reordered positions. I have learned that although the syntax differs between frameworks, the underlying mathematical operation of using index mapping is consistent, making it relatively easy to transfer between the two after understanding the basics.

Let's illustrate further with an example, using random tensors:

```python
import torch
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example with PyTorch
B, N, C = 2, 4, 3
one_hot_torch = torch.eye(C).repeat(B,N,1) # creates a sequence of one-hots
index_torch = torch.tensor([[2, 0, 1, 3], [3, 2, 0, 1]])  # Permutation indices for the one-hot tensor

sorted_torch = sort_one_hot(one_hot_torch, index_torch)
print("PyTorch One Hot tensor:", one_hot_torch)
print("PyTorch Indices:", index_torch)
print("PyTorch Sorted One Hot Tensor:", sorted_torch)

# Example with TensorFlow
one_hot_tf = tf.constant(np.eye(C), dtype=tf.float32)
one_hot_tf = tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(one_hot_tf,axis = 0),[B,N,1]) # creates a sequence of one-hots
index_tf = tf.constant([[2, 0, 1, 3], [3, 2, 0, 1]],dtype = tf.int32) # Permutation indices for the one-hot tensor

sorted_tf = sort_one_hot_tf(one_hot_tf, index_tf)

print("Tensorflow One Hot tensor:", one_hot_tf)
print("Tensorflow Indices:", index_tf)
print("Tensorflow Sorted One Hot Tensor:", sorted_tf)


```

This script sets up a simple example, using a one-hot tensor in which all the categorical values are one-hot encoded. The indices tensor specifies, for each sequence of the batch, the order in which the values must be reordered. The output shows the initial one-hot tensors, the indices used for reordering, and the resulting sorted one-hot tensors, demonstrating that the ordering is applied per-batch. The third code example provides a concrete illustration of the functions in action, demonstrating that the re-ordering mechanism works as expected. Iâ€™ve found this approach to be consistently reliable, regardless of batch size or sequence length, within practical limits.

Regarding learning resources, I highly recommend exploring the official documentation of both PyTorch and TensorFlow. Pay close attention to their sections on indexing and gathering operations, as well as broadcasting rules for operations involving tensors with different shapes. Additionally, a solid grounding in linear algebra concepts related to tensor manipulations and matrix indexing can be quite useful. Also, examine tutorials related to sequence models and attention mechanisms; they often include examples and explanations on how reordering is performed. Finally, studying code examples of model architectures can help deepen understanding of how this reordering occurs in practice. Specifically, the Transformer model family contains many examples where sequence reordering operations are heavily utilized.
