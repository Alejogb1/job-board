The core challenge when extracting prediction labels from a Keras Siamese network lies in its architecture: it doesn't directly output class labels in the typical classification sense, but rather a similarity score between two input samples.  My experience implementing Siamese networks for image verification systems, specifically for handwritten signature authentication, highlighted this nuance. We weren't classifying images into predefined classes; instead, we evaluated if two signatures belonged to the same individual, based on a distance metric derived from the network's learned embeddings. Therefore, extracting labels requires careful interpretation of these similarity scores and, depending on the application, defining a suitable threshold.

Let's clarify how a Siamese network functions. It takes a pair of input samples, runs each through identical sub-networks—often convolutional neural networks—and generates an embedding vector representing the high-level features of each input. Subsequently, a distance function, such as the Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, calculates a measure of the proximity between these embeddings.  The network is trained to minimize the distance for similar pairs and maximize it for dissimilar ones, without explicitly learning discrete class labels. The output is, therefore, a similarity score – not a label.

To convert this score into a classification, you'll generally need a threshold. If the similarity score exceeds the threshold, you can interpret that as the input pair belonging to the same class; otherwise, they belong to distinct classes. The optimal threshold value is typically determined experimentally, often using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and selecting a point that balances true positives and false positives.

The approach to label extraction depends heavily on your use case. Here are common scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Pairwise Verification**

In situations where the aim is to confirm if two inputs belong to the same class (like the signature authentication example), you calculate the similarity score for every input pair and then use the threshold as described earlier. Below is code illustrating this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume 'siamese_model' is a pre-trained Keras Siamese model
# Assume 'input_pair' is a tuple or list containing two input tensors.


def predict_pairwise_similarity(model, input_pair):
    """Calculates the similarity score between two input samples."""

    embedding_a = model(tf.expand_dims(input_pair[0], axis=0)) # Add batch dimension
    embedding_b = model(tf.expand_dims(input_pair[1], axis=0))  # Add batch dimension
    distance = tf.norm(embedding_a - embedding_b, ord='euclidean')
    return 1 - distance / tf.norm(embedding_a + embedding_b) #Normalized cosine like calculation

def classify_pairwise(model, input_pair, threshold):
     """Classifies a pair as belonging to the same or different class using the threshold."""
     similarity = predict_pairwise_similarity(model, input_pair)
     if similarity > threshold:
          return "Same Class"
     else:
         return "Different Class"

# Sample Usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Generate dummy input data for demonstration
  input_a = tf.random.normal(shape=(224, 224, 3))
  input_b = tf.random.normal(shape=(224, 224, 3))
  input_pair_sample = (input_a, input_b)

  # Placeholder model for example purposes
  class DummyModel(tf.keras.Model):
      def __init__(self):
           super(DummyModel, self).__init__()
           self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation="relu")
           self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
           self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128)
      def call(self, x):
           x = self.conv(x)
           x = self.flatten(x)
           return self.dense(x)

  siamese_model = DummyModel()
  threshold = 0.7  # Example threshold, needs tuning

  classification_result = classify_pairwise(siamese_model, input_pair_sample, threshold)
  print(f"Classification Result: {classification_result}")

```
In this example, the `predict_pairwise_similarity` function calculates a similarity score between two input samples. The distance is converted into a normalized cosine-like score (between 0 and 1), where higher values indicate greater similarity.  The function `classify_pairwise` then applies a user-defined threshold to this similarity score to determine whether the two inputs are deemed to belong to the same or different classes. The threshold will need to be tuned based on the performance requirements of the specific task.

**Scenario 2: One-Shot Classification**

One-shot classification involves comparing a new sample against a known dataset of samples and finding the most similar one, effectively classifying it as belonging to the same class as the nearest match. This typically involves calculating similarity scores between the new sample and every sample in the training dataset, and selecting the sample with the highest similarity.

```python
def classify_one_shot(model, new_sample, training_samples):
     """Classifies a new sample based on similarity to a dataset."""
     best_similarity = -1.0
     best_match_index = -1

     new_embedding = model(tf.expand_dims(new_sample, axis=0))

     for idx, training_sample in enumerate(training_samples):
         training_embedding = model(tf.expand_dims(training_sample, axis=0))
         distance = tf.norm(new_embedding - training_embedding, ord='euclidean')
         similarity = 1 - distance / tf.norm(new_embedding + training_embedding) #Normalized cosine like calculation
         if similarity > best_similarity:
             best_similarity = similarity
             best_match_index = idx
     return best_match_index # Index of the training sample with highest similarity

# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate some dummy data, new sample and training samples
    new_sample = tf.random.normal(shape=(224, 224, 3))
    training_samples = [tf.random.normal(shape=(224, 224, 3)) for _ in range(5)]
    training_labels = ["class_a", "class_b", "class_c", "class_d", "class_e"]

    # Placeholder model for demonstration
    class DummyModel(tf.keras.Model):
        def __init__(self):
            super(DummyModel, self).__init__()
            self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation="relu")
            self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
            self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128)
        def call(self, x):
             x = self.conv(x)
             x = self.flatten(x)
             return self.dense(x)

    siamese_model = DummyModel()

    predicted_label_index = classify_one_shot(siamese_model, new_sample, training_samples)
    print(f"Predicted label: {training_labels[predicted_label_index]}")
```

In this snippet, the `classify_one_shot` function compares a new sample's embedding against each training sample's embedding, identifies the training sample with the highest similarity score, and assigns the new sample to the corresponding class.

**Scenario 3: Clustering**

If you require cluster-like assignments of unlabeled data based on embedding similarities, techniques like k-means clustering can be applied to the embeddings directly after they have been generated by the Siamese sub-network on new inputs.
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

def cluster_embeddings(model, input_data, n_clusters):
     """Clusters embeddings using K-Means"""
     embeddings = []
     for input_sample in input_data:
        embedding = model(tf.expand_dims(input_sample, axis=0))
        embeddings.append(embedding.numpy().flatten())
     embeddings = np.array(embeddings)
     kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=0, n_init = 10)
     kmeans.fit(embeddings)
     return kmeans.labels_

# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate dummy input samples
    input_samples = [tf.random.normal(shape=(224, 224, 3)) for _ in range(10)]

    # Placeholder model for demonstration
    class DummyModel(tf.keras.Model):
        def __init__(self):
             super(DummyModel, self).__init__()
             self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation="relu")
             self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
             self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128)
        def call(self, x):
             x = self.conv(x)
             x = self.flatten(x)
             return self.dense(x)
    siamese_model = DummyModel()

    n_clusters = 3
    cluster_labels = cluster_embeddings(siamese_model, input_samples, n_clusters)
    print(f"Cluster Labels: {cluster_labels}")
```
This code generates embeddings for a batch of data and then uses KMeans to assign cluster labels based on the learned representations. This can be useful for finding underlying structure in unlabeled data.

These three scenarios show the flexibility of Siamese networks. However, it is crucial to remember that a carefully selected threshold is critical for pairwise and one-shot classification. The performance greatly depends on the training process and the careful tuning of this threshold. Similarly, the choice of the appropriate clustering algorithm and number of clusters is important for the third use case.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Siamese networks, I suggest exploring resources on deep learning architectures specifically focused on metric learning. Also, materials discussing techniques for optimizing distance-based objectives and selecting appropriate similarity functions would be beneficial. Additionally, look for books or tutorials that discuss the challenges of non-traditional classification and unsupervised learning tasks. Finally, a resource outlining evaluation metrics for such systems, such as area under the curve metrics for threshold optimization would be helpful.
