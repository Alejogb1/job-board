Setting `layers.trainable = True` in Keras during transfer learning doesn't always immediately unlock training for all layers as intended.  The crucial oversight often lies in the interaction between the model's compilation and the layer's trainability attribute.  My experience troubleshooting this in large-scale image recognition projects consistently highlighted the necessity of recompiling the model *after* modifying layer trainability.  Failing to do so leaves the underlying TensorFlow/Theano graph unchanged, rendering the `trainable` flag effectively inert.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, at its core, builds a computational graph representing the model's architecture and operations.  When you compile a model using `model.compile()`, this graph is finalized.  This graph dictates which weights are updated during training based on the optimizer and loss function specified.  Setting `layers.trainable = True` modifies a model's attribute, but it does *not* automatically alter the compiled graph.  The compiler needs to re-evaluate the entire model structure to incorporate the changed trainability status, which is why recompilation is essential.  Think of it like changing the blueprint of a building mid-construction; you need to re-evaluate and adjust the construction plan to reflect the changes before the building can be altered accordingly.

Several factors can further complicate the issue:

* **Pre-trained Weights:**  Pre-trained weights are typically loaded in a frozen state.  Setting `layers.trainable = True` on these layers only unlocks their *potential* for training.  The optimizer will only update weights marked as trainable *and* included in the compiled graph.

* **Layer Hierarchy:**  In deep models, trainability might not propagate correctly down the hierarchy if layers are nested within other non-trainable containers (e.g., custom layers or functional model structures).  Ensure that trainability is set recursively to affect all nested layers.

* **Optimizer Choice:** While less frequent, an improperly configured optimizer can sometimes interfere with weight updates, even for trainable layers.  Verify your optimizer settings and ensure they are appropriate for your task and learning rate.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
model = keras.Sequential([base_model, keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(), keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])

# INCORRECT: Setting trainable but not recompiling
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = True

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This code incorrectly attempts to fine-tune the VGG16 base model. While `layer.trainable = True` is set for all layers within `base_model`, the model's compilation happens *before* the trainability changes are reflected in the computational graph, leading to no effect on pre-trained weights.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
model = keras.Sequential([base_model, keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(), keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])

# CORRECT: Setting trainable and recompiling
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = True

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example is identical to the previous one except for a crucial addition: the model is compiled *after* setting the trainability flags. This ensures that the updated trainability attributes are incorporated into the TensorFlow graph, enabling weight updates during training.

**Example 3: Handling Nested Layers**

```python
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Fine-tuning a sub-model within a larger model
sub_model = keras.models.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.layers[2].output)

for layer in sub_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = True

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) #Important: Compile the original model not the submodel!

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This illustrates a more complex scenario where we want to fine-tune only a portion of a model.  This example focuses on setting `trainable` flags within a sub-model which is created for the purpose of selectively activating fine tuning only for specific layers.  It's crucial here to compile the *original* model (`model`), not the sub-model (`sub_model`). The original model's compilation ensures that the modified trainability within the sub-model is correctly reflected in the overall model's graph.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the official Keras documentation on model customization and the TensorFlow documentation on model building.  Exploring detailed examples of transfer learning with various pre-trained models provided in Keras applications will further solidify understanding.  A thorough grasp of TensorFlow's computational graph and how Keras interacts with it is essential for mastering this aspect of deep learning.  Furthermore,  carefully studying examples demonstrating how different aspects of transfer learning are applied, particularly those related to freezing and unfreezing specific layers, would be extremely beneficial.  Consulting textbooks on deep learning, focusing on sections dealing with model architecture and training, can provide valuable theoretical background.
