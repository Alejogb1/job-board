The core challenge in zeroing out PyTorch tensor elements after a given index along a specified axis lies in effectively leveraging PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities to selectively modify tensor values.  My experience working on large-scale neural network training pipelines has highlighted the frequent need for this type of operation, particularly during masked attention mechanisms and selective backpropagation.  Directly modifying tensors in-place is often the most efficient approach, avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.  This response details the procedure, highlighting different strategies based on the desired level of generality.

**1.  Explanation of the Methodology**

The solution hinges on creating a boolean mask that identifies elements to be zeroed. This mask is then used for indexing the tensor, allowing for in-place modification using the assignment operator. The axis specification dictates how the indexing is performed.  For a given axis `axis` and index `index`, we generate a boolean mask where `True` indicates elements to be zeroed.  This mask has the same shape as the input tensor, but its `True` values are positioned to correspond to the target elements.  Specifically, for each slice along the specified axis, elements after the `index` are marked `True`.  Finally, this mask is utilized for zeroing the selected elements of the original tensor.

This approach offers several advantages: it is computationally efficient (avoiding unnecessary copies), it's highly flexible in terms of axis selection, and it directly addresses the problem statement.  Alternatively, one might use slicing, but this approach becomes cumbersome when dealing with multi-dimensional tensors and variable-length sequences along the specified axis.  Furthermore, sophisticated techniques such as advanced masking offered by libraries like NumPy are not directly applicable due to PyTorch's specific tensor handling.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Zeroing out elements along axis 0**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(4, 6)
index = 2
axis = 0

mask = torch.arange(tensor.shape[axis]) >= index
mask = mask.unsqueeze(1).expand(tensor.shape[axis], tensor.shape[1])  # Broadcast to match tensor dimensions

tensor[mask] = 0
print(tensor)
```

This example demonstrates zeroing out elements after index `2` along axis `0`. We first create a boolean mask using `torch.arange`. `unsqueeze` adds a dimension for broadcasting, ensuring that the mask correctly aligns with the tensor's shape.  `expand` expands the mask to the correct dimensionality.  Finally, we use boolean indexing to modify the tensor in-place.

**Example 2: Zeroing out elements along axis 1 with varying indices**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(4, 6)
indices = torch.tensor([1, 3, 2, 4])
axis = 1

for i in range(tensor.shape[0]):
    mask = torch.arange(tensor.shape[axis]) >= indices[i]
    tensor[i, mask] = 0

print(tensor)
```

This example generalizes the process to handle varying indices across rows (axis 1).  A loop iterates through each row, creating a row-specific mask based on `indices`. This enhances flexibility, allowing zeroing out elements after different indices along the axis. Note that, for efficiency in larger tensors, vectorization techniques might be preferable.  This example prioritizes clarity over maximal optimization for smaller datasets.


**Example 3:  Handling higher-dimensional tensors**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(72).reshape(3, 4, 6)
index = 2
axis = 1

mask = torch.arange(tensor.shape[axis]) >= index
mask = mask.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).expand(*tensor.shape[:axis], tensor.shape[axis], *tensor.shape[axis+1:])

tensor[mask] = 0
print(tensor)
```

This example tackles a 3D tensor, illustrating the adaptability of the method. The creation of the mask is more complex due to the need for multiple unsqueeze operations to ensure correct broadcasting along all dimensions.  Careful handling of broadcasting dimensions is crucial when dealing with tensors of higher order. This approach directly addresses the potential complexities inherent in higher-dimensional tensor manipulation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official PyTorch documentation is invaluable, specifically sections on tensor manipulation and advanced indexing.  Thorough understanding of NumPy's broadcasting mechanism is also helpful, though direct translation is not always straightforward due to differences in PyTorch's tensor handling.  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook can provide the necessary foundation in vector and matrix operations relevant to tensor manipulation.  Furthermore, exploring examples in research papers utilizing similar tensor operations can offer further insights into effective implementation strategies.
