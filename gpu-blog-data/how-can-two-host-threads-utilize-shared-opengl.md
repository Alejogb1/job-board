Directly addressing the challenge of sharing OpenGL display lists (textures) between two host threads utilizing separate contexts while employing `cudaGLSetGLDevice` necessitates a nuanced understanding of CUDA's interaction with OpenGL and the limitations inherent in multi-threaded rendering.  My experience developing high-performance visualization applications for geophysical modeling has highlighted the critical need for careful synchronization and resource management in such scenarios.  Improper handling can lead to race conditions, context corruption, and ultimately application instability.

The fundamental constraint lies in OpenGL's inherent single-threaded nature per context. While multiple contexts can exist concurrently, each operates independently and demands exclusive access to its associated resources.  `cudaGLSetGLDevice`, while providing the crucial bridge between CUDA and OpenGL, cannot directly circumvent this limitation.  Attempting to simultaneously access and modify a shared texture from two contexts will inevitably result in undefined behavior.  Therefore, a robust solution necessitates a carefully designed synchronization mechanism coupled with appropriate resource management strategies.

**1.  Explanation of the Solution**

The optimal approach involves employing a shared, dedicated CUDA memory buffer as an intermediary.  The rendering threads, each bound to its respective OpenGL context, will perform texture updates to this shared CUDA memory.  A third, dedicated thread (or a section of the main thread) will then act as a synchronization point and transfer the data from the CUDA buffer to the OpenGL textures using `cudaGLMapGLbufferObject` and `cudaGLUnmapGLbufferObject`.  This eliminates direct concurrent access to the OpenGL textures from multiple threads.

This method requires careful consideration of the following points:

* **Synchronization:** The synchronization mechanisms between the rendering threads and the data transfer thread are paramount.  Mutual exclusion primitives such as mutexes or semaphores should be used to prevent race conditions during data updates and transfers.  Conditions variables can be used to signal completion of rendering operations before the transfer process begins.

* **Memory Management:**  Efficient memory allocation and deallocation are crucial.  The CUDA memory buffer should be sufficiently large to hold the texture data.  Careful management is also needed to ensure OpenGL resources are properly released when no longer required.

* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is essential throughout the process.  Checks should be in place to verify the success of CUDA and OpenGL function calls, including `cudaGLSetGLDevice`.


**2. Code Examples**

The following examples illustrate the core aspects of the solution.  Note that these are simplified illustrations and would require expansion for a complete production-ready application.  They assume a basic familiarity with CUDA and OpenGL programming.

**Example 1: Texture Data Update (Thread 1)**

```c++
__global__ void updateTextureData(unsigned char* textureData, const float* newData, size_t size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    // Perform calculations on newData and update textureData
    textureData[i] = (unsigned char)newData[i];
  }
}


// ... in host code ...
// Assuming 'textureData' is a CUDA memory pointer to the shared texture buffer

float* h_newData; // Host side new texture data
cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_newData, size*sizeof(float));
// ...populate h_newData...

unsigned char* d_textureData; // Device side pointer
cudaMalloc((void**)&d_textureData, size*sizeof(unsigned char));

cudaMemcpy(d_textureData, h_newData, size*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


int threadsPerBlock = 256;
int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
updateTextureData<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_textureData, h_newData, size);

cudaFreeHost(h_newData);
// ... Synchronization mechanism (mutex, condition variable) ...
```

**Example 2: Texture Data Update (Thread 2)**

This example mirrors Example 1, operating on the same shared CUDA memory but within a separate context and thread. The key difference lies in independent processing of potentially different sections or updates to the texture within `updateTextureData`. The synchronization mechanism (not shown) is vital here to prevent data corruption.


**Example 3: Data Transfer and Rendering**

```c++
// ... in the data transfer thread ...

// Assuming 'glTextureID' is the OpenGL texture ID and 'cudaBuffer' is a registered CUDA GL interop buffer

GLuint glTextureID;
unsigned char *mappedPtr;

cudaGLMapGLbufferObject((void**)&mappedPtr, cudaBuffer);

// Copy the updated data from the CUDA buffer to the OpenGL texture
cudaMemcpy(mappedPtr, d_textureData, size*sizeof(unsigned char), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost); //OR cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice if 'd_textureData' is also in CUDA graphics memory.

cudaGLUnmapGLbufferObject(cudaBuffer);

glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, glTextureID); // Bind the OpenGL texture
// ... render with the updated texture ...
```

These examples highlight the separation of concerns: dedicated CUDA kernels for data manipulation and a separate thread for managing the synchronized transfer of data between CUDA and OpenGL.  The use of `cudaGLMapGLbufferObject` and `cudaGLUnmapGLbufferObject` ensures that the data is properly transferred to and from the OpenGL texture.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I strongly recommend thoroughly studying the CUDA and OpenGL programming guides provided by NVIDIA.  Further, exploring advanced synchronization techniques within the CUDA programming model (e.g., atomic operations, streams) could improve performance.  Finally, consult documentation on OpenGL context management and resource sharing for multi-threaded applications.  These resources provide the necessary foundational knowledge and detailed information for addressing the complexities of shared resource management in this context.  Consulting specific documentation on `cudaGLSetGLDevice` and CUDA's interoperability with OpenGL is also crucial.  Focusing on error checking and robust memory management will lead to a more stable and reliable application.
