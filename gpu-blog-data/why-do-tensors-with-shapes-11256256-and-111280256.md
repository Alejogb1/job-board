The incompatibility stems from a fundamental aspect of tensor broadcasting in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch: the broadcasting rules prioritize aligning dimensions from the trailing end.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image processing pipelines has highlighted this consistently.  When attempting to assign a tensor of shape [1,1,1280,256] to a tensor of shape [1,1,256,256], the frameworks encounter a mismatch in the third dimension.  The broadcasting mechanism, designed to facilitate operations between tensors of differing shapes under specific conditions, fails because it cannot implicitly expand or contract the mismatched dimension (1280 vs 256) to achieve compatibility.

Let's clarify the mechanics. Broadcasting operates by conceptually replicating dimensions of size one to match the shape of the other tensor. For example, adding a tensor of shape [256] to a tensor of shape [1, 256] is possible because the framework implicitly expands the first tensor's shape to [1, 256].  However, this mechanism cannot handle mismatches in dimensions larger than one without explicit reshaping or manipulation.

Attempting an assignment without prior manipulation directly violates this constraint.  The framework will raise an error, typically indicating a shape mismatch or broadcasting failure. The error message will vary depending on the specific framework used; PyTorch might return a `RuntimeError` indicating a size mismatch, while TensorFlow might raise an `InvalidArgumentError`.

The solution requires preprocessing the tensors to ensure shape compatibility before the assignment. The most appropriate approach depends on the intended operation and the semantic meaning of the tensors. Three primary methods exist:

1. **Reshaping and Slicing:** If the 1280 values in the larger tensor represent multiple channels or feature maps that can be collapsed or selected, this method is applicable. We can reshape the tensor into a compatible shape and then select a subset of the data, before assigning it to the target tensor.  This approach is useful when the assignment aims to replace a subset of the features, rather than replace the entire tensor.

2. **Tensor concatenation:** If the intended operation involves appending features, the appropriate approach is to concatenate the tensors along the channel dimension (the third dimension in this case). This creates a new, larger tensor encompassing all features, before a possible subsequent assignment to a differently shaped target. This is advantageous when we require preserving all the initial information within the larger tensor.

3. **Resampling (Interpolation):**  If the data represents a continuous signal, resizing the larger tensor to the target shape using interpolation techniques (like bilinear or bicubic interpolation) is often necessary. This method is suitable when the data loss due to downsampling is acceptable or the information within the larger tensor is redundant.


Here are three code examples illustrating these solutions using PyTorch.  Adaptations to TensorFlow are straightforward, involving analogous functions.


**Example 1: Reshaping and Slicing**

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.randn(1, 1, 256, 256)  # Target tensor
tensor2 = torch.randn(1, 1, 1280, 256) # Source tensor

# Reshape tensor2 to match tensor1 along the relevant dimension
# Assume only the first 256 channels of tensor2 are relevant.

reshaped_tensor2 = tensor2[:, :, :256, :]

# Assign the reshaped portion
tensor1[:, :, :, :] = reshaped_tensor2

print(tensor1.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([1, 1, 256, 256])
```

This code first reshapes `tensor2` by slicing along the third dimension. This selectively uses the first 256 channels, creating a tensor with shape [1, 1, 256, 256].  The subsequent assignment then proceeds without errors because the shapes perfectly align. This example presumes that only a subset of the information from `tensor2` is necessary for the assignment.

**Example 2: Tensor Concatenation**

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.randn(1, 1, 256, 256)
tensor2 = torch.randn(1, 1, 1280, 256)

# Concatenate along the channel dimension (dimension 2)
concatenated_tensor = torch.cat((tensor1, tensor2), dim=2)

print(concatenated_tensor.shape) #Output: torch.Size([1, 1, 1536, 256])

#Further processing might involve assigning parts of this concatenated tensor. This would require considering appropriate dimensions.
```

In contrast to the previous example, this code demonstrates concatenation along the channel dimension. The result is a tensor with a significantly larger third dimension, reflecting the combination of features from both input tensors.  Note that direct assignment of `concatenated_tensor` to `tensor1` would still fail due to size mismatch.  Further steps would be necessary, perhaps involving selecting a section of `concatenated_tensor` before assigning it to `tensor1` or another, differently-shaped target.

**Example 3: Resampling using Interpolation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

tensor1 = torch.randn(1, 1, 256, 256)
tensor2 = torch.randn(1, 1, 1280, 256)

# Upsample tensor1 to match tensor2's dimensions (if appropriate)
upsampled_tensor1 = F.interpolate(tensor1, size=(1280, 256), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)

# Or downsample tensor2 to match tensor1's dimensions
downsampled_tensor2 = F.interpolate(tensor2, size=(256, 256), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)

# Assign the resampled tensor.  Choose either upsampled_tensor1 or downsampled_tensor2 based on requirements.

tensor1[:,:,:,:] = downsampled_tensor2

print(tensor1.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 1, 256, 256])
```

This example uses PyTorch's `interpolate` function from `torch.nn.functional` to perform bilinear interpolation for resampling.  The choice between upsampling and downsampling depends on the specific context. Upsampling increases resolution, potentially introducing artifacts. Downsampling reduces resolution, leading to information loss. The selection hinges on the application and the trade-off between resolution and data fidelity.  Align_corners=False is a crucial parameter for correct interpolation in many scenarios.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) regarding tensor manipulation and broadcasting rules.  Thoroughly reviewing the sections on tensor reshaping, slicing, concatenation, and interpolation will provide the necessary background for resolving such shape mismatches effectively.  Also, consider exploring resources dedicated to linear algebra and numerical computing for a deeper understanding of tensor operations and their underlying mathematics.  Finally, a comprehensive guide on image processing techniques would be beneficial for scenarios involving image data.  Understanding image processing would give context to selecting the appropriate resampling methods.
