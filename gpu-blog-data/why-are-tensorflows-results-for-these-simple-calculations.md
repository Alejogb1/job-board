TensorFlow, while powerful for complex machine learning, can exhibit seemingly inaccurate results for basic arithmetic operations due to its reliance on floating-point representation and the inherent precision limitations it entails. This discrepancy arises not from bugs in TensorFlow itself, but from a confluence of factors including finite-precision arithmetic, numerical instability, and optimization strategies designed for higher-level computation, not basic algebra. I've encountered this behavior repeatedly when initially prototyping models, particularly when attempting to verify calculations by hand.

The core issue stems from how computers represent real numbers. They utilize floating-point representations, like IEEE 754 single (32-bit) or double (64-bit) precision formats, to approximate real numbers using a finite number of bits. These formats consist of a sign bit, a significand (mantissa), and an exponent. This inherent limitation means that many real numbers, especially irrational ones, cannot be represented exactly. Operations on these approximate values accumulate rounding errors, which, while small individually, can become significant when compounded through multiple calculations, particularly when subtracting nearly equal numbers.

TensorFlow, like other numerical computation libraries, prioritizes computational efficiency and scalability. This often leads to internal optimizations that may not prioritize maximum accuracy for simple arithmetic. For instance, TensorFlow may employ techniques such as auto-vectorization and data-parallel processing, which can lead to slight variations in the order of operations that, in turn, can influence the accumulation of rounding errors. Furthermore, it frequently utilizes optimized kernels for its operations. These kernels, while generally faster, may make compromises in precision to achieve the performance gains. Finally, the default data type for tensors in TensorFlow is often `float32` which possesses less precision than `float64`. While this is sufficient for many machine-learning tasks, it does exacerbate the issue of accumulating error in seemingly simple calculations.

The following code examples illustrate how these inaccuracies manifest:

**Example 1: Catastrophic Cancellation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(1.0000001, dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)

c = a - b

with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(f"TensorFlow Result: {result}")

  actual_result = 1.0000001 - 1.0
  print(f"Actual Result:   {actual_result}")

```

In this example, we are subtracting two nearly equal numbers. The expected result is 0.0000001. Due to the limitations of floating point precision, particularly with the default `float32` datatype, the result produced by TensorFlow is likely to be an approximation that deviates somewhat from the ideal answer. This phenomenon, known as catastrophic cancellation, arises when two nearly equal numbers are subtracted, resulting in a loss of significant digits and introducing comparatively large errors. This is exacerbated by using `float32` where the precision is less compared to `float64`. While the error may seem minimal in isolation, such errors compound in more complex operations and may lead to problematic results.

**Example 2: Accumulation of Rounding Errors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(0.1, dtype=tf.float32)
sum_value = tf.constant(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)

num_iterations = 100

for _ in range(num_iterations):
    sum_value = sum_value + a

with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(sum_value)
  print(f"TensorFlow Result: {result}")
  actual_result = 0.1 * num_iterations
  print(f"Actual Result:   {actual_result}")

```
Here, we are adding 0.1 a hundred times using a TensorFlow constant and operation and then comparing with the actual value. The expected result should be 10.0 but the TensorFlow result deviates significantly due to the limitations in the finite representation of 0.1 in `float32`. The error is not caused by the addition process itself but by the inexact representation of 0.1. Every addition introduces a slight error and after many iterations, the cumulative error is very noticeable. This issue becomes critical for algorithms with large number of iterations or calculations as small errors can amplify and lead to significant inaccurate outputs.

**Example 3: Utilizing higher precision (`float64`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(1.0000001, dtype=tf.float64)
b = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)

c = a - b

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(f"TensorFlow Result: {result}")
    actual_result = 1.0000001 - 1.0
    print(f"Actual Result:   {actual_result}")

```

This example is similar to the first one except we explicitly cast the variables to type `float64`. As can be seen in the result, the answer from TensorFlow is closer to the actual result which demonstrates that switching to `float64` precision results in smaller errors. This is because the 64-bit format is able to represent numbers with far greater accuracy, reducing the extent of accumulated error. While `float64` can alleviate some of these issues, it comes at a computational cost and it is important to choose it judiciously depending on the application needs.

In practice, these limitations require developers to be aware of potential accuracy issues when performing even simple calculations with TensorFlow. It is rarely the case that the discrepancies are actually bugs in the library itself. The focus of TensorFlow is on efficient computation for complex models and not highly accurate arithmetic operations. Understanding that these errors are a consequence of floating-point representations and how they are handled in the library is critical to preventing erroneous results in more complex models that depend on these basic operations. One should also be conscious of choices made with regards to the precision of data types within the library as the errors introduced can easily be exacerbated by the use of lower precision floats like `float32` when `float64` is needed.

To mitigate these issues, I typically recommend the following strategies and resources: Firstly, be diligent in testing basic operations, especially subtractions of close values, when debugging a problem. Secondly, utilize higher-precision datatypes like `float64` when precision is critical, while bearing in mind the tradeoffs in performance and memory consumption. Finally, when implementing complex numerical calculations, refer to resources on numerical analysis and stability, such as those found in introductory textbooks on numerical methods and computation. Books on scientific computing are also useful, and often cover common floating point arithmetic issues.
