The core issue underlying a neural network's error decreasing on the training set while remaining stagnant or even increasing on the test set is overfitting.  This phenomenon, frequently encountered during my years developing deep learning models for financial market prediction, arises from the network's excessive sensitivity to the training data's specific noise and idiosyncrasies.  The model learns the training data too well, effectively memorizing it instead of generalizing the underlying patterns. This results in excellent performance on the data it has seen, but poor generalization to unseen data.

This problem is not solely a function of network complexity.  While deep, highly parameterized networks are more prone to overfitting, even relatively simple architectures can exhibit this behavior given insufficient regularization or inappropriate training parameters. The key lies in finding the balance between model complexity and its capacity to learn generalizable features.

Let's delineate the reasons behind this discrepancy and discuss mitigation strategies.  Overfitting manifests in several ways:

1. **High Model Capacity:** A network with too many parameters (weights and biases) relative to the size of the training dataset possesses excessive capacity to model the training data, including the noise.  This leads to a complex decision boundary that fits the training data tightly but fails to capture the true underlying data distribution.

2. **Insufficient Regularization:** Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization (weight decay), constrain the magnitude of the network's weights, preventing them from becoming too large. Large weights often indicate overfitting, as they amplify the influence of specific training examples.  The absence of sufficient regularization allows the network to exploit the training set's peculiarities.

3. **Inappropriate Optimization:** The choice of optimizer and its hyperparameters significantly impact the training process.  An aggressive optimizer might lead to rapid convergence on the training set but fail to find a globally optimal solution, resulting in overfitting.  Insufficient learning rate scheduling also contributes; a constant high learning rate can cause the network to overshoot the optimal parameter space.

4. **Data Issues:**  The presence of outliers, noisy data, or an insufficiently representative training set can exacerbate overfitting.  A biased training set will lead to a model that performs well only on similarly biased data.


Now, let's examine three code examples demonstrating these concepts, focusing on a simple regression task using a feedforward neural network in Python with TensorFlow/Keras.  Each example progressively addresses the overfitting issue.

**Example 1:  Overfitting Scenario**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data with noise
X_train = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y_train = 2*X_train + 1 + np.random.normal(0, 2, 100) # adding significant noise
X_test = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)
y_test = 2*X_test + 1

# Build a deeply over-parameterized model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

train_loss = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Train Loss: {train_loss}, Test Loss: {test_loss}")
```

This example uses a deep network with many neurons, highly likely to overfit the noisy training data.  The test loss will be significantly higher than the training loss.

**Example 2:  Introducing L2 Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Data generation (same as Example 1)

# Build model with L2 regularization
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01), input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

train_loss = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Train Loss: {train_loss}, Test Loss: {test_loss}")
```

Here, L2 regularization (`kernel_regularizer`) is added to constrain the weights, reducing the model's capacity to overfit.  The gap between training and test loss will likely be smaller.

**Example 3:  Early Stopping and Data Augmentation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Data generation (same as Example 1)  - Consider data augmentation here, e.g., adding more noisy examples

# Build a moderately sized model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Early stopping callback
early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, restore_best_weights=True)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stopping], verbose=0)

train_loss = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Train Loss: {train_loss}, Test Loss: {test_loss}")
```

This example incorporates early stopping, preventing further training once the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing.  A validation set is used to monitor generalization performance.  Furthermore,  consider the addition of data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and thus improve model robustness.

These examples illustrate key strategies to combat overfitting.  However, the optimal approach often necessitates experimentation and careful consideration of the specific dataset and problem.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting texts on deep learning and machine learning, focusing on chapters dedicated to regularization techniques, optimization algorithms, and model selection.  Exploring research papers on overfitting and its mitigation in neural networks will also provide valuable insights.  A thorough understanding of statistical learning theory is also beneficial.  Furthermore, consider reviewing documentation on the specific deep learning frameworks you intend to use, as they provide detailed explanations and examples for implementing various regularization methods and optimization strategies.
