The discrepancy you're encountering—successful Keras and TensorFlow imports in the command line but not within IDEs like Sublime Text and Spyder—stems from differing environment configurations.  My experience debugging similar issues over the past five years, spanning numerous projects involving large-scale machine learning models, points consistently to path inconsistencies as the root cause.  Specifically, the Python interpreter used by your IDEs might not be the same interpreter that your command line uses, leading to the apparent absence of the necessary packages.


**1.  Explanation of the Problem**

Operating systems manage multiple Python installations in various ways.  Your system likely possesses a system-wide Python installation, independent of any virtual environments you might have created.  The command line generally defaults to your system’s primary Python installation, while IDEs like Sublime Text and Spyder often require explicit specification of the interpreter to be used for execution. If you installed TensorFlow and Keras within a virtual environment using pip, and your IDE isn't configured to use that environment, the import statements will inevitably fail.  Furthermore, incorrect PATH environment variables can also contribute to this issue.  Even if the interpreter in your IDE is pointed at the correct virtual environment, if the system cannot locate the necessary libraries, the imports will still fail.

This necessitates a systematic check of the following:

* **Interpreter Selection:**  Ensure your IDE explicitly points to the Python interpreter residing within the virtual environment where TensorFlow and Keras are installed.
* **Virtual Environment Activation:** If using a virtual environment, it must be activated *before* launching your IDE.  This ensures the IDE inherits the environment's package installations.
* **Environment Variables:** Verify your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (or equivalent, depending on your operating system) includes the directories where TensorFlow and Keras are located.  An incorrect or missing `PYTHONPATH` will prevent the interpreter from finding the libraries.
* **Package Installation Verification:**  Double-check the actual installation of TensorFlow and Keras within the target virtual environment using `pip list`.  A seemingly successful installation in one environment doesn’t guarantee its presence in another.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the necessary steps for addressing this issue within different contexts.  Assume `venv` is the name of your virtual environment.

**Example 1: Setting the Interpreter in Spyder**

```python
# No code execution here; this is a procedural example

1. In Spyder, go to Preferences > Python Interpreter.
2. Under "Select the Python interpreter:", select the interpreter from within your virtual environment (e.g., /path/to/your/venv/bin/python).
3. Click "Apply" and then "OK."
4. Restart Spyder.
5. Attempt to import TensorFlow and Keras within a new Spyder script.

```

This example demonstrates the crucial step of explicitly telling Spyder which Python interpreter to use.  Failure to correctly specify the interpreter within your virtual environment is the most common cause of this type of import error.


**Example 2: Activating the Virtual Environment Before Launching Sublime Text**

```bash
# Shell commands for environment activation and execution
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate     # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)

# Launch Sublime Text after activating the environment.
subl

# Within your Sublime Text Python file:
import tensorflow as tf
import keras

#If successful, proceed with your TensorFlow/Keras code
print(tf.__version__)
print(keras.__version__)
```

This example showcases the importance of activating the virtual environment *before* starting Sublime Text.  This ensures that the Python interpreter used by Sublime Text inherits the packages installed within the virtual environment.


**Example 3: Checking Package Installation and PYTHONPATH**

```python
# Python code to verify installation and environment variables

import sys
import os

# Check TensorFlow and Keras installation within the current environment
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    import keras
    print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
    print("Keras version:", keras.__version__)
except ImportError:
    print("TensorFlow or Keras not found in the current Python environment.")

# Check PYTHONPATH environment variable
print("\nPYTHONPATH:", os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH'))

# Check the Python path
print("\nPython Path:", sys.path)

```

This example provides a programmatic way to verify both the installation of TensorFlow and Keras and the state of the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  Inspecting the output of `sys.path` helps identify the directories searched by the Python interpreter for modules, revealing potential path issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For more in-depth understanding, I strongly recommend consulting the official documentation for TensorFlow and Keras.  Furthermore, reviewing the documentation for your specific IDE (Sublime Text and Spyder) regarding interpreter configuration is essential.  Finally, a thorough understanding of Python's module search path and virtual environments is crucial for effective troubleshooting of similar issues.  These resources will provide comprehensive guidance on environment management within the Python ecosystem.
