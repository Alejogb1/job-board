The core inefficiency in many Python functions stems from repeated computations within loops, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex operations.  My experience optimizing numerous scientific computing algorithms has highlighted this as a primary bottleneck.  Directly addressing redundant calculations significantly improves performance.  This response will detail several strategies to achieve this, focusing on vectorization and algorithmic improvements.

**1. Explanation:  Identifying and Eliminating Redundancy**

The most straightforward approach to optimizing Python functions involves meticulously examining the code for repeated calculations.  These often manifest within nested loops or recursive calls.  A common example is calculating the same intermediate value multiple times.  For instance, consider a function computing the Euclidean distance between numerous points in a dataset. A naive implementation might recalculate the squared difference between coordinates repeatedly.  Instead, pre-computing these values and storing them in an array drastically reduces computational overhead.

Another frequent source of inefficiency lies in inefficient data structures.  Using Python lists for numerical computations, while convenient, can be significantly slower than using NumPy arrays. NumPy's vectorized operations leverage highly optimized underlying C code, offering substantial performance gains.  Further, algorithms themselves can be improved.  For example, a brute-force O(n²) algorithm for a problem might be replaceable with a more efficient O(n log n) or even O(n) algorithm, offering exponential improvements as data size increases.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Vectorizing Euclidean Distance Calculation**

This example demonstrates the performance difference between a naive approach and a vectorized approach using NumPy.

```python
import numpy as np
import time

def euclidean_distance_naive(points):
    """Calculates pairwise Euclidean distances using nested loops."""
    n = len(points)
    distances = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            distance = 0
            for k in range(len(points[i])):
                distance += (points[i][k] - points[j][k])**2
            distances[i, j] = distances[j, i] = np.sqrt(distance)
    return distances

def euclidean_distance_vectorized(points):
    """Calculates pairwise Euclidean distances using NumPy vectorization."""
    points = np.array(points)
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((points[:, np.newaxis, :] - points[np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=2))


points = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10,11,12]] * 1000

start_time = time.time()
distances_naive = euclidean_distance_naive(points)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Naive approach time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

start_time = time.time()
distances_vectorized = euclidean_distance_vectorized(points)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Vectorized approach time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

assert np.allclose(distances_naive, distances_vectorized) #verify correctness
```

The `euclidean_distance_naive` function showcases a typical inefficient implementation.  The `euclidean_distance_vectorized` function, however, leverages NumPy's broadcasting capabilities to perform the calculation across the entire array simultaneously, resulting in significant speed improvements, especially with larger datasets.  The `assert` statement ensures both functions produce identical results.  This is crucial during optimization; correctness must not be sacrificed for speed.


**Example 2: Memoization for Recursive Functions**

Recursive functions, if not carefully designed, can lead to exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations of the same subproblems. Memoization is a powerful technique to address this.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_recursive_memoized(n):
    """Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using memoization."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive_memoized(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive_memoized(n-2)

def fibonacci_recursive_unmemoized(n):
    """Calculates the nth Fibonacci number without memoization."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive_unmemoized(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive_unmemoized(n-2)


n = 35  # Test with a larger value of n to see the difference.

start_time = time.time()
result_memoized = fibonacci_recursive_memoized(n)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Memoized approach time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

start_time = time.time()
result_unmemoized = fibonacci_recursive_unmemoized(n)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Unmemoized approach time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

assert result_memoized == result_unmemoized #verify correctness
```

The `@lru_cache` decorator from `functools` automatically implements memoization, storing previously computed results.  This dramatically reduces computation time for larger values of `n`, as the unmemoized version recalculates Fibonacci numbers repeatedly.


**Example 3: Algorithmic Optimization:  Sorting**

This example illustrates the importance of choosing the right algorithm.

```python
import random
import time
from timeit import timeit

def bubble_sort(data):
  """Implements a bubble sort."""
  n = len(data)
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(0, n-i-1):
      if data[j] > data[j+1]:
        data[j], data[j+1] = data[j+1], data[j]
  return data

def merge_sort(data):
  """Implements a merge sort."""
  if len(data) > 1:
    mid = len(data)//2
    left = data[:mid]
    right = data[mid:]

    merge_sort(left)
    merge_sort(right)

    i = j = k = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
      if left[i] < right[j]:
        data[k] = left[i]
        i += 1
      else:
        data[k] = right[j]
        j += 1
      k += 1
    while i < len(left):
      data[k] = left[i]
      i += 1
      k += 1
    while j < len(right):
      data[k] = right[j]
      j += 1
      k += 1
  return data

data = random.sample(range(10000),10000)

time_bubble = timeit("bubble_sort(data.copy())", globals=globals(), number=1)
time_merge = timeit("merge_sort(data.copy())", globals=globals(), number=1)

print(f"Bubble sort time: {time_bubble:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Merge sort time: {time_merge:.4f} seconds")
```

This example compares bubble sort (O(n²)) and merge sort (O(n log n)). For larger datasets, the superior time complexity of merge sort becomes evident, rendering bubble sort impractical.  This underscores the significance of selecting an algorithm appropriate for the problem's scale and characteristics.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of algorithm analysis and design, I recommend exploring standard textbooks on algorithms and data structures.  For Python-specific optimization, focusing on NumPy's documentation and tutorials, including its advanced features like broadcasting and vectorization, is crucial. Finally, familiarity with Python's profiling tools like `cProfile` is vital for identifying performance bottlenecks in complex applications. These tools allow for a precise understanding of where time is spent within a function, guiding optimization efforts to the most impactful areas.
