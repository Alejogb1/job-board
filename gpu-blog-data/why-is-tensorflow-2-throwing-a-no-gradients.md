The "No gradients provided" error in TensorFlow 2 when using a custom loss function typically stems from the inability of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation engine to compute gradients with respect to your model's trainable variables.  This often arises from subtle issues within the loss function's definition, specifically concerning the use of operations incompatible with automatic differentiation or improper handling of tensor shapes.  In my experience troubleshooting this across various projects, from large-scale image classification to time-series forecasting, this error consistently pointed to a breakdown in the differentiable computation graph.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` automatically tracks operations performed within its context. When `tape.gradient()` is called, it uses this information to compute gradients.  However, several factors can prevent this computation.  One frequent culprit is the usage of operations that lack defined gradients.  These operations might involve control flow (e.g., complex `if` statements within the loss function dependent on tensor values), non-differentiable functions (like certain custom functions without explicit gradient definitions), or operations performed outside the `tf.GradientTape` context.  Another common source of error is an improper shape alignment between the loss tensor and the model's output, leading to an inability to backpropagate the error signals effectively.  Finally,  incorrect handling of tensor types (e.g., using `tf.constant()` where a `tf.Variable` is required) can impede gradient calculation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Incorrect use of control flow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def incorrect_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  loss = 0.0
  for i in range(tf.shape(y_true)[0]):
    if y_true[i] > 0.5:
      loss += tf.abs(y_true[i] - y_pred[i]) # tf.abs() is differentiable, but the conditional isn't always

  return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(tf.random.normal((10,1)))
  loss = incorrect_loss(tf.random.normal((10,1)), y_pred)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

*Commentary:* The `if` statement within the loop prevents the automatic differentiation from tracing the entire computation graph consistently. The gradient computation will fail because the gradient with respect to `y_pred` is undefined for instances where `y_true[i] <= 0.5`. The solution is to replace this conditional logic with differentiable operations, for instance, using a differentiable approximation of a step function, like a sigmoid function with a steep slope.


**Example 2:  Incompatible function within the loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def non_differentiable_func(x):
  if x > 0:
    return np.floor(x)  # np.floor is not differentiable in TensorFlow's context.
  else:
    return x

def incorrect_loss2(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(non_differentiable_func(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)))

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(tf.random.normal((10,1)))
  loss = incorrect_loss2(tf.random.normal((10,1)), y_pred)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

*Commentary:* This uses `np.floor`, a NumPy function which is not directly differentiable within the TensorFlow graph.  Using TensorFlow equivalents like `tf.math.floor` is often insufficient as it might not have a registered gradient. Instead, use a differentiable approximation like rounding or a smooth floor function.


**Example 3: Shape Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def incorrect_loss3(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred)) # correct operation, but potential shape issue

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)]) # output shape is (None, 10)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(tf.random.normal((10,5))) # input shape is (10,5), y_true will need to match
  y_true = tf.random.normal((10, 10)) # shape mismatch. y_true should have shape (10, 10) to match prediction.
  loss = incorrect_loss3(y_true, y_pred)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

*Commentary:*  Although the `tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(...))` is perfectly differentiable, a shape mismatch between `y_true` and `y_pred` can lead to the error.  Ensure the shapes are compatible for element-wise subtraction; broadcasting rules might apply, but incompatible shapes will result in errors during gradient calculation. In this case, the output of the dense layer is (10, 10) while the y_true is (10, 5). They need to have the same shape along the axis of the batch size.  Careful consideration of your model's output dimensions and the corresponding shape of your target variable (`y_true`) is critical.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

TensorFlow documentation on automatic differentiation and custom training loops;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning focusing on TensorFlow implementation details;  research papers discussing advanced optimization techniques and their implementation in TensorFlow.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing the intricacies of gradient tape and automatic differentiation within TensorFlow. These resources offer in-depth explanations of the underlying mechanisms and troubleshooting strategies.  Thoroughly understanding these concepts will prove invaluable in avoiding similar errors in the future.
