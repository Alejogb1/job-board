TensorFlow 1.x's graph-based execution model differs fundamentally from TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution.  Direct loading isn't possible; a conversion process is required.  My experience porting large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x underscores the importance of understanding this distinction and the available conversion tools.  I've observed significant performance improvements after migration, particularly in iterative training and inference.

**1.  Explanation of the Conversion Process**

The core issue lies in the contrasting architectures.  TensorFlow 1.x relied on static computation graphs defined before execution, whereas TensorFlow 2.x defaults to eager execution, where operations are executed immediately. This necessitates converting the 1.x graph into a 2.x compatible format.  The primary method involves utilizing the `tf.compat.v1.saved_model` library to save the 1.x model as a SavedModel, a serialized representation of the graph and its associated data. This SavedModel can then be loaded and utilized within a TensorFlow 2.x environment.

The conversion isn't always straightforward.  Specific operations or custom layers from TensorFlow 1.x might not have direct equivalents in TensorFlow 2.x.  This necessitates manual adjustments, often involving substituting deprecated functions or re-implementing custom components to ensure compatibility.  Furthermore, the conversion process may require handling differences in data handling, particularly regarding placeholders and feed dictionaries.  The reliance on `tf.Session` in 1.x is superseded by the integrated execution environment in 2.x.

Successfully migrating a 1.x model requires careful consideration of several factors:

* **Dependency Management:** Ensuring all required libraries and their compatible versions are installed.  Conflicts between library versions can significantly impede the conversion process.

* **Custom Op Support:** Identifying and addressing any custom operations not directly supported in TensorFlow 2.x.  This may involve re-implementing the custom operation using TensorFlow 2.x APIs or finding alternative implementations.

* **Data Handling Adjustments:** Correctly mapping placeholders and feed dictionaries from the 1.x model to the appropriate input mechanisms in TensorFlow 2.x.

* **Session Management:** Replacing the `tf.Session` paradigm with the default eager execution context in TensorFlow 2.x.

* **Compatibility Checks:** Verifying model functionality after conversion by comparing outputs against the original 1.x model.

**2. Code Examples**

**Example 1: Saving a TensorFlow 1.x model as a SavedModel**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your TensorFlow 1.x model definition ...

# Assuming 'model' is your TensorFlow 1.x model
tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save(
    session=tf.compat.v1.Session(),
    export_dir="./saved_model",
    inputs={"input_tensor": model.input},
    outputs={"output_tensor": model.output}
)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the process of saving a TensorFlow 1.x model as a SavedModel. It assumes you have defined your model (`model`) beforehand using TensorFlow 1.x APIs.  Crucially, `tf.compat.v1` is used to access the necessary functions from TensorFlow 1.x within the TensorFlow 2.x environment. The `simple_save` function saves the model to the specified directory (`./saved_model`).  This directory is then used to load the model in TensorFlow 2.x.


**Example 2: Loading the SavedModel in TensorFlow 2.x**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("./saved_model")

# Accessing the model's input and output tensors
infer = loaded_model.signatures["serving_default"]

# Performing inference
input_data = ... # Your input data
results = infer(input_tensor=input_data)
```

This example demonstrates how to load the SavedModel created in Example 1 within a TensorFlow 2.x environment. `tf.saved_model.load` loads the model from the specified directory.  The `serving_default` signature key is typically used for inference, providing access to the input and output tensors.  The inference is executed by calling the `infer` function with the input data.  Note that the structure of input data must match the expectations of the loaded model.


**Example 3: Handling Custom Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_custom_op_v2(x):
  # TensorFlow 2.x implementation of the custom operation
  return tf.math.square(x)


loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("./saved_model")
modified_infer = loaded_model.signatures["serving_default"].replace_function(
    "my_custom_op", my_custom_op_v2
)

# Performing inference with modified custom op
input_data = ...
results = modified_infer(input_tensor=input_data)
```

This demonstrates how to handle a potential incompatibility.  If your 1.x model uses a custom operation not directly supported in 2.x, this example shows how to replace the old operation with its 2.x equivalent.  The `replace_function` method allows you to substitute the original custom op with a new implementation, ensuring correct functionality.   Replacing the op requires knowing the name and implementation of the original custom operation from the 1.x model.  Thorough debugging and testing are crucial in this step to ensure accuracy.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on model conversion and the usage of `tf.compat.v1` and `tf.saved_model`.  Furthermore, searching for "TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x migration" on various technical forums will yield numerous discussions and practical solutions to common issues encountered during the conversion process.  Dedicated books focusing on TensorFlow's architecture and migration strategies can offer valuable insights.  Finally, exploring example code repositories on platforms like GitHub can provide practical examples and templates for specific conversion tasks.
