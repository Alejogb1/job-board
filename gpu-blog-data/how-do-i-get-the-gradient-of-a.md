TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capability, while primarily designed for backpropagation through entire networks to adjust weights, can be leveraged to obtain gradients with respect to intermediate layer activations. This process requires utilizing TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` to record operations and then calculating gradients with respect to specifically tracked tensors, the intermediate layer outputs in this case.

The conventional application of `tf.GradientTape` involves calculating gradients of a loss function with respect to the trainable variables of a neural network. However, the underlying mechanism, which computes derivatives of tracked operations, doesn't inherently restrict us to trainable variables. The critical adaptation is explicitly tracking the intermediate activation tensors within the tape's scope. This allows us to then compute the gradient of a final output with respect to these tracked activations, effectively isolating a gradient signal at a specific point in the network's forward pass.

Consider, for example, a scenario involving a convolutional neural network for image classification. I encountered a need to understand how individual feature maps within a convolutional layer influence the final classification probability. To achieve this, I needed the gradient of the output probability (e.g., for a specific class) with respect to the activation maps of that chosen convolutional layer. This information proved invaluable in visualizing the receptive field of that convolutional feature map relative to the input image, allowing an understanding of what spatial regions within the image most strongly activate the identified feature.

The central idea hinges on the `tf.GradientTape`'s ability to track tensors which aren't trainable variables as well as its `gradient` function which can take any registered tensor and a target tensor. The target is the end of the calculation, and the source is the tensor from which the gradient is to be taken.

Here's a demonstration using TensorFlow 2. First, we define a simple model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')
        self.pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))
        self.conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')
        self.pool2 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.pool1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.pool2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense1(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
```

This code defines a rudimentary convolutional neural network composed of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and a fully connected output layer. The crucial part for our objective is the ability to access the output tensors of the convolutional layers.

Next, we create a function that calculates the gradient of the model output with respect to the activation of the first convolutional layer (`self.conv1`).

```python
def get_intermediate_gradient(model, input_tensor, target_class):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(input_tensor)
    conv1_out = model.conv1(input_tensor)
    
    # This is crucial - we must keep track of conv1_out tensor for gradient calculation.
    
    pool1_out = model.pool1(conv1_out)
    conv2_out = model.conv2(pool1_out)
    pool2_out = model.pool2(conv2_out)
    flatten_out = model.flatten(pool2_out)
    output_probs = model.dense1(flatten_out)
    target_prob = output_probs[:, target_class]

  gradients = tape.gradient(target_prob, conv1_out)
  return gradients
```

Within the function, we explicitly `watch` the input tensor with `tape.watch(input_tensor)`. This is necessary for calculating the gradient with respect to the input later, if needed.  We also compute the intermediate tensor `conv1_out` by calling `model.conv1(input_tensor)`, and the rest of the network forward pass. Most importantly, we compute the `target_prob`, which is the probability associated with the class specified by `target_class`. The `gradient` function calculates the derivative of `target_prob` with respect to `conv1_out`.

Finally, let's demonstrate the usage:

```python
input_shape = (1, 28, 28, 1) # Example shape for MNIST like data
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(input_shape)
target_class_index = 3  # Example: gradient with respect to class #3

gradients = get_intermediate_gradient(model, dummy_input, target_class_index)

print("Shape of the gradient with respect to conv1 activations:", gradients.shape)

```

The output of this code will display the shape of the computed gradients tensor. The shape will match that of the first convolutional layer's output, effectively representing the influence of each feature map location on the chosen output probability.

Several key points warrant further emphasis. Firstly, the tensor we are calculating the gradient with respect to, `conv1_out` in this case, must be present within the context of the gradient tape. Secondly, if you need to also compute the gradient with respect to the input, you must `watch` it with the `tape.watch()` call. Thirdly, you're not limited to accessing just a single intermediate activation; multiple tensors can be tracked, allowing you to obtain gradients with respect to multiple intermediate layers simultaneously. The only limitations are memory and computation.

I have employed this method in scenarios including network visualization, developing explainable AI techniques, and creating adversarial attacks. For example, visualizing gradients with respect to convolutional layer outputs helps to understand what input features are crucial to each convolutional filter by calculating the influence each feature map has on final class activation. The resulting gradients can be interpreted similarly to a saliency map, allowing us to highlight what aspects of the input image drive the given convolutional layer and final classification result. This is particularly useful in debug or understanding complex convolutional models.

This capability extends beyond simple feedforward networks. The same principles can be applied to recurrent neural networks or transformer networks; you must track intermediate tensor states within the tape's scope, allowing gradients to be computed with respect to those tracked tensor activations.

Further study and experimentation could consider exploring using second-order gradients for similar purposes or exploring how these intermediate gradients change with different activation functions and network architectures. Delving into techniques like Integrated Gradients, which are related to gradients of network outputs with respect to inputs, would also further contextualize the use and interpretation of these types of intermediate layer gradients.

Resources for further understanding include the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.GradientTape`, tutorials on automatic differentiation, and academic papers on visualization and explainable machine learning. Studying the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation would also provide a valuable context for understanding how these gradients are calculated at a fundamental level. Experimentation with different model architectures and problem domains is highly recommended to solidify understanding. I have found these resources to be effective at elucidating both the practical and theoretical considerations of this technique.
