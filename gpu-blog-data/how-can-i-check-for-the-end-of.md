The `match` statement in Python 3.10+ leverages pattern matching, offering a powerful mechanism for structured data decomposition.  However, directly checking for the *end* of a string within a `match` statement requires a nuanced approach, as the inherent structure doesn't explicitly expose string termination.  My experience debugging complex log parsing systems highlighted this need, leading me to develop several effective strategies.  The key lies in combining pattern matching with explicit length checks or leveraging techniques that implicitly handle string boundaries.

**1. Explicit Length Checks:**

This approach involves incorporating the length of the string into the pattern.  We can use named capture groups to extract substrings and then compare their lengths to the total string length to determine if a match occurred at the end.  This is generally the most straightforward and readily understandable method.

```python
import re

def check_end_of_string(text: str, pattern: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a pattern matches the end of a string using explicit length comparison.

    Args:
        text: The input string.
        pattern: The regular expression pattern.

    Returns:
        True if the pattern matches the end of the string, False otherwise.
    """
    match = re.match(pattern, text)
    if match:
        matched_text = match.group(0)  # Extract the matched substring
        return len(matched_text) == len(text)
    return False


# Example Usage:
text1 = "This is a test string."
text2 = "Another test string. End"
pattern = r"\w+\.$" # Matches one or more alphanumeric characters followed by a period at the end.


print(f"'{text1}' ends with pattern: {check_end_of_string(text1, pattern)}") # Output: False
print(f"'{text2}' ends with pattern: {check_end_of_string(text2, pattern)}") # Output: False (because of " End")

text3 = "This ends with a period."
print(f"'{text3}' ends with pattern: {check_end_of_string(text3, pattern)}") # Output: True


```

This code utilizes the `re` module for regular expression matching, allowing for flexible pattern definition.  The function `check_end_of_string` directly compares the length of the matched substring with the input string's length.  The example demonstrates how this approach differentiates between patterns matching at the end and those occurring elsewhere in the string.


**2.  Using `$` Anchor and Pattern Matching:**

The `$` anchor in regular expressions signifies the end of a string.  This provides a concise method to directly check for end-of-string matches within the regular expression itself, eliminating the need for post-match length comparisons.  However, it requires correctly constructing a regular expression that encapsulates the desired ending pattern.

```python
import re

def check_end_with_anchor(text: str, pattern: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a pattern matches the end of a string using the '$' anchor in regex.

    Args:
        text: The input string.
        pattern: The regular expression pattern (must include '$').

    Returns:
        True if the pattern matches the end of the string, False otherwise.
    """
    match = re.match(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)


# Example Usage:
text1 = "This is a test string."
text2 = "Another test string ending."
pattern = r"\w+\.$" # Matches one or more alphanumeric characters followed by a period at the end

print(f"'{text1}' ends with pattern: {check_end_with_anchor(text1, pattern)}") # Output: False
print(f"'{text2}' ends with pattern: {check_end_with_anchor(text2, pattern)}") # Output: True

```

This method leverages the power of regular expressions to implicitly handle the end-of-string condition.  The `$` anchor ensures that only matches occurring at the very end of the input string will be considered valid. This simplifies the logic compared to explicit length checks.

**3.  String Slicing and Pattern Matching (For Specific Substring Checks):**

If the goal is not to match an arbitrary pattern at the end, but rather to verify the presence of a specific known substring at the end, a more direct and efficient approach is to use string slicing combined with standard equality checks. This avoids the overhead of regular expressions if the task is straightforward.


```python
def check_end_substring(text: str, suffix: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a specific suffix exists at the end of a string using string slicing.

    Args:
        text: The input string.
        suffix: The substring to check for at the end.

    Returns:
        True if the suffix is at the end of the string, False otherwise.
    """
    return text.endswith(suffix)


# Example Usage:
text1 = "This is a test string."
text2 = "This string ends with suffix."
suffix = "suffix."

print(f"'{text1}' ends with '{suffix}': {check_end_substring(text1, suffix)}")  # Output: False
print(f"'{text2}' ends with '{suffix}': {check_end_substring(text2, suffix)}")  # Output: True

```

This function directly utilizes the `endswith()` method, offering a highly optimized and readable solution for checking specific suffixes. This method proves most efficient when dealing with fixed substrings rather than complex patterns.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The Python documentation on the `re` module provides comprehensive details on regular expression syntax and usage.  Understanding regular expressions is crucial for effectively using the `$` anchor and constructing complex patterns.  Furthermore, exploring resources on string manipulation techniques in Python, specifically focusing on slicing and indexing, can significantly enhance your understanding of string processing.  Finally, consult materials on Python's `match` statement for a deeper grasp of pattern matching capabilities beyond basic string comparisons.  These combined resources will provide a solid foundation for robust string processing within Python.
