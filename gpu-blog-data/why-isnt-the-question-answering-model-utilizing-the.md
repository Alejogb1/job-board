My experience working with transformer-based question answering models has shown me that GPU utilization issues are frequently multifaceted, stemming from misconfigurations or a lack of understanding of the underlying PyTorch (or TensorFlow) architecture. Often, the model itself is not the problem; instead, the problem lies within the data handling, inference setup, or environment.

To effectively leverage a GPU for deep learning, several preconditions must be met. First, and most fundamentally, your system must possess a compatible NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers properly installed and configured. This includes the CUDA toolkit, cuDNN library, and a compatible PyTorch installation that specifically includes CUDA support. Neglecting this initial step renders any attempts at GPU utilization futile. Second, the tensors used for model processing must be explicitly moved to the GPU device. Finally, the inference code must be structured in a manner that actually encourages batch processing, as the gains from parallelization are significantly more pronounced with larger batch sizes. This usually means vectorizing operations where possible. Without these steps, even the most powerful GPU will sit idle, while computation is offloaded onto the CPU.

Let’s consider a common scenario: a developer loads a pre-trained question answering model, feeds it a single query, and observes that the process is disappointingly slow. The first instinct might be to assume the model is faulty or that the GPU is not being recognized. However, a more careful examination often reveals that the issue arises from improper tensor placement. The default behavior in many frameworks is to perform operations on the CPU. To rectify this, tensors need to be moved to the GPU explicitly.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example question and context
question = "What is the capital of France?"
context = "France is a country in Western Europe. The capital of France is Paris."

# Tokenize the input
inputs = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors="pt")

# Incorrect: Inputs and model are on CPU (Default).
# predictions = model(**inputs)

# Correct: Move inputs to GPU
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    inputs = inputs.to(device)
    model.to(device)
    # Now model and inputs are on the GPU
    predictions = model(**inputs)
    # Get output on CPU and display
    start_scores = predictions.start_logits.cpu()
    end_scores = predictions.end_logits.cpu()
else:
    print("CUDA is not available. Continuing on CPU.")
    predictions = model(**inputs)
    start_scores = predictions.start_logits
    end_scores = predictions.end_logits
    
# Post-processing (example)
start_index = torch.argmax(start_scores)
end_index = torch.argmax(end_scores)
answer = tokenizer.decode(inputs["input_ids"][0][start_index: end_index + 1])
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

This first code segment demonstrates a critical step. Notice that the `inputs` dictionary and the `model` are transferred to the appropriate device using `inputs.to(device)` and `model.to(device)`. If CUDA is not available, a message is displayed and the process is handled using CPU processing only. Failing to explicitly move these elements to the GPU results in all computations occurring on the CPU despite the presence of a capable GPU. The results are then transferred back to the CPU via `cpu()` prior to any post-processing steps, as typically NumPy operations for tasks such as selection or indexing are performed on the CPU.

Another performance bottleneck arises from inefficient data loading. If your pipeline loads each question-context pair individually and performs inference sequentially, the GPU will not be utilized to its full potential. To address this, employ data loaders that support batch processing. Grouping similar sequences together before inference significantly enhances throughput by maximizing parallel processing on the GPU.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer

# Same model and tokenizer as before
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Create a custom dataset
class QADataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, questions, contexts):
        self.questions = questions
        self.contexts = contexts

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.questions)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        question = self.questions[idx]
        context = self.contexts[idx]
        inputs = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
        return inputs
# Sample Questions and Contexts
questions = [
    "What is the capital of France?",
    "What is the highest mountain?",
    "What is the largest ocean?"
]
contexts = [
    "France is a country in Western Europe. The capital of France is Paris.",
    "Mount Everest is the highest mountain above sea level.",
    "The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on Earth."
]

# Create dataset and dataloader
dataset = QADataset(questions, contexts)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=False) # Batch size of 2
# Move model to GPU if available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    model.to(device)
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")

# Inference loop with batch processing
for batch in dataloader:
    batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
    with torch.no_grad():
      predictions = model(**batch)
    start_scores = predictions.start_logits.cpu()
    end_scores = predictions.end_logits.cpu()

    # Simplified post-processing (example, batching would require indexing)
    for idx in range(start_scores.shape[0]):
      start_index = torch.argmax(start_scores[idx])
      end_index = torch.argmax(end_scores[idx])
      answer = tokenizer.decode(batch["input_ids"][idx][start_index: end_index + 1])
      print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

This second code example illustrates the use of a custom Dataset and Dataloader to handle multiple question-context pairs in batches. Observe how the input batch and the model are moved to the device using a dictionary comprehension. The `padding=True` option in the tokenizer function ensures all sequences within a batch have the same length, which is necessary for efficient GPU parallelization. This approach leverages batch processing, allowing the GPU to handle multiple data points concurrently, leading to a significant speedup compared to processing individual pairs sequentially. The processing is performed within `torch.no_grad()` context to avoid unnecessary gradient computations since inference does not involve backpropagation. While this simplified post processing does not scale well to very large batches, in real use-cases, a batched post-processing logic would be implemented.

Finally, it’s important to profile your application to identify specific bottlenecks. PyTorch provides tools like `torch.autograd.profiler` that can provide insight into performance bottlenecks. Another reason for lack of GPU utilization can be inefficient algorithms or inappropriate data types in downstream processing that may use the CPU. By analyzing the profiling data, one can pinpoint performance limitations. For example, one might realize that their text preprocessing is CPU bound, leading them to precompute those steps and store the result, or implement it directly in CUDA if feasible.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer
from torch.profiler import profile, record_function, ProfilerActivity
# Same model and tokenizer as before
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example question and context
question = "What is the capital of France?"
context = "France is a country in Western Europe. The capital of France is Paris."

# Tokenize the input
inputs = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors="pt")
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    inputs = inputs.to(device)
    model.to(device)
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("CUDA is not available. Continuing on CPU.")

# Profiling the model
with profile(activities=[
        ProfilerActivity.CPU, ProfilerActivity.CUDA], record_shapes=True) as prof:
    with record_function("model_inference"):
        predictions = model(**inputs)

        start_scores = predictions.start_logits.cpu()
        end_scores = predictions.end_logits.cpu()
        start_index = torch.argmax(start_scores)
        end_index = torch.argmax(end_scores)
        answer = tokenizer.decode(inputs["input_ids"][0][start_index: end_index + 1])
        print(f"Answer: {answer}")

print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by="cpu_time_total", row_limit=10))
```

The third code example leverages PyTorch’s profiler to assess the computational load. By wrapping the inference with `profile` and `record_function` context managers, detailed information about GPU and CPU usage is gathered. The printed output, sorted by `cpu_time_total`, shows which sections of the code consume the most CPU time. By examining this table, one can determine if specific sections of code are preventing GPU utilization. This is an iterative process, and the profiling process might lead to code redesigns for better performance.

To gain a broader understanding, I would recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation on CUDA semantics, particularly focusing on how tensors are allocated and moved between devices. The Transformers library documentation is also very useful. Additionally, numerous blog posts and tutorials online cover best practices for optimizing neural network performance, but focus specifically on deep learning and avoid generic introductions to the topic. A key concept to study is the notion of CUDA streams and asynchronous operations. These concepts are essential when creating highly optimized deep learning pipelines.
