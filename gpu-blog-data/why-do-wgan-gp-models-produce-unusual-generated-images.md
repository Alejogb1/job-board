The instability frequently observed in Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) stems primarily from the sensitivity of the gradient penalty mechanism to hyperparameter choices and the inherent challenges in balancing the discriminator and generator training.  My experience working on high-resolution image generation using WGAN-GP, particularly in the context of medical imaging synthesis, revealed this acutely.  Slight variations in the gradient penalty coefficient, learning rates, or batch sizes consistently yielded dramatically different results, ranging from coherent but blurry images to complete artifacts.  This isn't simply a matter of inadequate training; rather, it's an intrinsic characteristic of the algorithm's architecture and optimization landscape.

**1. A Clear Explanation:**

WGAN-GP addresses the vanishing gradient problem present in standard GANs by using the Wasserstein distance as a loss function and employing a gradient penalty to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator.  This constraint aims to prevent the discriminator from becoming too powerful, allowing the generator to learn effectively.  However, the effectiveness of the gradient penalty is heavily reliant on proper tuning.  An overly strong penalty (high gradient penalty coefficient) can stifle the discriminator's learning capacity, leading to a weak discriminator that fails to provide meaningful feedback to the generator. Conversely, a weak penalty allows the discriminator to collapse into a region of the input space where it can easily distinguish between real and fake samples, again hindering the generator’s progress.  This results in images that exhibit either a lack of detail and diversity (weak discriminator) or highly unrealistic and structurally inconsistent features (overly powerful discriminator).

Another critical factor contributing to unusual image generation is the choice of network architecture.  While WGAN-GP allows for greater flexibility in architecture compared to standard GANs, inappropriate architectures can still lead to problems.  For instance, a discriminator that’s too shallow may fail to capture the complex features of the underlying data distribution, whereas an excessively deep discriminator might overfit the training data, hindering generalization and leading to artifacts in the generated images.  Similarly, inadequate generator design can prevent the model from effectively mapping latent space representations to realistic image samples.  Finally, data quality plays a crucial role. Insufficient or noisy training data will inevitably limit the model's ability to learn a meaningful representation, regardless of the network architecture or hyperparameters used.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate different potential issues and how they manifest in the generated images.  They are simplified for illustrative purposes and assume familiarity with PyTorch.  The key modifications are highlighted.

**Example 1:  Overly Strong Gradient Penalty:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Define generator and discriminator architectures) ...

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 1e-4
gradient_penalty_coefficient = 10.0 # <-- Excessively high
batch_size = 64

# ... (Optimizer setup) ...

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        real_images = batch
        # ... (Generator and discriminator forward passes) ...
        # ... (Gradient penalty calculation) ...
        gradient_penalty = gradient_penalty_coefficient * torch.mean((gradient_norm - 1)**2) # <-- High coefficient

        # ... (Loss calculation and backpropagation) ...
```

In this example, the `gradient_penalty_coefficient` is excessively high. This overly restricts the discriminator, preventing it from effectively learning to distinguish between real and fake images. Consequently, the generator will produce blurry, low-resolution images lacking fine details.


**Example 2: Inappropriate Discriminator Architecture:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Generator architecture) ...

# Discriminator architecture - Too shallow
class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(784, 128), # <-- Insufficient layers
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.Linear(128, 1)
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

# ... (Rest of the code remains similar to Example 1) ...
```

Here, the discriminator network is deliberately kept shallow. This limits its capacity to learn the complex features of the image data. The generated images will likely lack coherence and structural integrity, exhibiting unrealistic artifacts.


**Example 3:  Inadequate Data Preprocessing:**

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.datasets import MNIST

# ... (Generator and discriminator architectures) ...

# Data loading
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(), # <-- Missing normalization
])

train_dataset = MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

# ... (Rest of the training code remains the same) ...
```

This code snippet demonstrates a lack of proper data normalization. Failing to normalize the input data can negatively impact the training dynamics of both the generator and the discriminator, leading to unstable training and consequently poorly generated images.  The generated images might exhibit inconsistent brightness, contrast, or other artifacts stemming from the poorly scaled inputs.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The original WGAN and WGAN-GP papers are essential reading.  Additionally, studying various implementations of WGAN-GP available online in repositories, along with their associated documentation and hyperparameter choices, is valuable.  Focusing on detailed explanations of hyperparameter tuning strategies and architectural considerations will be extremely helpful.  Finally, reviewing empirical studies comparing different GAN architectures and analyzing their respective successes and failures in specific domains provides further insights into the challenges and solutions associated with generating high-quality images.  A thorough understanding of optimization algorithms and their behavior in high-dimensional spaces is also crucial.
