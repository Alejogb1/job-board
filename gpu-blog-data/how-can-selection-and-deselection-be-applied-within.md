The core challenge in managing selection and deselection within Altair's `LayerChart` lies not in the chart type itself, but in the interaction model it inherits from Vega-Lite's layered specification.  Direct manipulation of individual layers' selections is not straightforward; instead, selection propagates across the layered chart based on the defined selection criteria and the interaction event.  My experience building interactive dashboards for financial data analysis highlights the importance of understanding this propagation behavior.  Improperly defined selections can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly with complex layered charts containing multiple data sources.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Altair's `LayerChart` constructs a visualization by overlaying multiple charts. Each chart operates on its own data, but they share a common coordinate system.  Selections are defined at the chart level, not the layer level. This means that selecting a point on one layer might trigger a selection—or deselection—on other layers, depending on your selection specification.  The critical component is the `select` argument within the chart specification.  This argument allows you to define the selection's behavior and, crucially, which data fields drive the selection.  The `select` argument takes a string identifying the selection, and options for the selection's type (e.g., `single`, `multi`, `interval`). The selected data points are then highlighted (by default), but you can also use the selection to filter or transform the data within other layers using transforms like `filter`.  Therefore, effective selection management requires careful consideration of the data fields used in each layer and how they relate to your selection definition.  Deselection, conversely, occurs when a selection is cleared either programmatically or through user interaction (e.g., clicking elsewhere in the chart).  This again propagates across layers, but its effect depends on the interaction mode and your selection definition.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Single Selection**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [2, 4, 1, 3, 5], 'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']})

# Define selection
selection = alt.selection_single(on='mouseover', fields=['x', 'y'])

# Create layered chart
chart = alt.layer(
    alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y', color='category').add_selection(selection),
    alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(x='x', y='y').transform_filter(selection)
).properties(width=300, height=200)

chart
```

This example demonstrates a simple single selection.  Hovering over a point in the scatter plot (layer 1) selects that point and filters the line chart (layer 2) to only show the data point selected.  The `transform_filter` on the line chart ensures that only the selected data is visible. The `on='mouseover'` parameter indicates that selection happens on mouse hover.  The `fields=['x', 'y']` parameter ensures that the selection is based on both X and Y coordinates.


**Example 2: Multi-Selection with Data Filtering**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 5, 2, 4], 'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C']})

# Define selection
selection = alt.selection_multi(fields=['category'])

# Create layered chart
chart = alt.layer(
    alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y', color='category').add_selection(selection),
    alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(x='category', y='count()').transform_filter(selection)
).properties(width=400, height=200)

chart
```

Here, a multi-selection is used, allowing multiple categories to be selected simultaneously. The selection is based on the 'category' field.  The bar chart (layer 2) updates dynamically to show the count of selected categories. Note how `fields` only specifies 'category'. The `transform_filter` ensures that the bar chart only represents the selected categories.


**Example 3:  Interval Selection and Conditional Encoding**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data with noise for better visual demonstration
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': np.arange(100), 'y': np.random.randn(100).cumsum() + 50})

# Interval selection
brush = alt.selection_interval()

# Create layered chart
chart = alt.layer(
    alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(x='x', y='y').properties(width=500, height=200).add_selection(brush),
    alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y', color=alt.condition(brush, alt.value('red'), alt.value('lightgray')))
).properties(width=500, height=200)

chart
```

This example utilizes an interval selection, allowing users to select a range of data points on the line chart. The point chart (layer 2) then conditionally changes the color of points within the selected interval to red. This demonstrates dynamic encoding based on selection.  The `alt.condition` function is crucial for controlling the appearance of data points based on the selection state.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Altair's official documentation. The Vega-Lite specification.  A comprehensive book on data visualization with Altair (if one exists that suits your level).  Published research papers on interactive visualization techniques.


Through these examples and explanations, the intricacies of managing selection and deselection in Altair’s `LayerChart` become clear.  Remember to carefully define your selection parameters, utilize appropriate transform functions, and leverage conditional encoding for creating powerful and intuitive interactive visualizations.  Thorough understanding of Vega-Lite's selection mechanism is crucial for advanced manipulation.
