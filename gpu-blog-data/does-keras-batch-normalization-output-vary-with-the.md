Batch normalization, implemented in Keras, does exhibit output variations based on the number of training epochs, specifically concerning its moving average statistics, not the instantaneous output given a batch. I've spent considerable time debugging models where this subtlety caused unexpected behavior during inference after short versus long training runs, compelling me to closely examine how Keras handles batch normalization.

The primary mechanism behind this variation stems from the manner in which Keras' batch normalization layers compute and utilize moving statistics during training. Internally, a batch normalization layer maintains a moving average for both the mean and variance of the input activations. During the training phase, for each mini-batch, the layer calculates the mean and variance across the batch. Simultaneously, it updates the moving mean and moving variance using a smoothing factor, conventionally denoted as 'momentum' in Keras. This update formula is generally a weighted average, where the current batch's statistics are combined with the existing moving statistics. Mathematically, the update to moving mean, µ, at time t might be expressed as:

µ<sub>t</sub> = momentum * µ<sub>t-1</sub> + (1 - momentum) * µ<sub>batch</sub>

A similar equation governs the update for the moving variance. It is this accumulation of information, specifically the moving statistics, that causes output differences based on epoch number. Early in training, the moving statistics are still converging towards a representation of the population data distribution. Each batch contributes significantly to the moving statistics because they are further from a stable average. Later in training, the updates are smaller. The moving statistics, now representative of the training distribution, stabilize. Consequently, the batch normalization layer output changes based on these varying statistics. The crucial point is that this influence on the output isn’t during training itself; rather, it affects how the layer normalizes data during inference when these precomputed statistics, not batch statistics, are used.

The primary benefit of this moving average approach is that, during inference (or evaluation), we do not compute statistics over small evaluation batches (which could be very different from the training data). Instead, the learned, averaged statistics from training are used, providing more reliable and consistent normalization, particularly beneficial in situations with limited data in validation or testing scenarios. However, the disadvantage is that changes to batch size can cause a slight change to the moving averages during training, indirectly affecting future inference due to the weighted averaging of the statistics.

To illustrate these behaviors, consider the following Keras code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Batch Normalization Layer with Different Epochs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)

# Define a simple model with batch normalization
def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Train for a small number of epochs
model_short = create_model()
model_short.fit(data, np.random.rand(1000, 1), epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Train for a larger number of epochs
model_long = create_model()
model_long.fit(data, np.random.rand(1000, 1), epochs=50, verbose=0)

# Prediction using the first sample
sample_data = data[0].reshape(1,10)
output_short = model_short.predict(sample_data)
output_long = model_long.predict(sample_data)

print(f"Output after 5 epochs: {output_short}")
print(f"Output after 50 epochs: {output_long}")
```

In this first example, two identical models are created. They differ only in the duration of training, 5 and 50 epochs respectively. After training, a single input sample is passed through both models. Even with the same input, the `predict` outputs will likely differ as the models converge on different internal state for the moving averages within the batch normalization layer. This demonstrates that the output is not solely a function of model weights, but also the internal state of batch normalization, which changes based on training duration.

**Example 2: Impact of Initializing Moving Statistics**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)

# Define a model with batch normalization with custom init
def create_model(init_mean, init_var):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.BatchNormalization(
             beta_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(init_mean),
             gamma_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(init_var),
             moving_mean_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(init_mean),
             moving_variance_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(init_var)
           ),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Model with standard initialization (zeros and ones)
model_default = create_model(0.0, 1.0)
model_default.fit(data, np.random.rand(1000, 1), epochs=1, verbose=0)

# Model with custom initialization
model_custom = create_model(0.5, 0.5)
model_custom.fit(data, np.random.rand(1000, 1), epochs=1, verbose=0)

# Prediction using the first sample
sample_data = data[0].reshape(1,10)
output_default = model_default.predict(sample_data)
output_custom = model_custom.predict(sample_data)

print(f"Output with default init: {output_default}")
print(f"Output with custom init: {output_custom}")
```

This second example demonstrates how changing the initial value of the `moving_mean` and `moving_variance` parameters can affect the output, even after only one epoch of training. These parameters are typically initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. However, I force it to initialize them with different values using  `beta_initializer`, `gamma_initializer`, `moving_mean_initializer`, and `moving_variance_initializer`. As one might expect, the model with custom initial values has slightly different outputs as its internal statistics differ, reinforcing that it is not just the learned weights that affect the output but also how much those weights have been trained in conjunction with batch normalization.

**Example 3: Using Training and Inference Modes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)

# Define a model with batch normalization
def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Create and train a model
model = create_model()
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(1000, 1), epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Prediction during training mode (using batch statistics)
sample_data = data[0].reshape(1,10)
training_output = model(sample_data, training=True) # Note training=True

# Prediction during inference mode (using moving statistics)
inference_output = model.predict(sample_data) # Note training is False by default
print(f"Output in training mode: {training_output}")
print(f"Output in inference mode: {inference_output}")

```

The third example makes explicit the difference between training and inference behavior using the `training` flag, available when making model calls instead of `.predict`. During training mode, even during evaluation, the model continues to calculate batch statistics using each incoming batch. In this mode, the output of batch normalization depends on the batch provided. When `training=False` (or just using `.predict`), inference mode is used, with the accumulated moving average statistics determining the layer’s normalization behavior. This demonstration clarifies why the same input given to a model can produce different results depending on whether it is training or inference time. This also provides another perspective on why epoch number can affect batch normalization, since inference time will use moving averages that change more early in training.

For further investigation and in-depth understanding, I recommend referencing advanced deep learning resources that explore the mathematical foundations and nuances of batch normalization. Technical papers detailing the original batch normalization algorithm and subsequent modifications can prove valuable. In particular, I suggest consulting documentation on normalization layer implementations across various deep learning frameworks. Additionally, examining the source code of specific Keras batch normalization implementations can help one internalize the exact details of moving average calculation. Specifically, one should look at how `momentum` affects batch normalization behavior. Finally, practical deep learning books, often using code examples, explain and demonstrate concepts at a different level and offer helpful intuition about how deep learning models behave.
