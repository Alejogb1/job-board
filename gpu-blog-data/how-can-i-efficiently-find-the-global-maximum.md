The inherent difficulty in locating the global maximum of a high-dimensional function stems from the combinatorial explosion of possible search spaces.  Gradient-based methods, while efficient in lower dimensions, often become trapped in local optima when dealing with such a large parameter count.  My experience working on optimizing complex financial models with over 800 parameters highlighted this challenge repeatedly.  Therefore, relying solely on gradient ascent is insufficient; a hybrid approach is necessary.

This response will outline a strategy combining global optimization techniques with local refinement.  The core idea involves employing a global search algorithm to identify promising regions of the parameter space, followed by the application of a gradient-based method to refine the solution within these regions.  This strategy mitigates the risk of becoming stuck in suboptimal local maxima inherent in gradient-based approaches alone.

**1.  Global Search Strategy:  Simulated Annealing**

Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic metaheuristic that excels at escaping local optima.  It mimics the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is slowly cooled to reach a low-energy state.  In our context, the "energy" represents the negative of the objective function value.  SA probabilistically accepts worse solutions during the early stages of the search, allowing it to explore a wider range of the parameter space. As the "temperature" parameter decreases, the probability of accepting worse solutions diminishes, focusing the search on regions with higher function values.

The algorithm iteratively proposes new parameter configurations, evaluating the resulting function value.  A move to a better configuration is always accepted, while a move to a worse configuration is accepted with a probability that decreases exponentially with the energy difference and the temperature.  The temperature is gradually reduced over iterations, ultimately driving the algorithm towards a global optimum.


**2. Local Refinement:  Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS)**

Once SA identifies a promising region, a local optimization method like L-BFGS is employed to refine the solution. L-BFGS is a quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix (matrix of second-order partial derivatives) efficiently, requiring only limited memory storage. This makes it suitable for high-dimensional problems where storing the full Hessian would be computationally prohibitive.  L-BFGS iteratively updates the parameter values based on the gradient and an approximation of the Hessian, converging rapidly towards a local optimum within the vicinity of the initial point provided by SA.


**3. Hybrid Approach Implementation and Code Examples**

The combined approach involves running SA to coarsely locate potential maxima, then using each identified peak as a starting point for L-BFGS. The highest value found after the L-BFGS refinement across all starting points represents the best estimate of the global maximum.


**Code Example 1:  Simulated Annealing Implementation (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

def simulated_annealing(objective_function, initial_params, temperature, cooling_rate, iterations):
    params = initial_params
    best_params = params
    best_value = objective_function(params)
    for i in range(iterations):
        new_params = params + np.random.normal(0, 1, len(params)) # Perturbation
        new_value = objective_function(new_params)
        delta_e = new_value - best_value
        if delta_e > 0:
            params = new_params
            best_params = params
            best_value = new_value
        else:
            acceptance_probability = np.exp(delta_e / temperature)
            if np.random.rand() < acceptance_probability:
                params = new_params
        temperature *= cooling_rate
    return best_params, best_value

# Example usage (replace with your objective function)
def my_objective_function(params):
    return -np.sum(params**2) #Example, needs replacement


initial_params = np.random.rand(500)
best_params, best_value = simulated_annealing(my_objective_function, initial_params, 100, 0.95, 1000)
print(f"Best parameters: {best_params}, Best value: {best_value}")

```

**Code Example 2: L-BFGS Optimization (Python using SciPy)**

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize_lbfgsb

#Example usage (replace with your objective function and initial parameters from SA)
initial_params = best_params #From Simulated Annealing
result = minimize_lbfgsb(lambda x: -my_objective_function(x), initial_params) #Negative since we maximize

print(f"L-BFGS Result: {result}")
print(f"Optimized parameters: {result.x}, Optimized value: {-result.fun}")
```

**Code Example 3:  Hybrid Approach Orchestration (Python)**

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize_lbfgsb
import numpy as np

# ... (Simulated annealing function from Example 1) ...

def hybrid_optimization(objective_function, num_sa_runs=5, sa_iterations = 1000, lbfgs_options={}):
  best_global_params = None
  best_global_value = float('-inf')
  for i in range(num_sa_runs):
    initial_params = np.random.rand(500)
    sa_params, sa_value = simulated_annealing(objective_function, initial_params, 100, 0.95, sa_iterations)
    lbfgs_result = minimize_lbfgsb(lambda x: -objective_function(x), sa_params, **lbfgs_options)
    if -lbfgs_result.fun > best_global_value:
      best_global_value = -lbfgs_result.fun
      best_global_params = lbfgs_result.x
  return best_global_params, best_global_value

#Example Usage
best_global_params, best_global_value = hybrid_optimization(my_objective_function)
print(f"Global Optimization Result: Parameters - {best_global_params}, Value - {best_global_value}")
```


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of global optimization techniques, I would recommend consulting texts on numerical optimization and metaheuristics.  Specifically, look for detailed treatments of simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization.  For a comprehensive understanding of quasi-Newton methods, including L-BFGS, reference books on numerical analysis are invaluable.  Furthermore, studying the theoretical properties of convergence and computational complexity for these algorithms is crucial for choosing appropriate methods for specific problems.  Finally, exploring advanced optimization libraries in Python (like SciPy's optimization module) will provide practical tools for implementation.
