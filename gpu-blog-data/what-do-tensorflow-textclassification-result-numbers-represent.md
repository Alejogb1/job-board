TensorFlow's `text_classification` models, when deployed for inference, typically output a tensor containing probabilities, often referred to as confidence scores, rather than directly predicted class labels. Understanding these numerical outputs is crucial for correctly interpreting the model’s predictions and integrating them into downstream applications. These probabilities represent the model's degree of certainty that a given input text belongs to each of the pre-defined categories.

The specific representation is dependent on the final layer activation function used during model training. Typically, for multi-class classification, a *softmax* activation function is employed. In the case of multi-label classification (where an input can belong to multiple classes simultaneously), a *sigmoid* activation is more common. The output of these activations is what is being returned by a deployed model.

In *softmax*, the output for each class is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where all outputs sum to 1. This reflects the model's probabilistic assessment; for example, if a model is trained to classify movie reviews as ‘positive,’ ‘negative,’ or ‘neutral’ and, for a given review, outputs probabilities of 0.8, 0.1, and 0.1 respectively, it suggests the model is 80% confident the review is ‘positive.’ The highest value indicates the predicted class. It’s a mutually exclusive arrangement; a review cannot realistically be classified as both positive and negative in a single discrete assignment.

In *sigmoid*, each output corresponds to a single class, and each value is also between 0 and 1, but unlike softmax, they do not sum to 1. Each probability represents the model’s independent assessment of whether the input belongs to that particular class, so there can be multiple classes associated with the text above a designated threshold. For instance, if a model categorizes news articles with outputs representing 'politics' and 'sports', and provides 0.9 for politics and 0.2 for sports, the article is primarily political with a minor sports component. Note that defining an appropriate threshold is crucial in multi-label scenarios to determine the classes a given text belongs to, because the model is outputting confidence scores, not a distinct class label.

The training process involves minimizing a loss function which measures the difference between these model outputs and the actual classes during model training. The training procedure adjusts the model weights to get the predicted probability distributions as close as possible to the true label distributions. After training, when the model is deployed, it's important to understand that these scores are still only approximations, conditioned on the quality and representativeness of the data used for training.

Here are three specific code examples to clarify how these outputs are produced and what they mean.

**Example 1: Softmax Output from a Multiclass Classifier**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'model' is a trained TensorFlow text classification model with a softmax output layer
# and that input_text is a tensor containing the tokenized input text.

def predict_multiclass(model, input_text):
    logits = model(input_text)  # Get the logits before softmax
    probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits).numpy() # Apply softmax for probabilities
    return probabilities

# Assuming we have a text of interest
test_input = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]) # A dummy representation of tokenized input
# Model is a placeholder.  In a real implementation you'd use a pre-trained model.
model = lambda x: tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, -3.0]]) # Dummy model output

output_probabilities = predict_multiclass(model, test_input)

print(f"Softmax probabilities: {output_probabilities}")
predicted_class = tf.argmax(output_probabilities, axis=1).numpy() # Index of highest probability
print(f"Predicted class index: {predicted_class}")
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how the raw outputs (logits) of a model, which might be negative and do not sum to one, are converted to probabilities using `tf.nn.softmax`. The output `probabilities` shows the confidence score for each class. The code then determines the predicted class by selecting the argument with the highest probability via `tf.argmax`. The specific integer is an index to the array storing human-readable class labels. This pattern is the standard practice for most TensorFlow multi-class text classification problems.

**Example 2: Sigmoid Output from a Multi-Label Classifier**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'model' is a trained TensorFlow text classification model with a sigmoid output layer.

def predict_multilabel(model, input_text, threshold=0.5):
    logits = model(input_text)
    probabilities = tf.nn.sigmoid(logits).numpy() # Apply sigmoid to produce probabilities
    predicted_labels = (probabilities > threshold).astype(int) # Thresholding for label classification
    return predicted_labels

test_input = tf.constant([[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]) # A dummy tokenized input representation
model = lambda x: tf.constant([[0.6, 0.2, 0.9, 0.1]]) # Dummy model output

predicted_labels = predict_multilabel(model, test_input)

print(f"Predicted labels (1 if above threshold, 0 otherwise): {predicted_labels}")
```

**Commentary:** This example shows how a multi-label classifier using a sigmoid activation function outputs probabilities for each label independently. The sigmoid function maps the logits (model outputs) into the range [0, 1]. A threshold, typically 0.5, is then applied to decide whether a label is assigned (1) or not (0) to the input text. The output is a binary vector with length equal to the number of classes, reflecting the predicted labels. The critical factor here is choosing an appropriate threshold as there is no constraint on the probabilities summing to one. The correct threshold is usually determined through evaluation on a validation set.

**Example 3: Accessing Model Output Using TensorFlow Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# This sets up a minimal working example using Keras.

num_classes = 5
embedding_dim = 16
max_len = 10
vocabulary_size = 100 # Dummy vocabulary size
# Creating a minimal working model
model_input = layers.Input(shape=(max_len,))
embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(vocabulary_size, embedding_dim)(model_input)
flatten_layer = layers.Flatten()(embedding_layer)
output_layer = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(flatten_layer)

model = keras.Model(inputs=model_input, outputs=output_layer)

def get_prediction(model, input_text):
    probabilities = model.predict(input_text) # Get probability vector
    return probabilities

test_input = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
predictions = get_prediction(model, test_input)
print(f"Predicted probabilities: {predictions}")
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a common pattern using the Keras API. The `model.predict()` method automatically returns the model's output, which, in this case, is the vector of softmax probabilities. The `model.predict()` call handles passing input through all model layers. This pattern is essential when using higher-level APIs like Keras. You do not need to add an activation function yourself; in this case we chose ‘softmax’ for the output layer activation, so this function is automatically applied by Keras.

For additional information and advanced applications, I recommend exploring resources focusing on natural language processing (NLP) model evaluation metrics. Publications that focus on classification metrics are valuable for understanding how to determine the efficacy of these models, such as the F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curves. Books covering deep learning in the context of NLP, and the TensorFlow documentation on their text module, are also extremely helpful. Further, resources on information retrieval and text mining provide useful context on why these models are useful. Lastly, I recommend researching cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning, as the output of these models is highly dependent on the training procedures.  A high score on training data does not guarantee similar high accuracy on unseen data.
