TensorFlow Serving's CUDA support is intrinsically linked to the TensorFlow version it's built against.  My experience deploying models on AWS P3 instances highlighted the critical need for precise version alignment between TensorFlow, CUDA, cuDNN, and the TensorFlow Serving build process.  Simply stating "CUDA 9" is insufficient; the specific CUDA toolkit version, cuDNN version, and the corresponding TensorFlow version are crucial determinants of a successful compilation. Incorrect version pairings lead to cryptic errors and runtime failures, often masked by seemingly unrelated issues.

The compilation process itself is not straightforward; it requires a deep understanding of the dependencies and the build system.  While Docker images simplify deployment, managing dependencies at the build stage remains crucial for ensuring reproducibility and optimizing performance for specific hardware.  Ignoring these nuances results in unpredictable behavior and significant debugging challenges.  During my work on a large-scale recommendation system deployment, I spent considerable time resolving issues stemming from a mismatch between the TensorFlow Serving build environment and the runtime environment on the P3 instances.

**1.  Explanation:**

To compile TensorFlow Serving with CUDA 9 support for AWS P3 instances, one must first establish a build environment with the correct dependencies. This necessitates installing the specific versions of CUDA 9 toolkit, cuDNN corresponding to the CUDA 9, and the compatible TensorFlow version.  The critical dependency is the TensorFlow source code itself, which needs to be built with CUDA 9 support enabled.  This requires configuring the build process to locate the CUDA and cuDNN libraries during the compilation step. A common approach involves setting environment variables pointing to the installation directories of the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN.  Failing to configure these correctly leads to the build system linking against the wrong libraries, resulting in a TensorFlow Serving binary that cannot utilize the GPU acceleration capabilities of the P3 instances.


The build system employed by TensorFlow Serving, Bazel, requires a meticulous approach.  Building TensorFlow Serving with CUDA support necessitates a thorough understanding of Bazel's build configuration options.  Correctly specifying the CUDA toolchain and associated options is paramount.  Improper configuration may result in a build that omits CUDA support or generates a binary incompatible with the target hardware.  Finally, after a successful build, the resulting TensorFlow Serving binaries must be deployed to the AWS P3 instances; this process must ensure that the runtime environment on the instances mirrors the build environment to avoid runtime errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate snippets from a Bazel `WORKSPACE` file, a `BUILD` file, and a shell script for environment setup.  These are illustrative and will require modification based on the precise TensorFlow and CUDA versions used. Remember to always refer to the official TensorFlow documentation for the most up-to-date instructions.


**Example 1: Bazel WORKSPACE file (partial)**

```bazel
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "tensorflow",
    urls = ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git"], # Replace with actual URL
    sha256 = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", # Replace with SHA256 checksum
    strip_prefix = "tensorflow",
)

# Add CUDA and cuDNN repositories if not already included in the TensorFlow repository
#  These might be separate repositories depending on your TensorFlow version and build setup
# ...
```

This excerpt shows how to fetch the TensorFlow source code using Bazel's `http_archive` rule. The SHA256 checksum is crucial for ensuring reproducibility.  It is advisable to replace the placeholder values with the actual ones for your selected TensorFlow release.  Note that the way CUDA and cuDNN are included might vary depending on the TensorFlow version; some versions include them directly within the repository, while others require separate inclusion.

**Example 2: Bazel BUILD file (partial)**

```bazel
load("@tensorflow//tensorflow/tools/serving:serving_targets.bzl", "tf_serving_server")

tf_serving_server(
    name = "tensorflow_serving",
    model_servers = [":model_server"],
    cuda = True, #Enable CUDA support
    cuda_compute_capability = "7.0", # Adjust based on the P3 instance type
    # other options
)

# ... other build rules ...
```

This snippet illustrates the configuration of a TensorFlow Serving build rule using Bazel.  The `cuda` flag is critically important and enables GPU support during the build process.  The `cuda_compute_capability` should be set to a value compatible with the NVIDIA GPUs present in the P3 instances.  It's imperative to check the specifications of the specific P3 instance type for this value.


**Example 3: Shell script for environment setup (partial)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export CUDNN_ROOT="/usr/local/cudnn" # Adjust based on cuDNN installation location

# Set other environment variables as needed for TensorFlow and Bazel
# e.g., PYTHONPATH, Bazel flags

bazel build //tensorflow/tools/serving:tensorflow_model_server

# ... further deployment steps ...

```

This script sets essential environment variables that point to the CUDA and cuDNN installations.  These variables are crucial for the Bazel build process to correctly identify and link against the necessary libraries. The correct paths must match your system.  Incorrect path settings lead to compilation failures or binaries that cannot leverage GPU acceleration.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Official TensorFlow documentation:** This is the primary source of truth for building and deploying TensorFlow Serving.  Pay close attention to the sections on GPU support and building from source.
* **Bazel documentation:** Understanding Bazel's build system is crucial for navigating the TensorFlow build process.  The documentation provides detailed information on configuring and running Bazel builds.
* **NVIDIA CUDA documentation:** Refer to NVIDIA's documentation for details on CUDA toolkit installation and configuration.
* **NVIDIA cuDNN documentation:** This document provides information on installing and using cuDNN, a crucial library for deep learning operations on NVIDIA GPUs.


These resources offer essential guidance on the complexities involved in building TensorFlow Serving with CUDA support.  Successful compilation hinges on understanding and meticulously following the instructions in these documents and adhering to strict version control across the entire software stack.  Failure to do so almost guarantees compilation errors and deployment challenges, even with ostensibly correct configurations.  The detailed attention to version compatibility and environment setup, as illustrated in these examples, is crucial for successful GPU acceleration on AWS P3 instances.
