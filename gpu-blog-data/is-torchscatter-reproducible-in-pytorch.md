The inherent non-deterministic nature of certain parallel operations in CUDA, specifically atomic operations, presents challenges for ensuring reproducibility when using `torch_scatter` in PyTorch. Despite PyTorch’s efforts to provide deterministic behavior, subtle variations arising from the order of memory access across threads can still result in different outputs, especially with operations like `add` or `mean`.

`torch_scatter` is a powerful primitive for performing scattered updates to a tensor, operating in a many-to-one fashion. Specifically, given a source tensor, an index tensor, and a destination tensor, it takes each element from the source and aggregates (based on a specified reduction operation, i.e. `add`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, etc.) it into the destination tensor based on the index mapping. This functionality is particularly useful in graph neural networks and sparse tensor computations. However, achieving deterministic execution with `torch_scatter` is not guaranteed, despite common assumptions that setting manual seeds will resolve this.

The problem originates in the underlying CUDA implementation of the chosen reduction operations. If two or more threads try to update the same location in the destination tensor simultaneously (which is the intent of `torch_scatter` for entries with the same index), these updates become atomic operations. The order in which these atomic updates occur depends on low-level scheduling and can vary slightly across different executions, even with the same inputs and random seeds. This is particularly true for reduction operations like `add` and `mean` where a strict floating-point accumulation order is required for mathematical exactness. Due to the order variance, rounding errors and accumulated values can therefore diverge on different runs.

Although using `torch.manual_seed()` and enabling deterministic CUDA operations (`torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`, `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`) often leads to deterministic results for matrix multiplication and other common operations, the nature of `torch_scatter` makes it an exception. Even when the environment is otherwise perfectly deterministic (e.g., same GPU hardware, software versions, inputs), subtle threading differences may cause non-deterministic behavior. It's worth noting that the `min` and `max` operations are more often reproducible as they are less sensitive to ordering. However, the widely used `add` and `mean` operations are where the non-deterministic effects are most pronounced.

I’ve encountered situations in my work on graph representation learning where subtle changes due to this non-determinism had significant effects on my downstream model training. A network performing well one run would fail the next, due to small but influential perturbations generated by the non-deterministic behavior of `torch_scatter`. This led me to the realization that simply setting seeds was not enough to account for all non-determinism. To mitigate the problems caused by the non-deterministic nature of `torch_scatter`, I've resorted to the following techniques. One approach involves reducing the magnitude of floating-point variance. Although it doesn't provide full determinism it can mitigate large changes in the training process. Also, to the extent feasible, it is preferable to use operations that are more inherently deterministic than `add` or `mean` if it is suitable for your particular problem.

Here are several code examples to illustrate the non-deterministic behavior and potential mitigation:

**Example 1: Demonstrating Non-Deterministic `add` Operation**

```python
import torch
import torch_scatter

def test_scatter_add(device):
    torch.manual_seed(42)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

    src = torch.rand(10, 5, device=device)
    index = torch.randint(0, 3, (10,), device=device)
    out = torch.zeros(3, 5, device=device)

    out1 = torch_scatter.scatter_add(src, index, out=out.clone())
    out2 = torch_scatter.scatter_add(src, index, out=out.clone())

    print(f"Device: {device}")
    print("Output 1:\n", out1)
    print("Output 2:\n", out2)
    print("Are outputs equal?", torch.equal(out1, out2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        test_scatter_add(torch.device('cuda'))
    test_scatter_add(torch.device('cpu'))
```

This script tests `scatter_add` on both CPU and GPU. The outputs will be equal on CPU, but on the GPU there will very likely be a different result from `out1` and `out2`, even though the input data, seed, and deterministic settings are exactly the same. This demonstrates that `torch_scatter` is not fully deterministic with the `add` operation in a CUDA environment. The CPU version is deterministic because it doesn't involve concurrent execution and is therefore much more predictable.

**Example 2: Using `mean` Instead of `add`**

```python
import torch
import torch_scatter

def test_scatter_mean(device):
    torch.manual_seed(42)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

    src = torch.rand(10, 5, device=device)
    index = torch.randint(0, 3, (10,), device=device)
    out = torch.zeros(3, 5, device=device)

    out1 = torch_scatter.scatter_mean(src, index, out=out.clone())
    out2 = torch_scatter.scatter_mean(src, index, out=out.clone())


    print(f"Device: {device}")
    print("Output 1:\n", out1)
    print("Output 2:\n", out2)
    print("Are outputs equal?", torch.equal(out1, out2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        test_scatter_mean(torch.device('cuda'))
    test_scatter_mean(torch.device('cpu'))
```

This second example is similar to the first but uses `scatter_mean` instead of `scatter_add`. Similar to the previous example, the `scatter_mean` operation on the GPU will likely show different results on consecutive runs. Again, the CPU version behaves deterministically as expected. Both examples showcase that operations such as `add` or `mean` in the context of `torch_scatter` cannot be guaranteed to yield identical results across executions, in particular for GPUs.

**Example 3: Potential Mitigation (if applicable for the task) using `min`**

```python
import torch
import torch_scatter

def test_scatter_min(device):
    torch.manual_seed(42)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

    src = torch.rand(10, 5, device=device)
    index = torch.randint(0, 3, (10,), device=device)
    out = torch.full((3, 5), float('inf'), device=device)  # Initialize with maximum value

    out1 = torch_scatter.scatter_min(src, index, out=out.clone())[0]
    out2 = torch_scatter.scatter_min(src, index, out=out.clone())[0]

    print(f"Device: {device}")
    print("Output 1:\n", out1)
    print("Output 2:\n", out2)
    print("Are outputs equal?", torch.equal(out1, out2))

if __name__ == '__main__':
     if torch.cuda.is_available():
        test_scatter_min(torch.device('cuda'))
     test_scatter_min(torch.device('cpu'))

```

This third example uses `scatter_min` instead. Although the specific operation of taking the minimum might not apply to all problems, this particular `min` or `max` operation is much more likely to be deterministic across different runs compared to `add` or `mean` in GPU environment. The `min` operation does not depend on the order of calculations, therefore rendering the output more reproducible, in general. The output will be the same for both CPU and GPU environments, assuming the same seed is provided. It showcases a strategy that sometimes may be applicable to work around the non-deterministic behavior of other operations like `add` and `mean`.

For further understanding of the intricacies of CUDA's atomic operations, I recommend examining the CUDA programming guide and the documentation related to CUDA's shared memory and thread scheduling. The PyTorch documentation itself contains a wealth of information on its inner workings and its attempts at determinism. Further resources can be found by inspecting CUDA's lower-level math libraries, although these may be less directly applicable to most users of `torch_scatter` functionality. Although it is difficult to completely control non-determinism with reduction operations in `torch_scatter`, awareness of the issues enables targeted mitigation strategies such as choosing alternatives to `add` and `mean` when feasible or employing other techniques to reduce the floating-point variability in model training.
