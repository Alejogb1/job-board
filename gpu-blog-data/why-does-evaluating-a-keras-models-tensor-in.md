The root cause of the "FAILED_PRECONDITION: Could not find variable dense/kernel" error when evaluating a Keras model's tensor in graph mode stems from a mismatch between the model's execution context and the variable's lifecycle.  Specifically, the error arises because the TensorFlow graph execution environment, utilized during graph mode evaluation, cannot locate the weight tensor (`dense/kernel` in this case) because it hasn't been properly initialized or is not accessible within that execution context.  This commonly happens due to inconsistencies between the way the model is built, compiled, and subsequently evaluated, particularly when eager execution is involved during model construction or training.  I've encountered this issue numerous times while developing and deploying large-scale NLP models for sentiment analysis, often related to improper scoping or the use of custom training loops.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, the underlying framework for Keras, operates under two primary execution modes: eager execution and graph mode. Eager execution evaluates operations immediately, offering an intuitive and interactive experience, especially during development and debugging. Graph mode, conversely, constructs a computational graph first, then executes the entire graph efficiently, ideal for deployment and performance-critical scenarios.  The error you're encountering arises specifically within graph mode.

When you build a Keras model using the Sequential or Functional APIs, Keras constructs the model's layers, each with its associated weights (kernels, biases, etc.).  These weights are TensorFlow variables.  In eager execution, these variables are created and initialized immediately. However, in graph mode, the variable creation and initialization become part of the graph construction process.  The crucial aspect is that the graph must contain the complete definition of the variable *before* attempting to access or evaluate it.

If the `dense/kernel` variable is missing during graph mode evaluation, it indicates one of the following:

* **The layer containing the variable wasn't properly included in the model:** This can happen due to errors in the model definition itself. For instance, forgetting to add a layer or incorrectly referencing a layer within a custom function.
* **The model wasn't compiled properly:** Compilation is essential; it finalizes the model architecture and sets up the optimization process, crucial for weight initialization.  Without compilation, the weights might not exist in the graph.
* **The evaluation context is inconsistent:**  This is particularly relevant when transitioning between eager and graph execution. If a part of the model creation or training happens in eager execution, the graph might lack the necessary information about the weights.
* **Incorrect use of custom training loops or callbacks:**  Directly manipulating variables or layers outside the standard Keras training loop can inadvertently lead to inconsistent states in the graph.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Model Definition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect: Missing the dense layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Activation('relu') #The dense layer is missing
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Attempting to evaluate a tensor within the missing layer will fail
try:
    model.predict(tf.random.normal((1, 10)))
except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates a simple error in the model definition. The absence of a `Dense` layer means there's no `dense/kernel` variable to be found.  The `try-except` block is a crucial debugging strategy.

**Example 2: Improper Compilation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(5)
])

# Incorrect: Missing compilation
# Attempting to evaluate without compilation will fail.
try:
    model.predict(tf.random.normal((1, 10)))
except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')  #Correct compilation added here
model.predict(tf.random.normal((1,10)))
```

This highlights the necessity of compilation.  Without compilation, the internal structure of the model, including weight initialization, isn't fully defined, leading to the error. The corrected part shows the correct usage.


**Example 3:  Inconsistent Execution Modes (Simplified Illustration)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True) # Eager execution for model building

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(5)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(False) # Switching to graph mode for prediction

#Attempt to predict in graph mode after building the model in eager mode will likely fail
try:
    model.predict(tf.random.normal((1,10)))
except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

This example, while simplified, illustrates a potential issue with inconsistent execution modes.  Building the model in eager execution and then switching to graph execution for prediction can lead to issues due to the differing initialization mechanisms.  In practice, such inconsistencies are more subtle and often related to custom training procedures or callback functions. Consistent use of graph or eager execution throughout the model's lifecycle is best practice to avoid such problems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation on eager execution and graph mode, focusing on the differences in variable handling and initialization. Consult the Keras documentation on model building, compilation, and the intricacies of the Sequential and Functional APIs.   Explore the TensorFlow debugging tools, particularly those related to inspecting the computational graph and identifying variable lifecycles.  Review advanced topics such as custom training loops and Keras callbacks, understanding how improper implementation can lead to similar errors.  Finally, consult tutorials on deploying Keras models, especially when moving from development environments to production settings.  Addressing these areas will provide the necessary foundation to avoid this error and to build more robust and maintainable deep learning applications.
