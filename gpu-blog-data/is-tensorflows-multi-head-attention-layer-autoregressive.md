TensorFlow's multi-head attention layer, in its standard implementation within transformer architectures, is not inherently autoregressive. The core mechanism operates on all input sequence tokens simultaneously, computing attention weights across the entire sequence in a single forward pass. This is a key distinction compared to autoregressive models, which process input tokens sequentially and condition predictions on previously generated tokens.

The lack of autoregressive behavior stems from the attention mechanism itself. The query, key, and value projections are computed for all input positions, then these are used to generate an attention matrix, subsequently weighted to produce context vectors, which have no inherent temporal dependence. In practice, the multi-head attention layer is used in many non-autoregressive models, demonstrating its ability to process entire sequences in parallel without relying on iterative feedback loops that define autoregressive operations. Autoregressive models like those based on LSTMs or the decoding phase of a Transformer, generate each output token based on previous outputs, whereas multi-head attention layers calculate the entire output given input vectors. This distinction is fundamental to how each method approaches sequence modeling tasks.

To illustrate, consider the typical formula for self-attention, where *Q*, *K*, and *V* represent the query, key, and value matrices, respectively:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k)) * V
```

This equation shows that the attention weights are computed as a function of *Q* and *K*, and all input positions in the sequence contribute to these calculations. There is no explicit looping or sequential processing that would indicate autoregressivity. The entire operation is vectorized, allowing for efficient parallel computation. The output is created via a weighted sum of all the *V* vectors after scaling by the attention weights. Each position in the output has access to all positions in the input.

The absence of autoregressive processing in the multi-head attention layer allows for efficient parallel processing and it is often beneficial, for example, in tasks like machine translation and image processing where simultaneous information integration across the entire input context improves performance. The downside, however, is that one can't use it directly to perform sequence generation, which requires an iterative process. It's the model surrounding the attention layer (e.g., the decoder in the case of Transformer) which contributes the autoregressive behavior by incorporating output embedding of previous time-steps.

Now, let’s look at some practical examples within TensorFlow’s Keras API that highlight this non-autoregressive nature.

**Example 1: Basic Multi-Head Attention Usage**

This snippet demonstrates how a multi-head attention layer can be used in a sequential context. Although it is used in a model, the layer itself doesn't introduce any autoregressive behavior:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MultiHeadAttention, Embedding, Input, LayerNormalization, Dense, Add
from tensorflow.keras import Model
import numpy as np

# Define parameters
seq_length = 10
embedding_dim = 128
num_heads = 4

# Define the inputs
inputs = Input(shape=(seq_length, embedding_dim))

# Define multi-head attention layer
attention_layer = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embedding_dim)

# Apply multi-head attention layer
attention_output = attention_layer(inputs, inputs)


# A simple feed forward network that also includes residual connections and layer norm
def feed_forward_network(x, d_model, d_ff):
    ff_output = Dense(d_ff, activation='relu')(x)
    ff_output = Dense(d_model)(ff_output)
    x = Add()([x, ff_output])
    x = LayerNormalization()(x)
    return x


ff_output = feed_forward_network(attention_output, embedding_dim, 256)

# Create a model
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=ff_output)

# Generate random input
input_data = np.random.rand(1, seq_length, embedding_dim).astype(np.float32)

# Get output
output_data = model(input_data)

print("Output shape:", output_data.shape) # Output shape: (1, 10, 128)
```
The output shape is consistent with the input shape after the attention layer and following the feed forward layers, confirming parallel processing of all positions, and no autoregressive behavior.  The attention layer takes the entire sequence as input and produces the entire sequence as output without iterating or feeding back any result as input to the next step. Each of the 10 tokens in the output was calculated without any knowledge of other tokens at the previous step.

**Example 2: Masked Attention and Autoregressivity**

While the multi-head attention layer is non-autoregressive by default, masking can be introduced. However, the masking is imposed from outside the multi-head attention layer. The layer itself is not modified to generate sequentially, rather the data it receives has been altered using a mask. The following code shows the application of a causal mask.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MultiHeadAttention, Embedding, Input, LayerNormalization, Dense, Add
from tensorflow.keras import Model
import numpy as np

# Define parameters
seq_length = 10
embedding_dim = 128
num_heads = 4

# Define the inputs
inputs = Input(shape=(seq_length, embedding_dim))

# Define multi-head attention layer
attention_layer = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embedding_dim)

# Generate a causal mask
def create_causal_mask(seq_len):
  mask = 1 - tf.linalg.band_part(tf.ones((seq_len, seq_len)), -1, 0)
  return mask

causal_mask = create_causal_mask(seq_length)

# Apply multi-head attention layer with causal mask
attention_output = attention_layer(inputs, inputs, attention_mask=causal_mask)

# A simple feed forward network that also includes residual connections and layer norm
def feed_forward_network(x, d_model, d_ff):
    ff_output = Dense(d_ff, activation='relu')(x)
    ff_output = Dense(d_model)(ff_output)
    x = Add()([x, ff_output])
    x = LayerNormalization()(x)
    return x


ff_output = feed_forward_network(attention_output, embedding_dim, 256)

# Create a model
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=ff_output)

# Generate random input
input_data = np.random.rand(1, seq_length, embedding_dim).astype(np.float32)

# Get output
output_data = model(input_data)

print("Output shape:", output_data.shape) # Output shape: (1, 10, 128)
```

Here, a causal mask is applied before inputting data to the multi-head attention layer, which forces each output position to only attend to the past. The *attention_mask* parameter is used to enforce the causal masking by forcing the multi-head attention layer to consider only prior elements when computing the attention weights. However, even with the mask, the multi-head attention layer itself is not fundamentally autoregressive. It merely processes the modified input within its vectorized calculations. The autoregressive behavior is an effect created by this masking. The data is still processed in parallel within the layer. Each position in the output still attends to all *available* positions given the mask in single pass.

**Example 3: Integrating with an Autoregressive Decoder**

This code shows that to create an autoregressive model, we must integrate the multi-head attention layer into a larger model, such as in a Transformer decoder:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MultiHeadAttention, Embedding, Input, LayerNormalization, Dense, Add
from tensorflow.keras import Model
import numpy as np


# Define parameters
seq_length = 10
embedding_dim = 128
num_heads = 4
vocab_size = 100

# Define input layers
input_token_ids = Input(shape=(seq_length,))
embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)
inputs = embedding_layer(input_token_ids)

# Define multi-head attention layer
attention_layer = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embedding_dim)

# Generate a causal mask
def create_causal_mask(seq_len):
  mask = 1 - tf.linalg.band_part(tf.ones((seq_len, seq_len)), -1, 0)
  return mask

causal_mask = create_causal_mask(seq_length)

# Apply multi-head attention layer with causal mask
attention_output = attention_layer(inputs, inputs, attention_mask=causal_mask)


# A simple feed forward network that also includes residual connections and layer norm
def feed_forward_network(x, d_model, d_ff):
    ff_output = Dense(d_ff, activation='relu')(x)
    ff_output = Dense(d_model)(ff_output)
    x = Add()([x, ff_output])
    x = LayerNormalization()(x)
    return x

ff_output = feed_forward_network(attention_output, embedding_dim, 256)

output = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(ff_output)

# Create a model
model = Model(inputs=input_token_ids, outputs=output)

# Generate random input
input_data = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(1, seq_length))

# Get output
output_data = model(input_data)

print("Output shape:", output_data.shape) # Output shape: (1, 10, 100)

```
The model takes integer ids for tokens and produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary. To perform autoregressive generation, one would need to call this model repeatedly in a loop, feeding the previously generated token back into the model. The model itself, built using the multi-head attention layer, is not autoregressive. The autoregressive behavior is generated by repeatedly calling this model.

**Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding of attention mechanisms and transformer architectures, I recommend consulting resources that focus on the following topics: *The Annotated Transformer* and accompanying blogs or texts which outline the architecture of Transformer models, including the decoder's operation, the attention mechanism, and masking techniques. Additional references focused on sequence-to-sequence models will provide a broader view of different approaches to sequence processing with a view towards autoregressive models. Finally, specific documentation within TensorFlow for models with attention, including examples, will help illustrate the usage patterns and architecture details.

In conclusion, while the multi-head attention layer is a fundamental component of many models, it is not, by itself, an autoregressive operation. The key distinction lies in the fact that it processes the entire input sequence simultaneously, making parallel computations possible. Autoregressive behavior can be achieved using masks or by incorporating the multi-head attention layer into a larger model such as the decoding block of the Transformer, but the layer itself remains inherently parallel.
