The behavior of `tf.signal.rfft2d` in the context of centered kernel convolution is fundamentally driven by its efficient handling of real-valued input signals in the frequency domain. Specifically, `tf.signal.rfft2d` computes the *real-valued* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a 2D signal, leveraging the inherent Hermitian symmetry of the transform for real inputs to reduce computational cost and memory consumption. This differs from the standard complex-valued FFT, which would produce redundant data. Understanding this is key to accurately performing convolution in the frequency domain when dealing with images, audio, or similar data.

The core idea of convolution through FFTs is that spatial convolution becomes point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. To perform centered kernel convolution using `tf.signal.rfft2d`, the kernel, which is typically small and centered, also needs to be transformed using `tf.signal.rfft2d`. Because convolution is commutative, it does not matter which input signal or kernel is the operand of the first transform. However, one signal is transformed only once while the others will be transformed each time a different kernel is used for convolution. The frequency-domain representation from `tf.signal.rfft2d` implicitly accounts for the shift induced by a centered kernel. Therefore, a spatial shift of the kernel prior to transformation is not needed. The resulting multiplication in the frequency domain produces a transformed signal that incorporates the convolution effect. The final step involves performing an inverse FFT to return to the spatial domain. However, since the original transform was a real-valued FFT (`tf.signal.rfft2d`), we must use `tf.signal.irfft2d` for the inverse operation, which will also return a real-valued signal. Crucially, the output of `tf.signal.irfft2d` will be of the same size as the original input of `tf.signal.rfft2d` which may cause difficulties when the kernel is larger than 1. We must compensate for this behavior.

Let’s consider a practical example. Suppose we have an input image and a Gaussian kernel that we wish to use in a convolution. The first step is transforming both using `tf.signal.rfft2d`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example input image (for demonstration purposes)
input_image = tf.constant(np.random.rand(128, 128), dtype=tf.float32)

# Gaussian kernel with a size of (15, 15)
kernel_size = 15
sigma = 2.0
x = tf.range(-kernel_size // 2 + 1, kernel_size // 2 + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.range(-kernel_size // 2 + 1, kernel_size // 2 + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
xx, yy = tf.meshgrid(x, y)
gaussian_kernel = tf.exp(-(xx**2 + yy**2) / (2 * sigma**2))

# Perform a centered kernel convolution in the frequency domain
input_fft = tf.signal.rfft2d(input_image)
kernel_fft = tf.signal.rfft2d(tf.cast(gaussian_kernel, dtype=tf.float32))
# The zero padding that follows is essential when the kernel is smaller than the input
padded_kernel_fft = tf.pad(kernel_fft, [[0, input_image.shape[0] - kernel_fft.shape[0]], [0, input_image.shape[1] - kernel_fft.shape[1]]])
convolved_fft = input_fft * padded_kernel_fft # point-wise multiplication
convolved_image = tf.signal.irfft2d(convolved_fft)

print(f"Shape of convolved image: {convolved_image.shape}")
```

In this example, we generate a random image and a centered Gaussian kernel.  We then transform both to the frequency domain using `tf.signal.rfft2d`. Before multiplication in the frequency domain, the kernel is zero padded, matching the size of the input. After that multiplication, the inverse transform, `tf.signal.irfft2d`, provides the spatial representation of the convolved image. Note that the shape of the `convolved_image` is identical to the input `input_image` since the inverse transform takes this shape from the original transform.

Let's consider the impact of padding. When transforming the kernel with `tf.signal.rfft2d`, its size will typically be much smaller than the input signal. The `tf.signal.irfft2d` function requires that the frequency domain representation of the kernel be the same shape as the result of the `tf.signal.rfft2d` applied to the input. This is achieved by zero-padding the smaller kernel to be the same size as the larger input.  Without this padding, direct multiplication in the frequency domain would lead to incorrect results, as the frequency representation of the convolved signal would be truncated. Below is an example illustrating the result of this error:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example input image (for demonstration purposes)
input_image = tf.constant(np.random.rand(128, 128), dtype=tf.float32)

# Gaussian kernel with a size of (15, 15)
kernel_size = 15
sigma = 2.0
x = tf.range(-kernel_size // 2 + 1, kernel_size // 2 + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.range(-kernel_size // 2 + 1, kernel_size // 2 + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
xx, yy = tf.meshgrid(x, y)
gaussian_kernel = tf.exp(-(xx**2 + yy**2) / (2 * sigma**2))

# Perform a centered kernel convolution in the frequency domain
input_fft = tf.signal.rfft2d(input_image)
kernel_fft = tf.signal.rfft2d(tf.cast(gaussian_kernel, dtype=tf.float32))

# No zero padding occurs here.
convolved_fft = input_fft * kernel_fft # point-wise multiplication - ERROR!
convolved_image = tf.signal.irfft2d(convolved_fft) # ERROR!

print(f"Shape of convolved image: {convolved_image.shape}")
```
In this case, the shapes of `input_fft` and `kernel_fft` are different, causing TensorFlow to interpret the multiplication in a peculiar manner. The error is silent, but the result will be incorrect. The output from `tf.signal.irfft2d` will still have the same shape as `input_image`. It’s critical to maintain consistent dimensions in the frequency domain by padding the smaller kernel as described in the first code snippet.

Finally, it's important to recognize that using the FFT for convolution, while efficient for large kernels and input sizes, introduces a subtle difference in the handling of boundary conditions compared to a standard spatial convolution.  The frequency-domain implementation implicitly employs a periodic boundary condition due to the nature of the FFT.  This means that when the kernel's effect would extend beyond the boundaries of the input, the result wraps around to the opposite side. In situations where this behavior is undesirable, the input may need to be padded with zeros or by mirroring to mitigate edge artifacts. Here, a simple example with padding of the input prior to transformation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example input image (for demonstration purposes)
input_image = tf.constant(np.random.rand(128, 128), dtype=tf.float32)

# Gaussian kernel with a size of (15, 15)
kernel_size = 15
sigma = 2.0
x = tf.range(-kernel_size // 2 + 1, kernel_size // 2 + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.range(-kernel_size // 2 + 1, kernel_size // 2 + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
xx, yy = tf.meshgrid(x, y)
gaussian_kernel = tf.exp(-(xx**2 + yy**2) / (2 * sigma**2))

# Pad the input to reduce edge artifacts
padding = kernel_size // 2
padded_input = tf.pad(input_image, [[padding, padding], [padding, padding]])

# Perform a centered kernel convolution in the frequency domain
input_fft = tf.signal.rfft2d(padded_input)
kernel_fft = tf.signal.rfft2d(tf.cast(gaussian_kernel, dtype=tf.float32))

padded_kernel_fft = tf.pad(kernel_fft, [[0, padded_input.shape[0] - kernel_fft.shape[0]], [0, padded_input.shape[1] - kernel_fft.shape[1]]])
convolved_fft = input_fft * padded_kernel_fft
convolved_image = tf.signal.irfft2d(convolved_fft)

# Remove added padding after convolution
output = convolved_image[padding:-padding, padding:-padding]

print(f"Shape of convolved image: {output.shape}")
```

In summary, `tf.signal.rfft2d` is critical for efficiently computing the frequency representation of real-valued signals for convolution.  To correctly apply a centered kernel convolution in the frequency domain:

1.  Transform both the input signal and kernel using `tf.signal.rfft2d`.
2.  Pad the transformed kernel to have the same dimensions as the transformed signal.
3.  Perform point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain.
4.  Use `tf.signal.irfft2d` to inverse transform the result back into spatial domain.
5.  Manage boundary conditions by padding the input signal prior to transformation and removing padding after the convolution, if needed.

Further information on the mathematical underpinnings of the FFT and the theory of frequency domain signal processing can be found in textbooks on digital signal processing.  TensorFlow's official documentation provides more detailed explanations of the `tf.signal` module's functionality, including examples and the impact of padding.  Finally, research papers exploring efficient convolution techniques for deep learning architectures offer additional insight into using frequency domain techniques for optimization.
