The inconsistency observed with `tf.control_dependencies` in seemingly identical code stems primarily from the non-deterministic nature of TensorFlow's graph execution, specifically concerning the ordering of operations within a graph when control dependencies are involved.  My experience working on large-scale TensorFlow models for natural language processing highlighted this issue repeatedly.  While the code might appear identical, subtle differences in the underlying graph construction, particularly concerning the execution order of operations outside the control dependency context, can lead to varied outcomes. This is because `tf.control_dependencies` only guarantees that the dependent operations execute *after* the controlled operations, not necessarily in a specific order relative to other independent operations.


This problem is often exacerbated when working with asynchronous operations or within complex computational graphs.  Consider scenarios where multiple threads or processes interact with the same TensorFlow graph.  Even slight variations in thread scheduling can affect the order in which operations are added to the graph, ultimately altering the final result despite the apparent sameness of the code.  Furthermore, the use of placeholders or feeding data dynamically into the graph can introduce further inconsistencies, as the graph's structure may vary slightly depending on the input data.

The core principle to understand is that `tf.control_dependencies` manipulates the *graph* structure, not the execution order directly.  The runtime execution order is determined by TensorFlow's optimizer, which seeks an efficient execution plan.  This plan isn't guaranteed to be consistent across different runs, even with identical code, due to the factors mentioned above.


Let's illustrate this with examples.  Assume we have a simple scenario where we want to ensure an operation `op_b` executes only after `op_a`.


**Example 1: Simple Control Dependency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='a')
    b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='b')

    op_a = tf.compat.v1.assign(a, 10)
    op_b = tf.compat.v1.assign(b, a + 5)

    with tf.control_dependencies([op_a]):
        op_c = tf.compat.v1.identity(op_b) # op_c depends on op_b, which depends on op_a

    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    result_c = sess.run(op_c)
    print(f"Result of op_c (after op_a): {result_c}") # Expected Output: 15
```

This example demonstrates the intended behavior.  `op_b` (and consequently `op_c`) only executes after `op_a` is complete due to the control dependency.


**Example 2: Introducing Non-Determinism**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='a')
    b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='b')
    c = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='c')

    op_a = tf.compat.v1.assign(a, 10)
    op_b = tf.compat.v1.assign(b, a + 5)
    op_c = tf.compat.v1.assign(c, a + b) #Independent of control dependency

    with tf.control_dependencies([op_a]):
        op_d = tf.compat.v1.identity(op_b)

    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    #Introducing potential non-determinism through a sleep
    time.sleep(0.1) #This sleep might cause unpredictable runtime behavior
    result_c, result_d = sess.run([op_c, op_d])
    print(f"Result of op_c (independent): {result_c}") # Potentially inconsistent
    print(f"Result of op_d (dependent): {result_d}") # Consistent: 15
```


Here, the introduction of `op_c`, which doesn't depend on `op_a`, creates an element of non-determinism.  The `time.sleep()` simulates an external influence; this may affect the optimizer’s choice of execution plan, leading to `op_c` possibly executing before `op_a` completes in certain runs, even though they appear unrelated in the code. The `op_d` result remains consistent, highlighting that the control dependency is localized.


**Example 3:  Complex Graph with Multiple Dependencies**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='a')
    b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='b')
    c = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='c')
    d = tf.compat.v1.Variable(0, name='d')

    op_a = tf.compat.v1.assign(a, 10)
    op_b = tf.compat.v1.assign(b, a * 2)
    op_c = tf.compat.v1.assign(c, b + 5)
    op_d = tf.compat.v1.assign(d, c * 3)


    with tf.control_dependencies([op_a, op_b]):
      op_e = tf.compat.v1.identity(op_c) # Depends on op_c which depends on op_a and op_b

    with tf.control_dependencies([op_c]):
        op_f = tf.compat.v1.identity(op_d) # Depends on op_d, which depends on op_c

    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    result_e, result_f = sess.run([op_e, op_f])
    print(f"Result of op_e: {result_e}") # Consistent: 25
    print(f"Result of op_f: {result_f}") #Consistent: 75

```

This demonstrates a more complex scenario. The nested dependencies correctly enforce the execution order. However, if other independent operations were introduced, similar non-deterministic behaviour, as illustrated in Example 2, could surface.

To mitigate inconsistencies, consider these strategies:

1. **Minimize External Influences:** Reduce external factors that can affect the execution plan, like asynchronous operations or lengthy pauses within the execution flow.

2. **Explicit Sequencing:** Use explicit TensorFlow control flow constructs like `tf.group` to enforce a specific execution order whenever possible. `tf.group` executes operations concurrently but guarantees completion before proceeding.

3. **Graph Debugging Tools:** Utilize TensorFlow's debugging tools to visualize the graph’s structure and identify potential points of inconsistency. This allows for a thorough analysis of the execution flow and detection of unintended dependencies.


Remember that resolving inconsistencies often necessitates understanding the complete graph structure and the interaction between different operations, not just the code snippet containing `tf.control_dependencies`.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (specifically sections on graph construction and execution).  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a focus on TensorFlow's inner workings.  Advanced TensorFlow tutorials covering graph optimization and debugging.  A solid understanding of concurrency and parallel processing concepts will also prove helpful.
