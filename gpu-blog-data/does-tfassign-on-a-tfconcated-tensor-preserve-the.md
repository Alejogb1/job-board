Within TensorFlow’s computational graph, the interplay between tensor concatenation (`tf.concat`) and variable assignment (`tf.assign`) requires careful consideration of how the graph’s structure and variable attributes are modified. Specifically, directly assigning a value to the output of a `tf.concat` operation, even if its inputs are variables, does *not* preserve the original variable nature of those inputs. The concatenation operation produces a new, independent tensor, effectively severing its direct relationship to the source variables. Consequently, `tf.assign` when targeted at the concatenation output, will reassign the output tensor not modify the contributing input variables.

This behavior stems from the inherent immutability of tensors in TensorFlow. A tensor, once defined, represents a static computational result. `tf.concat`, when executed, generates a new tensor by combining the inputs into a single entity. If those inputs are themselves variables, their values *are* copied into the new tensor’s initial state during computation, but the new tensor has no inherent linkage back to the original `tf.Variable` objects. The `tf.assign` operation then, simply writes a new value to *this* concatenated tensor, ignoring the fact that this tensor's data originated, in part, from existing variables. The variables remain unchanged.

To illustrate this, consider a hypothetical scenario where I am working on a simple model involving feature embeddings, a task I have encountered frequently in my work with recommendation systems. I might have two embedding variables representing different user segments, each initialized with some random values. Suppose I wish to concatenate them for subsequent processing, then update this joined embedding using assignment. The following code demonstrates this common pitfall:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create two variables representing embeddings
var1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 10)), name='var1')
var2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 10)), name='var2')

# Concatenate the variables along axis 1
concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([var1, var2], axis=1)

# Assign a new value to the concatenated tensor
new_value = tf.random.normal((5, 20))
assignment_op = tf.assign(concatenated_tensor, new_value)


with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    print("Initial var1 values:\n", sess.run(var1))
    print("Initial var2 values:\n", sess.run(var2))
    print("Initial concatenated tensor values:\n", sess.run(concatenated_tensor))

    sess.run(assignment_op)  # Executing the assignment

    print("\nvar1 values after assignment:\n", sess.run(var1))
    print("var2 values after assignment:\n", sess.run(var2))
    print("Concatenated tensor values after assignment:\n", sess.run(concatenated_tensor))
```

In this first code example, after initialization, `var1` and `var2` hold random initial values and the initial value of the `concatenated_tensor` is the horizontal combination of these two. When `tf.assign` modifies the `concatenated_tensor` by providing it with `new_value`, `var1` and `var2` *do not change*. This confirms that the assignment is made only to the output of the `tf.concat` operation, leaving the initial variables unaffected. The immutability of the individual tensors within a TensorFlow graph is evident here. The assignment creates a new value for the `concatenated_tensor` without any impact on its constitutive variables. I've made this error during large scale A/B testing simulations on multiple occasions and the debugging process is cumbersome.

To modify the original variables, one needs to specifically target them.  For example, if my intention is to update the values of `var1` and `var2` after they've been concatenated, I would need to calculate an update for them separately then `tf.assign` them directly. This avoids the pitfall of attempting an update on the concatenation result:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create two variables representing embeddings
var1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 10)), name='var1')
var2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 10)), name='var2')

# Concatenate the variables along axis 1
concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([var1, var2], axis=1)

# Generate an update value that is the same shape as the concatenated tensor.
new_value = tf.random.normal((5, 20))

# Split the update value into parts corresponding to the original variables.
new_value_1, new_value_2 = tf.split(new_value, num_or_size_splits=2, axis=1)

# Assignment operations for the constituent variables, var1 and var2
assignment_op_1 = tf.assign(var1, new_value_1)
assignment_op_2 = tf.assign(var2, new_value_2)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    print("Initial var1 values:\n", sess.run(var1))
    print("Initial var2 values:\n", sess.run(var2))
    print("Initial concatenated tensor values:\n", sess.run(concatenated_tensor))

    sess.run([assignment_op_1,assignment_op_2])  # Executing the assignments

    print("\nvar1 values after assignment:\n", sess.run(var1))
    print("var2 values after assignment:\n", sess.run(var2))
    print("Concatenated tensor values after assignment:\n", sess.run(concatenated_tensor))

```

In the second example, instead of targeting the concatenated output, I explicitly use `tf.split` to break the update value back into pieces and then assign the corresponding pieces to `var1` and `var2`, respectively. This time, the change is reflected on the variable's values rather than simply the concatenated output value. The final concatenated value also reflects the updated variable values. I have found this pattern necessary when implementing techniques like differential privacy on embeddings, where updating variables individually after aggregation is necessary.

Finally, in cases where one needs to dynamically update only a specific portion of a variable, the `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` operation is often beneficial. This powerful function allows the selective update of parts of a variable based on indices without having to reassign the entire variable. In this third example, I show how to achieve an update similar to our previous case using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create two variables representing embeddings
var1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 10)), name='var1')
var2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 10)), name='var2')


# Concatenate the variables along axis 1
concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([var1, var2], axis=1)

# Generate an update value that is the same shape as the concatenated tensor.
new_value = tf.random.normal((5, 20))

# Split the update value into parts corresponding to the original variables.
new_value_1, new_value_2 = tf.split(new_value, num_or_size_splits=2, axis=1)

# Create indices for updating each portion
indices_var1 = tf.reshape(tf.range(0, tf.size(var1)), shape=(tf.size(var1),1))
indices_var2 = tf.reshape(tf.range(0, tf.size(var2)), shape=(tf.size(var2),1))

# Perform scatter update on the original variables
scatter_op_1 = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(var1, indices_var1, tf.reshape(new_value_1, shape=(tf.size(new_value_1),)))
scatter_op_2 = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(var2, indices_var2, tf.reshape(new_value_2, shape=(tf.size(new_value_2),)))


with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    print("Initial var1 values:\n", sess.run(var1))
    print("Initial var2 values:\n", sess.run(var2))
    print("Initial concatenated tensor values:\n", sess.run(concatenated_tensor))

    sess.run([scatter_op_1, scatter_op_2]) # Executing the assignments

    print("\nvar1 values after scatter_nd_update:\n", sess.run(var1))
    print("var2 values after scatter_nd_update:\n", sess.run(var2))
    print("Concatenated tensor values after scatter_nd_update:\n", sess.run(concatenated_tensor))
```

Here, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` is used to modify elements of `var1` and `var2` independently. Note that in order for this approach to work, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` requires the updates to be flattened to a 1D tensor. The updated values of `var1` and `var2` are then combined to form an updated `concatenated_tensor` upon recalculation. This operation is especially useful when dealing with sparse updates. For example, when working with embedding layers where only a small portion of the layer is updated during a training step.

For further exploration of these concepts, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation. The guides on variables and tensor manipulation will provide a more in-depth understanding. Additionally, books covering advanced TensorFlow techniques, particularly those focusing on computational graphs and custom operations, can offer valuable insights. Also, various online courses provide hands-on training with TensorFlow and related practical application considerations.
