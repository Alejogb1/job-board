Yes, OpenGL can handle 24-bit Bayer tile data on the GPU, though it requires careful setup and consideration of how this non-standard format interacts with OpenGL's typical processing pipeline. The key is to understand that OpenGL doesn't inherently understand Bayer patterns; it works with data as textures or vertex attributes. Therefore, handling Bayer data involves initial loading of raw data, a manipulation of this data before or within the shader pipeline, and, most critically, demosaicing, which converts the single-channel Bayer pattern to a full color image. I've wrestled with this in a custom astronomy imaging pipeline where real-time Bayer processing was essential.

The most direct approach involves treating the 24-bit Bayer data as three separate 8-bit channels, carefully packed and then unpacked on the GPU. This isn’t as straightforward as RGB, since the channels aren't R, G, and B, but rather represent different color samples at different positions within a regular grid. When dealing with 24-bit data, you have three 8-bit components effectively packed end-to-end, and not necessarily in a way that aligns perfectly to byte-aligned RGB representations. Therefore, a critical step is unpacking this correctly into a structure that OpenGL can work with. Usually, I find this involves treating it as a single channel texture in a shader and then doing explicit channel extraction, followed by demosaicing.

Here's an illustration of how to approach this. First, we'll need to pack our 24-bit data into a format that is consumable by OpenGL. Assume your 24-bit Bayer image has already been loaded into a `std::vector<uint8_t>` named `bayerData`. Each 3-byte grouping represents a single sensor site sample. We create an OpenGL texture object from it:

```cpp
GLuint textureID;
glGenTextures(1, &textureID);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureID);

// Assuming width and height of the Bayer image are available
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_R8UI, width, height, 0, GL_RED_INTEGER, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, bayerData.data());

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
```

In this snippet, the core function is `glTexImage2D`. Notice we specify `GL_R8UI`, which means we're treating the texture as having a single, 8-bit unsigned integer channel. The `GL_RED_INTEGER` and `GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE` arguments further specify the format of the data we are passing. The key takeaway here is that the raw 24-bit bytes are loaded into the GPU's texture memory sequentially, 8-bits at a time as if it was a monochrome image. The layout is not interpreted by OpenGL at this stage, but will be inside the pixel shader.

Next, the pixel shader becomes critical. We need to unpack the 24-bit bytes into the correct color channel based on the Bayer pattern. A basic example, focusing on a RGGB pattern, would look like this:

```glsl
#version 330 core

in vec2 TexCoords;
out vec4 FragColor;

uniform sampler2D bayerTexture;

void main()
{
    ivec2 texelCoord = ivec2(TexCoords * textureSize(bayerTexture, 0));
    uint rawValue = texelFetch(bayerTexture, texelCoord, 0).r;

    // Unpack 24-bit byte to three 8-bit values
    uint val1 = rawValue; // Most significant 8 bits,
    uint val2 = rawValue; // Next most significant 8 bits
    uint val3 = rawValue; // Least significant 8 bits

    // Determine color based on row and column parity (RGGB)
    float r = 0.0;
    float g = 0.0;
    float b = 0.0;

    if ((texelCoord.y % 2 == 0) && (texelCoord.x % 2 == 0)) {
        r = float(val1) / 255.0;
        g = 0.0;
        b = 0.0;

    } else if ((texelCoord.y % 2 == 0) && (texelCoord.x % 2 != 0)) {
        r = 0.0;
        g = float(val2) / 255.0;
        b = 0.0;
    } else if ((texelCoord.y % 2 != 0) && (texelCoord.x % 2 == 0)) {
        r = 0.0;
        g = float(val2) / 255.0;
        b = 0.0;
    } else {
        r = 0.0;
        g = 0.0;
        b = float(val3) / 255.0;
    }


    FragColor = vec4(r,g,b,1.0);
}
```

This shader is a significant simplification, and is just for demonstration purposes. The crux of the problem, and indeed, why direct handling of 24-bit Bayer data in OpenGL is complicated, is that you need to manually reconstruct colors based on the Bayer pattern. This snippet simply selects the appropriate packed byte depending on location in the texture. In a practical scenario, `val1`, `val2`, and `val3` need to have the correct component extracted from the packed 24-bits (using bitwise operations or data structures), and then the if-else statements also need to be tailored to match the specific pattern used by your sensor.

The shader demonstrates how to extract data for a RGGB bayer pattern, but importantly it does *not* perform demosaicing. The next step would involve applying a demosaicing algorithm in the fragment shader. A simple nearest-neighbor interpolation is trivial, but introduces significant artifacts. High-quality demosaicing algorithms, such as bilinear or even more advanced adaptive approaches, add significant complexity but are necessary for good image quality. Here’s a further shader example that attempts to perform simple bilinear interpolation on a RGGB pattern for illustrative purposes:

```glsl
#version 330 core

in vec2 TexCoords;
out vec4 FragColor;

uniform sampler2D bayerTexture;
uniform int width;
uniform int height;

float sampleBayer(ivec2 coord, int offset){
  if(coord.x < 0 || coord.y < 0 || coord.x >= width || coord.y >= height){
    return 0.0;
  }

  uint rawValue = texelFetch(bayerTexture, coord, 0).r;
  uint val = 0;
  if (offset == 0){
      val = rawValue & 0xFFu;
  }else if (offset == 8){
      val = (rawValue >> 8u) & 0xFFu;
  }else if(offset == 16){
      val = (rawValue >> 16u) & 0xFFu;
  }

  return float(val) / 255.0;
}

void main()
{
    ivec2 texelCoord = ivec2(TexCoords * vec2(width,height));


    float r = 0.0;
    float g = 0.0;
    float b = 0.0;

    if ((texelCoord.y % 2 == 0) && (texelCoord.x % 2 == 0)) { // Red Pixel
      r = sampleBayer(texelCoord,0);
      g = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,1), 8) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,-1), 8) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,0), 8) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,0), 8)) / 4.0;
      b = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,1), 16) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,1), 16) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,-1), 16) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,-1), 16)) / 4.0;


    } else if ((texelCoord.y % 2 == 0) && (texelCoord.x % 2 != 0)) { // Green Pixel
      r = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,0), 0) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,0), 0)) / 2.0;
      g = sampleBayer(texelCoord,8);
      b = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,1), 16) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,-1), 16)) / 2.0;
    } else if ((texelCoord.y % 2 != 0) && (texelCoord.x % 2 == 0)) { // Green Pixel
       r = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,0), 0) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,0), 0)) / 2.0;
      g = sampleBayer(texelCoord,8);
       b = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,1), 16) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,-1), 16)) / 2.0;
    } else { // Blue Pixel
      r = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,1), 0) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,1), 0) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,-1), 0) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,-1), 0)) / 4.0;
      g = (sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,1), 8) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(0,-1), 8) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(1,0), 8) + sampleBayer(texelCoord + ivec2(-1,0), 8)) / 4.0;
      b = sampleBayer(texelCoord,16);

    }
    FragColor = vec4(r,g,b,1.0);
}
```
This updated fragment shader calculates the red, green and blue components by averaging adjacent values, based on a simple bilinear approach.  The `sampleBayer` function takes a coordinate, and an offset which specifies the byte-location to read from within the 24 bit value, and performs bounds checking. This still represents only a very basic demoisaicing algorithm, and will exhibit visual artifacts, but highlights the steps that are needed.

In summary, while OpenGL itself has no direct understanding of Bayer patterns, handling 24-bit Bayer data on the GPU is absolutely feasible. It requires correctly mapping the raw data into a suitable texture format (typically a single channel integer format), unpacking the Bayer information in a shader, and then implementing a demosaicing algorithm within the fragment shader pipeline. For a more rigorous understanding of demosaicing algorithms, research topics such as bilinear interpolation, gradient-based demosaicing, and frequency-domain methods are recommended. Additionally, exploring image processing literature focused on color filter arrays and their respective reconstruction techniques will also prove beneficial. Finally, examining existing image processing libraries with GPU capabilities can also provide insightful approaches, although explicit code for this is outside the scope of this discussion.
