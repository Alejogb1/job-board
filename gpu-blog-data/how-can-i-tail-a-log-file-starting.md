The challenge of selectively tailing a log file from a designated line hinges on efficient file access and manipulation techniques.  My experience working on high-throughput logging systems for financial transaction processing revealed that naive approaches, like counting lines from the beginning, are computationally expensive for large files.  Optimized solutions leverage file system features, specifically seeking to a given byte offset, thereby avoiding unnecessary line-by-line scans.

**1. Understanding the Approach**

The core principle is to determine the byte offset corresponding to the desired starting line.  This avoids the costly iteration through preceding lines. We can achieve this using `seek()` functionality available in most file I/O libraries. However, the accuracy of this method depends on the consistency of line endings within the log file.  Inconsistent line endings (a mixture of LF, CRLF, or other variations) can lead to imprecise positioning.  Therefore, robust solutions usually incorporate error handling and potential line-by-line adjustments after the initial `seek()`.

**2. Code Examples**

The following examples demonstrate this approach using Python, Perl, and Bash.  Each example assumes the log file is named `mylogfile.log` and the target line number is 1000.  Error handling, crucial for production environments, is incorporated.

**2.1 Python Implementation**

```python
def tail_from_line(filename, line_number):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            # Attempt to seek directly to approximate byte offset
            f.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to end of file
            file_size = f.tell()
            f.seek(0)  # Reset to beginning

            # Simple approximation: average line length
            avg_line_len = 100  # Adjust based on log file characteristics
            approx_offset = (line_number - 1) * avg_line_len

            if approx_offset > file_size:
                raise ValueError("Line number exceeds file size")

            f.seek(approx_offset)

            current_line = 0
            for line in f:
                current_line += 1
                if current_line >= line_number:
                    yield line

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = "mylogfile.log"
    line_number = 1000
    for line in tail_from_line(filename, line_number):
        print(line, end='')
```

This Python code first attempts to estimate the byte offset. The `avg_line_len` parameter is a crucial tuning factor; a more accurate estimate would require prior analysis of the log file's line length distribution.  The `yield` keyword makes this function a generator, improving memory efficiency for extremely large log files. The robust error handling addresses potential file not found or line number out-of-bounds errors.


**2.2 Perl Implementation**

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

sub tail_from_line {
    my ($filename, $line_number) = @_;

    open(my $fh, "<", $filename) or die "Could not open file '$filename' $!";

    #seek to approximate position, handle errors
    seek($fh, ($line_number -1) * 100, 0) or die "Seek failed: $!";

    my $current_line = 0;
    while(my $line = <$fh>){
        $current_line++;
        if($current_line >= $line_number){
            print $line;
        }
    }

    close $fh;
}

tail_from_line("mylogfile.log", 1000);
```

The Perl code utilizes Perl's built-in file handling capabilities. Similar to the Python example, it employs a simple line length approximation for the initial seek. Error checking is integrated using `die` to handle file opening and seek failures.  This approach is concise and leverages Perl's strengths in text processing.


**2.3 Bash Implementation**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename="mylogfile.log"
line_number=1000

#Approximation using head and tail
head -n "$line_number" "$filename" | tail -n +1
```

The Bash script uses a combination of `head` and `tail` commands.  `head -n "$line_number"` extracts the first `$line_number` lines, and `tail -n +1` then removes the header lines, effectively starting from the specified line.  This solution is straightforward but lacks the fine-grained control and error handling of the previous examples. Its efficiency depends heavily on the performance of the `head` and `tail` utilities, which may not be optimized for very large files.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further study, I suggest consulting advanced file I/O tutorials specific to your chosen programming language.  Understanding concepts like buffered I/O and memory mapping can significantly impact performance when dealing with massive log files. Text processing and regular expression resources are valuable for handling complex log formats and filtering specific events.  Finally, exploring operating system-specific tools like `sed` and `awk` can provide alternative approaches for log manipulation.  Understanding the strengths and limitations of each method will enable choosing the most appropriate technique for various scenarios.  Always prioritize robust error handling and performance considerations, particularly in high-volume log processing systems.
