The crux of visualizing intermediate convolutional layers in a Keras CNN lies in accessing the feature maps generated at each layer and then transforming them into a visually interpretable format.  My experience debugging complex CNN architectures for medical image analysis has highlighted the critical role of this visualization in understanding model behavior and identifying potential issues like overfitting or insufficient feature extraction.  Directly accessing these intermediate activations requires leveraging Keras' functional API or model subclassing, avoiding the limitations of the Sequential API for complex visualization tasks.


**1.  Clear Explanation of the Process:**

Visualizing intermediate convolutional layers involves several steps. First, we need to modify the Keras model to expose the activations of the desired layers. This is achieved by defining the model using the functional API, allowing us to specify output nodes for each layer of interest.  Each layer's output represents a tensor containing the feature maps.  These tensors are multi-dimensional arrays where each dimension corresponds to: batch size, height, width, and the number of feature maps.  Therefore, for visualization, we select a specific image from the batch (index 0, typically) and iterate through the feature maps. Each feature map is then processed for visualization.  This typically involves rescaling the pixel values to the range [0, 255] for display as grayscale or color images.  More sophisticated techniques might involve applying techniques like gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) for highlighting regions of importance within the feature maps, but that is outside the scope of this response.  Finally, these processed feature maps are displayed using libraries like Matplotlib.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using the Functional API for Layer Access**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Define the model using the Functional API
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)) # Example input shape
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
layer1_output = x # Access the output of the first convolutional layer
x = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
layer2_output = x # Access the output of the second convolutional layer
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)

# Compile and train the model (omitted for brevity - replace with your training loop)
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)

# Access and visualize intermediate layer activations
img_index = 0 # Select a single image from the batch
intermediate_layer_model1 = keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer1_output)
intermediate_layer_model2 = keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer2_output)

intermediate_output1 = intermediate_layer_model1.predict(np.expand_dims(your_test_image[img_index], axis=0))
intermediate_output2 = intermediate_layer_model2.predict(np.expand_dims(your_test_image[img_index], axis=0))

# Visualize the feature maps (example for layer 1)
for i in range(intermediate_output1.shape[-1]):
    plt.subplot(4, 8, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(intermediate_output1[0, :, :, i], cmap='gray')
    plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

#Repeat visualization for layer2 using intermediate_output2

```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the core principle. By creating separate models that output the intermediate layers, we can directly access and visualize their activations.  The `your_test_image` variable needs to be replaced with your actual test image data. The code then iterates through each feature map and displays it using Matplotlib.  Note the reshaping to handle batch size.


**Example 2:  Using Model Subclassing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

class MyCNN(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
        self.pool1 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
        self.conv2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')
        self.pool2 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
        self.flatten = Flatten()
        self.dense = Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.pool1(x)
        self.layer1_output = x # Store the output
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.pool2(x)
        self.layer2_output = x #Store the output
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = MyCNN()
#Compile and train model (omitted for brevity)
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)


#Visualization (similar to Example 1, but accessing self.layer1_output and self.layer2_output)
img_index = 0
intermediate_output1 = model(np.expand_dims(your_test_image[img_index], axis=0)).numpy()
intermediate_output2 = model.layer2_output.numpy() #Directly accessing the layer output
#rest of the visualization code is similar to Example 1
```

**Commentary:**  Model subclassing provides a more structured approach, especially for complex models.  We store the intermediate outputs as attributes within the class, allowing direct access after model prediction.  This approach can be more maintainable for larger architectures.


**Example 3: Handling Different Activation Functions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (Import statements as before)

# Model definition (similar to Example 1 or 2, but focusing on activation functions)

# ... (Inside your model definition)
x = Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='tanh')(input_tensor) # Example with tanh activation

# ... (Rest of the model)


#Visualization (modified to handle different ranges)
# ... (Access intermediate layer outputs as before)

for i in range(intermediate_output1.shape[-1]):
  #Normalize and scale to [0,255] for visualization.  Tanh outputs range [-1,1]
    plt.subplot(4, 8, i + 1)
    plt.imshow((intermediate_output1[0, :, :, i] + 1) / 2 * 255, cmap='gray') #Normalize to [0,1] and scale to [0,255]
    plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

**Commentary:** This example addresses the visualization of layers with non-ReLU activation functions.  Functions like `tanh` produce outputs in a different range, requiring normalization and scaling to the [0, 255] range before visualization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly sections on the functional API and model subclassing, are invaluable resources.  A solid understanding of NumPy for array manipulation is crucial.  Matplotlib provides excellent tools for image display and manipulation.  Finally, reviewing research papers on CNN visualization techniques will broaden your understanding of advanced visualization methods.
