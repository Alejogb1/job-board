TensorFlow's selective GPU utilization during validation and not training is not a default behavior.  In my experience debugging large-scale image classification models, I've encountered instances where this apparent discrepancy arose due to misconfigurations, specifically in how data pipelines and device placement were managed. The root cause is almost always a failure to explicitly assign training operations to the GPU, even if validation inherently uses it due to less stringent memory constraints.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental reason TensorFlow might appear to use the GPU for validation but not training boils down to how you structure your computational graph and manage the placement of operations.  TensorFlow, by default, executes operations on the CPU if not explicitly assigned to a different device.  While validation often involves smaller datasets and consequently lower memory demands, allowing it to proceed relatively smoothly even with implicit CPU execution, training with large datasets requires the massive parallel processing power of a GPU.  If you've not explicitly directed TensorFlow to utilize the GPU for training, it will default to the CPU, leading to the observed asymmetry.  This isn't inherent to TensorFlow's validation process; it's a consequence of potentially inconsistent or omitted device placement specifications within your training loop.  Furthermore, inefficient data loading mechanisms can exacerbate this issue.  If your training data isn't pre-fetched and efficiently streamed to the GPU, the bottleneck will be the CPU, even if the GPU is theoretically available.  Careful examination of your data loading and model compilation steps is crucial.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Device Placement (CPU Training)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

(x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
x_val = x_val.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_val = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_val, num_classes=10)


model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

**Commentary:** This example lacks explicit device placement.  While validation might run on the GPU due to its smaller dataset, training will be significantly slower on the CPU, creating the illusion of GPU-only validation.


**Example 2: Correct Device Placement (GPU Training)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        ])

        model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                      loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                      metrics=['accuracy'])

        (x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
        x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
        x_val = x_val.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
        y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
        y_val = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_val, num_classes=10)

        model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
else:
    print("No GPU found. Training will be slow.")

```

**Commentary:** This example utilizes `tf.config` and `tf.device` to explicitly place the model and training operations on the GPU (if available).  The `set_memory_growth` function is crucial for dynamic GPU memory allocation; this prevents potential out-of-memory errors during training.  The `else` block provides a fallback for CPU training if a GPU isn't detected.


**Example 3:  Efficient Data Preprocessing and Batching**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition from Example 2) ...

AUTOTUNE = tf.data.AUTOTUNE

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(32).prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)
val_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_val, y_val)).batch(32).prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)

model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10, validation_data=val_dataset)

```

**Commentary:** This example showcases efficient data handling.  `tf.data.Dataset` provides tools for creating optimized pipelines. `batch(32)` divides the data into batches for efficient GPU processing, and `prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)` pre-fetches data in the background, minimizing data transfer latency and preventing the CPU from becoming a bottleneck.  The combination of explicit GPU placement and optimized data handling ensures that both training and validation effectively leverage the GPU.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on device placement and data input pipelines.  Additionally, studying advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on distributed training and performance optimization would be beneficial.  Exploring resources on memory management within TensorFlow and strategies for profiling performance bottlenecks would be particularly useful in troubleshooting similar issues.  Finally, a deep dive into the intricacies of CUDA programming and its interaction with TensorFlow would provide a comprehensive perspective.  Addressing these aspects systematically ensures efficient and balanced GPU utilization during both training and validation.
