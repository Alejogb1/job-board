Modern server architectures, particularly those used in high-performance computing, often employ Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) to enhance memory bandwidth and reduce latency. When processes and threads are not allocated to resources within the same NUMA node, data access across interconnects can dramatically degrade performance. Therefore, understanding how to redistribute CPU and GPU assignments across NUMA nodes becomes critical for optimized application execution.

The challenge lies in effectively managing the complex interplay between processor affinity, memory locality, and the heterogeneity introduced by GPU accelerators. Simply assigning threads to CPUs without regard for NUMA architecture, or neglecting to colocate data with processing resources, will lead to sub-optimal utilization and increased communication overhead. I've personally witnessed cases where such misalignments resulted in performance regressions by a factor of two or more, underscoring the importance of this issue.

To address the redistribution of resources, one must employ a combination of operating system APIs, process management techniques, and GPU-specific tools. The fundamental goal is to ensure that each processing unit operates on data that resides as close as possible, physically, within the memory space of its NUMA node. This minimization of inter-node memory traffic is what drives performance improvements.

Firstly, consider the redistribution of CPU core affinity. Operating systems expose APIs allowing explicit control over which cores a process or thread executes upon. On Linux systems, the `sched_setaffinity` system call provides this mechanism. This call, along with its thread-specific counterpart `pthread_setaffinity_np`, lets the user bind a process to a specific set of CPU cores, essentially mapping workloads to specific NUMA nodes.

Hereâ€™s a basic example in C, illustrating how to bind a process to a single CPU core:

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <sched.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    cpu_set_t cpuset;
    CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);

    // Bind to the first core on the node. Assuming the first core belongs to the node you desire.
    CPU_SET(0, &cpuset);

    if (sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset) == -1) {
        perror("sched_setaffinity");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("Process bound to core 0.\n");

    // Simulate some work.
    sleep(5);

    return 0;
}

```
This example demonstrates the basic usage of `sched_setaffinity`. We initialize a `cpu_set_t` structure, clearing any previously defined affinities, and then set bit 0 which represents the first core. A call to `sched_setaffinity`, using 0 as the PID which indicates that we are applying it to the current process, binds the current process to this specific core.  For more complex systems involving multiple NUMA nodes, one would need to iterate across available cores within specific nodes, or use a more sophisticated strategy based on system topology information gathered from the operating system through system calls or utilities such as `lscpu` and `numactl`.

Moving to more complex scenarios involving threads, we need to use `pthread_setaffinity_np` after creating the thread. Consider the following snippet:

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sched.h>

void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    cpu_set_t cpuset;
    CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);
    CPU_SET(1, &cpuset); // Binding the thread to core 1.

    if (pthread_setaffinity_np(pthread_self(), sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_setaffinity_np");
        pthread_exit(NULL);
    }

    printf("Thread executing on core 1.\n");

    // Simulate thread work.
    sleep(5);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    if (pthread_create(&thread, NULL, thread_function, NULL) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_create");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a thread is created using `pthread_create`. The `thread_function` then uses `pthread_setaffinity_np` to bind itself to core 1. It's crucial to note the use of `pthread_self()`, which refers to the current thread.  Incorrectly applying thread affinity can lead to unpredictable behavior including thread starvation.

When GPUs are introduced, the process becomes more involved as direct interaction with the GPU requires specific device drivers and APIs, such as those provided by CUDA or OpenCL. The fundamental principle remains the same: minimizing data movement by assigning the GPU device and associated memory buffers to the same NUMA node as the CPU cores responsible for processing that data. These systems are often equipped with technologies such as NVLink for faster GPU-CPU communication, further emphasizing the importance of correct placement.

The following example illustrates GPU memory allocation and GPU selection with a hypothetical, abstracted, API to emphasize the concept:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Hypothetical GPU library for illustrative purposes.
// In reality, specific CUDA/OpenCL calls would be required.
typedef struct {
    int id;
    int numa_node;
    void *device_memory;
} GPU_device_t;

GPU_device_t *select_gpu_on_node(int numa_node);
void* gpu_allocate_memory(GPU_device_t *gpu, size_t size);
void gpu_perform_computation(GPU_device_t *gpu, void *data, size_t size);
void free_gpu_memory(GPU_device_t *gpu, void *mem);

int main() {
    int target_numa_node = 0; // Target NUMA node
    size_t data_size = 1024;

    // Hypothetically select a GPU on the target NUMA node.
    GPU_device_t *gpu = select_gpu_on_node(target_numa_node);

    if (gpu == NULL) {
      printf("No GPU found on the NUMA Node %d. Exiting.", target_numa_node);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Allocate memory on that specific GPU.
    void *gpu_data = gpu_allocate_memory(gpu, data_size);
    if (gpu_data == NULL) {
       printf("Failed to allocate memory on GPU. Exiting.");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("GPU Memory allocated on NUMA Node %d.\n", gpu->numa_node);
    // Simulate CPU work on the same node. Bind to appropriate core as shown before.
    printf("CPU work being performed from the same NUMA Node.\n");
    sleep(2);

    // Perform computation on the GPU using the allocated memory
    gpu_perform_computation(gpu, gpu_data, data_size);

    //Free memory.
    free_gpu_memory(gpu, gpu_data);

    return 0;
}

// Function Definitions for Hypothetical Calls
GPU_device_t *select_gpu_on_node(int numa_node) {
    // Implementation would involve GPU driver calls to determine device location.
    // For demonstration, we'll pretend a device is on numa node 0.
    if (numa_node == 0) {
        GPU_device_t *gpu = (GPU_device_t*)malloc(sizeof(GPU_device_t));
        gpu->id = 0;
        gpu->numa_node = 0;
        return gpu;
    }
    return NULL;
}

void* gpu_allocate_memory(GPU_device_t *gpu, size_t size) {
    // Implementation would use GPU library specific allocation calls.
     void *ptr = malloc(size);
     gpu->device_memory = ptr;
     return ptr;
}

void gpu_perform_computation(GPU_device_t *gpu, void *data, size_t size) {
  // In the real world, this will be more complex, however, to show the process, here we do nothing.
  printf("GPU performing calculation on data of size: %zu\n", size);
  sleep(1);
}
void free_gpu_memory(GPU_device_t *gpu, void *mem){
    free(mem);
    free(gpu);
}
```

This hypothetical example illustrates the critical steps of selecting the correct GPU based on its NUMA node affinity, allocating memory on that GPU, and executing computation in the same node. Real-world implementation would utilize device libraries, such as CUDA or OpenCL, to perform these tasks. Also important would be to utilize the CPU affinity techniques as shown above. Proper NUMA awareness and affinity are important when offloading processing to the GPU to maximize performance, as failure to do so can lead to significant delays as data is moved across nodes.

For further exploration, I would recommend studying resources related to operating system process scheduling, specifically focusing on processor affinity, using tools such as `numactl`, as well as documentation for GPU programming libraries like CUDA or OpenCL. Understanding the system topology, which can be gathered using the aforementioned utilities, is fundamental to making informed decisions about resource allocation. These combined approaches allow for optimal NUMA-aware CPU and GPU resource redistribution.
