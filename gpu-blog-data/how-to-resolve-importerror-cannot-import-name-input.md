The `ImportError: cannot import name 'Input' from 'tensorflow.keras.models'` typically arises from attempting to access the `Input` layer incorrectly, reflecting a misunderstanding of its location within TensorFlow's Keras API. Instead of being a direct member of `tensorflow.keras.models`, `Input` is a distinct module within `tensorflow.keras.layers`. My experiences building various deep learning models over the last three years, particularly those involving custom architectures, have made this a common hurdle for beginners, and even an easy mistake to make while switching between framework versions.

The core issue lies in the hierarchical structure of the `tensorflow.keras` module. When defining a sequential or functional model, one uses the `Input` layer to establish the entry point of the computational graph. However, it is not a class or method of the `models` submodule, but rather a standalone function found within the `layers` module. Thus, the error is not due to a faulty TensorFlow installation or corrupted packages; it signifies a misdirected import statement. Consequently, directly importing from `tensorflow.keras.models` will always fail. Instead, the correct path is `tensorflow.keras.layers`.

To rectify this, the import statement must be adjusted to reflect the actual module location. Here's a practical demonstration. Imagine a common scenario where a developer is attempting to construct a simple sequential model, mistakenly attempting to import Input from models. This will trigger the very error under discussion.

```python
# Incorrect Import causing the error:
import tensorflow as tf

# The following line will cause the ImportError: cannot import name 'Input' from 'tensorflow.keras.models'
from tensorflow.keras.models import Input, Sequential, Model # Incorrect import statement

# Intended Model definition (does not run due to the error above)
input_layer = Input(shape=(784,))
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation="softmax")(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)
```

In this example, the incorrect import of `Input` from `tensorflow.keras.models` will immediately halt the program's execution and generate the `ImportError`. The intention is clear; the developer wants to create an input layer for the model. However, the library's internal structure is not being respected. The remedy, as previously mentioned, requires a targeted import from the `layers` module. The corrected code segment would then look like the following:

```python
# Correct import statement
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input # Correct import statement
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential, Model

# Model definition
input_layer = Input(shape=(784,))
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation="softmax")(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)

# Example Model Summary (to verify)
model.summary()
```

In this corrected example, the import statement has been changed. `Input` is now brought in directly from `tensorflow.keras.layers`. The rest of the model architecture remains consistent with the previous (incorrect) attempt, demonstrating that the core logic is sound and the issue is solely in the import location. Upon execution of this adjusted snippet, the model definition will proceed without error, and the model summary can be printed out. The `Input` layer is now correctly recognized and integrated in the model definition.

Moving beyond the basic functional API model construction, the same error may also surface when using Sequential model definitions, specifically if the initial layer definition uses Input incorrectly. Let's assume we are defining a simple Sequential model with two dense layers:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
# Incorrect Sequential model definition
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(784,)), # Incorrect usage of Input layer here
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])
```
In this case, while the error may not be on the `import` statement itself, the `Input` layer is being used *inside* the `Sequential` constructor as an *actual layer*, rather than serving as the input definition for the functional API. This misuse of `Input` will raise an error, albeit not the standard `ImportError`, it highlights incorrect usage of Input. While the code will run, it will not create a functioning model due to the internal error within the Sequential constructor. The correct approach when using Sequential API is to specify the `input_shape` during the first layer instantiation. The fix is as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense # Import Dense layer

# Correct Sequential model definition
model = Sequential([
    Dense(units=10, activation='softmax', input_shape=(784,)) #Corrected definition using input_shape param
])
```
Here, the `Input` layer has been completely removed and the `input_shape` argument is passed directly to the first `Dense` layer. This accurately defines an input shape for the model.

In summary, the resolution of the `ImportError` or misapplication of `Input` involves correctly locating the `Input` layer within `tensorflow.keras.layers`. While seemingly trivial, this misunderstanding can stall progress, especially during the learning phase of framework usage. Thorough reading of documentation is crucial, as is close attention to import paths.

For further understanding of the TensorFlow Keras API, I would recommend exploring resources focusing on the fundamental concepts of model building, such as the official TensorFlow documentation available on their website. The Keras API documentation specifically will also prove extremely helpful. Additionally, tutorials detailing the differences between the Sequential and Functional API, which are often readily found on platform such as YouTube, can aid greatly in preventing this sort of error. Another book is also a good investment, although I do not have a specific book recommendation at the moment, but you should search for one which caters to a modern version of the API. Examining open-source code repositories and actively trying out these concepts on simple datasets will consolidate knowledge. Specifically, examining models which explicitly utilize either the Functional or Sequential API will help clarify which way is appropriate in specific circumstances.
