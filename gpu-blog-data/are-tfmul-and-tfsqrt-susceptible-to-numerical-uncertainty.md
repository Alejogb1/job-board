TensorFlow's `tf.mul` (element-wise multiplication) and `tf.sqrt` (square root) operations, while fundamental, are not immune to numerical uncertainty inherent in floating-point arithmetic.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has repeatedly highlighted the subtle but crucial impact of these limitations, particularly when dealing with extensive computations and values spanning several orders of magnitude.  The core issue stems from the finite precision representation of floating-point numbers, leading to rounding errors that accumulate and potentially affect the final results.

**1. Explanation of Numerical Uncertainty in `tf.mul` and `tf.sqrt`**

Floating-point numbers, the bedrock of numerical computation in TensorFlow, are approximations of real numbers.  They are represented using a fixed number of bits, comprising a sign, exponent, and mantissa. This finite representation necessitates rounding during arithmetic operations.  In `tf.mul`, the product of two floating-point numbers might not be exactly representable, resulting in a small rounding error. This error is amplified when performing numerous multiplications sequentially.  Similarly, `tf.sqrt` involves an iterative approximation algorithm (e.g., Newton-Raphson), introducing further rounding errors at each iteration. The inherent limitations of the algorithm itself, coupled with the representation limitations of the input and output, contribute to the overall uncertainty.

Consider a scenario where a very small number is multiplied by a very large number.  The result might underflow (become too small to be represented) or, conversely, the product of two moderately sized numbers might exceed the maximum representable value, leading to overflow. In both cases, the outcome deviates significantly from the mathematically accurate result.  Furthermore, catastrophic cancellation can occur when subtracting two nearly equal numbers; the significant digits cancel out, leaving only the least significant digits which are predominantly rounding errors.  This phenomenon is particularly relevant in iterative algorithms used by functions like `tf.sqrt`.

The magnitude of the numerical uncertainty depends on several factors including: the precision of the floating-point type (e.g., float32, float64), the range and distribution of input values, and the number of operations involved. Higher precision (float64) reduces but does not eliminate the issue.  The accumulation of errors across multiple operations necessitates careful consideration of the problem's numerical stability.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the susceptibility of `tf.mul` and `tf.sqrt` to numerical uncertainty using TensorFlow 2.x.  I've used both float32 and float64 to highlight the precision differences.

**Example 1:  Accumulated Error in `tf.mul`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Using float32
x_f32 = tf.constant([1.0, 1.0000001, 1.0000002], dtype=tf.float32)
product_f32 = tf.reduce_prod(x_f32)
print(f"Float32 Product: {product_f32}")

#Using float64
x_f64 = tf.constant([1.0, 1.0000001, 1.0000002], dtype=tf.float64)
product_f64 = tf.reduce_prod(x_f64)
print(f"Float64 Product: {product_f64}")
```

This illustrates the accumulation of rounding errors when repeatedly multiplying near-unity values. The float64 result is closer to the true mathematical product due to its higher precision.  However, a discrepancy still exists, especially when scaling the number of multiplicands.

**Example 2:  Error Propagation in `tf.sqrt`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Float32
x_f32 = tf.constant([1e-10, 1e10], dtype=tf.float32)
sqrt_f32 = tf.sqrt(x_f32)
print(f"Float32 Square Roots: {sqrt_f32}")

#Float64
x_f64 = tf.constant([1e-10, 1e10], dtype=tf.float64)
sqrt_f64 = tf.sqrt(x_f64)
print(f"Float64 Square Roots: {sqrt_f64}")
```

This example highlights the impact on values across different orders of magnitude.  The `tf.sqrt` operation introduces additional errors, particularly evident with the smaller value (1e-10) in float32.  The float64 version offers improved accuracy, showing the benefit of higher precision.  However, note that even with float64, we might not obtain the exact mathematical square root due to the iterative nature of the algorithm.

**Example 3: Catastrophic Cancellation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Demonstrating catastrophic cancellation
a = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant(1.0 + 1e-7, dtype=tf.float32)
c = b - a
d = tf.sqrt(c)
print(f"Result: {d}")

#Using NumPy for comparison
a_np = np.float32(1.0)
b_np = np.float32(1.0 + 1e-7)
c_np = b_np - a_np
d_np = np.sqrt(c_np)
print(f"NumPy result for comparison: {d_np}")
```

This showcases catastrophic cancellation. The subtraction of nearly equal numbers (a and b) leads to a loss of precision in `c`, impacting the accuracy of the subsequent `tf.sqrt` operation. Comparing the TensorFlow result with a NumPy calculation provides another benchmark to show the extent of the inaccuracy. The NumPy calculation, while also subject to floating-point limitations, may reveal slight differences due to distinct implementation details.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of numerical methods and floating-point arithmetic, I highly recommend consulting texts on numerical analysis and scientific computing.  Explore the documentation associated with TensorFlow, particularly the sections addressing numerical stability and precision control.  Pay close attention to the mathematical foundations of linear algebra and the subtleties of floating-point representation.  Investigating alternative numerical methods and algorithms can prove valuable to minimize the impact of numerical uncertainty in your applications.  Understanding the error propagation analysis associated with specific mathematical operations is also essential.
