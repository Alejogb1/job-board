Directly manipulating global memory to store class instances from within a CUDA kernel presents significant challenges due to the concurrent execution model and the inherent restrictions on kernel-side access to dynamically allocated memory. Primarily, the CUDA programming model intends kernels to perform computations on data already residing within device memory, as opposed to creating and managing complex data structures from within. Instead, a more appropriate strategy involves creating class instances on the host and passing the necessary data, or pointers to the data, to the kernel.

Let me explain the process I've found to work reliably, based on past projects involving parallel image processing and simulation. CUDA kernels execute in parallel across multiple threads, and each thread cannot directly access the host's memory space where a typical C++ class instance would reside. Trying to instantiate a class object inside a kernel would require dynamic memory allocation (which is limited within kernel context) and thread safety mechanisms that are not straightforward to implement directly. Therefore, we must shift the responsibility of object instantiation to the host side and then utilize device memory effectively for the kernel operations.

Essentially, the solution relies on two main steps: first, creating the instance on the host and populating it with necessary data, and second, passing a representation of that data (typically via structured data passed through device memory) to the kernel, where each thread can access the relevant part of it.

Let's walk through an example with a simplified `Point` class:

```cpp
// Host-side Point class
class Point {
public:
    float x;
    float y;

    Point(float x_val, float y_val) : x(x_val), y(y_val) {}
};
```

Now, if I wanted to use multiple `Point` instances in a CUDA kernel, I would not directly create them in the kernel itself. I'd instead create a host-side array of `Point` objects and then transfer the underlying data, or necessary references to that data, to the device. Here's the first code example demonstrating this data transfer process.

```cpp
// Host-side setup

#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Kernel declaration
__global__ void processPoints(float* d_x, float* d_y, int numPoints);

int main() {
    const int numPoints = 5;
    std::vector<Point> points;
    for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
        points.emplace_back(static_cast<float>(i), static_cast<float>(i * 2));
    }

    float* d_x;
    float* d_y;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_x, numPoints * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_y, numPoints * sizeof(float));

    // Copy x and y components to device
    float h_x[numPoints];
    float h_y[numPoints];

    for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
      h_x[i] = points[i].x;
      h_y[i] = points[i].y;
    }

    cudaMemcpy(d_x, h_x, numPoints * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_y, h_y, numPoints * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel
    processPoints<<<1, numPoints>>>(d_x, d_y, numPoints);

    cudaFree(d_x);
    cudaFree(d_y);

    return 0;
}


// Kernel implementation
__global__ void processPoints(float* d_x, float* d_y, int numPoints) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < numPoints) {
      // Each thread accesses a component of an implied Point instance
      float x_val = d_x[i];
      float y_val = d_y[i];

      // Do something with x and y values
      float result = x_val + y_val;

      // Here, I'm just demonstrating access; in real scenarios
      // you'd be performing computations or modifying other device data
    }
}

```

In this code, the host creates a `std::vector` of `Point` objects. Before launching the kernel, it allocates device memory for separate float arrays `d_x` and `d_y` to store each point's respective 'x' and 'y' value. The data is then copied to the device, which the kernel can access. Within the kernel, each thread implicitly reads a portion of the x and y arrays, which collectively represents a single `Point` instance for each corresponding thread.

Next, consider a more complex scenario using a struct to hold the point data on the host, which might be preferred over passing separate arrays for better data organization:

```cpp
// Host-side Point struct, which is POD for direct memory copy
struct PointData {
  float x;
  float y;
};

// Kernel declaration
__global__ void processPointsStruct(PointData* d_points, int numPoints);

int main() {
    const int numPoints = 5;
    std::vector<Point> points;
    for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
        points.emplace_back(static_cast<float>(i), static_cast<float>(i * 2));
    }

    // Convert to POD struct for direct memory copy
    std::vector<PointData> pointData(numPoints);
    for(int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
      pointData[i].x = points[i].x;
      pointData[i].y = points[i].y;
    }


    PointData* d_points;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_points, numPoints * sizeof(PointData));
    cudaMemcpy(d_points, pointData.data(), numPoints * sizeof(PointData), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    // Launch kernel
    processPointsStruct<<<1, numPoints>>>(d_points, numPoints);


    cudaFree(d_points);


    return 0;
}

// Kernel implementation
__global__ void processPointsStruct(PointData* d_points, int numPoints) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < numPoints) {
      // Direct access to PointData struct via index
      PointData currentPoint = d_points[i];
      float x_val = currentPoint.x;
      float y_val = currentPoint.y;

      // Do something with x and y values
      float result = x_val + y_val;

    }
}

```
Here, Iâ€™ve created a `PointData` struct, which is a plain old data (POD) struct to ease the memory copy process. The `std::vector<Point>` is converted into a `std::vector<PointData>` and then transferred using a direct `cudaMemcpy`. The kernel then accesses the `PointData` struct directly using the thread index. This approach keeps data logically bundled but requires an extra copy into a POD-struct container.

Lastly, suppose the `Point` class had a method. How do we conceptually handle this in the kernel? We cannot directly call class methods within a CUDA kernel. Instead, we perform equivalent calculations in the kernel. Let's assume we want to simulate a simple `move` operation. The actual movement logic must be done within the kernel after reading from device memory:

```cpp
// Host-side Point class
class Point {
public:
    float x;
    float y;
    Point(float x_val, float y_val) : x(x_val), y(y_val) {}

    void move(float dx, float dy) {
        x += dx;
        y += dy;
    }
};

struct PointData {
    float x;
    float y;
    float dx;
    float dy;
};

// Kernel declaration
__global__ void movePointsKernel(PointData* d_points, int numPoints);


int main() {
    const int numPoints = 5;
    std::vector<Point> points;
    for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
      points.emplace_back(static_cast<float>(i), static_cast<float>(i * 2));
    }


    std::vector<PointData> pointData(numPoints);
    for(int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i){
      pointData[i].x = points[i].x;
      pointData[i].y = points[i].y;
      pointData[i].dx = 1.0f; // Example move
      pointData[i].dy = 2.0f; // Example move
    }


    PointData* d_points;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_points, numPoints * sizeof(PointData));
    cudaMemcpy(d_points, pointData.data(), numPoints * sizeof(PointData), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    // Launch kernel
    movePointsKernel<<<1, numPoints>>>(d_points, numPoints);

   // Copy back modified data
    std::vector<PointData> resultData(numPoints);
    cudaMemcpy(resultData.data(), d_points, numPoints * sizeof(PointData), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Check results
     for (int i = 0; i < numPoints; ++i) {
       std::cout << "Point " << i << ": x = " << resultData[i].x << ", y = " << resultData[i].y << std::endl;
    }

    cudaFree(d_points);
    return 0;

}

// Kernel implementation
__global__ void movePointsKernel(PointData* d_points, int numPoints) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (i < numPoints) {

      PointData currentPoint = d_points[i];
      // Simulate the move method within the kernel
       d_points[i].x = currentPoint.x + currentPoint.dx;
       d_points[i].y = currentPoint.y + currentPoint.dy;
    }
}

```
In this example, I've added `dx` and `dy` fields in the `PointData` struct and performed the equivalent of the `move` operation by directly modifying device memory.  It is critical to copy data back after any modifications done in the kernel when the result is needed by the host.

In summary, CUDA kernels cannot directly create or manage complex classes because of their parallel execution model and limited memory access capabilities. You would leverage host-side object instantiation and then transfer data to the device using efficient device memory allocation and data copy techniques. For method calls within classes, you perform an equivalent computation within the kernel instead.

For further study, I would suggest examining resources focused on the following topics: CUDA memory model, including global, shared, and constant memory; host and device memory management; optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes; and understanding the difference between struct and class objects in C++, specifically when dealing with memory copies. A deep understanding of these concepts will help design efficient and correct CUDA programs. Furthermore, consider reviewing example projects that use different strategies to pass complex data to kernels; this can offer practical solutions.
