The fundamental shift between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x lies in the execution model.  TensorFlow 1.x relied heavily on static computation graphs defined using `tf.Session` and `tf.placeholder`, whereas TensorFlow 2.x adopts a more intuitive eager execution model where operations are evaluated immediately. This necessitates a significant restructuring of code, particularly regarding variable management, session handling, and the use of `tf.compat.v1` for backward compatibility. My experience porting large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.0 to 2.x highlighted these challenges repeatedly.

**1.  Eager Execution and `tf.function`:**

The core of the conversion process involves replacing the static graph approach with eager execution.  In TensorFlow 2.x, operations are executed immediately unless explicitly compiled into a graph using `@tf.function`.  This decorator allows for graph-mode execution, crucial for performance optimization, particularly with complex models.  However, it's important to understand that even with `@tf.function`, the underlying paradigm has shifted from explicit graph construction to a more Pythonic, imperative style.

**2. Variable Management:**

TensorFlow 1.x required explicit variable initialization within a session.  TensorFlow 2.x utilizes automatic variable initialization.  This simplification eliminates the need for `tf.global_variables_initializer()` and `tf.Session.run()`.  Variables are now created using `tf.Variable` and are automatically tracked within the scope of the execution.  Furthermore, variable sharing mechanisms need to be updated;  the `tf.get_variable()` method, common in 1.x, is replaced by the more straightforward `tf.Variable` with appropriate name scoping.

**3.  `tf.compat.v1` and Gradual Migration:**

TensorFlow 2.x provides `tf.compat.v1` to maintain backward compatibility.  This module allows you to temporarily retain 1.x functionalities during the migration process.  However, relying excessively on `tf.compat.v1` hinders the benefits of the 2.x improvements.  The best approach involves a gradual migration, systematically refactoring sections of code to leverage native TensorFlow 2.x features while using `tf.compat.v1` only where absolutely necessary for components that are difficult to immediately refactor.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Linear Regression (TensorFlow 1.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x code
W = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1], name='x')
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1], name='y')

y_pred = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init)
    # Training loop here...
```

**Example 2:  Same Linear Regression (TensorFlow 2.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 2.x code
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')

def model(x):
  return tf.matmul(x, W) + b

def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(0.01)

# Training loop
for i in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x_train)
        loss = loss_fn(y_train, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W, b]))
```

**Example 3:  Illustrating `tf.function`:**

This example showcases the use of `@tf.function` to compile a computationally intensive function into a graph for improved performance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def complex_computation(input_tensor):
  # Perform computationally expensive operations
  result = tf.math.sin(input_tensor)
  result = tf.math.pow(result, 2)
  result = tf.reduce_sum(result)
  return result

# Example usage
input_data = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
output = complex_computation(input_data)
```

The original TensorFlow 1.x example relied on placeholders, a session, and explicit variable initialization.  The TensorFlow 2.x equivalent leverages eager execution, automatic variable management, and the `@tf.function` decorator for optimized performance where necessary.  The final example demonstrates how to introduce graph-mode execution strategically, ensuring efficiency without sacrificing the inherent advantages of eager execution for general model development.


**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  The official TensorFlow 2.x migration guide.  This document provides detailed explanations and best practices for converting TensorFlow 1.x code.
2.  TensorFlow's API documentation.  A comprehensive resource that details the functionality of all classes and methods within TensorFlow 2.x.
3.  A practical guide to TensorFlow 2.x.  Books and tutorials focusing on TensorFlow 2.x will offer practical examples and clear explanations.

Remember, migrating large codebases is a substantial undertaking.  A phased approach, coupled with thorough testing at each stage, is crucial to ensure the stability and accuracy of the converted code.  Prioritize refactoring sections that are most critical to the model's core functionalities first. This minimizes disruption and aids in identifying potential issues early.  Systematic testing, including unit tests and integration tests, will confirm correct functionality after conversion and identify any unexpected behavior.
