The duplicate printing behavior observed during TensorFlow’s `model.fit()` is often not an error, but rather an artifact of how TensorFlow manages its training loop, particularly in distributed and custom training scenarios, and how it interacts with callbacks and logging mechanisms. I’ve encountered this directly while debugging performance bottlenecks in a large-scale natural language processing project. Specifically, it stems from redundant or overlapping logging outputs originating from different components of the TensorFlow training process.

The core of this phenomenon lies in TensorFlow's internal structure. When `model.fit()` is executed, it orchestrates a complex series of operations. It not only handles the forward and backward passes of the neural network, but it also manages data input, loss calculation, gradient application, and crucially, reporting progress. This reporting is facilitated through the use of callbacks and the underlying TensorFlow logging framework. In many cases, particularly when using a custom training loop, users might unknowingly activate or define duplicate reporting mechanisms, leading to these apparent duplicate messages.

One major contributing factor is the simultaneous use of TensorFlow's built-in progress bar and user-defined callbacks with similar output capabilities. TensorFlow, by default, produces its own progress bar that displays loss and metric information. If a custom callback is also configured to log similar data to the console or a file, the results will be redundant. The `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` callback, for example, can produce output each epoch about saving the model, and if another mechanism is tracking the progress of each epoch, these messages may overlap. Similarly, some experimentation tracking frameworks integrate with TensorFlow's logging, and if a user is directly logging information using TensorFlow’s API as well, double outputs may occur.

Another less obvious reason for this repetition is when using distributed training strategies, such as `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` or `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`. When employing these strategies, training logic is replicated across multiple devices (GPUs or machines). If the logging output is not carefully managed within this distributed context, each device can generate similar logging messages, leading to repetitive output. Typically, only the main worker should log progress in a distributed context. A naive implementation, unaware of its distributed context, will therefore print logs from all worker processes. This is not an error condition, but a consequence of the default logging behavior. It does not impact the training itself. It simply overwhelms the console with repeated messages.

The problem is further exacerbated by using custom training loops where users take fine-grained control over the training process via `tf.GradientTape` instead of relying on `model.fit`. In custom loops, the responsibility for logging falls completely on the user. I have found that a common pitfall is manually logging data and failing to take into account logging mechanisms from frameworks interacting with TensorFlow, or even forgetting that the `model.fit` API relies on its own set of callbacks to generate output. It may appear as if two logs are happening in `model.fit` as opposed to the user's logging mechanism and `model.fit` logs. The complexity multiplies when adding advanced callback logic and distribution strategies simultaneously.

Let's explore this with a few code examples.

**Example 1: Overlapping Callbacks**

This example showcases a scenario where a custom callback duplicates the output already handled by TensorFlow's default progress bar.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate dummy data
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, (1000, 1))

# Custom Callback
class CustomCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {logs["loss"]:.4f}, Accuracy: {logs["accuracy"]:.4f}')


# Train the model with the callback, but without disabling default progress bar.
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=5, verbose=1, callbacks=[CustomCallback()])
```

In this case, the `verbose=1` setting produces the standard TensorFlow progress bar output. The custom callback `CustomCallback` also produces output at the end of each epoch. Thus, the loss and accuracy figures appear twice. If the user set verbose to zero, the standard Tensorflow progress output would not appear, only the custom one. The key is understanding where each log originates.

**Example 2: Distributed Training Output**

Here, I will demonstrate how duplicate output can occur in a distributed environment. Note that this is a conceptual example, as running a multi-worker setup requires additional environment configuration.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os


# Simulate a distribution strategy
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# Define a simple model
with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate dummy data
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, (1000, 1))


# Function to train model (modified to include rank check in actual implementation)
def train(model, data, labels):
    model.fit(data, labels, epochs=2, verbose=1)

# This will produce duplicate output as all worker processes try to log (conceptual)
train(model, data, labels)

```

In a real multi-GPU or multi-worker context, the `train` function runs concurrently on each device or worker, without proper conditional logging. Each instance of `model.fit` triggers its default output mechanism. As all devices will print, we would see duplicate messages for each worker. In a practical situation, I would configure logging at the primary worker only. This example, as written, is conceptual and a user would need to use TF distributed setup to see this in action.

**Example 3: Custom Training Loops**

Here, we'll create a custom training loop that replicates logging similar to what `model.fit` would do by default, without handling logging from callbacks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define the optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
metrics = ['accuracy']

# Generate dummy data
data = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 10), dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant(np.random.randint(0, 2, (1000, 1)), dtype=tf.float32)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)).batch(32)


# Training loop
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
  epoch_loss = tf.keras.metrics.Mean()
  epoch_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.Mean()
  for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(x_batch)
        loss = loss_fn(y_batch, logits)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    epoch_loss.update_state(loss)
    prediction = tf.round(tf.nn.sigmoid(logits))
    correct_prediction = tf.cast(tf.equal(prediction, y_batch), tf.float32)
    accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(correct_prediction)
    epoch_accuracy.update_state(accuracy)

  print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {epoch_loss.result():.4f}, Accuracy: {epoch_accuracy.result():.4f}')


# Now, If model.fit is also used, this logging can be duplicated.
# model.fit(data, labels, epochs=2, verbose=1)
```

Here, I create my own logging mechanism to report loss and accuracy. It's now the user's responsibility to understand that additional log output from `model.fit`, if it is used elsewhere, will cause duplicate logs. This code example avoids using `model.fit`, it demonstrates that this behavior can be seen in custom implementations as well.

To avoid these duplicate outputs, the following adjustments are beneficial. First, if employing a custom callback, ensure that the `verbose` setting in `model.fit` is set to 0. This will suppress the default progress bar. Additionally, if incorporating custom training loops, meticulously manage the logging. In distributed training scenarios, always use rank-based logging, often achieved by checking `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.ClusterResolver.task_type` or the environment variable `TF_CONFIG` to ensure only the designated worker generates output. Furthermore, examine any other frameworks that may be logging output in conjunction with TensorFlow.

For further study, I would recommend reviewing the TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops and distributed training strategies. The Keras documentation also contains extensive information on using callbacks. There are also numerous tutorials available online that delve into the nuances of advanced training techniques. Examining these resources, particularly the section on logging control, is valuable.
