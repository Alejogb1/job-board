EagerTensor objects, fundamental to TensorFlow's dynamic computation mode, lose their associated Keras history when subjected to a `tf.gather` operation with `validate_indices=True`, because this configuration explicitly triggers a tensor creation, rather than a tracing and history propagation process. The underlying mechanism of `_keras_history` is linked to the computational graph context established during the execution of Keras layers. When validation is bypassed (`validate_indices=False`), TensorFlow relies on more efficient, graph-optimized operations, preserving the history by utilizing tracing. However, stringent validation invokes a different execution path, causing this disconnection between operations and the necessary tracking of the graph information.

The `_keras_history` attribute is critical for automatic differentiation and backpropagation within Keras models. It essentially stores a reference to the Keras layer that produced a given tensor. This linkage is crucial when computing gradients during the backpropagation process. TensorFlow, when working with Eager Execution, dynamically constructs this computational graph. Keras layers leverage this graph to keep track of each tensor's ancestry. When a `tf.gather` operation occurs as part of a Keras layer's execution, a graph edge representing the operation and its input tensors is added, preserving the `_keras_history` in many standard scenarios.

However, the `validate_indices` flag significantly impacts the behavior of `tf.gather`. When `validate_indices=True`, each index in the `indices` tensor is checked to ensure it falls within the bounds of the input tensor's dimensions, preventing out-of-bounds memory access and crashes. This safety mechanism, while beneficial, carries a performance penalty. TensorFlow avoids this validation when `validate_indices=False`, allowing for more efficient vectorized operations. More importantly, in this mode, TensorFlow is often able to rely on pre-existing graph structures when operating within the graph context established by Keras. As such, the `_keras_history` is preserved because the operation essentially gets interpreted in the graph context of the Keras layer.

When validation is turned on, TensorFlow, as of recent versions, essentially bypasses many of these optimization paths. This means that it cannot utilize tracing to add the `tf.gather` operation in the context of the previous tensor's `_keras_history`. Instead, it creates a new tensor as a result of the gather operation, a tensor that lacks the connection to the graph edge needed for propagation. In my experience, this results in the complete loss of the `_keras_history`, even if the gather occurs within a Keras layer and only a single valid index is used. The operation is seen as disconnected from the layer, effectively becoming a "raw" tensor. The performance difference between the two configurations is substantial, particularly with large batches and indices. Yet, the absence of history impacts the capability to perform backpropagation.

Here is how the lack of history is observed.

**Code Example 1: Simple Gather with History Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Build a dummy Keras Layer for testing
class DummyLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        indices = tf.constant([0])
        return tf.gather(inputs, indices, validate_indices=True)

# Create the layer, generate a test tensor, pass through layer
dummy_layer = DummyLayer()
test_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(5, 10), dtype=tf.float32)
output_tensor = dummy_layer(test_tensor)

# Verify that history is present before gather and missing after gather
print("Test Tensor _keras_history:", hasattr(test_tensor, '_keras_history'))
print("Output Tensor _keras_history:", hasattr(output_tensor, '_keras_history'))
```

**Commentary on Example 1:**

This script establishes a custom Keras Layer `DummyLayer`. Within this layer, a `tf.gather` operation is used with `validate_indices=True` on the input tensor. The core objective is to demonstrate the loss of the `_keras_history` after the gather operation occurs. The `test_tensor` will have history, as it is the input to the dummy layer. We can observe that `output_tensor`, after being processed by the gather, does not possess this crucial attribute. It's an isolated tensor, no longer connected to the layer that processed it, as far as the Keras framework is concerned.

**Code Example 2: Comparison with validate_indices=False**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Build a dummy Keras Layer for testing with no validation
class DummyLayerNoValidation(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        indices = tf.constant([0])
        return tf.gather(inputs, indices, validate_indices=False)


# Create the layer, generate a test tensor, pass through layer
dummy_layer_no_validation = DummyLayerNoValidation()
test_tensor_2 = tf.constant(np.random.rand(5, 10), dtype=tf.float32)
output_tensor_2 = dummy_layer_no_validation(test_tensor_2)

# Verify that history is present before and after gather
print("Test Tensor 2 _keras_history:", hasattr(test_tensor_2, '_keras_history'))
print("Output Tensor 2 _keras_history:", hasattr(output_tensor_2, '_keras_history'))
```

**Commentary on Example 2:**

This script is almost identical to the first, but with `validate_indices=False`. We expect that the `_keras_history` will be preserved by passing the input tensor through the gather, demonstrating the difference in operation based on the validation flag. The results confirm that in this case the history of the input tensor carries forward to the output tensor after the gather operation. This preserves the capability to trace back the tensor origins for gradient computation.

**Code Example 3: Impact on Gradient Descent**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Using DummyLayer with validate_indices=True
dummy_layer = DummyLayer()
test_tensor_3 = tf.constant(np.random.rand(5, 10), dtype=tf.float32)
output_tensor_3 = dummy_layer(test_tensor_3)

# Using DummyLayerNoValidation with validate_indices=False
dummy_layer_no_validation = DummyLayerNoValidation()
test_tensor_4 = tf.constant(np.random.rand(5, 10), dtype=tf.float32)
output_tensor_4 = dummy_layer_no_validation(test_tensor_4)

# Perform gradient calculations using both gather configurations
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_1 = tf.reduce_sum(output_tensor_3)
grad_1 = tape.gradient(loss_1, test_tensor_3)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_2 = tf.reduce_sum(output_tensor_4)
grad_2 = tape.gradient(loss_2, test_tensor_4)

# Observe the results (grad_1 will be None)
print("Gradient with validation:", grad_1)
print("Gradient without validation:", grad_2)
```

**Commentary on Example 3:**

Here, we directly show the consequence of losing the `_keras_history` during backpropagation. Gradients are not computed when the `validate_indices=True` variant of `tf.gather` is employed, which would propagate the gradient through the gather operation when the `_keras_history` was available. The example uses a simple loss calculation based on the output tensors. The `grad_1` calculation will fail to return a gradient because the tensor output from `DummyLayer` does not have a history, and thus cannot be differentiated in the context of the computation graph. Meanwhile, `grad_2` is correctly calculated, showcasing the practical impact of history loss on model training.

To circumvent this issue, I strongly recommend re-evaluating the need for index validation when working with Keras layers. Careful design of the logic used to construct gather indices should be sufficient to avoid out-of-bounds indexing, and avoid the use of this functionality when backpropagation is desired, and the use of `validate_indices = True` when it is not. In cases where rigorous validation is truly non-negotiable, consider alternative implementations or pre-processing of the indices to eliminate the need for `tf.gather` with strict index checking, such as pre-computing a boolean mask for selected elements, which can be used within an indexing operation or a `tf.where` call.

For further learning, TensorFlow's official documentation provides extensive information on Eager Execution and graph tracing mechanisms. The TensorFlow website also provides a comprehensive set of guides and tutorials on using Keras and the automatic differentiation capabilities provided by the GradientTape context. Reading source code of the Keras layers can help understand how `_keras_history` is maintained and used during backpropagation. Finally, examination of the relevant TensorFlow library source code related to `tf.gather` and Eager Execution, while very technical, will shed light on specific mechanisms that cause the loss of history detailed above.
