The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in the loss function during TensorFlow/Keras regression model training almost invariably stems from numerical instability, often manifesting as exploding gradients or undefined mathematical operations within the loss calculation.  In my experience troubleshooting this across numerous projects, including a recent large-scale time-series forecasting application, I've found the root causes generally fall into three categories: data issues, model architecture choices, and optimizer hyperparameter selection.

**1. Data-Related Issues:**

The most common culprit is the presence of invalid data points within the training set. This includes:

* **Infinite or extremely large values:**  Outliers in your features or target variable can lead to extremely large intermediate calculations during the forward and backward passes, eventually resulting in `inf` or `nan` values that propagate through the network.  Even a single such point can contaminate the entire training process.  Robust data preprocessing is crucial.

* **NaN or infinite values in the input data:** This is a straightforward error; even a single NaN in your input data will inevitably propagate through the model's calculations and lead to NaN loss.  Thorough data cleaning and validation are essential before training.

* **Issues with data scaling:**  Features with vastly different scales can exacerbate gradient issues.  If one feature has values ranging from 0 to 1 while another ranges from 0 to 1e6, the gradients for the latter feature will dwarf those of the former, potentially leading to instability and NaN loss.  Standardization (mean=0, std=1) or Min-Max scaling are effective countermeasures.


**2. Model Architecture and Activation Functions:**

Inappropriate choices in model architecture and activation functions can also trigger NaN loss.

* **Inappropriate activation functions:** Using activation functions like sigmoid or tanh in deeper networks can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients, especially if your data isn't properly scaled.  ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or its variants (LeakyReLU, ELU) are generally preferred for their ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

* **Overly complex models:**  An excessively large or deeply layered model, especially without appropriate regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization), can increase the susceptibility to overfitting and numerical instability, potentially causing NaN loss.  Start with simpler models and incrementally increase complexity as needed.


**3. Optimizer Hyperparameters:**

The choice and tuning of the optimizer's hyperparameters significantly impact training stability.

* **High learning rate:** An excessively high learning rate can cause the optimizer to overshoot the optimal weights, leading to instability and NaN loss. Starting with a relatively low learning rate and gradually increasing it (if necessary) is a safer approach.

* **Incorrect optimizer choice:** Some optimizers are more susceptible to numerical issues than others.  While Adam is frequently a good starting point,  SGD with momentum can sometimes be more robust in handling noisy data or complex models.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating common scenarios leading to NaN loss and how to address them:

**Example 1: Handling Outliers**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Simulate data with an outlier
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1)
X[0,0] = 1e10  # Introduce an outlier

# Model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile with a smaller learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse')

# Train (this might produce NaN loss)
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

#Solution: Robust outlier removal

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'X': X[:,0], 'y': y[:,0]})
df_cleaned = df[(np.abs(df - df.mean()) < (3*df.std())).all(axis=1)] #Removes outliers > 3 standard deviations from the mean
X_cleaned = df_cleaned['X'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y_cleaned = df_cleaned['y'].values.reshape(-1,1)
model.fit(X_cleaned, y_cleaned, epochs=10) #Train on the cleaned data
```

This example shows how a single outlier can lead to NaN loss.  Robust statistical methods, like removing outliers beyond a certain percentile or using median-based methods are applied to prevent this issue.

**Example 2: Data Scaling**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Data with different scales
X = np.concatenate((np.random.rand(100,1), np.random.rand(100,1)*1000), axis=1)
y = X[:,0] + X[:,1] + np.random.randn(100)

# Scale the data using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and Train
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_scaled, y, epochs=10)
```
This example illustrates the importance of scaling features using a `StandardScaler` before training to avoid gradient issues.


**Example 3: Learning Rate Adjustment**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Generate data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2*X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

#Attempt with a high learning rate (likely to produce NaN)
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=10), loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

#Solution - Reduce the learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01), loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

```

This shows how an excessively high learning rate can lead to NaN loss.  Reducing the learning rate is a direct and effective solution.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, the Keras documentation, and a comprehensive textbook on machine learning covering gradient-based optimization techniques and numerical stability.  Furthermore, reviewing advanced tutorials on handling outliers and data preprocessing in Python would greatly benefit understanding these issues.  Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation and gradient descent is also vital for diagnosing such problems effectively.
