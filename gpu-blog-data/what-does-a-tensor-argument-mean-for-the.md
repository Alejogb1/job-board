The PyTorch `Normal` distribution's tensor argument fundamentally alters its behavior from a single univariate distribution to a potentially multivariate, or even a batch of multivariate, distributions.  This is achieved through broadcasting and the inherent flexibility of PyTorch's tensor operations. My experience building Bayesian neural networks extensively utilized this feature, often necessitating careful consideration of the tensor's shape and implications for the resulting distribution parameters.  Understanding this is key to avoiding subtle yet impactful errors in probabilistic modeling.

**1.  Explanation:**

The `Normal` distribution in PyTorch, defined through `torch.distributions.Normal`, accepts `loc` and `scale` as arguments representing the mean and standard deviation, respectively.  When these arguments are scalars, a single univariate normal distribution is defined.  However, when `loc` and `scale` are tensors, the interpretation shifts significantly.

The dimensionality of the input tensors dictates the nature of the resulting distribution. A one-dimensional tensor for both `loc` and `scale` defines a batch of univariate normal distributions, each with its mean and standard deviation drawn from the respective tensors.  A two-dimensional tensor, on the other hand, defines a batch of multivariate normal distributions.  The first dimension represents the batch size, while the second dimension represents the dimensionality of each multivariate normal.  This flexibility extends to higher dimensions, allowing for complex, hierarchical modeling scenarios.

It is crucial to note the broadcasting behavior.  If `loc` and `scale` have different shapes but are compatible for broadcasting, PyTorch will automatically expand the smaller tensor to match the larger one, generating a consistent set of distribution parameters.  However, incompatible shapes will lead to runtime errors.  Careful attention must be paid to ensure that the broadcasting rules align with the intended distribution structure.  Mismatch between intended dimension and resulting broadcast dimensions is a common source of errors I encountered in past projects.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Univariate Normal Distribution (Scalar Inputs):**

```python
import torch
from torch.distributions import Normal

loc = 0.0  # Mean
scale = 1.0  # Standard Deviation

normal_dist = Normal(loc, scale)
sample = normal_dist.sample()  # Generates a single sample from the distribution

print(f"Sample from univariate normal: {sample}")
print(f"Distribution mean: {normal_dist.mean}")
print(f"Distribution standard deviation: {normal_dist.stddev}")
```

This example showcases the simplest case.  Both `loc` and `scale` are scalars, defining a single standard normal distribution.


**Example 2: Batch of Univariate Normal Distributions (1D Tensors):**

```python
import torch
from torch.distributions import Normal

loc = torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0, -1.0])  # Mean for three distributions
scale = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.5, 2.0])  # Standard deviation for three distributions

normal_dist = Normal(loc, scale)
samples = normal_dist.sample()  # Generates three samples, one from each distribution

print(f"Samples from batch of univariate normals: {samples}")
print(f"Distribution means: {normal_dist.mean}")
print(f"Distribution standard deviations: {normal_dist.stddev}")
```

Here, `loc` and `scale` are one-dimensional tensors.  This defines three separate univariate normal distributions, each with its own mean and standard deviation.  The `sample()` method returns a tensor of three samples, one from each distribution.


**Example 3: Batch of Bivariate Normal Distributions (2D Tensors):**

```python
import torch
from torch.distributions import Normal

loc = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]]) # Mean for two bivariate distributions
scale = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]]) # Covariance matrix (diagonal for simplicity) for two distributions - shape should be (batch_size, dim, dim) for full covariance matrices

#Note: In reality, scale would be a 3D tensor for full covariance matrices for each bivariate normal.  This simplified example uses a diagonal covariance matrix for clarity
normal_dist = Normal(loc, scale)
samples = normal_dist.sample() # Generates two samples, each a 2D vector


print(f"Samples from batch of bivariate normals: {samples}")
print(f"Distribution means: {normal_dist.mean}")
print(f"Distribution standard deviations: {normal_dist.stddev}")

```

This illustrates the use of 2D tensors to create a batch of bivariate normal distributions.  Each row in `loc` and `scale` represents the mean and covariance matrix (in this simplified example a diagonal covariance matrix is used for clarity. In reality you would need a (batch_size, dim, dim) tensor for a fully specified covariance matrix) of a separate bivariate normal distribution.  Again, the `sample()` method returns a tensor reflecting the batch and dimensionality of the defined distributions.  Error handling for incorrect tensor shapes, or attempting to use a non-positive definite covariance matrix is crucial here.
