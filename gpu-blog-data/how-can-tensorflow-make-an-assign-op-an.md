TensorFlow's dataflow graph execution inherently manages dependencies between operations; however, explicitly defining dependencies, particularly for `assign` operations, is crucial for ensuring correct execution order, especially in distributed or asynchronous settings.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems highlighted the importance of this, where improperly managed dependencies led to inconsistent model updates and unpredictable results.  The key is understanding that TensorFlow's control dependencies are the mechanism for this explicit dependency management.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's graph construction represents computations as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Nodes represent operations, and edges represent data dependencies.  A standard `tf.assign` operation updates a variable's value.  Without explicit control dependencies, TensorFlow's optimizer might reorder operations for performance reasons, potentially leading to incorrect results if the assigned value is subsequently used in a calculation that depends on that update.

Control dependencies, established using `tf.control_dependencies`, enforce a specific execution order.  They don't create data dependencies; rather, they dictate the order in which operations are executed within the graph.  An `assign` operation, when placed within a `tf.control_dependencies` context, guarantees that its execution precedes any operations within that context.  This ensures that the updated variable's value is available for subsequent computations relying on it.  This is particularly relevant when dealing with multiple threads or asynchronous operations within a TensorFlow session.  Improper management of these dependencies can result in race conditions, data inconsistencies, and non-deterministic outputs.  The careful definition of control dependencies ensures that the dataflow remains accurate and predictable, regardless of the underlying execution environment.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Control Dependency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

v = tf.Variable(0, name='my_variable')

with tf.control_dependencies([tf.assign(v, 10)]):
    result = v + 5  # This operation depends on the assignment

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(result))  # Output: 15
```

This illustrates a basic scenario.  The `tf.assign(v, 10)` operation is placed within `tf.control_dependencies`.  The `result` calculation is only executed *after* the assignment is complete, guaranteeing that `v` holds the updated value (10).  Failing to use `tf.control_dependencies` might result in `v` retaining its initial value (0) in `result`, leading to an incorrect outcome (5 instead of 15).

**Example 2: Multiple Assignments and Dependencies**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

v1 = tf.Variable(0, name='var1')
v2 = tf.Variable(0, name='var2')

assign_op1 = tf.assign(v1, 5)
assign_op2 = tf.assign(v2, v1 * 2)

with tf.control_dependencies([assign_op1]):
    with tf.control_dependencies([assign_op2]):
        result = v2 + 10

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(result))  # Output: 20
```

Here, we chain control dependencies.  `assign_op2` depends on `assign_op1` completing, ensuring that `v1` is updated to 5 before `v2` is calculated.  `result` subsequently depends on `assign_op2`, completing the ordered execution sequence.  Removing the nested `tf.control_dependencies` could lead to unpredictable results, as the order of assignment operations is not guaranteed without explicit control.

**Example 3: Handling Gradient Calculations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])
W = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))

y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y)) # Mean Squared Error

train_op = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(loss)
assign_W = tf.assign(W, tf.constant([[2.0]]))


with tf.control_dependencies([assign_W]):
    updated_loss = loss

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    data = [[1.0]]
    _, new_loss = sess.run([train_op,updated_loss], feed_dict={x: data})
    print(new_loss)
```

This example demonstrates the importance of control dependencies in gradient-based optimization.  We explicitly assign a new value to `W`.  The `updated_loss` calculation depends on this assignment.  The placement within `tf.control_dependencies` ensures that the loss is computed using the newly assigned weights.  Without the control dependency, the loss calculation might use the old weights, leading to an incorrect gradient update in the subsequent training step.  Such issues can significantly affect model training stability and convergence.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution and control dependencies, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Specifically, examining the sections on variable management, control flow operations, and distributed TensorFlow would be highly beneficial.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics such as session management and asynchronous computation will solidify your understanding of how these dependencies impact performance and correctness in more complex scenarios.  A comprehensive grasp of graph visualization tools can significantly aid in debugging and comprehension of complex dataflows and dependencies within TensorFlow programs.  Finally, reviewing examples of TensorFlow models and analyzing their use of control dependencies within their implementations is invaluable practical experience.
