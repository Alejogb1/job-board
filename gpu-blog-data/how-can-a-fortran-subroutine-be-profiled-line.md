Profiling Fortran subroutines at a granular, line-by-line level requires a nuanced approach, differing significantly from simply timing the entire subroutine execution.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving legacy Fortran codebases has highlighted the limitations of standard profiling tools and the necessity of employing more sophisticated techniques.  The key lies in leveraging compiler-specific instrumentation capabilities or employing external profiling libraries designed for Fortran.  Simply relying on built-in timer functions will not yield the fine-grained data necessary for efficient optimization of individual lines or code blocks.

**1.  Explanation of Line-by-Line Profiling Techniques**

Line-by-line profiling involves measuring the execution time spent on each line of code within a subroutine.  This provides detailed information about performance bottlenecks, identifying specific lines that consume disproportionate amounts of computational resources.  Achieving this precision in Fortran necessitates methods beyond basic timing.  Here, we primarily consider two strategies:

* **Compiler-Based Instrumentation:** Modern Fortran compilers, such as gfortran and Intel Fortran, often offer built-in profiling capabilities. These compilers can instrument the code during compilation, inserting calls to timing functions around each line or basic block.  The output typically presents a detailed profile summarizing the time spent on each instrumented section.  This approach is generally preferred for its ease of use and integration with the compilation process. However, the level of detail can vary depending on compiler flags and optimization settings.  Over-aggressive optimization may interfere with accurate profiling results.

* **External Profiling Libraries:**  For scenarios where compiler-based profiling falls short or lacks desired features, dedicated profiling libraries can be employed.  These libraries typically provide more control over the profiling process, allowing for custom instrumentation and the selection of specific functions or code sections for profiling.  They may offer more advanced features like call graph profiling and statistical analysis of execution times.  However, integrating an external library usually requires more manual effort than relying on compiler features.

The selection between these two methods depends heavily on the specific project's needs and constraints.  For simpler projects with readily available compiler support, compiler-based profiling suffices.  For complex projects requiring more control or analysis, an external library may be necessary.  One must always remember that profiling introduces overhead, hence accurate results might necessitate running the profiled code with realistic input sizes and potentially multiple times to average out the noise.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different profiling approaches:

**Example 1:  Compiler-based profiling with gfortran**

```fortran
program my_program
  implicit none
  integer :: i, n
  real(8), allocatable :: a(:)

  n = 1000000
  allocate(a(n))

  ! ... (Some initialization of 'a') ...

  call my_subroutine(a, n)

  deallocate(a)
  end program my_program

subroutine my_subroutine(x, n)
  implicit none
  integer, intent(in) :: n
  real(8), intent(inout) :: x(n)
  integer :: i

  do i = 1, n
    x(i) = x(i) * 2.0d0      ! Line to be profiled intensely
  end do

  do i = 1, n
    x(i) = x(i) + 1.0d0      ! Another line potentially requiring optimization.
  end do
end subroutine my_subroutine
```

To profile this code using gfortran, we would compile it with the `-pg` flag:

```bash
gfortran -pg -o my_program my_program.f90
./my_program
gprof my_program
```

The `gprof` utility then generates a report detailing the execution time spent in each function and, importantly, within each line (if sufficient compiler support is available; this depends on the gfortran version and optimization level).  The output will show a breakdown of the time spent in `my_subroutine`, specifically pinpointing the relative execution times of the two loops.

**Example 2:  Illustrative use of an external timer (for conceptual understanding)**

This example doesn't use a dedicated profiling library but demonstrates the concept using a simple timer.  A true library would provide more sophisticated functionality.

```fortran
program my_program
  implicit none
  integer :: i, n
  real(8), allocatable :: a(:)
  real(8) :: start_time, end_time, elapsed_time

  n = 100000
  allocate(a(n))

  call cpu_time(start_time)
  do i = 1, n
    a(i) = i**2       ! Line 1
  end do
  call cpu_time(end_time)
  elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
  print *, "Time for loop 1:", elapsed_time


  call cpu_time(start_time)
  do i = 1, n
    a(i) = sqrt(a(i)) ! Line 2
  end do
  call cpu_time(end_time)
  elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
  print *, "Time for loop 2:", elapsed_time

  deallocate(a)
end program my_program
```

This is a rudimentary approach;  the `cpu_time` intrinsic (or a similar system-dependent function) provides only the overall time for each loop, not line-by-line data.  This highlights the limitation of relying solely on built-in timers for granular profiling.

**Example 3:  Conceptual outline for using a hypothetical external profiling library**

This example illustrates the general structure of using an external library. Specific details will vary greatly depending on the library chosen.

```fortran
program my_program
  use my_profiling_library  ! Hypothetical library

  ! ... (Initialization) ...

  call profile_start()       ! Start profiling
  call my_subroutine()       ! Subroutine to be profiled
  call profile_stop()        ! Stop profiling
  call profile_report("my_report.txt") ! Write the report

  ! ... (Rest of the program) ...

end program my_program

subroutine my_subroutine()
  implicit none
  integer :: i
  ! ... (Code of my_subroutine) ...
  do i = 1, 1000
     ! ... (some computations) ...
     call profile_mark("loop_iteration") ! Mark specific point in time.
  end do
end subroutine my_subroutine
```

In this conceptual example, `my_profiling_library` provides functions to initiate and terminate profiling (`profile_start`, `profile_stop`),  mark specific points during execution (`profile_mark`), and generate a report (`profile_report`).  Such libraries usually require specific installation and linking procedures during compilation.  They usually offer more advanced options than those provided by compiler flags alone.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend consulting the documentation of your chosen Fortran compiler regarding its profiling capabilities.  Explore the manuals for gfortran, Intel Fortran, or other relevant compilers for details on compiler flags, optimization options, and how to interpret the profiling output.  Additionally, search for publications and documentation related to performance analysis and optimization techniques for Fortran applications.  Consider exploring books on High-Performance Computing, focusing on Fortran programming and optimization strategies.  Finally, examine the documentation of potential profiling libraries specifically designed to work with Fortran codes; the availability and suitability will depend on the specific needs of your project.
