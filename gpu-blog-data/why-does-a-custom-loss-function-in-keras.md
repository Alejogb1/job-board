High mean squared error (MSE) and output offset when utilizing a custom loss function in Keras often stem from a mismatch between the loss function's gradient landscape and the optimizer's learning process.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, particularly involving complex image segmentation tasks and time-series forecasting, points to several potential culprits.  The core problem usually isn't the loss function itself being inherently flawed, but rather how its gradients interact with the model's weights and the optimizer's update rules.

**1. Gradient Explosions or Vanishing Gradients:**

A poorly designed custom loss function can lead to either gradient explosion or vanishing gradients.  Gradient explosion occurs when the gradients become excessively large, causing the optimizer to take excessively large steps, potentially overshooting the optimal weights and leading to oscillations or divergence.  This manifests as high MSE and unstable output.  Vanishing gradients, conversely, result in exceedingly small gradients, causing the optimizer to make minuscule updates, slowing down learning considerably, and potentially leading to a model converging to a suboptimal solution, often with a noticeable output offset.  This occurs when the loss function's derivatives become very small across a wide range of weight values.  The offset is due to the model never adequately correcting its initial biases.

**2. Incorrect Implementation of the Loss Function:**

The most common error is an incorrect implementation of the custom loss function itself.  A subtle bug in the calculation of the loss or its gradient can lead to significantly inaccurate updates and, subsequently, high MSE and offset.  This can be particularly problematic when dealing with complex functions involving multiple terms or non-linear operations.  Careless handling of numerical precision, or overlooking edge cases where inputs might be undefined or cause numerical instabilities (e.g., division by zero or logarithm of a non-positive number), can further exacerbate these problems.

**3. Optimizer Choice and Hyperparameter Tuning:**

The choice of optimizer significantly influences how well the model converges given a custom loss function.  Optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, and SGD have different strengths and weaknesses in navigating complex gradient landscapes.  An optimizer that excels with standard MSE might perform poorly with a custom loss function.  I've personally observed that, in cases where the gradient landscape is particularly erratic due to a custom loss function, a more robust optimizer like SGD with momentum might yield better results than Adam, which can struggle with noisy gradients.  Moreover, hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate selection, is crucial.  An inappropriately high learning rate can lead to gradient explosions, while a learning rate that is too low can result in vanishing gradients.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating a potential issue with numerical instability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def unstable_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.math.log(tf.math.abs(y_true - y_pred) + 1e-9) # added small constant to prevent log(0)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=unstable_loss, metrics=['mse'])
# ... Training code ...
```

This example showcases a potential problem.  The logarithm operation is sensitive to small values;  a near-zero difference between `y_true` and `y_pred` will produce an extremely negative value or potentially a `NaN` which drastically impacts gradient calculation and optimizer behavior. The `1e-9` addition attempts to mitigate this, but a more robust design might be preferable.

**Example 2: Incorrect Gradient Calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def incorrect_gradient_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred)) # MSE calculation is correct
    # INCORRECT GRADIENT CALCULATION: This line produces a wrong gradient.
    grad = tf.reduce_mean(y_true - y_pred) # This is NOT the gradient of MSE.
    return loss # The actual loss is correct but we are returning incorrect gradient values.

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=incorrect_gradient_loss, metrics=['mse'])
# ... Training code ...
```

This example shows a critical error.  Although the loss calculation is correctly implemented as MSE, the provided gradient is inaccurate.  The optimizer uses this erroneous gradient, leading to misdirected weight updates, resulting in high MSE and potential output offsets.  Keras automatically computes gradients; this example only serves to highlight a potential mistake within a complex custom loss function where manual gradient computation might be mistakenly implemented.

**Example 3: A robust example of a custom loss function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def robust_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Huber loss function: Less sensitive to outliers than MSE
    delta = 1.0
    abs_error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    quadratic = tf.minimum(abs_error, delta)
    linear = abs_error - quadratic
    loss = 0.5 * quadratic**2 + delta * linear
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=robust_loss, metrics=['mse'])
# ... Training code ...
```

This example presents a more robust loss function, the Huber loss, which is less sensitive to outliers than MSE.  It smoothly transitions from quadratic to linear behavior, helping to mitigate the impact of noisy data points on gradient calculation.  This is particularly beneficial when dealing with datasets containing outliers or significant noise.

**Resource Recommendations:**

Several excellent textbooks cover the mathematical foundations of optimization and machine learning.  A strong understanding of calculus, particularly gradient descent and backpropagation, is essential for debugging custom loss functions.  Furthermore, researching different loss functions relevant to your specific problem is vital.  Reviewing the documentation of your chosen deep learning framework for details on custom loss implementation and gradient calculation is also critical.


In conclusion, resolving high MSE and output offset issues related to custom loss functions requires a systematic approach.  It's essential to carefully review the loss function's implementation, scrutinize the gradient calculations, and consider the optimizer's suitability and hyperparameters.  Thorough testing and understanding the mathematical foundations of both the loss function and the optimization process are crucial for constructing robust and effective machine learning models.
