The widespread misconception is that TensorFlow's `tf.random.set_seed(n)` function guarantees completely reproducible results across different executions; however, this function primarily controls the initial state of the global random number generator (RNG). It does not address all sources of nondeterminism present within the TensorFlow framework, especially when GPU acceleration is involved or when using certain specific operations. My practical experience debugging model training, particularly involving recurrent networks on GPUs, has repeatedly shown this limitation.

The primary mechanism for pseudo-random number generation in TensorFlow relies on generators. `tf.random.set_seed(n)` sets a global seed that influences the default generator. However, individual operations, especially those executed on GPUs, often create their own generators for parallel processing. These individual operation generators may not be influenced by the global seed or might be influenced indirectly in a complex fashion dependent on CUDA and cuDNN. Consequently, setting a global seed will likely produce reproducible results on CPUs, but not necessarily on GPUs and sometimes not even across different versions of TensorFlow. Additionally, some operations, like `tf.nn.dropout`, might use a different seed management system for performance.

Further, the use of `tf.function` for performance boosts introduces subtleties. When decorated with `tf.function`, a computation graph is compiled and executed. The generation of random numbers within a `tf.function` can exhibit behavior that is not fully deterministic, despite the use of `tf.random.set_seed()`. The reason is that `tf.function` execution can trigger multiple operations where the random number generation process for the optimized graph might differ from eager execution or from a direct use of the individual operations. This often manifests in minor differences across runs, or even on the same run if specific configurations change. This subtle unpredictability has caused my team considerable frustration when debugging deep learning models during A/B testing.

To illustrate these nuances, let us explore a few code examples. The first will demonstrate simple CPU-based random number generation with `tf.random.normal`. This will produce consistent results.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Generate random numbers on CPU.
cpu_random1 = tf.random.normal((1,5))
cpu_random2 = tf.random.normal((1,5))
print(f"CPU random 1: {cpu_random1.numpy()}")
print(f"CPU random 2: {cpu_random2.numpy()}")

tf.random.set_seed(42)

cpu_random3 = tf.random.normal((1,5))
cpu_random4 = tf.random.normal((1,5))
print(f"CPU random 3: {cpu_random3.numpy()}")
print(f"CPU random 4: {cpu_random4.numpy()}")
```

In this example, setting the seed using `tf.random.set_seed(42)` results in identical outputs for `cpu_random1` and `cpu_random3` as well as `cpu_random2` and `cpu_random4`, due to the deterministic nature of the CPU-based generation. The output demonstrates perfect reproducibility. This is expected, when operations execute on the CPU.

The following example illustrates the issue when GPU utilization is present by using `tf.matmul` operation. Note that a GPU must be available for the results to vary.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Generate random matrices on GPU.
gpu_random1 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
gpu_random2 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
result1 = tf.matmul(gpu_random1, gpu_random2)
print(f"Result 1 (first run's matrix multiplication): {tf.reduce_sum(result1).numpy()}")


tf.random.set_seed(42)
gpu_random3 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
gpu_random4 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
result2 = tf.matmul(gpu_random3, gpu_random4)
print(f"Result 2 (second run's matrix multiplication): {tf.reduce_sum(result2).numpy()}")
```

When this code is executed, the outputs for `result1` and `result2` are likely to be slightly different, though setting the seed was applied before matrix multiplication. This difference stems from variations in the order of operations or how specific kernels are launched on the GPU. The precise behavior can be affected by the GPU device, driver version, and cuDNN version. Thus, while the initial state of the global random generator is reset by `tf.random.set_seed(42)`, the computation utilizing the GPU may introduce randomness. The `tf.matmul` is using its own GPU-specific random generator which is not fully controlled by `tf.random.set_seed`.

My final example shows how `tf.function` further obfuscates the reproducibility.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def compute_random_function():
    random_matrix1 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
    random_matrix2 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
    return tf.matmul(random_matrix1, random_matrix2)

tf.random.set_seed(42)
result_func1 = compute_random_function()
print(f"Result from tf.function (run 1): {tf.reduce_sum(result_func1).numpy()}")

tf.random.set_seed(42)
result_func2 = compute_random_function()
print(f"Result from tf.function (run 2): {tf.reduce_sum(result_func2).numpy()}")


def compute_random_eager():
    tf.random.set_seed(42)
    random_matrix1 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
    random_matrix2 = tf.random.normal((100,100))
    return tf.matmul(random_matrix1, random_matrix2)


result_eager1 = compute_random_eager()
print(f"Result from eager execution (run 1): {tf.reduce_sum(result_eager1).numpy()}")

result_eager2 = compute_random_eager()
print(f"Result from eager execution (run 2): {tf.reduce_sum(result_eager2).numpy()}")
```

Here, even if `tf.random.set_seed(42)` is set globally, the `tf.function` output (`result_func1` and `result_func2`) may still show slight differences, whereas eager execution results (`result_eager1` and `result_eager2`) might remain consistent, provided the execution happens on CPU. This occurs due to the compilation of the `tf.function` code into a graph, where operations are re-ordered for optimization. As mentioned earlier, GPU computations are susceptible to minor randomness from the architecture of the CUDA library and device driver. The behavior within `tf.function` might even differ across TensorFlow versions or different configurations. The eager execution version shows the behavior that is expected in this case.

To achieve better reproducibility, several steps must be taken. First, for CPU computations, `tf.random.set_seed(n)` is often sufficient. For GPU computations, it's recommended to explicitly set operation-specific seeds through the `seed` argument, where applicable. Also, explicitly control the environment by fixing TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN versions. For research projects, where full reproducibility is critical, it is essential to document these configurations thoroughly. The environment variables `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` when set to 1, can also help, albeit at the expense of some performance.

Furthermore, when dealing with `tf.function` and other optimized computations, consider using the `tf.random.stateless_normal` operation which accepts a seed as input, offering more control over random number generation across different executions.

For resources, TensorFlowâ€™s API documentation itself is invaluable. Exploring discussions on the TensorFlow GitHub repository and community forums provides useful insights into practical issues. The official TensorFlow tutorials regarding determinism are a good starting point for detailed strategies and the use of environment variables. Finally, articles describing the inner workings of CUDA and GPU programming help in understanding the limitations of pseudo-random generation on parallel architectures. Careful planning and detailed logging will reduce the surprise when the `tf.random.set_seed()` fails to deliver complete consistency.
