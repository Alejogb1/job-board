The inefficiency observed when passing a pointer to a structure by value with Clang and GCC stems from the compilers' inability to reliably perform certain optimizations in the presence of aliasing and potential side effects.  My experience optimizing high-performance C++ applications has repeatedly highlighted this issue, particularly when dealing with large structures or those containing mutable members.  The core problem isn't inherent to the compilers themselves, but rather a consequence of the robust safety mechanisms they employ to guarantee correct program execution across a wide range of coding styles.

**1.  Explanation:**

When a structure pointer is passed by value, the compiler creates a copy of the pointer itself, not the entire structure. This copy, residing on the stack, points to the original structure in memory.  The seemingly trivial operation is, however, fraught with complexities for the compiler's optimization engine. The compiler must assume the possibility of aliasing: multiple pointers might refer to the same memory location.  Consequently, any operation performed through the copied pointer might inadvertently modify the original structure, even if the function ostensibly only reads its contents.  To avoid introducing undefined behavior, the compiler is forced to be conservative.  It cannot, for example, safely perform common subexpression elimination or loop unrolling if there's a chance a modification through the passed pointer could affect other parts of the program. This limitation leads to increased code size and execution time compared to passing a pointer by reference (using a pointer to pointer) or passing the structure by reference directly.

Further complicating the matter is the potential for side effects within the called function.  If the function modifies the structure through the copied pointer, the compiler cannot reliably predict the impact on other parts of the program relying on the same structure.  This makes safe optimization exceptionally challenging, often necessitating the generation of more cautious (and slower) code.

Therefore, the inefficiency is not due to a flaw in the compilers, but rather a result of their robust design in the face of potential aliasing and side effects.  Bypassing these safety features using compiler intrinsics or unsafe coding practices might yield performance improvements, but at the cost of potentially introducing subtle bugs and hard-to-debug issues.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Pass-by-Value (Pointer to Struct)**

```c++
struct MyStruct {
  int data[1024];
};

void processStruct(MyStruct* sPtr) {
  // Perform operations on sPtr->data
  for (int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
    sPtr->data[i] += 1; // Potential side effect!
  }
}

int main() {
  MyStruct myData;
  processStruct(&myData); //Passing a pointer by value
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, passing `&myData` by value forces the compiler to treat the pointer copy as potentially modifying the original structure. Even if the `processStruct` function only reads data, the compiler can't make such an assumption confidently.

**Example 2: Efficient Pass-by-Reference (Pointer to Pointer)**

```c++
struct MyStruct {
  int data[1024];
};

void processStruct(MyStruct** sPtrPtr) {
  // Perform operations on (*sPtrPtr)->data
  for (int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
      (*sPtrPtr)->data[i] += 1;
  }
}

int main() {
  MyStruct myData;
  MyStruct* myDataPtr = &myData;
  processStruct(&myDataPtr); // Passing a pointer to a pointer
  return 0;
}
```

This revised code explicitly passes a pointer to the pointer, eliminating the ambiguity. The compiler can now more effectively optimize because it understands that modifications to the pointed-to structure are visible to the caller.


**Example 3: Efficient Pass-by-Reference (Direct Reference)**

```c++
struct MyStruct {
  int data[1024];
};

void processStruct(MyStruct& sRef) { //Pass by reference
  for (int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
    sRef.data[i] += 1;
  }
}

int main() {
  MyStruct myData;
  processStruct(myData); // Pass by reference directly
  return 0;
}
```

Passing the structure by reference is the most efficient approach.  The function directly operates on the original structure without creating copies, enabling aggressive compiler optimizations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the following resources for a deeper understanding:

*   **The C++ Programming Language (Stroustrup):** This definitive guide provides insights into memory management and optimization techniques in C++.
*   **Effective C++ (Meyers):** Offers practical advice on writing efficient and maintainable C++ code.
*   **Modern C++ Design (Alexandrescu):** Covers advanced C++ features that can be useful for optimizing performance-critical code.
*   **Compiler Optimization Reference Manuals (for both GCC and Clang):** These detailed manuals offer insights into the specific optimization capabilities of these compilers and how to guide them effectively.  Pay close attention to the sections on alias analysis and pointer analysis.
*   **Assembly Language Programming:** Understanding assembly language helps in analyzing the generated code and pinpointing areas for improvement.


Through diligent study and practical experience, I've found that choosing the correct method for passing structure data, considering aliasing and side-effect implications, is crucial for efficient C++ application development.  Prioritizing techniques like pass-by-reference and careful consideration of the compilerâ€™s capabilities are essential for maximizing performance.  Remember, premature optimization is the root of all evil; focus on clean, well-structured code first and then profile to identify areas for targeted optimization.
