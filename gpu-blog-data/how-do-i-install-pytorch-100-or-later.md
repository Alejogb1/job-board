The enduring challenge in deploying PyTorch on Google Colab stems from the dynamic nature of Colab's runtime environments and the version control intricacies of PyTorch itself.  Over the years, I've encountered countless scenarios where seemingly straightforward installation commands fail due to inconsistencies between pre-installed CUDA versions, conflicting package dependencies, and the inherent ephemeral nature of Colab instances.  Therefore, a robust installation strategy necessitates a methodical approach incorporating explicit environment management and version verification.

**1. Understanding the Colab Environment and PyTorch Dependency Tree:**

Google Colab provides a readily accessible environment pre-configured with many Python packages. However, PyTorch, particularly older versions like 1.0.0, requires careful consideration of CUDA compatibility.  CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform, is crucial for leveraging GPU acceleration within PyTorch.  Colab instances frequently update their CUDA toolkits, introducing potential incompatibility issues with specific PyTorch versions.  Moreover, PyTorch itself depends on other libraries such as  NumPy, torchvision (for computer vision tasks), and potentially others. Installing PyTorch 1.0.0 or later often requires managing these dependencies to ensure version compatibility and avoid conflicts.  Failure to address these aspects often results in runtime errors, particularly those related to CUDA mismatches or missing library components.  My experience has shown that explicitly specifying versions during installation is key to avoiding these complications.

**2.  Methodical Installation Strategies and Code Examples:**

My preferred approach involves a three-step process:  (a) environment check; (b) CUDA version determination and compatible PyTorch selection; (c) installation with explicit dependency management using `pip`.

**Code Example 1: Environment Check and CUDA Version Determination:**

```python
import torch
import subprocess

print("Checking CUDA availability...")
try:
  cuda_available = torch.cuda.is_available()
  if cuda_available:
    cuda_version = subprocess.check_output(['nvcc', '--version']).decode('utf-8')
    print(f"CUDA is available. Version: {cuda_version}")
  else:
    print("CUDA is not available. Installing CPU-only PyTorch.")
except FileNotFoundError:
  print("nvcc not found. CUDA is likely not installed. Installing CPU-only PyTorch.")


```

This code snippet first checks for CUDA availability using the `torch.cuda.is_available()` function. If CUDA is available, it utilizes `subprocess` to obtain the CUDA version. This information is crucial for selecting a compatible PyTorch version.  A `try-except` block handles the case where CUDA is not installed, guiding the installation towards a CPU-only PyTorch build.  In my experience, this proactive check prevents numerous installation failures resulting from trying to use GPU-accelerated PyTorch on a system without CUDA support.

**Code Example 2: Installing PyTorch 1.0.0 (CPU Only):**

```bash
pip install torch==1.0.0 --user
```

For CPU-only installation of PyTorch 1.0.0,  the above command is sufficient.  The `--user` flag installs the package in the user's local directory, avoiding potential permission issues within the Colab environment.  This is particularly useful if one doesn't have administrative privileges within the Colab runtime.  After this installation, running `import torch` should confirm the successful installation of the CPU-only version of PyTorch 1.0.0.  I have frequently used this method when dealing with constraints related to Colab runtime settings.


**Code Example 3: Installing PyTorch 1.10.0 (CUDA Enabled, assuming CUDA 11.x is available):**

```bash
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.10.0+cu113 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

This command showcases installing a newer PyTorch version (1.10.0) with CUDA support.  Here, I've explicitly specified the CUDA version (cu113)  and also added torchvision and torchaudio, common PyTorch extensions. The `--index-url` argument points to the official PyTorch wheels repository, ensuring you're installing verified packages.  The cu113 in the package names must match the CUDA version found in Code Example 1.  Choosing an incorrect CUDA version in the package name frequently leads to compilation errors and installation failure.  Note:  Replace `cu113` with the actual CUDA version identified in your environment.  This is a crucial step that significantly reduces installation issues, based on my extensive experience with this process.


**3.  Post-Installation Verification and Resource Recommendations:**

After installation, always verify the installation by running simple PyTorch commands:

```python
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.cuda.is_available()) # Check for CUDA availability (if applicable)
print(torch.version.cuda) # Print CUDA version (if applicable)
```

These commands confirm the installed PyTorch version and CUDA availability.  The output should precisely reflect the intended configuration.  Discrepancies should lead to a re-evaluation of the installation steps.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further assistance, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation for installation instructions.  The NVIDIA CUDA documentation is invaluable for understanding CUDA versions and compatibility.  Additionally, exploring existing StackOverflow questions regarding PyTorch installation on Colab will likely reveal solutions for specific issues you may encounter.  These resources often provide comprehensive insights into troubleshooting and best practices.  Familiarity with basic command-line operations and package management within Python is also beneficial in handling these installation tasks effectively.  Finally,  thoroughly reviewing the error messages returned by failed installation attempts is essential for pinpointing the exact cause of the failure.
