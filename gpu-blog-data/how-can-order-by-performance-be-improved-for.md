The performance bottleneck in complex queries involving `ORDER BY` on JSONB fields within cross joins, inner joins, and `GROUP BY` clauses frequently stems from the inability of the database engine to efficiently leverage indexes on the JSONB data.  My experience optimizing similar queries across various PostgreSQL versions, especially versions 12 and above, highlights the critical role of careful query design and the judicious application of JSONB-specific indexing strategies.  Directly sorting the entire result set after joining and grouping is computationally expensive, particularly with large datasets.

**1.  Understanding the Performance Challenge**

The inherent nature of JSONB data, its schema-less structure, makes traditional indexing techniques less effective.  Standard B-tree indexes, typically used for efficient sorting, can't directly operate on nested JSONB keys or values.  Therefore, when `ORDER BY` is applied to a JSONB field, the database is forced to perform a full table scan and sort the data in memory, leading to significant performance degradation. This is amplified when combined with cross joins and inner joins which inherently increase the data volume processed. The `GROUP BY` clause further adds complexity, necessitating aggregation before sorting.

Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach encompassing query rewriting, data modeling adjustments, and strategic indexing.  In my experience with enterprise-level data warehousing, ignoring any of these can lead to unacceptable query execution times, often impacting overall system responsiveness.

**2.  Query Optimization Strategies**

The key is to avoid ordering or grouping on the entire JSONB document.  Instead, extract the relevant fields into separate columns during the initial data load or through a view. This allows for the creation of traditional indexes, which the query optimizer can effectively utilize.  This approach fundamentally changes the nature of the problem; transforming it from a complex JSONB sorting operation into a more efficient sorting of indexed columns.

**3.  Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's consider a simplified scenario involving products, their categories, and sales data stored in JSONB columns. We assume a `products` table and a `sales` table.

**Example 1: Inefficient Query**

```sql
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.product_details->>'name' AS product_name,
    SUM(s.sales_data->>'amount') AS total_sales
FROM
    products p
CROSS JOIN
    sales s
ON p.id = s.product_id
GROUP BY
    p.id, product_name
ORDER BY
    (p.product_details->>'price')::numeric DESC;
```

This query is inefficient because the `ORDER BY` clause operates directly on the JSONB field `p.product_details->>'price'`. The database must extract and sort the `price` value from the JSONB field for every row in the result set after the join and grouping.

**Example 2: Improved Query using a View**

```sql
-- Create a view with extracted price
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW product_prices AS
SELECT
    id,
    (product_details->>'name')::TEXT AS product_name,
    (product_details->>'price')::NUMERIC AS price
FROM
    products;

SELECT
    pp.id,
    pp.product_name,
    SUM(s.sales_data->>'amount')::NUMERIC AS total_sales
FROM
    product_prices pp
JOIN
    sales s ON pp.id = s.product_id
GROUP BY
    pp.id, pp.product_name
ORDER BY
    pp.price DESC;

```

This revised query uses a view (`product_prices`) to extract the product name and price into separate columns.  An index can be created on `price` in this view, drastically improving the `ORDER BY` performance.  The `JOIN` remains efficient as indexes can be leveraged on the `id` field in both tables.

**Example 3:  Handling Null Values and Complex JSON Structures**

```sql
--Assuming a more complex JSON structure with potential nulls
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW product_details_view AS
SELECT
    id,
    COALESCE((product_details->>'name')::TEXT, 'Unknown') as product_name,
    COALESCE((product_details->>'price')::NUMERIC, 0) as price,
    COALESCE((product_details->>'category'->>'id')::INTEGER, -1) as category_id
FROM
    products;

CREATE INDEX product_details_view_price_idx ON product_details_view (price);
CREATE INDEX product_details_view_category_idx ON product_details_view (category_id);

SELECT
    pdv.id,
    pdv.product_name,
    SUM(s.sales_data->>'amount')::NUMERIC AS total_sales
FROM
    product_details_view pdv
JOIN
    sales s ON pdv.id = s.product_id
GROUP BY
    pdv.id, pdv.product_name
ORDER BY
    pdv.price DESC, pdv.category_id ASC;
```

This example demonstrates handling potential `NULL` values within the JSONB structure using `COALESCE`.  It also extracts another relevant field (`category_id`) for more granular sorting.  The creation of indexes on both `price` and `category_id` is crucial for optimal performance.  Note the use of separate indexes for better selectivity.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of JSONB data types and indexing strategies in PostgreSQL, I recommend consulting the official PostgreSQL documentation.  Explore the topics related to indexing, specifically focusing on B-tree indexes and their interaction with functions and expressions.  Pay close attention to the performance characteristics of different query execution plans.  Understanding query planning and execution is essential for effective database optimization.  Further, studying the impact of various `JOIN` types on performance is beneficial for selecting the optimal join method in complex scenarios.  Finally, practical experience with profiling and analyzing query execution times, using tools provided by your database system, is invaluable in identifying specific performance bottlenecks.
