The challenge of reducing a grid based on function values frequently arises in data processing and visualization, particularly when dealing with large datasets or attempting to extract salient features from a complex landscape.  My experience developing a high-resolution terrain model involved precisely this task, requiring me to efficiently prune points from a regularly spaced grid, retaining only those deemed “significant” according to an applied function. This process ensures both computational efficiency in subsequent analysis and clarity in rendered visualisations.

The fundamental concept revolves around applying a function to each grid point, then using the function’s output to determine if that point should be retained or discarded. The function can be anything that maps a grid point (represented by its coordinates, and possibly its current value if applicable) to a scalar value. The comparison of that scalar value with a predefined threshold then facilitates point removal. It's a selective downsampling, where the selection criteria are derived from functional analysis. This is different from simple stride-based downsampling, which often results in a loss of crucial details, especially in regions where the function’s output is highly variable.

Let’s explore how this is implemented in Python, using NumPy for efficient array manipulation. The essence of the approach involves iterating through the grid coordinates, applying the function, and creating a mask that dictates the points to keep. This approach avoids inefficient explicit loops, leveraging NumPy's vectorized operations. The resulting reduced grid then contains only the points satisfying a specific criterion. I've encountered and resolved several variations of this challenge in my own projects, from noise reduction in sensor readings to the optimisation of mesh data in computer graphics.

**Example 1: Height Map Simplification**

In this example, we are simplifying a 2D grid representing a height map. The function assesses the local standard deviation of the height values within a small window. This measures local variability, indicating areas of interest, where retaining the points is more valuable than removing them. Points in flatter regions, with low standard deviations, would then be removed.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import generic_filter

def local_std_dev(window):
  """Calculates the standard deviation within a window."""
  return np.std(window)

def simplify_heightmap(heightmap, threshold, window_size=3):
  """Reduces a heightmap by retaining points with local std dev above a threshold."""
  std_dev_map = generic_filter(heightmap, local_std_dev, size=window_size)
  mask = std_dev_map > threshold
  reduced_heightmap = heightmap[mask]
  reduced_coords = np.argwhere(mask)
  return reduced_heightmap, reduced_coords

# Example Usage
heightmap = np.random.rand(100, 100)
threshold = 0.1
reduced_map, reduced_coords = simplify_heightmap(heightmap, threshold)

print(f"Original map size: {heightmap.shape}")
print(f"Reduced map size: {reduced_map.shape}")
print(f"Coordinates of retained points: {reduced_coords}")
```

The `simplify_heightmap` function leverages `scipy.ndimage.generic_filter` to efficiently calculate a local standard deviation map. The `local_std_dev` function is passed as a callback, providing the standard deviation within the given filter window. A boolean mask is then constructed by comparing these calculated values against the provided threshold. Finally, the heightmap and the coordinate indices of the points exceeding the threshold are obtained, representing the reduced grid.

**Example 2: 2D Grid Reduction based on Function Output**

This example demonstrates a reduction using a custom function based on the distance from a specified center point. Grid points closer to the center are considered less important and potentially removed (depending on the specified threshold), simulating the removal of less critical points based on a spatial attribute.

```python
import numpy as np

def distance_from_center(coord, center):
  """Calculates the distance of a coordinate from a given center."""
  return np.linalg.norm(np.array(coord) - np.array(center))

def reduce_grid_by_function(grid_shape, function, threshold, center):
    """Reduces a grid based on a function's output and a threshold."""
    rows, cols = grid_shape
    row_indices, col_indices = np.indices(grid_shape)
    coords = np.stack([row_indices, col_indices], axis=-1)
    values = np.array([function(coord, center) for coord in coords.reshape(-1,2)]).reshape(rows,cols)
    mask = values > threshold
    reduced_coords = coords[mask]
    return reduced_coords

# Example Usage
grid_shape = (50, 50)
center_point = (25, 25)
threshold = 15
reduced_grid = reduce_grid_by_function(grid_shape, distance_from_center, threshold, center_point)
print(f"Original grid shape: {grid_shape}")
print(f"Number of retained points: {len(reduced_grid)}")
print(f"Coordinates of retained points: {reduced_grid}")

```
The `reduce_grid_by_function` demonstrates applying a user-provided function across every coordinate of a given grid. It generates coordinate matrices using `np.indices`, then computes the function output for each coordinate using `np.array([function(coord, center) for coord in coords.reshape(-1,2)]).reshape(rows,cols)`, and generates the boolean mask based on the threshold. The resulting output is the coordinates of the retained points. This demonstrates the versatility of the technique, as any function can be used as the basis for point selection.

**Example 3: 3D Grid Reduction based on Gradient Magnitude**

Expanding beyond 2D, this example demonstrates a reduction in a 3D grid by evaluating the magnitude of the gradient at each point. This approach, often applied in scientific computing and medical image processing, allows for the preservation of points with significant variations in their local surroundings.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import sobel

def gradient_magnitude(grid):
    """Calculate the magnitude of the gradient of the 3D grid."""
    grad_x = sobel(grid, axis=0)
    grad_y = sobel(grid, axis=1)
    grad_z = sobel(grid, axis=2)
    return np.sqrt(grad_x**2 + grad_y**2 + grad_z**2)

def reduce_3d_grid_by_gradient(grid, threshold):
    """Reduces a 3D grid based on the magnitude of the gradient."""
    grad_mag = gradient_magnitude(grid)
    mask = grad_mag > threshold
    reduced_coords = np.argwhere(mask)
    reduced_grid_values = grid[mask]
    return reduced_grid_values, reduced_coords

# Example Usage
grid_3d = np.random.rand(30, 30, 30)
threshold_3d = 0.5
reduced_grid_3d, reduced_coords_3d = reduce_3d_grid_by_gradient(grid_3d, threshold_3d)
print(f"Original 3D Grid Shape: {grid_3d.shape}")
print(f"Reduced Grid Size: {reduced_grid_3d.shape}")
print(f"Reduced Grid Coordinates: {reduced_coords_3d}")
```

Here, the `gradient_magnitude` function calculates the gradient across all three axes using `scipy.ndimage.sobel`. The squared components of the gradient are then summed, and the square root provides the overall gradient magnitude at each point. The `reduce_3d_grid_by_gradient` function creates a mask by thresholding this magnitude, effectively removing points where the gradient is below a certain value, retaining the ones with larger gradient magnitudes. The reduced grid values along with their coordinates are returned. This demonstrates how the methodology generalises to higher dimensions, maintaining the same fundamental principles of applying a function and utilising a threshold for selection.

For individuals wishing to explore related topics further, I would recommend investigating resources on the NumPy library for array manipulation, scipy.ndimage for image processing and filtering, and the mathematical concepts behind gradient descent and statistical measures such as standard deviation. Understanding data structures and algorithms related to spatial partitioning (such as quadtrees or octrees) can further enhance the performance of these techniques, particularly when handling extremely large datasets. Furthermore, exploring material related to computational geometry and mesh reduction algorithms would provide additional context on how these techniques apply in broader scientific computing contexts.
