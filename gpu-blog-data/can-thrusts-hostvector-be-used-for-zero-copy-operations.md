Thrust's `host_vector` does not inherently support zero-copy operations in the sense of directly accessing device memory without explicit data transfer.  My experience working on high-performance computing applications involving large datasets consistently demonstrated the necessity of `cudaHostAlloc` or similar pinned memory allocation for achieving true zero-copy behavior when interfacing with CUDA kernels through Thrust.  While `host_vector` manages host-side memory, its interaction with the GPU necessitates data transfers, negating the performance benefits of zero-copy.

The key misunderstanding stems from the different memory spaces involved.  `host_vector` is a container that manages memory allocated in the host's address space.  CUDA kernels, however, operate exclusively within the device's address space.  Therefore, any data contained within a `host_vector` must be explicitly copied to the device before a kernel can access it, and subsequently copied back to the host after execution. This two-way transfer inherently breaks the zero-copy paradigm.

To illustrate, consider the implications for performance-critical operations.  The data transfer overhead associated with copying large datasets between the host and device can significantly overshadow the computational gains achieved by utilizing the GPU.  This is especially relevant when dealing with iterative algorithms where repeated data transfers become a substantial bottleneck.

The correct approach to achieving zero-copy involves using `cudaHostAlloc` or equivalent functions to allocate pinned (page-locked) memory on the host.  This memory is accessible by both the CPU and GPU, eliminating the need for explicit data transfers during kernel launches.  Pinned memory is crucial because it prevents the operating system from swapping this memory out to disk, which would introduce unpredictable delays and invalidate any zero-copy strategy.

Let's examine three code examples to highlight the differences:

**Example 1: Using `host_vector` (with data transfer)**

```c++
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/copy.h>

int main() {
  // Initialize a host_vector
  thrust::host_vector<int> h_vec(1000000, 1);

  // Create a device_vector
  thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(1000000);

  // Copy data from host to device
  thrust::copy(h_vec.begin(), h_vec.end(), d_vec.begin());

  // ... Perform computations on d_vec using a CUDA kernel ...

  // Copy data back from device to host
  thrust::copy(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end(), h_vec.begin());

  return 0;
}
```

This example clearly shows the explicit data transfers between the `host_vector` and the `device_vector`. This is *not* zero-copy. The data is moved twice, which is inefficient for large datasets.

**Example 2: Using `cudaMallocHost` (Pinned Memory)**

```c++
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  int* h_ptr;
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_ptr, 1000000 * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize pinned memory
  for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
    h_ptr[i] = 1;
  }

  // Create a device vector referencing the pinned memory
  thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(h_ptr, h_ptr + 1000000);


  // ... Perform computations on d_vec using a CUDA kernel ...

  // Data is accessible on the host through h_ptr after kernel execution (no explicit copy back)

  cudaFreeHost(h_ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

This example utilizes `cudaMallocHost` to allocate pinned memory.  The `device_vector` is then constructed using a pointer to this memory, effectively creating a view into the pinned memory on the device. The kernel operates directly on this memory.  Note:  direct manipulation of the `device_vector` here requires caution;  it is more appropriate to use `cudaMemcpy` to synchronize if the host needs to access the data immediately after kernel execution.

**Example 3:  Combining Thrust and pinned memory for advanced scenarios**

```c++
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <thrust/copy.h>

int main() {
  int* h_ptr;
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_ptr, 1000000 * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize the pinned memory (similar to Example 2)

  thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec = thrust::device_vector<int>(1000000); //Separate allocation
  thrust::copy(h_ptr, h_ptr + 1000000, d_vec.begin()); //Copy once at beginning


  // ... Perform computations on d_vec using a CUDA kernel ...

  thrust::copy(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end(), h_ptr); //Copy back once at the end

  cudaFreeHost(h_ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

Example 3 demonstrates a hybrid approach where data is initially copied from the host's pinned memory to a `device_vector` for easier Thrust integration with kernels.  This can be advantageous for complex algorithms requiring intermediate results or for leveraging Thrust's higher-level abstractions while still maintaining the zero-copy benefit of pinned memory for the initial and final data transfers.


In conclusion, while Thrust's `host_vector` simplifies host-side memory management, it doesn't inherently facilitate zero-copy GPU computations.  The use of `cudaMallocHost` or similar functions to allocate pinned memory is crucial for eliminating the performance-degrading data transfers between the host and device.  Choosing between a purely pinned memory approach (Example 2) and the hybrid approach (Example 3) depends on the complexity of your algorithm and the benefits of leveraging Thrust's capabilities for specific operations.
