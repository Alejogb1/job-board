The problem of finding the most likely intersection point of multiple multivariate Gaussian distributions lacks a closed-form solution, unlike the simpler case of finding the intersection of two univariate Gaussians.  This is a consequence of the complex interplay between the covariance matrices and means of the individual distributions.  My experience in developing Bayesian inference systems for high-dimensional sensor data frequently encountered this challenge, requiring the development of iterative numerical methods.  The most robust approach, in my opinion, centers around maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) within a suitably constrained optimization framework.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The intersection of multiple Gaussian distributions isn't a single point, but rather a region of higher probability density where the probability densities of all distributions overlap significantly.  We aim to find the point within this region that maximizes the joint probability density.  This is equivalent to finding the point that maximizes the product of the individual probability density functions (PDFs).  Mathematically, given *k* multivariate Gaussian distributions, each characterized by mean vector  μ<sub>i</sub> and covariance matrix Σ<sub>i</sub> (i = 1,...,k), we seek to maximize the following function:

P(x) = Π<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup>  N(x | μ<sub>i</sub>, Σ<sub>i</sub>)

where N(x | μ<sub>i</sub>, Σ<sub>i</sub>) represents the PDF of the *i*-th multivariate Gaussian distribution.  This is a non-linear, multi-dimensional optimization problem.  Direct analytical solutions are impractical for more than a couple of distributions and even then, are computationally expensive. Therefore, iterative numerical optimization techniques are necessary.  Methods such as gradient ascent, Newton's method, or more robust methods like Nelder-Mead are commonly employed.  The choice depends on the dimensionality of the problem and the characteristics of the covariance matrices (e.g., positive definiteness, conditioning).  Furthermore, constraints might be necessary to ensure the solution lies within a physically meaningful region.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples utilize Python with the `numpy` and `scipy` libraries.  I've chosen these specifically for their efficiency and robustness in numerical computations within scientific contexts;  I’ve used them extensively in my work involving Gaussian process regression and Kalman filtering.


**Example 1: Nelder-Mead Optimization**

This example uses the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, a derivative-free method well-suited for non-smooth or noisy objective functions.  It's particularly robust when dealing with ill-conditioned covariance matrices.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal

def multivariate_gaussian_product(x, means, covariances):
    """Calculates the product of multivariate Gaussian PDFs."""
    product = 1.0
    for i in range(len(means)):
        product *= multivariate_normal.pdf(x, mean=means[i], cov=covariances[i])
    return -product  # Minimize the negative of the product

# Example data (three 2D Gaussian distributions)
means = [np.array([1, 2]), np.array([3, 1]), np.array([2, 3])]
covariances = [np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]]), np.array([[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]), np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])]

# Initial guess
x0 = np.array([2, 2])

# Optimization using Nelder-Mead
result = minimize(multivariate_gaussian_product, x0, args=(means, covariances), method='Nelder-Mead')

print("Most likely intersection point:", result.x)
print("Negative Log-Likelihood at intersection:", result.fun)
```

**Example 2: Gradient Ascent**

This example demonstrates a gradient ascent approach. It requires calculating the gradient of the log-likelihood function, which involves derivatives of the multivariate Gaussian PDF.  This approach offers faster convergence than Nelder-Mead for well-behaved functions.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal
from scipy.linalg import inv

def log_likelihood(x, means, covariances):
    """Calculates the log-likelihood of the product of Gaussians."""
    log_likelihood = 0
    for i in range(len(means)):
        diff = x - means[i]
        log_likelihood += -0.5 * np.dot(diff.T, np.dot(inv(covariances[i]), diff)) - 0.5 * np.log(np.linalg.det(covariances[i])) - len(means[0])/2 * np.log(2 * np.pi)
    return log_likelihood

def gradient_ascent(x0, means, covariances, learning_rate=0.1, iterations=1000, tolerance=1e-6):
    x = x0
    for i in range(iterations):
        grad = np.zeros_like(x)
        for j in range(len(means)):
            diff = x - means[j]
            grad += -np.dot(inv(covariances[j]), diff)
        x_new = x + learning_rate * grad
        if np.linalg.norm(x_new - x) < tolerance:
            break
        x = x_new
    return x

#Using the same means and covariances from Example 1
x0 = np.array([2,2])
most_likely_point = gradient_ascent(x0, means, covariances)
print("Most likely intersection point (Gradient Ascent):", most_likely_point)
```


**Example 3:  Handling Singular Covariance Matrices**

Real-world data often leads to singular or near-singular covariance matrices.  The previous methods may fail in such cases.  Regularization techniques are crucial. This example adds a small diagonal matrix to the covariance matrices to ensure positive definiteness.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal
from numpy.linalg import slogdet

def regularized_multivariate_gaussian_product(x, means, covariances, regularization):
    product = 1.0
    for i in range(len(means)):
        regularized_cov = covariances[i] + regularization * np.eye(covariances[i].shape[0])
        try:
            product *= multivariate_normal.pdf(x, mean=means[i], cov=regularized_cov)
        except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
            # Handle potential errors during PDF calculation
            return np.inf  # Return a large value to penalize this point

    return -product

# Example with a near-singular covariance matrix
means = [np.array([1, 2]), np.array([3, 1]), np.array([2, 3])]
covariances = [np.array([[1, 0.99], [0.99, 1]]), np.array([[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]), np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])]
regularization = 1e-6 #small regularization parameter

x0 = np.array([2, 2])
result = minimize(regularized_multivariate_gaussian_product, x0, args=(means, covariances, regularization), method='Nelder-Mead')

print("Most likely intersection point (with regularization):", result.x)

```
