CUDA project creation within Parallel Nsight 2.2 hinges on the understanding that the IDE acts primarily as a visual front-end, leveraging underlying build systems like Make or CMake.  Direct project creation isn't a feature within Parallel Nsight itself; rather, it facilitates debugging and profiling of pre-existing CUDA projects.  My experience troubleshooting this for several high-performance computing clients clarified this point.  The process involves setting up the build environment independently, and then integrating that environment within Parallel Nsight.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The critical first step is to define and build your CUDA project using a build system external to Parallel Nsight.  This build system manages the compilation of your CUDA kernels (.cu files) and the linking of your host code (typically C++).  Once compiled, Parallel Nsight then utilizes the generated executables for debugging and profiling.  This decoupling is key;  Parallel Nsight doesn't replace your build process, but augments it.  Furthermore, the success of integration is directly correlated to how correctly the build system is configured.  Incorrectly specified include paths, library paths, or compiler flags can lead to build failures and prevent Parallel Nsight from recognizing your project.  Therefore, meticulous attention to the build system is crucial before invoking Parallel Nsight.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate project setup using Make, CMake, and a rudimentary example illustrating the kernel call. Remember that these examples represent simplified scenarios; real-world projects often demand more intricate build configurations.

**Example 1: Make-based Project**

This example uses a simple Makefile to compile a CUDA kernel that adds two vectors.

```makefile
# Makefile for CUDA vector addition

# CUDA compiler
NVCC := /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc # Adjust path as needed

# Source files
SOURCES := vector_add.cu main.cpp

# Object files
OBJECTS := $(SOURCES:.cu=.o) $(SOURCES:.cpp=.o)

# Executable
EXECUTABLE := vector_add

all: $(EXECUTABLE)

$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECTS)
	$(NVCC) -o $@ $^

%.o: %.cu
	$(NVCC) -c $< -o $@

%.o: %.cpp
	g++ -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f $(EXECUTABLE) $(OBJECTS)
```

`vector_add.cu`:

```cuda
__global__ void vectorAdd(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}
```

`main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Include the kernel definition
// ... (vectorAdd function declaration would go here) ...

int main() {
  // ... (host code for vector addition, memory allocation, kernel launch, etc.) ...
  return 0;
}
```

After building this with `make`, you can launch the `vector_add` executable within Parallel Nsight for debugging and profiling.  The Makefile's crucial aspect is how it explicitly calls `nvcc` for CUDA code compilation and `g++` for the host code.  This separation is essential for CUDA projects.

**Example 2: CMake-based Project**

CMake offers superior cross-platform compatibility. This example uses CMake to achieve the same vector addition.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(VectorAdd)

set(CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "70") # Specify CUDA architecture

add_executable(vector_add main.cpp vector_add.cu)
target_link_libraries(vector_add cudart)
```

`main.cpp` and `vector_add.cu` remain the same as in the Make example. CMake's `find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)` could be added for more robust CUDA library detection; however, for simplicity, we assumed a pre-configured environment. The crucial line is `target_link_libraries(vector_add cudart)` explicitly linking the CUDA runtime library.

**Example 3: Simple CUDA Kernel (Illustrative)**

This illustrates a minimalistic kernel to highlight kernel launch and configuration within the host code.  Note that error handling is omitted for brevity.

```cuda
__global__ void simpleKernel(int* data, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        data[i] *= 2;
    }
}
```

This kernel, when launched with appropriate grid and block dimensions, doubles the values in the input array.  Integrating this into either a Make-based or CMake-based project would follow the structure outlined in the preceding examples.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The CUDA Toolkit documentation.  Thorough understanding of CUDA programming is foundational.
*   The Parallel Nsight documentation. It provides detailed steps and troubleshooting guides.
*   A comprehensive C++ programming guide.  Strong C++ foundations are crucial for writing efficient host code.
*   A text on parallel programming concepts. This provides valuable context for understanding CUDA's parallel execution model.


In summary, creating a CUDA project compatible with Parallel Nsight 2.2 necessitates a robust understanding of build systems (Make or CMake) and CUDA programming.  Parallel Nsight's role is primarily in the debugging and profiling stages, not in project creation itself.  A clean and well-structured build system ensures a smooth integration with Parallel Nsight, providing a seamless workflow for debugging and performance analysis.  My years working with performance-critical applications solidified the importance of this clear separation of concerns.  Rushing the project setup phase is frequently the root cause of integration problems.  The accuracy of compiler flags and linking libraries cannot be overstated.
