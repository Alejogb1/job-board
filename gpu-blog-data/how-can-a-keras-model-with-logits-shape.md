The discrepancy between a Keras model outputting logits of shape `(None, 2)` and having labels of shape `(None, 1)` requires careful handling, specifically in how the loss function is applied and interpreted. The core issue lies in the model producing a two-element vector per sample, typically representing unscaled probabilities for two classes (hence, logits), while the provided labels are single values, presumably representing the class index. To bridge this gap, we need to use a loss function designed to operate correctly in this scenario, and potentially adjust label encoding prior to use.

In essence, the model isn't wrong to output `(None, 2)`; it's designed for multi-class classification, where each index in the output vector corresponds to a specific class. A shape of `(None, 1)` suggests a single class label, often encoded as a numerical index indicating the class itself (e.g., 0 or 1). Without appropriate intervention, directly pairing logits of `(None, 2)` with labels of `(None, 1)` will lead to incorrect gradient computations and improper learning. The typical loss function for this mismatch is *Sparse Categorical Crossentropy*.

To understand this, let's imagine a scenario from a previous project. I was developing a binary image classifier using a convolutional neural network in Keras. The final fully connected layer of the model was set up to output a two-element vector of logits â€“ essentially, the unscaled outputs before applying a softmax function. The labels I had, however, were coming in as a one-dimensional array, a column vector containing zeros or ones that indicated the ground truth class for each image. Initially, I naively attempted to use categorical crossentropy, expecting that the model would treat the two elements as independent class scores, which is incorrect for these labels. This resulted in significant errors during model training, showcasing the importance of aligning loss functions with the input label formats.

*Sparse Categorical Crossentropy* is designed precisely to handle the scenario where your model outputs logits for multiple classes and your labels are single integers that represent the class index. This is what I ended up using in the image classification task. The function treats the label as the index corresponding to the correct logit. This avoids the necessity of one-hot encoding labels, simplifying data preparation. When calculating the loss, this function will take the output corresponding to the true class based on the labels and compares that against a target of 1 (or 0 based on calculation method), rather than computing crossentropy on each of output index. This is because the labels are single class index and not a one hot encoded array.

Let's exemplify this using Python and Keras. Consider a very basic Keras model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Dummy model for demonstration
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)  # Output layer with 2 logits
])

# Dummy data: logits of (None, 2)
logits = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 2))
# Dummy data: labels of (None, 1) (Class indices)
labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
```

This first block of code defines a simple model that outputs logits of shape (None, 2) and generates dummy data for logits and integer class labels. To train this model, we would need to specify a loss function. Here's the code demonstrating how to use Sparse Categorical Crossentropy:

```python
# Compile the model with Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (using dummy data)
model.fit(x=tf.random.normal(shape=(100,10)), y=labels, epochs=5)

# Now lets test predictions on new samples
new_samples = tf.random.normal(shape=(10,10))
predictions = model(new_samples)
print(f"Shape of predictions: {predictions.shape}")
print(f"Raw Logits (first 5): {predictions.numpy()[:5]}")
```
Here, `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` is passed to the compiler, with the crucial `from_logits=True` parameter specified. The `from_logits=True` parameter informs the loss function that the input data is not scaled probabilities but the raw, unscaled logits. This ensures the cross entropy calculations are performed correctly. The code then demonstrates training the model using the dummy data and showing the output shape and raw logits output of new samples. This highlights how the model processes new inputs and generate predictions using logits.

If, for some reason, we absolutely must use a categorical crossentropy (which expects one-hot encoded labels), we can pre-process our data prior to passing them into the model. While *Sparse Categorical Crossentropy* is preferred in the given scenario, one-hot encoding can be a solution in specific cases that require or expect it. Note that this is not necessary in the original problem, but presented here for completeness. Here is an example how this might be achieved.

```python
# One-hot encode labels to shape (None, 2)
one_hot_labels = tf.one_hot(tf.squeeze(labels, axis=1), depth=2)

# Compile the model with Categorical Crossentropy
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x=tf.random.normal(shape=(100,10)), y=one_hot_labels, epochs=5)

# New samples
new_samples = tf.random.normal(shape=(10,10))
predictions = model(new_samples)
print(f"Shape of predictions: {predictions.shape}")
print(f"Raw Logits (first 5): {predictions.numpy()[:5]}")
```

In this example, we apply `tf.one_hot` to convert the labels from indices to their one-hot encoded representation. Notice the shape of the one-hot labels becomes `(None, 2)`. After this pre-processing, we can use categorical crossentropy. Note that for this, we need to drop the `sparse` keyword and use `CategoricalCrossentropy`. Furthermore, we still need the `from_logits=True` parameter specified here too. This code demonstrates the same training and prediction, but with the labels preprocessed using the one hot encoding and using `CategoricalCrossentropy`. This highlights the differences in how each loss function is used with differently shaped label inputs.

In practical scenarios, opting for *Sparse Categorical Crossentropy* directly simplifies the training process and reduces the need for one-hot encoding when working with integer class labels. In contrast, if the original data was already in a one-hot encoded format, then the plain *Categorical Crossentropy* would be the better option. The choice, therefore, needs to be contextualized based on the nature of the labels you have at hand.

For those seeking further information on this topic, I recommend exploring documentation on `tf.keras.losses` module, which provides an exhaustive overview of the different loss functions and their appropriate usage. Additionally, books and online resources that elaborate on deep learning foundations, especially loss functions used in classification problems, can be very useful. Finally, numerous public deep learning courses and tutorials often cover the topic of label formats and their impact on the choice of loss function. Focusing on these materials and examples should provide a comprehensive understanding of how models can be trained effectively with different output shapes and label formats.
