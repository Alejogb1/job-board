The challenge with applying the Swin Transformer, a model designed for processing fixed-size inputs, to images of varying dimensions in TensorFlow and Keras centers on the architecture's reliance on a fixed grid-based partitioning of the input. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks which can implicitly handle varying input sizes due to their kernel sliding nature, the Swin Transformer's patch embedding layer and subsequent window-based attention mechanisms are initially defined for a specific image resolution. Adapting it for arbitrary sizes involves careful preprocessing and, occasionally, modifications to how positional embeddings are handled. My work in developing a medical image analysis pipeline highlighted this precise issue, demanding an adaptable approach for different scan resolutions.

The core solution lies in two primary steps: first, adapting the input image to a uniform patch size compatible with the Swin Transformer's expected input, and second, managing the positional embeddings effectively to account for the potentially varied number of patches. The Swin Transformer divides the input image into non-overlapping patches, typically with a fixed size such as 4x4 or 2x2 pixels. These patches are then flattened and linearly projected to a higher-dimensional embedding space, acting as the sequence inputs to the transformer blocks. Images with differing resolutions, therefore, will produce a different number of these input sequence tokens. Standard implementations require all image to be scaled, usually by resizing.

Resizing introduces information loss and can alter the inherent features within an image. Although this is often necessary, it can be mitigated to some extent. Rather than attempting to modify the core transformer structure (which can prove incredibly challenging without deep model understanding), the approach should focus on ensuring the consistency of the input sequence length and managing positional information. Padding can sometimes be an approach to achieve consistency but this needs careful consideration. The primary method for adapting images of varying size is to resize them. For most use cases, this will need to be handled at a preprocessing level so that the data fits the architecture. This is demonstrated in the examples below.

The first example showcases the basic image resizing process. Assume the Swin Transformer expects an input of 224x224 with patches of 4x4. This snippet shows how images of any size are resized to match that target before being provided to the model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image, target_size=(224, 224)):
  """
  Resizes an image to a target size.

  Args:
      image (tf.Tensor): Input image with arbitrary shape [height, width, channels].
      target_size (tuple): Target height and width for resizing.

  Returns:
      tf.Tensor: Resized image with shape [target_height, target_width, channels].
  """
  resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, target_size)
  return resized_image


# Example usage with dummy image
image_height = 512
image_width = 256
image_channels = 3

dummy_image = tf.random.normal(shape=(image_height, image_width, image_channels))

resized_image = preprocess_image(dummy_image)

print(f"Original image shape: {dummy_image.shape}")
print(f"Resized image shape: {resized_image.shape}")
```

This function, `preprocess_image`, leverages TensorFlow's `tf.image.resize` operation.  The function is highly efficient and can be integrated into a TensorFlow dataset pipeline seamlessly. The image is resized using bilinear interpolation, a common and effective technique. The output demonstrates the change in shape that results from the resizing process, demonstrating the change in dimensions to the pre-defined requirements. If the original image has vastly different aspect ratios from the input of the model, then resizing may introduce severe distortions. In such cases, techniques such as padding may be considered in conjunction with resizing. However, it is important that such preprocessing steps are consistently applied across training and inference.

The second example addresses the typical processing steps that follow the resizing stage and focus on how the image gets converted into patch embeddings for the Swin Transformer. Here the patch embedding function, `create_patch_embeddings`, can be added into the previous preprocessing step. The positional embeddings and normalization layers are added before the image patch embeddings are returned.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_patch_embeddings(image, patch_size=4, embed_dim=96, channels = 3):
  """
  Creates patch embeddings from an image.

  Args:
      image (tf.Tensor): Input image with shape [height, width, channels].
      patch_size (int): Size of the patches to create (patch_size x patch_size).
      embed_dim (int): The dimension of the embeddings.
      channels (int): Number of channels in the input image.

  Returns:
      tf.Tensor: Patch embeddings with shape [num_patches, embed_dim].
  """

  height, width, _ = image.shape
  num_patches_h = height // patch_size
  num_patches_w = width // patch_size
  num_patches = num_patches_h * num_patches_w

  patches = tf.image.extract_patches(
      images=tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0),
      sizes=[1, patch_size, patch_size, 1],
      strides=[1, patch_size, patch_size, 1],
      rates=[1, 1, 1, 1],
      padding="VALID",
  )

  patches = tf.reshape(patches, [num_patches, -1])
  linear_projection = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=embed_dim)
  patch_embeddings = linear_projection(patches)

  #Positional embedding layer
  pos_embed = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=[1, num_patches, embed_dim]))
  pos_embed_broadcasted = tf.tile(pos_embed, [tf.shape(patches)[0], 1, 1])

  patch_embeddings = patch_embeddings + pos_embed_broadcasted

  patch_embeddings = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-5)(patch_embeddings)

  return patch_embeddings


# Example usage
image_height = 224
image_width = 224
image_channels = 3
dummy_image = tf.random.normal(shape=(image_height, image_width, image_channels))

patch_embeddings = create_patch_embeddings(dummy_image)
print(f"Patch embeddings shape: {patch_embeddings.shape}")

```

The code extracts patches using `tf.image.extract_patches`, reshapes them, and applies a linear projection layer. A positional embedding is then added and the output normalised.  The shape of the resulting patch embeddings tensor demonstrates that the input is now compatible with the Swin Transformer's initial processing steps.  This code encapsulates the core transformation of the image data into a format suitable for transformer processing. Careful attention is paid to generating and broadcasting positional embeddings, a vital step often requiring precise management in the case of variable-sized images.

Finally, the third example focuses on integrating the pre-processing steps within a simplified Keras model. This will include the image resizing and patch embedding generation within a single function, before providing the embeddings to a dummy transformer block. This encapsulates the process required to load an image and pass it to a Swin Transformer-like architecture.

        x = inputs
        for transformer_block in self.transformer_blocks:
            x = transformer_block(x)

embed_dim = 96
num_heads = 8
mlp_dim = 384
num_transformer_blocks = 2

preprocessed_embeddings = preprocess_and_embed(dummy_image, embed_dim=embed_dim, channels = image_channels)

output = model(preprocessed_embeddings)
print(f"Model output shape: {output.shape}")
```

The `preprocess_and_embed` function is a higher level function that ensures both the resizing and patch embedding are performed within a single step, thus cleaning the model pipeline. This then feeds to a very basic dummy transformer layer so that the functionality is demonstrated within a model structure. It is evident from the shape of the `output` tensor that a transformer architecture accepts the embeddings. This encapsulation simplifies model construction. This model demonstrates the complete pipeline for adapting images of varying sizes, from preprocessing to consumption by a simplified transformer architecture.

For those looking to delve further, resources focused on image preprocessing with TensorFlow are essential for handling various augmentation techniques. Publications covering attention mechanisms and transformer architectures, particularly those focused on the Swin Transformer, are critical for in-depth understanding. The original Swin Transformer paper, alongside code repositories providing reference implementations (though often in frameworks other than TensorFlow initially), serve as primary references. Model training guidelines on large image datasets are a further important resource.  Understanding the limitations and trade-offs of resizing versus other preprocessing strategies is crucial for achieving optimal performance. Careful hyperparameter tuning with the image preprocessing settings is also essential for optimal results.
