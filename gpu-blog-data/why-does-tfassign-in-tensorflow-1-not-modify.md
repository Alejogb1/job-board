The core issue with `tf.assign` in TensorFlow 1.x stems from its deferred execution nature.  Unlike eager execution introduced in TensorFlow 2.x, TensorFlow 1.x relies on building a computation graph before execution.  `tf.assign` adds an assignment operation to this graph, but doesn't immediately change the variable's value.  The value is only updated after the session runs the graph containing the assignment operation.  This often leads to unexpected behavior, particularly for those transitioning from imperative programming paradigms. I've encountered this pitfall numerous times during my work on large-scale machine learning models utilizing TensorFlow 1.x for distributed training.

**Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.x employs a symbolic computation graph.  Variables are placeholders within this graph, not directly mutable objects as in standard Python.  `tf.assign` constructs a node in the graph representing the assignment; it doesn't alter the variable's value *in situ*. The actual assignment happens only when the session runs this graph, executing the assignment operation. Failure to explicitly run the session, or incorrect session management, results in the perceived lack of modification.  The variable retains its initial value until the assignment operation within the computational graph is executed.  This is a crucial difference from languages with eager execution where changes are immediate.  This behavior, while counterintuitive initially, is fundamental to TensorFlow 1.x's performance optimization strategies for large-scale computations.

Let's clarify this with illustrative examples.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Usage Leading to No Apparent Change**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a TensorFlow 1.x variable
with tf.Graph().as_default():
    my_variable = tf.Variable(initial_value=5, name='my_var')

    # Assignment operation
    assign_op = tf.assign(my_variable, 10)

    # Check the value BEFORE running the session â€“ it will not be modified yet.
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        print(f"Value before assignment: {my_variable.eval(session=sess)}") # Output: 5

        # The assignment only occurs after running assign_op within a session
        sess.run(assign_op)
        print(f"Value after assignment: {my_variable.eval(session=sess)}")  # Output: 10

        #  Accessing the variable outside the session context will raise an error.
        # print(my_variable.eval()) # This will raise an error

```

This example explicitly demonstrates the deferred execution.  The `tf.assign` operation creates an assignment *node* in the computation graph. The value of `my_variable` only changes after `sess.run(assign_op)` executes this node.  Failure to execute this node within a session context will leave the variable unchanged.


**Code Example 2:  Using `tf.control_dependencies` for Sequential Operations**

In situations requiring sequential operations where the result of one assignment influences the next, `tf.control_dependencies` ensures correct ordering within the computation graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default():
    a = tf.Variable(initial_value=2, name='a')
    b = tf.Variable(initial_value=3, name='b')

    assign_a = tf.assign(a, a * 2) # Assign a = a*2
    with tf.control_dependencies([assign_a]): # Ensures 'assign_a' executes before 'assign_b'
        assign_b = tf.assign(b, a + b) # Assign b = a + b (after a has been updated)


    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        sess.run([assign_a, assign_b])
        print(f"Value of a: {a.eval(session=sess)}")  # Output: 4
        print(f"Value of b: {b.eval(session=sess)}")  # Output: 7
```

Here, `tf.control_dependencies` ensures that `assign_b` only executes after `assign_a` is completed.  Without this, `assign_b` would use the original value of `a`, leading to an incorrect result.  This is crucial for correctly managing dependencies in complex computation graphs.


**Code Example 3:  Illustrating the Importance of `tf.global_variables_initializer()`**

The `tf.global_variables_initializer()` is essential for initializing variables before any operations involving them.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default():
    var = tf.Variable(0, name='my_var')
    assign_op = tf.assign(var, 10)

    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # Missing tf.global_variables_initializer() will result in an uninitialized variable error.
        #sess.run(assign_op) #This line will raise an error if initializer is missing.
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) #Crucial for initializing the variable
        sess.run(assign_op)
        print(f"Variable value: {var.eval(session=sess)}") # Output: 10

```

Omitting `tf.global_variables_initializer()` leads to an uninitialized variable error when attempting to run the assignment operation.  The initializer ensures that variables are properly set to their initial values before any operations are performed.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation (specifically the sections on variables, sessions, and graph execution).
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering TensorFlow.  Pay close attention to chapters that address computational graph concepts.
*   Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on graph construction and management.



Understanding the deferred execution model of TensorFlow 1.x is pivotal for effectively using `tf.assign`.  Properly managing sessions and utilizing mechanisms like `tf.control_dependencies` ensures correct variable modification and prevents common pitfalls arising from the graph-based nature of this framework.  The shift to eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x significantly simplifies this process, but mastering the intricacies of TensorFlow 1.x remains important for maintaining and extending legacy projects or understanding the foundational concepts upon which newer versions build.
