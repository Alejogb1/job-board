The fundamental challenge in combining explanation plans from separate SQL query parts lies in the inherent limitations of the query optimizer's ability to predict the execution plan for a composite query based solely on the plans of its constituent parts.  My experience optimizing complex, multi-stage ETL processes for a large financial institution highlighted this repeatedly.  While individual query plan analysis offers valuable insights, direct summation or naive concatenation of plans is inherently flawed due to the optimizer's cost-based approach and the impact of inter-query dependencies.  A true understanding requires a deeper dive into the optimizer's internal workings and the exploitation of available tools.

**1. Explanation of the Problem and Solution Strategies**

The query optimizer employs heuristic algorithms and cost models to determine the most efficient execution plan for a given SQL statement. This plan considers factors such as table statistics, index availability, data distribution, and available resources.  When we examine plans for individual queries independently, we are missing crucial information: how the optimizer would treat the combined query.  The presence of JOINs, subqueries, or CTEs fundamentally changes the optimization landscape.  The most efficient plan for a combined query often differs significantly from a simple combination of individual query plans.

Therefore, directly combining the explanation plans isn't viable. Instead, we must focus on strategies that allow us to indirectly infer the combined plan's behavior.  These include:

* **Profiling the Combined Query:** The most reliable method is to execute the complete combined query and analyze its execution plan. This approach gives us the definitive answer, reflecting the optimizer's actual choices for the unified query.  This allows us to observe the impact of inter-query dependencies on resource allocation and execution order.

* **Analyzing Query Structure for Potential Optimization:** Before running the combined query, carefully examine the structure of the individual queries and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.  This preemptive analysis can guide adjustments before profiling the combined query, leading to a more efficient final plan.

* **Using Query Hints (with Caution):**  Some database systems allow the use of query hints to influence the optimizer's behavior.  However, this should be done with extreme caution. Incorrectly applied hints can severely degrade performance.  Hints are best used after thorough profiling and only to address specifically identified inefficiencies, and never as a substitute for understanding the underlying data and query execution.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate these approaches with examples using PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN` command. Assume we have two tables: `customers` and `orders`.

**Example 1: Profiling the Combined Query**

This approach demonstrates the preferred method—profiling the combined query directly.

```sql
-- Query 1: Select customer details
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';

-- Query 2: Select orders for USA customers
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA');

-- Combined Query:  Efficiently integrates both operations
SELECT c.*, o.*
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.country = 'USA';

-- Analyze the execution plan for the combined query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT c.*, o.*
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.country = 'USA';
```

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command provides detailed timing information and the chosen execution plan for the combined query.  This offers the most accurate representation of how the database will execute the complete task.  Note the superior efficiency of the combined approach compared to nested selects, particularly in terms of reduced I/O operations.


**Example 2: Analyzing Query Structure for Optimization**

This example focuses on pre-optimization through structural analysis, before profiling the combined query.

```sql
-- Inefficient Query 1: Unindexed column in WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2023-01-01';

-- Inefficient Query 2:  Full table scan implied
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2023-01-01');

-- Optimized Query 1: Add index to order_date
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders (order_date);

-- Optimized Query 2:  Rewrite for better performance.
SELECT c.* FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date < '2023-01-01';

-- Analyze the execution plan after optimization.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT c.* FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date < '2023-01-01';
```

By adding an index and rewriting the query to utilize a JOIN, we eliminate the nested subquery, thus improving the overall performance. This illustrates the importance of pre-optimization to guide the later profiling process.


**Example 3:  Illustrating the Dangers of Query Hints (to be avoided unless absolutely necessary)**

This example showcases the potential pitfalls of using query hints.

```sql
-- Original Query
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';

-- Query with a potentially harmful hint (PostgreSQL specific)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ seqscan */ * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
```

While `/*+ seqscan */` might seem beneficial, forcing a sequential scan could be catastrophic if an index exists and is more efficient.  This highlights the risk of overriding the optimizer’s choices without a thorough understanding of the data and execution context.  Use hints sparingly and only after significant performance testing and investigation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To enhance your understanding, I recommend reviewing your database system's official documentation on query optimization and the `EXPLAIN` (or equivalent) command. Further, studying advanced SQL topics such as indexing strategies, query rewriting techniques, and database internals will significantly improve your ability to interpret and optimize combined query plans.  Familiarize yourself with the concept of cost-based optimization and its underlying algorithms. Lastly, invest time in profiling tools and techniques specific to your chosen database management system.  These tools can significantly aid in interpreting execution plans and identifying optimization opportunities in complex queries.
