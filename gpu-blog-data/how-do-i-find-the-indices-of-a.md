TensorFlow.js lacks a direct, single-function equivalent to NumPy's `where` or Python's list comprehension for finding indices of specific values within a tensor.  This limitation necessitates a more nuanced approach leveraging TensorFlow.js's capabilities for tensor manipulation and data extraction.  My experience in developing large-scale machine learning models using TensorFlow.js has taught me the efficacy of combining `tf.where`, `tf.gatherND`, and potentially `tf.unstack` for achieving this functionality.


**1. Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in TensorFlow.js's tensor structure. Unlike standard Python lists or NumPy arrays, direct indexing for finding all occurrences of a specific value isn't intrinsically supported.  The solution, therefore, hinges on a two-step process: first, identifying the *locations* of the target value using `tf.where`, and second, extracting the corresponding indices using either `tf.gatherND` or, for simpler cases, `tf.unstack`.

`tf.where(condition)` returns a tensor containing the indices of elements that satisfy a specified condition.  This condition is typically a boolean tensor generated through element-wise comparison of the input tensor with the target value. The output of `tf.where` is a tensor of shape `[N, dimension]`, where `N` is the number of matches and `dimension` is the rank of the input tensor. Each row represents the index of a matching element.

`tf.gatherND(params, indices)` then utilizes these indices to extract the corresponding values from the original tensor.  This is a more general approach suitable for higher-dimensional tensors.  For one-dimensional tensors, `tf.unstack` offers a simpler alternative by converting the tensor into an array, allowing straightforward index extraction.  The choice between `tf.gatherND` and `tf.unstack` depends on the tensor's dimensionality and performance considerations.  For higher-dimensional tensors, `tf.gatherND` offers superior efficiency.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: One-dimensional tensor using `tf.unstack`**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

async function findIndices1D(tensor, targetValue) {
  const unstackedTensor = tf.unstack(tensor);
  const indices = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < unstackedTensor.length; i++) {
    if (unstackedTensor[i].dataSync()[0] === targetValue) {
      indices.push(i);
    }
  }
  return indices;
}


async function main1D() {
  const tensor1D = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]);
  const target = 2;
  const indices = await findIndices1D(tensor1D, target);
  console.log(`Indices of ${target} in tensor1D: `, indices); // Output: Indices of 2 in tensor1D:  [1, 3, 5]
  tensor1D.dispose();
}

main1D();
```

This example demonstrates the simplest case.  `tf.unstack` converts the 1D tensor into an array of scalar tensors.  We iterate through this array, accessing the data synchronously using `dataSync()` and comparing it to the target value.  This approach is straightforward but only suitable for 1D tensors.  Note the crucial `tensor1D.dispose()` call for memory management, a best practice I've consistently employed in my projects to avoid memory leaks.


**Example 2: Two-dimensional tensor using `tf.where` and `tf.gatherND`**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

async function findIndices2D(tensor, targetValue) {
  const indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tensor, targetValue));
  const indexArray = await indices.array();
  indices.dispose();
  return indexArray;
}


async function main2D() {
  const tensor2D = tf.tensor2d([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 2], [7, 2, 9]]);
  const target = 2;
  const indices = await findIndices2D(tensor2D, target);
  console.log(`Indices of ${target} in tensor2D: `, indices); // Output: Indices of 2 in tensor2D:  [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1]]
  tensor2D.dispose();
}

main2D();
```

Here, we employ `tf.where` to find the indices directly.  `tf.equal` generates a boolean tensor indicating the locations of the target value.  `tf.where` then extracts these indices.  The result is a 2D array, where each inner array represents the row and column index of a matching element.  Again, memory management through `indices.dispose()` is critical.


**Example 3: Higher-dimensional tensor, error handling, and asynchronous operations**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

async function findIndicesND(tensor, targetValue) {
  try {
    const indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tensor, targetValue));
    const indexArray = await indices.array();
    indices.dispose();
    if (indexArray.length === 0) {
      return "Target value not found.";
    }
    return indexArray;
  } catch (error) {
    return `Error: ${error.message}`;
  }
}


async function mainND() {
  const tensor3D = tf.tensor3d([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 2], [7, 8]]], [2, 2, 2]);
  const target = 2;
  const indices = await findIndicesND(tensor3D, target);
  console.log(`Indices of ${target} in tensor3D: `, indices); // Output: Indices of 2 in tensor3D:  [[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1]]
  tensor3D.dispose();

  const tensorEmpty = tf.tensor1d([]);
  const indicesEmpty = await findIndicesND(tensorEmpty, 5);
  console.log("Indices in empty tensor:", indicesEmpty); // Output: Target value not found.
}

mainND();
```

This example extends the functionality to higher-dimensional tensors and incorporates robust error handling. The `try...catch` block gracefully handles potential errors, such as the target value not existing in the tensor.  The function also checks for empty tensors to prevent unexpected behavior.  The asynchronous nature of TensorFlow.js operations is explicitly managed using `async/await`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow.js API documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on linear algebra and tensor operations.  A practical guide to JavaScript asynchronous programming.  These resources provide the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to effectively work with tensors and implement sophisticated data manipulation techniques.  Understanding these concepts is paramount for efficient TensorFlow.js development, and my own proficiency in these areas has allowed me to successfully tackle numerous complex tasks.
