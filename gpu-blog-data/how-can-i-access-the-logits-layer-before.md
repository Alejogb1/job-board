Accessing the logits layer, the raw output of a neural network's final linear transformation before the softmax activation, requires a specific approach in Keras because by default, the model typically outputs the softmax probabilities directly. This is crucial for tasks beyond simple classification, including implementing contrastive losses, calculating gradient-based saliency maps, or manipulating intermediate outputs in complex architectures. My experience, particularly when working on a project involving adversarial robustness, has underscored the necessity of retrieving these raw scores; the probabilities generated post-softmax can mask valuable information.

The standard Keras model, constructed sequentially or using the functional API, often concludes with a Dense layer followed by a softmax activation for multi-class classification. To access the logits, I've consistently employed one of two primary strategies: building a new model that explicitly outputs the pre-softmax layer or, alternatively, using a Keras backend function to extract the intermediate tensor from an existing model. I've found the former strategy to be more transparent for debugging and less prone to issues related to Keras backend changes, and I will elaborate on its usage here.

The fundamental idea is to redefine the model up to, but not including, the final softmax operation. Consider a basic sequential model for a 10-class classification problem constructed in Keras. A common implementation looks like this:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Final softmax activation
])
```

To extract the logits, I would build a second model that contains all layers *except* the final softmax activation layer. This newly created model explicitly returns the raw outputs before the probability normalization:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Build a model up to the penultimate layer (before softmax)
logits_model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)  # No activation here - returns logits
])

# Optional: Transfer weights from the original model if it was already trained.
# Be careful when using pre-trained weights to ensure their dimensionality matches.
# In this case, they match exactly.
for i in range(len(logits_model.layers)):
    logits_model.layers[i].set_weights(model.layers[i].get_weights())
```

In this revised example, the `logits_model` shares the same structure and weights as the original model, with the exception of the final activation function. The final layer in `logits_model` returns the unnormalized logits as a tensor. Now, instead of using `model.predict(input_data)`, the logits can be accessed using `logits_model.predict(input_data)`.

For demonstration purposes, consider a different, more complex case using the functional API in Keras, where one might need to access an intermediate layer’s logits in a deep neural network that might have branches. Assume this functional architecture as a starting point:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(100,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
branch1 = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
branch2 = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
merged = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])
output = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)
```

To extract the logits from the output layer before applying the softmax, I’d rebuild the model as follows using the functional API:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(100,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
branch1 = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
branch2 = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
merged = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])
output_logits = layers.Dense(10)(merged) # No activation, returns logits

logits_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_logits)

# Optionally transfer weights from the original model.
for i in range(len(logits_model.layers)):
    logits_model.layers[i].set_weights(model.layers[i].get_weights())
```

This approach effectively creates a new model that mirrors the original, but without the final softmax activation. It provides direct access to the logits using the new model's `predict` method. The key difference is that `output_logits` in the new model no longer includes the softmax transformation, directly outputting the linear layer's results.

While the primary strategy is the creation of a separate model, the alternative method involves directly using the Keras backend, a technique I have used for some specialized experiments involving gradient manipulation. To do this, you must explicitly extract the output tensor of the desired layer from an already existing model, and use it to create a new Keras model which returns that tensor as output:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

# Assume the original model is defined as in the first example.
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Final softmax activation
])


input_tensor = model.input
output_logits = model.layers[-1].output # Access output tensor of the last layer

# Build a new Keras Model using functional API that outputs the last layer.
logits_model = keras.Model(inputs = input_tensor, outputs = output_logits)

# Here no weight transfer needs to be performed as it uses the same model
```

In this instance, I use the Keras backend `K` to obtain the tensor output of the last layer using `model.layers[-1].output`. This represents the logits before softmax. Then I construct a new Keras Model that returns that tensor directly. This approach eliminates the need to define model layers again, but it can be less readable and potentially more brittle if the model structure changes. I have encountered situations where the index to access layers needed to be updated based on changes in the architecture. Therefore, I would strongly recommend re-building a separate `logits_model` for robustness.

To further solidify comprehension, I recommend consulting several resources. Start with the official Keras documentation, specifically the sections on the Functional API and custom model layers. Then I would highly advise looking into examples that use the Keras backend for tensor manipulation and custom loss functions. A sound understanding of backpropagation is also fundamental to grasping why access to the logits is critical. Exploring examples that implement gradient-based techniques can be a valuable source of further insights. The official TensorFlow tutorials also have very useful information, particularly related to the underlying tensor manipulations.
