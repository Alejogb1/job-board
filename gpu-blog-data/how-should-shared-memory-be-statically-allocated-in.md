Static allocation of shared memory in CUDA offers performance advantages stemming from its predictable memory access patterns and compile-time optimization potential.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing kernels for geophysical simulations highlighted the crucial role of judicious shared memory usage.  In scenarios involving large datasets and computationally intensive operations, failure to leverage shared memory effectively can significantly impede performance.  Therefore, understanding its static allocation is paramount.

**1. Explanation of Static Allocation**

Unlike dynamic shared memory allocation, which occurs during kernel execution, static allocation reserves shared memory at compile time. This means the size of the shared memory block is fixed and known before the kernel launches. The compiler can then generate highly optimized code, leveraging knowledge of memory layout for better instruction scheduling and coalesced memory accesses. Coalesced access is critical; it significantly reduces the number of memory transactions between the GPU's multiprocessors and global memory, thus accelerating data transfer.

The primary mechanism for statically allocating shared memory is through the `__shared__` keyword within the kernel function declaration.  This keyword precedes variable declarations, reserving the specified memory within the shared memory space of each thread block. The size of the shared memory allocated per block is determined by the size of these variables.  Exceeding the maximum shared memory per multiprocessor, however, results in compilation failure or unexpected behavior if the compiler attempts to spill to global memory.  Therefore, precise sizing is essential.

Furthermore, the static nature of the allocation allows for more effective compiler optimizations. The compiler can perform more aggressive code transformations, including loop unrolling and instruction reordering, knowing the exact memory footprint of the shared memory.  This can lead to significant performance gains compared to dynamic allocation, where the memory layout is less predictable.

In contrast, dynamic shared memory allocation, using functions like `shfl_sync` and `__ballot_sync`, introduces runtime overhead that impacts performance, particularly in latency-sensitive operations. Static allocation minimizes this overhead, leading to more deterministic execution times.  While dynamic allocation offers flexibility, in many computationally-bound scenarios, the predictable performance of static allocation outweighs the flexibility benefits.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition**

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  __shared__ float shared_a[256]; //Static allocation of 256 floats
  __shared__ float shared_b[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    shared_a[threadIdx.x] = a[i];
    shared_b[threadIdx.x] = b[i];
    __syncthreads(); //Synchronize threads within the block

    float sum = shared_a[threadIdx.x] + shared_b[threadIdx.x];
    c[i] = sum;
  }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates basic static allocation.  Two arrays, `shared_a` and `shared_b`, are declared with `__shared__`, reserving 512 bytes of shared memory per block. The `__syncthreads()` call ensures all threads within a block have loaded their data into shared memory before performing the addition.  The size 256 is chosen assuming a block size of 256 threads;  adapting to different block sizes requires adjusting the shared memory allocation accordingly. This illustrates a scenario where the compiler can optimize memory access as the data layout is known a priori.


**Example 2: Matrix Transpose**

```c++
__global__ void matrixTranspose(const float *input, float *output, int width, int height) {
  __shared__ float tile[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_HEIGHT]; //Static allocation based on tile size

  int x = blockIdx.x * TILE_WIDTH + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * TILE_HEIGHT + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    tile[threadIdx.x][threadIdx.y] = input[y * width + x];
    __syncthreads();

    output[x * height + y] = tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x];
  }
}
```

Here, `TILE_WIDTH` and `TILE_HEIGHT` are preprocessor defines specifying the size of a tile processed within shared memory. This kernel transposes a matrix in tiles. The static allocation of `tile` facilitates efficient data reuse within the tile, minimizing global memory accesses. The choice of `TILE_WIDTH` and `TILE_HEIGHT` critically impacts performance and needs careful tuning based on the hardware and problem size;  too large a tile leads to shared memory overflow, while too small a tile diminishes the efficiency of shared memory usage.


**Example 3: Reduction Operation**

```c++
__global__ void reduce(const float *input, float *output, int n) {
  __shared__ float shared_data[256]; //Shared memory for reduction

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  shared_data[threadIdx.x] = (i < n) ? input[i] : 0.0f;

  for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
    __syncthreads();
    if (threadIdx.x < s) {
      shared_data[threadIdx.x] += shared_data[threadIdx.x + s];
    }
  }
  if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
    output[blockIdx.x] = shared_data[0];
  }
}
```

This kernel performs a parallel reduction operation using shared memory.  The reduction is performed within each block.  The statically allocated `shared_data` array facilitates the intermediate summation steps. The `for` loop iteratively reduces the data, utilizing shared memory for efficient communication between threads in the block.  The final result per block is written to global memory.  The synchronization (`__syncthreads()`) is vital to ensure that data is correctly aggregated at each stage of the reduction.  Misuse of this synchronization would lead to race conditions and incorrect results.
