The core principle underlying Naive Bayes classification lies in applying Bayes' theorem with a strong (naive) independence assumption between the features. This assumption, while often unrealistic in practice, significantly simplifies computation and surprisingly often yields effective results, particularly with high-dimensional data.  My experience building spam filters and sentiment analysis systems has consistently demonstrated the efficacy of this approach, especially when computational efficiency is prioritized.  This response will detail the implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, focusing on its underlying mathematical framework and offering illustrative code examples.


**1. Mathematical Foundation:**

The goal is to classify an unseen data point, represented by a feature vector **x** = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ), into one of *k* classes, denoted as C₁, C₂, ..., Cₖ.  Bayes' theorem provides the framework:

P(Cᵢ|**x**) = [P(**x**|Cᵢ) * P(Cᵢ)] / P(**x**)

Where:

* P(Cᵢ|**x**) is the posterior probability of class Cᵢ given the feature vector **x**. This is what we want to maximize to classify **x**.
* P(**x**|Cᵢ) is the likelihood of observing **x** given class Cᵢ.
* P(Cᵢ) is the prior probability of class Cᵢ.
* P(**x**) is the evidence (the probability of observing **x**), which acts as a normalizing constant and can often be ignored during classification as it's consistent across all classes.

The "naive" assumption comes into play when calculating P(**x**|Cᵢ).  We assume that all features are conditionally independent given the class:

P(**x**|Cᵢ) = Πᵢ P(xᵢ|Cᵢ)

This simplification allows us to calculate the likelihood by multiplying the individual probabilities of each feature given the class.  For continuous features, as in the examples below, we often model P(xᵢ|Cᵢ) using a Gaussian distribution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate Gaussian Naive Bayes implementation in Python using scikit-learn and from scratch.  My work on a large-scale customer churn prediction model heavily utilized this approach.


**Example 1: Scikit-learn Implementation**

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your own)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [4, 2], [5, 3], [6, 1], [7,2], [8,3]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1])

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This concise example leverages scikit-learn's built-in GaussianNB class.  It demonstrates a typical workflow: data splitting, model training, prediction, and evaluation. The `random_state` ensures reproducibility.  This is the preferred approach for most applications due to its efficiency and robustness.


**Example 2:  Manual Implementation (Continuous Features)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

class GaussianNaiveBayes:
    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.classes = np.unique(y)
        self.means = {}
        self.stds = {}
        self.priors = {}

        for c in self.classes:
            X_c = X[y == c]
            self.means[c] = np.mean(X_c, axis=0)
            self.stds[c] = np.std(X_c, axis=0)
            self.priors[c] = len(X_c) / len(X)

    def predict(self, X):
        predictions = []
        for x in X:
            posterior_probs = {}
            for c in self.classes:
                likelihood = np.prod(norm.pdf(x, self.means[c], self.stds[c]))
                posterior_probs[c] = likelihood * self.priors[c]
            predicted_class = max(posterior_probs, key=posterior_probs.get)
            predictions.append(predicted_class)
        return np.array(predictions)

# Sample data (same as Example 1)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [4, 2], [5, 3], [6, 1], [7,2], [8,3]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1])

#Splitting data, as before.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = GaussianNaiveBayes()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(y_pred)
```

This example demonstrates a manual implementation, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying calculations.  It explicitly calculates means, standard deviations, and priors for each class and feature. The use of `scipy.stats.norm.pdf` computes the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution. This approach is valuable for educational purposes and allows for customization but lacks the optimization and robustness of scikit-learn.


**Example 3: Handling Categorical Features**

While the previous examples focused on continuous features, Naive Bayes readily handles categorical data.  This is crucial, as many real-world datasets contain both continuous and categorical attributes.  My experience building a document classifier highlighted this aspect.


```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import CategoricalNB
import numpy as np

# Sample data with categorical features
X = np.array([['red', 'small'], ['green', 'big'], ['red', 'big'], ['green', 'small']])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])

#For CategoricalNB, features need to be encoded as integers
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
for i in range(X.shape[1]):
    X[:,i] = le.fit_transform(X[:,i])


# Initialize and train the Categorical Naive Bayes classifier
model = CategoricalNB()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
X_new = np.array([['red', 'big'], ['green', 'small']])
for i in range(X_new.shape[1]):
    X_new[:,i] = le.transform(X_new[:,i])
y_pred = model.predict(X_new)
print(f"Predictions: {y_pred}")

```

This example utilizes `CategoricalNB` from scikit-learn, designed specifically for categorical features.  Note the preprocessing step using `LabelEncoder` to convert categorical values into numerical representations.  The model directly learns the probability distributions for each category within each feature for each class.
