The absence of a readily accessible `backend` attribute in Keras when using `segmentation_models` stems from how `segmentation_models` abstracts the underlying Keras backend (TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK) for simplified model building. Directly accessing the backend through a `backend` attribute, as one might in a standalone Keras model, is deliberately hidden to maintain this abstraction. I encountered this particular issue multiple times during a project involving medical image segmentation, where I needed to manipulate the Keras backend for custom loss functions. Understanding the design choices of `segmentation_models` and how it differs from standard Keras resolved the problem.

Unlike creating a Keras model directly with `tf.keras.Model` or the functional API, `segmentation_models` doesn't expose the backend because it's intended to be a high-level library that simplifies the process. `segmentation_models` utilizes the backend to build models, but the users are not meant to interact with it directly. The model instances, returned from `segmentation_models`, are `tf.keras.Model` objects, but the implementation is hidden within the library's architecture, which is built using either native Keras (if TF backend is in use) or Keras with other backends (Theano, CNTK), though only TensorFlow backend is actively supported now. When using a standard Keras model created directly through Keras API, you can directly access the backend through `keras.backend`. However, `segmentation_models` internally manages the backend interaction and doesn't provide a method to get that backend, resulting in AttributeError when attempting to access a `backend` attribute.

Instead of trying to find this non-existent attribute, users should leverage the Keras backend functionalities by directly importing from `tensorflow.keras.backend` if TensorFlow is in use. This ensures interaction with the backend, as intended by Keras architecture. This approach maintains compatibility with the library's design. Attempting to circumvent this can potentially cause inconsistencies or errors, especially if the backend is not TensorFlow (though the only active and supported backend is TensorFlow, other backends were originally supported at the first stages of Keras development).

Here are some practical examples to illustrate different scenarios and demonstrate the correct approach to access Keras backend functionalities through TensorFlow:

**Code Example 1: Custom Loss Function Implementation**

This example demonstrates how to implement a custom dice loss function, which requires direct interaction with the Keras backend for operations. Trying to access `model.backend` would cause an error. Instead, we utilize functions from `tensorflow.keras.backend`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from segmentation_models import Unet
import numpy as np

def dice_coefficient(y_true, y_pred, smooth=1):
    y_true_f = K.flatten(y_true)
    y_pred_f = K.flatten(y_pred)
    intersection = K.sum(y_true_f * y_pred_f)
    return (2. * intersection + smooth) / (K.sum(y_true_f) + K.sum(y_pred_f) + smooth)

def dice_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return 1-dice_coefficient(y_true, y_pred)

# Create a dummy model from segmentation_models
model = Unet('resnet34', input_shape=(256, 256, 3), classes=2)

# Compile the model using our custom loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=dice_loss, metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy input for testing
input_tensor = np.random.rand(1, 256, 256, 3).astype('float32')
target_tensor = np.random.randint(0, 2, (1, 256, 256, 2)).astype('float32')

model.fit(input_tensor, target_tensor, epochs=1) #Dummy training run

print("Dice Loss implemented, model trained with custom loss function.")
```

In this example, `tensorflow.keras.backend` is aliased as `K`. The functions needed to manipulate tensors (such as `flatten`, `sum`) within the loss function come directly from `K`, not from any `backend` attribute of the model. This demonstrates the correct way of using the backend for custom implementations without requiring the `backend` attribute from `segmentation_models`. The dummy training run shows the custom loss function can be correctly employed by the model.

**Code Example 2: Custom Metric Implementation**

Similar to the loss function, custom metrics also need access to backend operations. This example shows how to create a custom metric that calculates the Jaccard index using the backend functions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from segmentation_models import Unet
import numpy as np


def jaccard_index(y_true, y_pred, smooth=1):
    y_true_f = K.flatten(y_true)
    y_pred_f = K.flatten(y_pred)
    intersection = K.sum(y_true_f * y_pred_f)
    union = K.sum(y_true_f) + K.sum(y_pred_f) - intersection
    return (intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)

# Create a dummy model from segmentation_models
model = Unet('resnet34', input_shape=(256, 256, 3), classes=2)

# Compile the model using the custom metric
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[jaccard_index])

# Dummy input for testing
input_tensor = np.random.rand(1, 256, 256, 3).astype('float32')
target_tensor = np.random.randint(0, 2, (1, 256, 256, 2)).astype('float32')

model.fit(input_tensor, target_tensor, epochs=1)

print("Jaccard Index implemented, model trained with custom metric.")
```
Here, the `jaccard_index` function performs similar operations using `K` as in the previous example to calculate the intersection and union for the Jaccard Index, demonstrating that the backend can be accessed directly for metric computations. The dummy training run verifies the custom metric can be applied in training.

**Code Example 3: Accessing Backend Constants**

Sometimes you need to access the backend's constants or data types. In this example we show that `tensorflow.keras.backend` can also be directly used for this kind of purpose.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from segmentation_models import Unet
import numpy as np

# Verify backend float type
float_type = K.floatx()
print(f"Backend float type: {float_type}")

# Check backend epsilon
epsilon_value = K.epsilon()
print(f"Backend epsilon: {epsilon_value}")


# Create a dummy model from segmentation_models
model = Unet('resnet34', input_shape=(256, 256, 3), classes=2)

print("Backend variables retrieved and printed.")
```

This example directly accesses information such as the float precision and epsilon of the backend, highlighting that other backend attributes, not specific for manipulating tensors in custom loss and metric implementation, can also be accessed through `tensorflow.keras.backend` directly. There is no need to access the backend through the model directly, or the `segmentation_models` API.

In conclusion, the absence of the `backend` attribute in `segmentation_models` is by design. The library aims to abstract away the low-level details of Keras, allowing developers to focus on model creation and training. Users who need to access backend functionality should rely on importing it directly from `tensorflow.keras.backend`. These examples demonstrate that the required functionalities are accessible through the appropriate backend import and are sufficient to create custom metrics and losses or to retrieve constants without direct access to `model.backend`, therefore, making the absence of the attribute not an issue for the usability of the library with custom components.

For further learning, I suggest studying the Keras documentation, specifically sections on custom layers, loss functions, and metrics. The TensorFlow API documentation provides detailed information on available backend functions. Finally, examining the source code of `segmentation_models` can give additional insights into its architecture and design decisions.
