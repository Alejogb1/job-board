Within a scikit-learn pipeline, accessing the precise train/test split indices after model evaluation requires careful consideration because the pipeline itself doesn’t directly retain this information. The standard `train_test_split` function returns these indices, however, a pipeline transforms the data. Specifically, when fitting a pipeline on the training set, transformations occur before the model is trained; therefore, the original indices are not automatically preserved or readily available for direct access after using a pipeline’s `fit` or `fit_transform` methods on the training dataset. This makes it essential to store or regenerate the indices separately and then understand how to align them with transformed data if needed. I’ve encountered this often when trying to analyze the impact of different preprocessing steps on specific data subsets and have developed a reliable approach.

The most straightforward way to retain and correlate the indices with the data after pipeline transformations involves several techniques, all grounded in using `train_test_split` outside of the pipeline, then manually aligning these to the data processed through the pipeline. The core idea is to keep the original indices, apply the pipeline, and then either access or re-compute subsets using these preserved indices.  The pipeline is designed to transform the *features* (X), while leaving the target variable (y), and indices unaffected. Thus, the process is focused around managing X's split using the returned indices.

Let’s examine the following three code examples to clarify this process:

**Example 1: Basic Train/Test Split with Index Retention**

This first example demonstrates the foundational step: performing the train/test split and storing the returned indices. Subsequently, these indices will be employed to extract the corresponding samples from the transformed data.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Perform train/test split, keeping the indices
X_train_indices, X_test_indices, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    np.arange(X.shape[0]), y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

# Separate data according to index sets
X_train = X[X_train_indices]
X_test = X[X_test_indices]

# Define a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# Fit and transform the data
X_train_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = pipeline.transform(X_test)

# Demonstrating the indices: the initial split indices used for X are now useful for retrieving the same rows of X_transformed

print(f"Number of training instances: {len(X_train_transformed)} matches {len(X_train_indices)}")
print(f"Number of testing instances: {len(X_test_transformed)} matches {len(X_test_indices)}")
```

In this example, the crucial aspect is obtaining `X_train_indices` and `X_test_indices` from the `train_test_split` call applied to a sequence of indices created using `np.arange(X.shape[0])`. The actual data, `X` is then subset using these stored index sets.  This ensures the split is consistent across both the original data and any downstream analysis that might refer to particular training or test set entries. The pipeline is then applied to the split sets, and the final print statements confirm the size alignment. I have found in numerous model audits that preserving this alignment between original and transformed data is critical.

**Example 2: Applying Indices to Track Subsets Post-Transformation**

This expands on Example 1, showing how you would actually use these preserved indices for further analysis or debugging after applying transformations using a pipeline.  In my work, I routinely use such approaches to evaluate how different preprocessing steps affect specific types of instances in the dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Perform train/test split, keeping indices
X_train_indices, X_test_indices, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    np.arange(X.shape[0]), y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

X_train = X[X_train_indices]
X_test = X[X_test_indices]

# Define a more complex pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('pca', PCA(n_components=2))
])

# Fit and transform
X_train_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = pipeline.transform(X_test)

# Suppose we need to access the first 5 training samples in both the original
# feature space and transformed feature space:

first_five_original_train = X[X_train_indices[:5]]  # Use the first 5 indices from original set
first_five_transformed_train = X_train_transformed[:5] # directly access from transformed array

print("Original First 5 training sample shape: ", first_five_original_train.shape)
print("Transformed First 5 training sample shape: ", first_five_transformed_train.shape)

# Let’s say we want to find the max value of the second transformed feature for a specific subset
max_second_transformed_feature_all_train = np.max(X_train_transformed[:, 1]) # all training set
max_second_transformed_feature_first_10_train = np.max(X_train_transformed[:10,1]) # first 10 training samples
print(f"Max of second transformed feature all train: {max_second_transformed_feature_all_train}")
print(f"Max of second transformed feature first 10 train: {max_second_transformed_feature_first_10_train}")
```

Here, the pipeline incorporates a PCA step after scaling, simulating a more complex preprocessing workflow. The key is that the indices (`X_train_indices`, `X_test_indices`) obtained from the initial split remain valid for accessing the corresponding samples *in the original feature space*.  The line using slicing on `X_train_transformed[:5]` accesses the transformed space. The example also shows use cases where indices are useful for more granular statistics. It is often invaluable for instance, to compare performance of the model on a specific subset of data, and these indices enable such an analysis.

**Example 3:  Recomputing Indices After Splitting Data with Custom Preprocessing**

This final example explores a situation where more involved preprocessing or filtering might mean recomputing specific sample indices, instead of just subsetting the original array. This occurs frequently when the preprocessing is dynamic, for example, in time series data or when data is filtered based on feature values *before* applying the actual model.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Sample data, time-series format
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
time_stamps = np.arange(100)

# Pre-filtering condition (example: remove samples prior to a specific timestamp)
time_filter_cutoff = 50
filtered_indices = time_stamps >= time_filter_cutoff

X = X[filtered_indices]
y = y[filtered_indices]

# Recompute train/test indices on the filtered data
X_train_indices, X_test_indices, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    np.arange(X.shape[0]), y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

X_train = X[X_train_indices]
X_test = X[X_test_indices]

# Define a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# Fit and transform
X_train_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = pipeline.transform(X_test)


print(f"Number of filtered training instances: {len(X_train_transformed)} matches {len(X_train_indices)}")
print(f"Number of filtered testing instances: {len(X_test_transformed)} matches {len(X_test_indices)}")
print(f"Original number of instances {len(time_stamps)}, Number of filtered instances: {len(X)}")
```

Here, we have added a simple, though meaningful, pre-processing step:  filtering data based on time stamps. After filtering, the indices returned by the split are based on the *filtered* data. Note that the initial indices associated with the complete, unfiltered dataset, have been made unusable. In this scenario, retaining the filtering step’s specific logic, and its result (`filtered_indices`), can be as crucial as preserving split indices. The final print statement shows the impact of filtering on the total number of samples. This example highlights that index management can depend strongly on the processing steps applied to the data prior to the main model training pipeline.

In summary, retrieving train/test split indices within a scikit-learn pipeline involves retaining these indices *outside* the pipeline's scope during the split using `train_test_split`, before data is passed to the pipeline.  One should then use these indices to subset either the original feature space (`X`), or to track corresponding sets of transformed data. Furthermore, care should be taken to recompute the indices if preprocessing steps modify the dataset before the pipeline.  These strategies have consistently been helpful in my experience debugging and interpreting model behavior.

For further exploration of related concepts, I recommend examining documentation on scikit-learn's pipelines and data splitting methods.  Additionally, researching techniques for feature importance analysis, such as SHAP values, can further clarify the impact of transformations on specific instances in the dataset. Discussions around stratified sampling and imbalanced dataset strategies also often touch on the need for careful index management.  Finally, deep dives into pipeline debugging and performance analysis tools will help to solidify these concepts.
