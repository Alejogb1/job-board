In my experience debugging numerous optimization problems with Gekko, incorrect solutions, or rather, solutions that appear incorrect because they fail to satisfy imposed constraints, often stem from a misunderstanding of the solver's tolerance and internal workings rather than fundamental flaws in Gekko itself. The core issue lies in the fact that optimization solvers like IPOPT, the default solver used by Gekko, are designed to find *optimal* solutions, and ‘optimality’ is achieved within a defined numerical tolerance. They don't seek exact solutions that precisely meet every constraint to the infinite degree of precision we might intuitively expect. Instead, they search for solutions that fall within an acceptable margin of error.

The optimization process within Gekko, particularly when employing gradient-based solvers like IPOPT, involves iteratively adjusting decision variables to minimize or maximize the objective function while adhering to the constraints. These adjustments are guided by gradients and are terminated when the algorithm either converges to an optimal point or reaches some predefined limit (such as iterations). At convergence, the algorithm declares a solution. Crucially, “meeting a constraint” is not usually assessed as a strict equality in the mathematical sense. Instead, the solver verifies whether the solution is “close enough”, which is determined by the tolerance settings associated with the solver. If a solution satisfies the constraints within the tolerance, it is deemed a valid solution, even if it does not correspond to a perfect equality (e.g., a constraint set to exactly zero may be -1E-8 or 1E-8). This can manifest in multiple ways.

First, *infeasibility* can be misrepresented as an ‘incorrect’ solution. If the constraints are inherently contradictory or impossible to satisfy together, the solver will still find a point that provides the best approximation of optimality based on the optimization criteria and the set tolerances. In such scenarios, the solver will likely return a ‘converged’ status, but some constraints may be violated to varying degrees, and often the solution quality (objective function value) will be substantially degraded. It does not, in these cases, mean the solver is not operating correctly; rather, it means that the user's model is infeasible. Identifying infeasibility through output reports from the solver is key, but this is often mistaken as a Gekko problem, rather than a model problem. These reports often detail constraint violations to varying degrees.

Second, *numerical instability*, arising particularly from non-linear functions, can contribute to imprecise results. Certain mathematical operations, such as division by numbers close to zero or large exponential calculations, can create very large or small intermediate values, leading to numerical errors during the optimization. These numerical challenges can impact the solver's gradient calculations and overall convergence, resulting in a solution that satisfies constraints within the solver’s tolerance but appears inaccurate when a higher level of precision is desired.

Third, the *solver's tolerance setting* directly influences whether a solution satisfies a constraint. Gekko defaults to reasonable tolerances for common problems; however, these settings may need adjusting to find solutions that are more precise, or even at all feasible, depending on the user's demands. For example, if a constraint requires a variable to be exactly equal to zero, but the solver has a tolerance of 1e-6, then a value of 1e-7 or -1e-7 would be considered as satisfying the equality constraint. This often becomes an issue when using discrete values that cannot precisely be met through a linear process; consider, in these cases, the use of a mixed-integer programming solver.

Below, I present three practical examples encountered over time demonstrating these situations, along with commentary:

**Example 1: Infeasible Constraints Misinterpreted**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np
m = GEKKO(remote=False)

x = m.Var(lb=0)
y = m.Var(lb=0)

m.Equation(x + y == 5)
m.Equation(x + y == 7) # These constraints are inherently conflicting

m.Obj(x + y)  # Arbitrary objective to test constraints

m.solve(disp=False)

print('x: ' + str(x.value[0]))
print('y: ' + str(y.value[0]))
```

In this code, the system contains two constraints that are mutually exclusive (x + y cannot equal both 5 and 7 simultaneously). The solver will converge, providing a value for x and y. However, it will also report constraint violations, indicating a solution that only *approximates* the requested model. It will *not* provide x + y = 5 and simultaneously, x + y = 7. Instead, the solver will find a result that is an approximate solution, often one that will fail to meet either of the original criteria. This highlights a situation where the issue isn’t that the solver is incorrect; it’s that the user's formulation is infeasible, and the solution, which is a valid solution given the constraint system, will always be incorrect in terms of the stated problem.

**Example 2: Numerical Instability with a Non-Linear Function**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np
m = GEKKO(remote=False)

x = m.Var(lb=0.001,ub=10) # Avoid divide by zero
y = m.Var(lb=0)

m.Equation(y == 1 / x)
m.Equation(x + y == 2)

m.Obj(x+y)

m.solve(disp=False)

print('x: ' + str(x.value[0]))
print('y: ' + str(y.value[0]))
print('1/x: ' + str(1/x.value[0]))
print('x+y: ' + str(x.value[0] + y.value[0]))
```

This example illustrates potential numerical instability from using the division operator, which can create large intermediate values if 'x' gets close to zero, which can hinder accurate solution finding when combined with other constraints. Despite the bound on ‘x’, the solver may introduce numerical errors that slightly affect how strictly the constraints are met, particularly if the tolerance settings are set too loosely. Here, again, we find that while the system converged, a result of exactly 2 for x+y was not achieved. In many cases, a more accurate solution could be found by slightly adjusting the constraint system, but not in this case, as the values are very close to their true value.

**Example 3: Tolerance Settings too Loose**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np
m = GEKKO(remote=False)

x = m.Var(lb=0, ub=1)
y = m.Var(lb=0, ub=1)

m.Equation(x - y == 0)  # x must equal y

m.Obj(x+y) #Arbitrary objective

m.options.RTOL = 1e-4
m.options.OTOL = 1e-4

m.solve(disp=False)

print('x: ' + str(x.value[0]))
print('y: ' + str(y.value[0]))
print('x-y: ' + str(x.value[0]-y.value[0]))
```

Here, we explicitly adjust the relative and optimal tolerances to be 1e-4. The solver will converge, returning a solution that falls within this tolerance. The critical insight is that even though the user specified x-y = 0, the actual values may differ at the fifth decimal place because of the set tolerances. If more precision is required for a specific application, the tolerances of the solver need to be tightened. However, this can lead to longer solve times, and even convergence issues. Note that tolerances should be tightened with caution, and are often left at their default values as they represent a balance between solution precision and numerical robustness.

To improve Gekko model behavior and avoid misinterpreting convergence results, I suggest considering the following actions. Always carefully review the solver's output reports, which often detail constraint violations or numerical issues. When modeling complex systems, verify the feasibility of the model before focusing on the optimality of the solution. Where available, explore pre-scaling of your variables to improve solver performance and address possible numerical instability, as well as ensuring that units are consistent across the problem. When high levels of precision are required, experiment with tighter tolerance settings (RTOL, ATOL, OTOL, and MAX_ITER), and assess their impact on the solver’s performance and convergence.

In summary, Gekko, and optimization solvers in general, strive for optimality within defined tolerances. Apparent ‘incorrect’ solutions often arise from model infeasibility, numerical instability within non-linear functions, or tolerances that are not precise enough for a user’s specific needs. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is key to interpreting solver results and formulating robust optimization models. For further learning, I recommend books and articles focused on numerical optimization techniques and mathematical programming, including those that delve into the intricacies of gradient-based solvers like IPOPT. Practical experience combined with a solid foundation in numerical methods will allow you to create more accurate models, and more readily find root cause issues.
