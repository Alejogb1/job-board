GPGPU processing, at its core, repurposes the graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose computations, contrasting sharply with the traditional role of GPUs in rendering graphics. My experience developing high-performance computational fluid dynamics simulations revealed firsthand how this paradigm shift drastically alters programming strategies and hardware utilization compared to standard graphics rendering.

The primary distinction lies in the nature of the computations performed and, consequently, the data access patterns and architectural optimizations required. Graphics rendering, primarily through libraries like OpenGL or DirectX, manipulates vertices, textures, and fragments to generate visual output on a display. This process is highly parallel, processing multiple pixels or triangles simultaneously, yet it relies on a pipeline that flows sequentially through fixed-function stages (vertex processing, rasterization, fragment processing) with limited programmability outside of the fragment and vertex shader stages. Standard graphics applications are, therefore, concerned with streaming large datasets from memory to the GPU, processing them according to a well-defined, often fixed-function, rendering pipeline and, then, displaying them.

In contrast, GPGPU computations using platforms like CUDA or OpenCL, focus on arbitrary calculations across vast, non-graphical datasets. These calculations typically follow the Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) principle, wherein the same operation is performed concurrently on different elements of the dataset, enabling significant acceleration over serial CPU execution. The computational complexity can vary dramatically; data processing is not tied to a rendering pipeline and is tailored to the specific algorithm being implemented, not to producing images. This approach requires a different method of thinking about how to interact with the hardware, emphasizing parallel algorithms and memory management. GPGPU execution also requires a significantly different programming model where the programmer takes more fine-grained control of the execution path and data movement, including explicitly allocating memory in the device memory and copying data to and from the host memory (the RAM of your main machine). In graphics programming, these transfers are largely handled by the graphics driver.

For example, consider implementing a basic matrix multiplication. In graphics, multiplication operations are used for transformations in world space, view space and projection space for vertices. These happen via linear algebra library calls that leverage the specialized hardware in the GPU rendering pipeline. It's hidden from the programmer beyond the high-level operation request. In GPGPU, this low-level control is the key to achieving optimized performance on the GPU.

Here's a basic CUDA example of matrix multiplication:

```cpp
__global__ void matrixMulKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int width) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < width && col < width) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < width; k++) {
            sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
        }
        C[row * width + col] = sum;
    }
}

// Host code for initialization and launch
int main() {
    // Simplified Memory Allocation and Initialization
    int width = 256;
    float* A = (float*)malloc(width * width * sizeof(float));
    float* B = (float*)malloc(width * width * sizeof(float));
    float* C = (float*)malloc(width * width * sizeof(float));

    // Host-side initialization for A and B (simplified)

    float* d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, width * width * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, width * width * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, width * width * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_A, A, width * width * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, B, width * width * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    dim3 dimBlock(16, 16);
    dim3 dimGrid((width + dimBlock.x - 1) / dimBlock.x, (width + dimBlock.y - 1) / dimBlock.y);

    matrixMulKernel<<<dimGrid, dimBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, width);

    cudaMemcpy(C, d_C, width * width * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    
    cudaFree(d_A); cudaFree(d_B); cudaFree(d_C);
    free(A); free(B); free(C);

    return 0;
}
```

This code illustrates the fundamental elements of GPGPU programming. The `matrixMulKernel` function is executed on the GPU, with each thread calculating a single element of the output matrix. The host code, residing on the CPU, allocates memory on both host and device, transfers data to the GPU, launches the kernel, and copies the results back. Notably, the computation is explicitly parallel, which is very different from the implicit, pipeline-driven parallelism of graphics operations.

A second illustration is a basic Monte Carlo simulation which can also be readily adapted to GPGPU, and which has no graphics equivalent in its implementation.

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <random>

__global__ void monteCarloKernel(double* results, int num_iterations) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (idx < num_iterations) {
      std::random_device rd;
      std::mt19937 gen(rd());
      std::uniform_real_distribution<> dist(-1.0, 1.0);
       
      int hits = 0;
       for (int i=0; i < 100; ++i){
          double x = dist(gen);
          double y = dist(gen);
          if (x * x + y * y <= 1.0) {
            hits++;
          }
      }
      results[idx] = 4.0 * static_cast<double>(hits) / 100.0;
    }
}

int main() {
    int num_iterations = 1024*1024;
    size_t size = num_iterations * sizeof(double);

    double* results_host = new double[num_iterations];
    double* results_device;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&results_device, size);

    dim3 block_dim(256);
    dim3 grid_dim((num_iterations + block_dim.x - 1) / block_dim.x);

    monteCarloKernel<<<grid_dim, block_dim>>>(results_device, num_iterations);

    cudaMemcpy(results_host, results_device, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_iterations; ++i) {
      sum += results_host[i];
    }

    double pi_estimate = sum / num_iterations;
    std::cout << "Estimated value of pi: " << pi_estimate << std::endl;

    cudaFree(results_device);
    delete[] results_host;

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the kernel calculates a large number of approximate values for pi using a basic Monte Carlo algorithm. The main thread on the host launches this kernel, transfers the data from the host to the device, executes the kernel on the device, transfers the results back to the host, and then consolidates those results to obtain a global estimate for pi. Again, the parallel data computation and the explicit control over memory transfers differentiate this from graphics usage.

Finally, letâ€™s examine a convolution operation, which is used both in image processing and in GPGPU applications. In graphics this would be used to implement a filter on a texture. However, in a GPGPU application the filtering can be done on any data set. This is a simplified one dimensional convolution but it can be extended to N-dimensions.

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

__global__ void convolution1DKernel(const float* input, float* output, const float* filter, int inputSize, int filterSize) {
    int outputIndex = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    if (outputIndex < inputSize - filterSize + 1) {
      float sum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < filterSize; i++){
          sum += input[outputIndex + i] * filter[i];
      }
        output[outputIndex] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int inputSize = 1024;
    int filterSize = 5;

    std::vector<float> input_host(inputSize);
    std::vector<float> filter_host(filterSize);
    std::vector<float> output_host(inputSize - filterSize + 1);

    // Populate inputs with dummy values for now
    for (int i = 0; i < inputSize; ++i) input_host[i] = i * 0.5;
    for (int i = 0; i < filterSize; ++i) filter_host[i] = 1.0 / filterSize;
   
    float *input_device, *output_device, *filter_device;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&input_device, inputSize * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&output_device, (inputSize - filterSize + 1) * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&filter_device, filterSize * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(input_device, input_host.data(), inputSize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(filter_device, filter_host.data(), filterSize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    dim3 block_dim(256);
    dim3 grid_dim((inputSize - filterSize + 1 + block_dim.x - 1) / block_dim.x);
    
    convolution1DKernel<<<grid_dim, block_dim>>>(input_device, output_device, filter_device, inputSize, filterSize);

    cudaMemcpy(output_host.data(), output_device, (inputSize - filterSize + 1) * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for(int i =0; i < output_host.size(); ++i){
        std::cout << output_host[i] << ", ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    cudaFree(input_device);
    cudaFree(output_device);
    cudaFree(filter_device);
    return 0;
}
```

Again the computation happens on the GPU in parallel, with the data being copied from the host to the device and then back to the host after computation. The kernel function performs the core convolution calculation.

To further understand and develop applications using GPGPU processing, resources covering the CUDA programming model, best practices for memory access optimization, and parallel algorithm design are beneficial. I would also recommend studying computational linear algebra and computational science tutorials. Additionally, investigating performance analysis tools and techniques for CUDA will prove essential to optimizing kernel performance, as well as developing an intuitive sense for where performance bottlenecks may occur. Examining application-specific libraries for areas such as deep learning or scientific simulation will give valuable insight into how these applications can be effectively implemented.
