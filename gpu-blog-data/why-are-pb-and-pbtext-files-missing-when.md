The absence of `.pb` and `.pbtext` files during the conversion of a TensorFlow 2 `.h5` model to a `.tflite` model stems from the fundamental difference in the underlying representations.  My experience debugging model conversion issues over the past five years, particularly in embedded systems development, has highlighted this crucial point repeatedly.  `.h5` files are the native format for Keras models, which are typically built upon TensorFlow's backend.  However, `.pb` (protocol buffer) and `.pbtext` (human-readable protocol buffer) files represent TensorFlow graphs in a serialized form, suitable for deployment but not directly used by the Keras API during model building. The `.tflite` format, on the other hand, is a specifically optimized representation for mobile and embedded devices, and its conversion process does not inherently generate these intermediary graph representations.

Let's clarify this with a clear explanation.  The Keras `.h5` file stores the model's architecture, weights, and training configuration.  To convert this to `.tflite`, the TensorFlow Lite Converter takes this information and optimizes it for the target platform. This optimization process doesn't involve creating the intermediary graph representation of `.pb` or `.pbtext`.  These files are often generated during the saving of TensorFlow graphs directly—a practice less common when working primarily with the Keras sequential or functional APIs. Therefore, their absence is expected behavior; it’s not an error.

The confusion often arises because developers accustomed to older TensorFlow 1.x workflows may expect these files to be generated as part of the conversion process.  In TensorFlow 1.x, the computational graph was explicitly defined and then saved, resulting in `.pb` files. TensorFlow 2.x, however, emphasizes eager execution, meaning operations are performed immediately, leading to a different workflow and the elimination of the explicit graph construction step during typical Keras model building.  This change in philosophy significantly impacts the expectation of the intermediate file output.

To illustrate, consider the following examples. These demonstrate the typical conversion process, highlighting the absence and expected behavior concerning `.pb` and `.pbtext` files.

**Example 1: Standard Conversion using `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the Keras model
model = keras.models.load_model('my_keras_model.h5')

# Create the TFLite converter
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)

# Convert the model
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the TFLite model
with open('converted_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)

print("Conversion complete.  .pb and .pbtext files are not generated.")
```

This example showcases the standard TensorFlow Lite conversion from a Keras model.  No `.pb` or `.pbtext` file is created. The process directly translates the Keras model's information into the optimized `.tflite` format.  Note the explicit absence of any steps to save or generate these intermediate representations.  This is the most common and recommended approach.

**Example 2: Conversion with Quantization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.load_model('my_keras_model.h5')

converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
tflite_model = converter.convert()

with open('quantized_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

print("Quantized model conversion complete. .pb and .pbtext files are still absent.")
```

Here, we introduce quantization, a technique to reduce model size and improve inference speed.  Even with this optimization, the conversion remains direct, resulting in a `.tflite` file without generating `.pb` or `.pbtext` counterparts. This highlights that even advanced conversion options do not necessitate the creation of these files.

**Example 3:  Illustrative (Non-Standard) Generation of a .pb file (for comparison)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.load_model('my_keras_model.h5')

# Save the model as a SavedModel (this is not part of the tflite conversion process)
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'saved_model')

# Now we can convert the SavedModel to a TensorFlow graph (.pb)
converter = tf.compat.v1.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model('saved_model') #Note the use of compat.v1
tflite_model = converter.convert()

with open('converted_from_saved_model.tflite','wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)


print("This demonstrates creating a .pb representation (via SavedModel), but this is not the standard Keras->TFLite workflow.")

```

This example demonstrates generating a `.pb` file *independently*, using the `tf.saved_model.save` function before conversion to `.tflite`. This, however, is a detour, not a part of the typical `.h5` to `.tflite` conversion procedure.  It showcases that the `.pb` file can exist independently of the conversion process; it is not a necessary intermediate file.

In summary, the absence of `.pb` and `.pbtext` files during a TensorFlow 2 `.h5` to `.tflite` conversion is the expected behavior. These files represent an older TensorFlow graph serialization method not intrinsically involved in the modern Keras workflow. The direct conversion from `.h5` to `.tflite` optimizes the model for deployment without needing these intermediary files.  Understanding this distinction between Keras models and TensorFlow graphs is crucial for efficient TensorFlow Lite development.
