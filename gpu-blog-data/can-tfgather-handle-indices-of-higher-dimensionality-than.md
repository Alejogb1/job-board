TensorFlow's `tf.gather` function's behavior with higher-dimensional indices is a subtle point often misunderstood.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems at a previous company frequently involved manipulating sparse matrices and high-dimensional embeddings, leading to extensive use of `tf.gather`.  A key fact to understand is that `tf.gather`'s handling of higher-dimensional indices is fundamentally about *broadcasting* the gather operation across the higher dimensions.  It does *not* interpret the higher dimensions of the index tensor as separate gather operations.  Instead, it efficiently gathers elements based on the flattened indices.

**1.  Explanation:**

The `tf.gather` function operates by selecting elements from a tensor based on a provided index tensor.  The input tensor (`params`) can be of arbitrary rank (number of dimensions). The index tensor (`indices`) specifies which elements to select from `params`.  When the `indices` tensor has a higher dimensionality than `params`, the behavior is determined by TensorFlow's broadcasting rules.  The crucial aspect is that the leading dimensions of `indices` are interpreted as batch dimensions.  Each element in these leading dimensions acts as an independent specification for a gather operation along the last dimension of `params`.

Let's consider a `params` tensor of shape `[M]` and an `indices` tensor of shape `[N, M]`.  Instead of performing `N` separate gathers, TensorFlow effectively flattens `indices` into a shape of `[N*M]`, and then gathers elements from `params` using these flattened indices.  The resulting tensor will have a shape of `[N]`. This behavior extends to indices with even more dimensions; each leading dimension of `indices` represents a batch dimension which undergoes independent gather operations based on the final dimension, which specifies the index within `params`.

This behavior is highly efficient because TensorFlow can optimize these operations internally for vectorized processing.  It avoids the overhead of explicitly looping through the batch dimensions. However, understanding this broadcasting is critical to avoid unexpected behavior and potential errors. Misinterpreting this behavior is a common source of bugs when dealing with complex tensor manipulations, especially in scenarios requiring careful index management for tasks like attention mechanisms or custom loss functions, which I encountered frequently in my previous role.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple 1D gather with 2D indices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])  # Shape [5]
indices = tf.constant([[0, 2, 4], [1, 3, 0]]) # Shape [2, 3]

gathered = tf.gather(params, indices)
print(gathered)  # Output: tf.Tensor([[10, 30, 50], [20, 40, 10]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32)
```

Here, `indices` has shape `[2, 3]`. Each row in `indices` selects three elements from `params`. The resulting `gathered` tensor has a shape `[2, 3]`, reflecting the batch size and the number of elements gathered per batch.  The `[2, 3]` shape is not a result of 3 separate gather operations, but a result of a gather operation using the flattened `indices`.

**Example 2:  Higher-dimensional parameters and indices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]) # Shape [2, 2, 2]
indices = tf.constant([[0, 1], [1, 0]])  # Shape [2, 2]

gathered = tf.gather(params, indices)
print(gathered) # Output: tf.Tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]], shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=int32)

indices2 = tf.constant([[[0], [1]], [[1],[0]]]) #Shape [2,2,1]
gathered2 = tf.gather(params, indices2)
print(gathered2) # Output: tf.Tensor([[[[1, 2]], [[3, 4]]], [[[5, 6]], [[7, 8]]]], shape=(2, 2, 1, 2), dtype=int32)
```

This demonstrates gathering from a 3D tensor. The first case shows how gathering with indices of shape `[2,2]` selects from the first dimension and results in the same shape because it selects the entire last two dimensions. In the second case we add a dimension to the index tensor. This results in the output having the same number of leading dimensions as the index tensor and correctly preserving the shape of the elements being gathered.

**Example 3: Handling Errors and Edge Cases**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([10, 20, 30])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 1, 3]]) #Index out of bounds

try:
    gathered = tf.gather(params, indices)
    print(gathered)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: ...indices[0,2] = 3 is out of range...

params2 = tf.constant([[1,2],[3,4]])
indices2 = tf.constant([[0,1,2]]) # Incorrect shape for broadcasting

try:
    gathered2 = tf.gather(params2, indices2)
    print(gathered2)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Output: Error: ...indices.shape[-1] must be equal to params.shape[-1]
```

This example illustrates error handling.  Attempting to access indices outside the bounds of `params` or using indices with a shape that is not compatible with the broadcasting rules will result in a `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`. Understanding these error messages is crucial for debugging.  In my experience, these errors often stemmed from subtle mismatches between the shapes of index tensors and the expected output shapes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on `tf.gather`.  Furthermore, a strong understanding of TensorFlow's broadcasting rules is essential.  Reviewing materials on array broadcasting in NumPy is beneficial as TensorFlow's broadcasting closely mirrors NumPy's.  Finally, studying examples of high-dimensional tensor manipulations in research papers or advanced TensorFlow tutorials will provide valuable practical insights.  Thoroughly examining the error messages generated during tensor operations is crucial for identifying and correcting index-related problems.  Practicing with progressively more complex scenarios will significantly improve one's understanding of how `tf.gather` handles higher-dimensional indices.
