Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), by design, are naturally suited for generating sequential data, a characteristic that extends to the creation of tensor sequences. Unlike feedforward networks that process inputs independently, RNNs maintain an internal state, allowing them to remember past information, and therefore, to generate output that is dependent on a history of inputs or previous outputs. This inherent sequentiality makes them effective for tasks like text generation, music composition, and, importantly, the generation of tensor sequences representing complex, time-varying data.

The core mechanism facilitating this process is the iterative computation within the RNN. At each step, the RNN receives an input, alongside its previous hidden state. It processes these two through a combination of linear transformations and activation functions, generating both a new hidden state and, in generative models, an output. Critically, the new hidden state is then fed back into the RNN during the subsequent step. The output, in the context of tensor sequence generation, becomes a tensor, potentially of arbitrary dimensionality, that forms a single element in the overall generated sequence. The network is trained to produce this sequence of tensors by observing how actual sequences of tensors unfold over time. The training objective often involves predicting the next tensor in the sequence given the previous ones.

Specifically, one can conceptualize tensor sequence generation with RNNs as follows: First, a sequence of input tensors (which may be zero-valued tensors or embedding vectors when not directly related to the output) are presented to the RNN. The network processes these tensors sequentially, adjusting its hidden state at each step. The output of the RNN at each step is then transformed into a tensor of the desired dimension. During training, this output is compared with the actual tensor in the training sequence at the equivalent time step, using a loss function like Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy Loss, depending on the data type of the target tensor. Backpropagation is used to adjust the RNN's weights to minimize this loss, allowing the network to learn the dependencies present within the training sequences. At generation time, a seed input or an initial sequence of inputs may be fed to the network, which is then used to predict the following tensor. The predicted tensor can be appended to the sequence, and the new generated tensor can be fed back as the input for the next step to generate even further tensors, this is how a sequence of tensors is formed.

Now, consider the application of RNNs for generating sequences of 2x2 matrices. These matrices may represent, for example, transformations in a 2D plane, or potentially pixel data, or abstract features. A simple example using Python with PyTorch is shown below.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class TensorGeneratorRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(TensorGeneratorRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        output, hidden = self.rnn(input, hidden)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, hidden

    def init_hidden(self, batch_size):
       return torch.zeros(1, batch_size, self.hidden_size)

# Define hyperparameters
input_size = 4 # Size of input tensor (flattened 2x2 matrix)
hidden_size = 32
output_size = 4  # Size of output tensor (flattened 2x2 matrix)
learning_rate = 0.01
num_epochs = 100

# Instantiate the model, loss function and optimizer
model = TensorGeneratorRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Generate training data (simulated sequence of 2x2 matrices)
def generate_training_sequence(seq_length, batch_size):
    inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, input_size)
    targets = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, output_size)
    return inputs, targets

seq_length = 10
batch_size = 2
inputs, targets = generate_training_sequence(seq_length, batch_size)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    hidden = model.init_hidden(batch_size)
    outputs, hidden = model(inputs, hidden)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
       print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Generation
with torch.no_grad():
    seed_input = torch.randn(1, 1, input_size) # Single input for generating sequence
    hidden = model.init_hidden(1)
    generated_sequence = []
    current_input = seed_input
    for _ in range(10):
        output, hidden = model(current_input, hidden)
        generated_sequence.append(output.squeeze().reshape(2,2)) #Reshape output into 2x2 matrix
        current_input = output.unsqueeze(0) #Use output as new input

    print("\nGenerated Sequence:")
    for tensor in generated_sequence:
      print(tensor)
```
This code defines a simple RNN for generating sequences of flattened 2x2 matrices. The `TensorGeneratorRNN` class encapsulates the RNN architecture, including a linear layer (`fc`) for converting the hidden state to the desired output tensor dimension. The forward pass takes an input tensor and a previous hidden state, outputting a new tensor and hidden state. Training occurs on randomly generated sequences and outputs and aims to minimize the Mean Squared Error between the predicted tensors and the target tensors. Note that the generation phase starts with a random seed tensor, iteratively generates new tensors which are then used as the input for the next step, thus creating a sequence.

This next example elaborates on sequence generation by using an LSTM, a more sophisticated variant of RNN, which is better at handling longer sequence dependencies. The generated tensor in this case is not a matrix, but a 3-dimensional tensor which might be used for example, to represent a voxel in a 3D space.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class TensorGeneratorLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(TensorGeneratorLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden, cell):
        output, (hidden, cell) = self.lstm(input, (hidden, cell))
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, hidden, cell

    def init_hidden_cell(self, batch_size):
        hidden = torch.zeros(1, batch_size, self.hidden_size)
        cell = torch.zeros(1, batch_size, self.hidden_size)
        return hidden, cell

# Define hyperparameters
input_size = 8  # Size of input tensor (flattened 2x2x2 tensor)
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 8   # Size of output tensor (flattened 2x2x2 tensor)
learning_rate = 0.005
num_epochs = 150

# Instantiate the model, loss function and optimizer
model = TensorGeneratorLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Generate training data (simulated sequence of 2x2x2 tensors)
def generate_training_sequence(seq_length, batch_size):
    inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, input_size)
    targets = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, output_size)
    return inputs, targets

seq_length = 15
batch_size = 3
inputs, targets = generate_training_sequence(seq_length, batch_size)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    hidden, cell = model.init_hidden_cell(batch_size)
    outputs, hidden, cell = model(inputs, hidden, cell)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Generation
with torch.no_grad():
    seed_input = torch.randn(1, 1, input_size)
    hidden, cell = model.init_hidden_cell(1)
    generated_sequence = []
    current_input = seed_input
    for _ in range(15):
        output, hidden, cell = model(current_input, hidden, cell)
        generated_sequence.append(output.squeeze().reshape(2,2,2)) # Reshape output into 2x2x2
        current_input = output.unsqueeze(0)

    print("\nGenerated Sequence:")
    for tensor in generated_sequence:
        print(tensor)
```
This code functions similarly to the previous example, with the key difference being the use of an LSTM layer instead of a basic RNN, and the output tensors being 2x2x2 tensors. The LSTM layer requires both a hidden state and a cell state to be carried between time steps.

Finally, this last example demonstrates how an RNN can be used to generate sequences of tensors which are complex embeddings. The previous examples directly predicted a target output tensor, this one takes a different approach. Here, the RNN predicts embeddings which may be used in downstream tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class EmbeddingGeneratorRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, embedding_size):
        super(EmbeddingGeneratorRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, embedding_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        output, hidden = self.rnn(input, hidden)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, hidden

    def init_hidden(self, batch_size):
        return torch.zeros(1, batch_size, self.hidden_size)

# Define hyperparameters
input_size = 32 # Size of input tensor
hidden_size = 128
embedding_size = 64 # Size of output embeddings
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 200

# Instantiate the model, loss function and optimizer
model = EmbeddingGeneratorRNN(input_size, hidden_size, embedding_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)


# Generate training data: simulated sequence of embeddings
def generate_training_sequence(seq_length, batch_size):
    inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, input_size)
    targets = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, embedding_size)
    return inputs, targets

seq_length = 20
batch_size = 4
inputs, targets = generate_training_sequence(seq_length, batch_size)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    hidden = model.init_hidden(batch_size)
    outputs, hidden = model(inputs, hidden)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if epoch % 25 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Generation
with torch.no_grad():
    seed_input = torch.randn(1, 1, input_size)
    hidden = model.init_hidden(1)
    generated_sequence = []
    current_input = seed_input
    for _ in range(20):
      output, hidden = model(current_input, hidden)
      generated_sequence.append(output.squeeze())
      current_input = output.unsqueeze(0)

    print("\nGenerated Embedding Sequence:")
    for tensor in generated_sequence:
      print(tensor)
```

In this example, the output tensors are embeddings, which are lower-dimensional vector representations of potentially complex data. They are useful in cases where the exact tensor needs to be inferred from patterns in an underlying dataset and then used for other purposes downstream. Again, note that the same fundamental structure of an RNN is maintained for the generation process.

For further understanding and practical applications of RNNs, I would recommend exploring resources focusing on time series analysis and sequence modelling. Textbooks and tutorials on deep learning, particularly those covering PyTorch or TensorFlow, provide comprehensive coverage of RNN architectures and their practical implementation. Additionally, research papers focusing on specific applications of RNNs such as machine translation or speech synthesis often offer valuable insights into the nuances of tensor sequence generation. Courses specializing in deep learning and its applications to sequence modelling can be a worthwhile investment. Finally, online forums focused on machine learning are an invaluable resource to learn best practices and practical tips.
