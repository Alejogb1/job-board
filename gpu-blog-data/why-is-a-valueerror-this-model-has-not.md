The `ValueError: This model has not been built` encountered during CNN audio spectrogram feature extraction almost invariably stems from a failure to properly initialize or compile the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model before attempting to use it for prediction or feature extraction.  My experience troubleshooting this issue in several large-scale audio classification projects has highlighted the critical need for distinct model building and usage phases.  This error manifests because the underlying model lacks the necessary internal weights and biases required for computation;  it’s essentially an empty shell trying to perform a task it hasn't been prepared for.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A CNN model, at its core, is a complex structure comprising layers (convolutional, pooling, dense, etc.) and their associated parameters (weights and biases). These parameters are not inherently present when a model architecture is defined.  The process of defining the architecture is separate from the process of training or even just preparing the model for inference. The `build()` method, often implicitly called during model compilation (using `model.compile()` in Keras or equivalent functions in other frameworks), initiates this preparation.  Without a successful build process, the internal structure of the model remains uninitialized, leading to the "model has not been built" error when you attempt to use methods like `model.predict()` or, in your case, perform feature extraction via `model.predict()` on spectrogram input.

This failure to build can arise from several sources: incorrect model definition, missing dependencies, issues with input shape specifications during the building process,  or simply forgetting the crucial compilation step.  Furthermore, depending on the framework,  using a sequential model might require explicit input shape definition for successful building, whereas functional models often handle this implicitly through the input tensor definitions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Keras Sequential Model – Incorrect Input Shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Incorrect input shape definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 100, 3)), #Should match spectrogram shape
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

#Attempting feature extraction without proper input shape during build (or compilation)
spectrogram = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 1) #Example spectrogram of shape (1, 224, 224, 1)
features = model.predict(spectrogram)  #This will raise ValueError

#Corrected version:
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 1)), #Corrected input shape
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #Crucial step: Compilation builds the model
features_correct = model_correct.predict(spectrogram) #This will execute successfully.
```

This example demonstrates a common error. The input shape provided during model definition (`(100, 100, 3)`) does not match the shape of the input spectrogram `(224, 224, 1)`.  The `compile()` step is also essential; it's during compilation that the model gets built. Without it, `model.predict()` fails.


**Example 2:  PyTorch Model – Missing `to()` Method**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 54 * 54, 10) #Assumed input shape after convolutions and pooling

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = CNN()
spectrogram = torch.randn(1, 1, 224, 224)

#Error will occur here: model hasn't been moved to the device
features = model(spectrogram) #Throws error in most cases due to uninitialized weights

#Corrected Version:
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
spectrogram = spectrogram.to(device)
features = model(spectrogram) # Executes successfully
```

In PyTorch, models often need to be explicitly moved to a computational device (CPU or GPU) using `model.to(device)`.  Furthermore, the input data must also reside on the same device. Forgetting this often leads to seemingly inexplicable errors, including the "model not built" manifestation.

**Example 3: TensorFlow Functional API – Incomplete Model Definition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 1))
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
#Missing Output Layer

#Attempting to build an incomplete model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x) # Incorrect: No output layer
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #Throws Error or unexpected behaviour

#Corrected Version:
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 1))
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
output_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(x) #Added output layer

model_corrected = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
model_corrected.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #Successfully compiles and builds the model
```

With the TensorFlow functional API, you must explicitly define both the input and output tensors.  Missing an output layer, as shown above, results in an incomplete model that cannot be built. The error might not be directly "model not built" but will manifest as an inability to use the model due to the structural incompleteness.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd suggest reviewing the official documentation for your deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).  Pay close attention to sections detailing model building, compilation (or equivalent processes), and the specifics of input shape management.  Additionally, consult textbooks on deep learning fundamentals, focusing on CNN architectures and their implementation. A practical hands-on approach, experimenting with smaller, simpler CNN models, will greatly improve your understanding.  Finally, a thorough understanding of tensor manipulation and broadcasting in your chosen framework is crucial for successfully handling multi-dimensional audio data like spectrograms.
