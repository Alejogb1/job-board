OpenCL program failures to locate available GPUs stem fundamentally from a mismatch between the program's expectations and the system's actual configuration, often obscured by layers of abstraction and driver complexities.  My experience debugging high-performance computing applications has consistently highlighted the criticality of understanding this underlying discrepancy.  In many cases, a seemingly simple "GPU not found" error masks a more nuanced problem.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process of OpenCL identifying and utilizing a GPU involves several distinct stages.  First, the OpenCL runtime needs to be properly installed and configured. This includes having the necessary drivers for the specific GPU architecture.  Second, the platform query must successfully identify the available OpenCL platforms. A platform represents a collection of devices, typically including one or more GPUs and CPUs.  Third, the application must accurately select the desired device from the list of identified devices.  A failure at any of these stages can lead to the program failing to find a GPU, even if one is physically present and ostensibly functional.

Common causes for this failure include, but are not limited to:

* **Incorrect Driver Installation:** The OpenCL drivers for the specific GPU model may be missing, outdated, or corrupted.  This is a frequent source of problems, especially on systems with multiple GPUs from different vendors.  Drivers must be specifically tailored to the hardware and the OpenCL version being used.

* **Platform Identification Issues:** The OpenCL runtime may fail to correctly identify the available platforms. This can occur due to permissions issues, conflicts with other software, or problems with the system's hardware configuration. In my experience, system-level conflicts are a recurring issue, particularly after major system updates or installations of new software components.

* **Device Selection Errors:** The application may attempt to select a device that does not exist, is unavailable, or lacks the required capabilities. This can be due to flawed logic in the device selection process or due to unexpected changes in the system's configuration, such as dynamic power saving settings altering available devices.

* **Insufficient Permissions:** The application may lack the necessary permissions to access the GPU.  This is particularly relevant in multi-user environments or when running applications with restricted privileges.

* **Conflicting Libraries:**  OpenCL applications can sometimes conflict with other libraries or applications that use similar resources, particularly if those applications are not properly managed. This could result in an application inadvertently failing to recognize available GPUs due to resource contention.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different aspects of OpenCL device selection and the potential for errors.  They are written in C++, a commonly used language for OpenCL development, although equivalent concepts apply to other languages.

**Example 1: Basic Platform and Device Query**

```c++
#include <CL/cl.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        std::vector<cl::Platform> platforms;
        cl::Platform::get(&platforms);

        if (platforms.empty()) {
            std::cerr << "No OpenCL platforms found." << std::endl;
            return 1;
        }

        cl::Platform platform = platforms[0]; // Select the first platform
        std::vector<cl::Device> devices;
        platform.getDevices(CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, &devices);

        if (devices.empty()) {
            std::cerr << "No OpenCL GPU devices found on selected platform." << std::endl;
            return 1;
        }

        std::cout << "Found " << devices.size() << " GPU devices." << std::endl;
        //Further processing with devices[0]...

    } catch (cl::Error &error) {
        std::cerr << "OpenCL error: " << error.what() << "(" << error.err() << ")" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic approach to querying OpenCL platforms and devices.  The crucial error handling within the `try-catch` block is essential for identifying potential issues.  Note that simply selecting the first platform (`platforms[0]`) might not be robust for systems with multiple platforms.  A more sophisticated approach may involve checking platform capabilities and selecting the most appropriate one based on application requirements.


**Example 2: Checking Device Capabilities**

```c++
// ... (Platform and device selection as in Example 1) ...

    cl::Device device = devices[0];
    std::string deviceName = device.getInfo<CL_DEVICE_NAME>();
    std::cout << "Device Name: " << deviceName << std::endl;

    cl_bool available = device.getInfo<CL_DEVICE_AVAILABLE>();
    if (!available) {
        std::cerr << "Device is not available." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    cl_ulong globalMemSize = device.getInfo<CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE>();
    std::cout << "Global Memory Size: " << globalMemSize << " bytes" << std::endl;
    // ...Further checks for compute units, max work group size, etc...
```

This example shows how to check specific device properties, such as availability (`CL_DEVICE_AVAILABLE`) and global memory size.  Checking these properties before attempting to utilize the device is vital.  An unavailable device, even if detected initially, might become unavailable during runtime due to power management or other system-level actions.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Devices**

```c++
// ... (Platform selection as in Example 1) ...

    std::vector<cl::Device> devices;
    platform.getDevices(CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, &devices);

    if (devices.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "No OpenCL GPU devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    for (const auto& device : devices) {
        std::string deviceName = device.getInfo<CL_DEVICE_NAME>();
        cl_bool available = device.getInfo<CL_DEVICE_AVAILABLE>();
        std::cout << "Device Name: " << deviceName << ", Available: " << available << std::endl;
        if (available) {
            //Use the specific device
            std::cout << "Using device: " << deviceName << std::endl;
            // ...Process with this device...
            break; // Exit loop after selecting a device
        }
    }

```

This example iterates through multiple devices, checking their availability.  This robust approach handles scenarios with multiple GPUs, prioritizing available devices. A more sophisticated selection might involve comparing device capabilities to find the optimal device for a specific task.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Khronos OpenCL specification provides comprehensive details on the API and underlying concepts.  Consult the OpenCL specification directly for definitive information on the API functions and error codes.  Furthermore, review the documentation accompanying your specific GPU vendor's OpenCL drivers.  Finally, studying existing OpenCL codebases and examples will provide valuable insight into best practices and error handling techniques.  Analyzing the code and error messages will often reveal the root cause of the problem.
