Directly addressing the question, I've consistently observed that the primary source of CUDA memory issues in PyTorch stems from inefficient management of tensors residing on the GPU. It’s less about PyTorch itself, and more about how we, as developers, utilize CUDA's memory space through PyTorch abstractions. In particular, the allocation and deallocation of GPU memory, along with operations that inadvertently create large, temporary tensors, are frequent culprits leading to `CUDA out of memory` errors.

The core of the problem is the constrained nature of GPU memory compared to system RAM. PyTorch tensors, when created using `.cuda()` or methods that implicitly move data to the GPU, utilize this limited resource. When we exhaust available GPU memory, subsequent allocation attempts fail, resulting in the aforementioned errors. The intricacies arise from how PyTorch and CUDA manage this space, where fragmentation, unexpected allocations, and insufficient deallocation compound the problem.

Specifically, I’ve encountered three primary scenarios leading to these memory errors. Firstly, unintentional creation of copies on the GPU through operations lacking in-place functionality. Secondly, the accumulation of gradients during training without proper memory management. Lastly, and perhaps less obvious, improper handling of tensors after training loops finish can lead to leaks and persistent memory utilization even when not needed. Each of these needs careful consideration when writing performant and stable PyTorch code.

Now, let's delve into concrete examples that showcase these scenarios.

**Example 1: Unnecessary Copying due to Out-of-Place Operations**

Consider a typical scenario where a user attempts to process a large tensor. They might inadvertently use an operation that returns a new tensor on the GPU instead of modifying the original.

```python
import torch

# Initial large tensor on the GPU
large_tensor = torch.rand(1000, 1000, 1000).cuda()

# Incorrect: Creates a new tensor on GPU, doubling memory usage
modified_tensor = large_tensor + 1

# Correct: Modifies the original tensor in-place
large_tensor.add_(1)


# Demonstration of the difference (this won't raise OOM)
if False:
  large_tensor = torch.rand(1000, 1000, 1000).cuda()
  modified_tensor = large_tensor + 1
  print("Memory used after addition:", torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / (1024 * 1024), "MB")
  modified_tensor = large_tensor.add_(1)
  print("Memory used after in-place addition:", torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / (1024 * 1024), "MB")


del large_tensor, modified_tensor # releasing
torch.cuda.empty_cache() # clearing cache

```

In this example, `large_tensor + 1` performs element-wise addition, but it allocates a completely new tensor on the GPU to store the result. This doubles the memory requirement, which can easily lead to an `out of memory` error with sufficiently large initial tensors. `large_tensor.add_(1)`, on the other hand, performs the addition directly on the existing tensor, significantly reducing memory overhead. The in-place version, denoted by the trailing underscore (`_`), avoids creating unnecessary copies and thus alleviates potential memory issues. We can also monitor the allocated GPU memory. Note the conditional block is set to `False` as an execution example could lead to instability on systems with less GPU memory. The `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called explicitly at the end to aid in the deallocation process.

**Example 2: Gradient Accumulation during Training**

Training deep learning models often involves backpropagation, which calculates gradients. These gradients, by default, also reside on the GPU. In scenarios where we perform multiple training steps without zeroing the gradients using `optimizer.zero_grad()`, the accumulated gradients occupy significant memory, resulting in memory issues.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Setup
model = nn.Linear(100, 10).cuda()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
inputs = torch.rand(32, 100).cuda()
target = torch.rand(32, 10).cuda()

# Incorrect: Accumulating Gradients
if False:
  for i in range(3):
      output = model(inputs)
      loss = criterion(output, target)
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step() # Step without zeroing gradient!


# Correct: Zeroing Gradients in each step
for i in range(3):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()


del model, optimizer, criterion, inputs, target
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

```

Here, the incorrect approach leads to gradient accumulation across loop iterations. In essence, each `.backward()` operation adds to the existing gradient values. While in some training scenarios, gradient accumulation is the desired behavior, it must be managed explicitly with batch accumulation. Failing to call `optimizer.zero_grad()` prior to the `.backward()` step in each iteration results in an unexpected growth in memory usage. The correct snippet correctly zero's out gradients before each iteration to stop this accumulation. Note the conditional block is set to `False` as an execution example could lead to instability on systems with less GPU memory. The `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called explicitly at the end to aid in the deallocation process.

**Example 3: Unmanaged Tensors after Training Loops**

Finally, a less obvious issue arises from retaining tensors after training is complete. Even if they are not actively used, they still occupy GPU memory unless explicitly deleted.

```python
import torch

# Create tensors and move them to the GPU.
a = torch.rand(100, 100).cuda()
b = torch.rand(100, 100).cuda()

# Some computation with `a` and `b`
c = a @ b

# Incorrect: a and b are not deleted after use
if False:
  print("Memory allocated after comp:", torch.cuda.memory_allocated()/(1024*1024), "MB")

# Correct: Deleting `a` and `b` releases the occupied memory
del a, b

print("Memory allocated after deletion:", torch.cuda.memory_allocated()/(1024*1024), "MB")

del c
torch.cuda.empty_cache() # clearing cache

```

In this scenario, tensors `a` and `b`, once allocated to the GPU, will persist until explicitly deallocated. The `del a, b` statement releases the allocated memory. Not doing so can lead to a slow accumulation of unused tensors, gradually filling available GPU memory. The `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` function can also be helpful but must be used carefully. The `empty_cache` function attempts to release all unoccupied cached memory. Note the conditional block is set to `False` as an execution example could lead to instability on systems with less GPU memory. The `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called explicitly at the end to aid in the deallocation process.

In summary, these three scenarios underscore the critical importance of managing GPU memory within PyTorch. The first involves the unnecessary allocation of new tensors through operations that lack in-place behavior. The second concerns gradient accumulation during training. Finally, the third is due to unmanaged tensors retained after use. Through disciplined application of in-place operations, careful zeroing of gradients, and proper deletion of tensors, many CUDA memory issues can be avoided.

For deeper understanding and further mitigation techniques, I recommend reviewing several sources. Firstly, the official PyTorch documentation on memory management, which includes specific sections on avoiding out-of-memory errors and utilizing `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`. Secondly, articles or tutorials on optimizing memory usage for large models within a deep learning context are helpful. Lastly, a solid understanding of general CUDA programming patterns and limitations greatly enhances one's ability to debug these types of issues.
