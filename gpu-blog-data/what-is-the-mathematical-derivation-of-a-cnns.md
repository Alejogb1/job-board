The output of a CNN's second convolutional layer, and indeed any subsequent layer, is fundamentally determined by the interplay of the previous layer's feature maps, the convolutional filters applied, and the activation function used.  This isn't simply a matter of matrix multiplication; the spatial arrangement of features and the inherent stride and padding parameters significantly impact the final dimensions and values.  My experience optimizing CNN architectures for high-resolution medical imaging has provided extensive insight into this process.  Understanding this requires a breakdown of the operations involved.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The first convolutional layer generates a set of feature maps from the input image.  Let's denote the input image as `I` with dimensions `H_i x W_i x C_i`, where `H_i`, `W_i`, and `C_i` represent the height, width, and number of channels respectively.  The first convolutional layer utilizes `K_1` filters, each with dimensions `F_1 x F_1 x C_i`, where `F_1` is the filter size.  The convolution operation between a filter and a region of the input image produces a single scalar value.  Sliding this filter across the entire input image, considering stride `S_1` and padding `P_1`, yields a feature map.  Repeating this for all `K_1` filters results in `K_1` feature maps. The dimensions of each feature map in the first layer's output are:

`H_1 = (H_i + 2P_1 - F_1) / S_1 + 1`
`W_1 = (W_i + 2P_1 - F_1) / S_1 + 1`

Therefore, the output of the first convolutional layer, `O_1`, has dimensions `H_1 x W_1 x K_1`.  An activation function, such as ReLU, is then applied element-wise to `O_1`, resulting in `A_1`.  This `A_1` serves as the input for the second convolutional layer.

The second convolutional layer operates similarly. It uses `K_2` filters, each with dimensions `F_2 x F_2 x K_1`. The convolution is performed on the feature maps of `A_1`. The stride and padding are now `S_2` and `P_2` respectively. The output of the second convolutional layer, `O_2`, before activation, has dimensions:

`H_2 = (H_1 + 2P_2 - F_2) / S_2 + 1`
`W_2 = (W_1 + 2P_2 - F_2) / S_2 + 1`

Thus, the final output of the second convolutional layer, after applying the activation function (e.g., ReLU), `A_2`, has dimensions `H_2 x W_2 x K_2`. Each value in `A_2` represents the activation of a specific filter at a specific location in the feature map, representing the learned features from the input image after two layers of convolution and activation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the process using Python and NumPy.  They simplify the actual implementation in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, focusing on the core mathematical operations.

**Example 1: Simplified 1D Convolution**

This example demonstrates a simplified 1D convolution to illustrate the core concept without the complexities of image handling.

```python
import numpy as np

# Input signal
input_signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Filter
filter = np.array([1, -1])

# Convolution operation (no padding, stride 1)
output = np.convolve(input_signal, filter, 'valid')

print(f"Input: {input_signal}")
print(f"Filter: {filter}")
print(f"Output: {output}")
```

This code performs a simple 1D convolution.  The `np.convolve` function computes the cross-correlation, effectively performing the convolution. The 'valid' mode ensures that only the parts of the signal where the filter fully overlaps are considered, eliminating edge effects.


**Example 2: 2D Convolution (Simplified)**

This example simulates a 2D convolution, highlighting the process without employing image processing libraries.


```python
import numpy as np

# Input (simplified image)
input_image = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Filter
filter = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])

# Convolution operation (no padding, stride 1) - Manual Implementation
output = np.zeros((2, 2))
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
        output[i, j] = np.sum(input_image[i:i+2, j:j+2] * filter)

print(f"Input:\n{input_image}")
print(f"Filter:\n{filter}")
print(f"Output:\n{output}")

```
This demonstrates manual calculation, showing how the filter is applied to each relevant section of the input.


**Example 3:  Illustrative Layer Output Dimensions**

This example focuses on calculating the output dimensions after convolutional layers.


```python
# Input dimensions
H_i = 28
W_i = 28
C_i = 3

# First Layer parameters
F_1 = 3
S_1 = 1
P_1 = 1
K_1 = 16

# Second layer parameters
F_2 = 3
S_2 = 1
P_2 = 1
K_2 = 32

# Calculate dimensions
H_1 = (H_i + 2*P_1 - F_1) // S_1 + 1
W_1 = (W_i + 2*P_1 - F_1) // S_1 + 1
H_2 = (H_1 + 2*P_2 - F_2) // S_2 + 1
W_2 = (W_1 + 2*P_2 - F_2) // S_2 + 1

print(f"Output of first layer: {H_1} x {W_1} x {K_1}")
print(f"Output of second layer: {H_2} x {W_2} x {K_2}")
```
This demonstrates how the dimensions of subsequent layers are derived from the parameters of each layer and the previous layer's output.
