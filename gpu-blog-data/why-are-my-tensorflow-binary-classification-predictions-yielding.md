The unusual prediction values you're observing in your TensorFlow binary classification model likely stem from an improperly scaled output layer or a misunderstanding of the model's output interpretation.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects involving sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and medical image classification, the crucial point is understanding that TensorFlow, by default, outputs raw logits from the final layer, not probabilities. This frequently leads to values outside the expected [0, 1] range, causing confusion.  Let's clarify this and explore potential solutions.

**1. Understanding the Output Layer and Activation Functions**

TensorFlow models, particularly those for binary classification, typically utilize a single neuron in the output layer. This neuron's output represents the raw logit, a pre-probability score. This score isn't directly interpretable as a probability.  To obtain a probability, you must apply a sigmoid activation function.  Without a sigmoid (or similar function like softmax for multi-class problems), your output will range from negative infinity to positive infinity.  Values significantly above zero indicate a strong prediction towards the positive class (class 1), while values significantly below zero suggest a strong prediction towards the negative class (class 0).  Values near zero represent uncertainty.  This is why you might see predictions like 10.5 or -3.2; they are not probabilities, but raw logits.

Failing to apply the sigmoid activation function is a very common mistake. The model might be learning correctly, but the output interpretation is flawed.  Furthermore, improper scaling of your input data can exacerbate the problem.  Features with vastly different scales can cause the model to assign disproportionate weights, leading to extreme logit values.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate with three scenarios to demonstrate the impact of activation functions and data scaling:


**Example 1:  Missing Sigmoid Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model without sigmoid activation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), # Example input shape
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Missing activation function!
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training code ...

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions) # Output: Raw logits, not probabilities!
```

In this example, the critical omission is the absence of an activation function in the final Dense layer. This directly leads to raw logits as predictions.  To rectify this, simply add `activation='sigmoid'` to the final layer:

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Added sigmoid activation
])
```

Now `model.predict(X_test)` will yield probabilities between 0 and 1.


**Example 2: Incorrect Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy']) # Incorrect loss function

# ... training code ...

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
```

Here, while we have a sigmoid, the loss function `'mse'` (mean squared error) is inappropriate for binary classification.  `'binary_crossentropy'` should be used.  `'mse'` can lead to numerical instability and inaccurate predictions, sometimes resulting in unusual output values even with the sigmoid activation.  Always pair the correct loss function with the appropriate activation function for optimal performance and interpretation.  Using `binary_crossentropy` ensures the model is trained to predict probabilities effectively.

**Example 3: Impact of Data Scaling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Example with unscaled data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10) * 1000 # Feature values between 0 and 1000
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# ... model definition (with sigmoid activation)...

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Now, with scaled data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=10)

predictions_scaled = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
print(predictions_scaled)
```

This example highlights the importance of data scaling.  Features with vastly different ranges can negatively impact model training and lead to unusual predictions.  Scaling the input data using techniques like `StandardScaler` (from scikit-learn) centers the data around zero with a unit standard deviation, improving model stability and convergence, often yielding more reasonable prediction values.  Remember to apply the same scaling transformation to your test data.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on binary classification, paying particular attention to the sections on activation functions and loss functions.  Additionally, exploring comprehensive machine learning texts focusing on model building and hyperparameter tuning would be immensely valuable.  Lastly, thoroughly investigate resources covering data preprocessing techniques to understand the importance of scaling and normalization.  Careful consideration of these resources will solidify your understanding and lead to more robust models.  Addressing the issues highlighted above should resolve the unusual prediction values you're encountering.  Remember, attention to detail in activation function selection, loss function choice, and data preprocessing is paramount for accurate and interpretable results in TensorFlow binary classification.
