Markov Chains, by their probabilistic nature, do not inherently maintain or display historical state values across time steps; rather, they define the probability of transitioning between states at each discrete step. My experience with simulating stochastic systems in ecological modeling has highlighted the need for a layer of post-processing to extract and present this temporal data, specifically when visualizing the progression through states. Building an R function to accomplish this involves simulating state transitions according to the chain's transition matrix and then recording these state values over the desired number of time steps.

The core challenge is differentiating between the Markov Chain process, which governs the probabilities of transition *at* each step, and the simulation process, which tracks the specific state an individual is in *across* a sequence of steps. Therefore, a simple function cannot directly display state values "over multiple time steps" without that function actively managing a history of states. It requires simulating the chain using a transition matrix, updating the current state based on the probabilities, and storing each state before the next transition is determined.

The following R function, named `simulate_markov_chain`, achieves this. It takes as input a transition matrix (`transition_matrix`), an initial state (`initial_state`), and the desired number of time steps (`num_steps`). The function returns a vector containing the sequence of states visited across those time steps.

```r
simulate_markov_chain <- function(transition_matrix, initial_state, num_steps) {
  # 1. Error Handling & Input Validation: Confirm type and dimensions of the transition matrix.
  if(!is.matrix(transition_matrix) || !is.numeric(transition_matrix)) {
    stop("The transition matrix must be a numeric matrix.")
  }
  if(nrow(transition_matrix) != ncol(transition_matrix)){
    stop("The transition matrix must be a square matrix.")
  }
  if(initial_state < 1 || initial_state > nrow(transition_matrix)){
    stop("Initial state must be within valid state range of the transition matrix.")
  }
  if(!is.numeric(num_steps) || num_steps <= 0){
    stop("Number of steps must be a positive numeric value.")
  }

  # 2. Initialization: The simulation begins by storing the initial state.
  num_states <- nrow(transition_matrix)
  state_history <- vector("numeric", length = num_steps + 1)
  state_history[1] <- initial_state
  current_state <- initial_state

  # 3. Simulation Loop: Iterate through desired number of steps, updating state at each step.
  for (i in 1:num_steps) {
    # 3a. Probabilistic Transition: Sample the next state based on probabilities in current row of matrix.
    next_state <- sample(1:num_states, size = 1, prob = transition_matrix[current_state, ])

    # 3b. Record State: Store the newly derived state in our history vector.
    state_history[i+1] <- next_state

    # 3c. Update Current State: Prepare for the next iteration by advancing the current state.
    current_state <- next_state
  }
  # 4. Return State History: A complete time series of simulated states.
  return(state_history)
}
```
The initial block validates that the inputs are of the correct type and range. This includes verifying that the transition matrix is a numeric square matrix and that the initial state and step number are within permitted ranges, preventing potential errors during runtime. The primary simulation loop then iterates over the desired number of steps. At each iteration, the `sample` function uses the probabilities in the current row of the `transition_matrix` to choose the next state. The chosen state is recorded in the `state_history` vector before updating `current_state` in preparation for the subsequent iteration, providing a record of the state at every time point. Finally, the vector containing the series of states is returned.

To understand how to work with the function, consider an example. Below, I construct a transition matrix representing movement between three states, then use `simulate_markov_chain` to track transitions over ten steps from an initial state of 1:
```r
# Example Transition Matrix for Three States:
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(
  0.7, 0.2, 0.1,
  0.3, 0.5, 0.2,
  0.1, 0.4, 0.5
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Simulate 10 steps starting from state 1:
simulated_states <- simulate_markov_chain(transition_matrix, initial_state = 1, num_steps = 10)

# Output the resulting sequence of states:
print(simulated_states)
```
This results in a numeric vector such as `[1] 1 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 2`, illustrating the system's simulated behavior over time. Each number corresponds to one of the three states. The initial state is the first value, and each subsequent value is the state at each time step.

Now, consider the scenario where we want to run multiple independent simulations of a Markov Chain and want to visualize the different state trajectories. We can modify the initial function to produce multiple simulated paths and present them in a single structure.

```r
simulate_multiple_chains <- function(transition_matrix, initial_state, num_steps, num_simulations) {

  # 1. Input validation: Confirm that number of simulations is also a positive numeric
  if(!is.numeric(num_simulations) || num_simulations <= 0){
    stop("Number of simulations must be a positive numeric value.")
  }
  # 2. Preallocation of list: To hold the results from each simulation.
  simulation_results <- list()

  # 3. Simulation Loop: Iterate through number of simulations, storing result of each.
  for(i in 1:num_simulations){
    simulation_results[[i]] <- simulate_markov_chain(transition_matrix, initial_state, num_steps)
  }

  # 4. Return all simulated trajectories.
  return(simulation_results)
}
```
This function takes the same transition matrix, initial state, and number of steps as `simulate_markov_chain`, plus the number of simulations to run. Within the primary for loop, `simulate_markov_chain` is called repeatedly, each result stored as a distinct element in a list called `simulation_results`. Finally, this list of simulation vectors is returned, containing distinct time series for each independent simulation.

Using the same transition matrix as before:

```r
# Generate 5 independent simulations, over 20 steps from initial state 1.
multiple_simulations <- simulate_multiple_chains(transition_matrix, initial_state = 1, num_steps = 20, num_simulations = 5)
# Output result for inspection.
print(multiple_simulations)
```
The output is a list of five numeric vectors, each vector showing an independent path through the three-state system over 20 time steps. We now have multiple simulated time-series data that we can further analyze or present graphically.

To extend this work, consider consulting resources on Markov Chain modeling and simulation. Specifically, seek resources covering topics like absorbing Markov Chains, which are useful for modeling systems where a specific state is eventually reached, and reversible Markov Chains, employed in simulations with detailed balance, such as those arising in statistical physics or Bayesian computation. Furthermore, studying material on time series analysis, state-space models, and data visualization will provide methods to effectively explore and present this simulated time-series data for insightful analysis. Publications focused on discrete-time stochastic processes can also deepen understanding.

In conclusion, while a Markov Chain model itself defines probabilistic transitions, simulating the chain and then tracking the visited states over time is necessary for displaying state values across time steps. A simple R function, such as the presented `simulate_markov_chain`, coupled with a wrapper for multiple runs, such as `simulate_multiple_chains`, provides this essential functionality. With this basis, users can conduct more sophisticated analyses and simulations of stochastic processes.
