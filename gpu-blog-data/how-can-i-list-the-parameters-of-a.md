Inspecting the parameters of a PyTorch network requires a nuanced understanding of the underlying model architecture and the framework's internal representation of tensors.  My experience troubleshooting complex deep learning models has highlighted the necessity of not just retrieving parameter lists, but also understanding their organization and usage within the computational graph.  Simply printing the parameters doesn't always provide the necessary context for debugging or analysis.  Therefore, a comprehensive approach encompassing different methods is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch models, at their core, are collections of layers (modules) interconnected to form a directed acyclic graph. Each layer typically contains one or more tensors representing its learnable parameters (weights and biases). These parameters are typically stored as instances of `torch.nn.Parameter`, a subclass of `torch.Tensor` that automatically registers itself within the model's parameter list.  Accessing these parameters can be done directly using the `parameters()` method of a module or iteratively traversing the model's architecture.  However, the most effective approach often involves combining direct access with informative printing techniques to understand the shape, type, and location of each parameter within the network.  Furthermore, differentiating between parameters and buffers is crucial. Buffers are tensors associated with the module, but they are not considered model parameters and are not updated during backpropagation.  Therefore, a robust solution needs to account for this distinction.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Direct Parameter Listing:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNet()

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter Name: {name}, Shape: {param.shape}, Type: {param.dtype}, Requires Grad: {param.requires_grad}")

#Further analysis could involve summing parameter counts for layer-wise analysis
total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
print(f"\nTotal Number of Parameters: {total_params}")
```

This example demonstrates the use of `named_parameters()`, which iterates through the model's parameters, providing both the name (path within the model architecture) and the tensor itself.  The output explicitly states the shape, data type, and whether gradient calculation is enabled for each parameter.  The additional calculation of `total_params` showcases how this information can be used for quantitative analysis.  This approach is best suited for smaller models; for extremely large models, a different approach (as shown below) might be needed due to memory constraints.

**Example 2: Recursive Parameter Listing for Complex Architectures:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def list_parameters(model, prefix=""):
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        full_name = prefix + "." + name if prefix else name
        print(f"Parameter Name: {full_name}, Shape: {param.shape}, Type: {param.dtype}, Requires Grad: {param.requires_grad}")
    for name, module in model.named_children():
        list_parameters(module, prefix + "." + name)

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(5, 2)
)

list_parameters(model)
```

This recursive function handles complex, nested models effectively.  It iterates through each submodule, recursively calling itself to traverse the entire architecture. The `prefix` argument ensures correct parameter naming, reflecting the hierarchical structure. This method is particularly advantageous when working with pre-trained models or custom architectures with multiple nested layers.

**Example 3:  Handling Buffers and Parameter Filtering:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10,5),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(5) # Includes buffers
)

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter: {name}, Shape: {param.shape}")

for name, buffer in model.named_buffers():
    print(f"Buffer: {name}, Shape: {buffer.shape}")

#Filtering parameters based on criteria (e.g., only weight parameters)
weight_params = [p for n, p in model.named_parameters() if 'weight' in n]
print("\nWeight parameters only:")
for param in weight_params:
    print(param.shape)
```

This example demonstrates how to differentiate between parameters and buffers.  Batch Normalization layers, for instance, utilize running mean and variance as buffers. These are crucial for inference but are not directly optimized during training.  The final section shows how you can filter parameters based on their name, which can be useful for analyzing specific parts of the model or for optimizing certain components separately.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning;  advanced PyTorch tutorials focusing on model architecture and parameter manipulation;  a reference guide for PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.  These resources offer a combination of theoretical background and practical examples, enabling a deeper understanding of PyTorch's inner workings and facilitating efficient parameter manipulation.  Understanding the distinction between different tensor operations within PyTorch is also essential.
