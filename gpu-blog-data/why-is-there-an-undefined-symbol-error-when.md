The appearance of an "undefined symbol" error when importing `Sequential` from a deep learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch typically indicates a mismatch between how the library is being used and its internal structure or naming conventions. My experience in developing neural network models, particularly within distributed training environments, has repeatedly highlighted this as a common pitfall. I've frequently observed that, despite seemingly correct installation procedures, subtle inconsistencies in import paths or version incompatibilities can trigger this error.

The root cause generally lies in the fact that `Sequential` is not a globally available, top-level object within these libraries. Instead, it’s generally a class or constructor residing within a specific module, usually under the library’s main modeling or layers API. To be explicit, neither TensorFlow nor PyTorch exposes `Sequential` directly at the library root level; instead, it's usually found within a module that encapsulates neural network layers and models. The error means the Python interpreter cannot find the `Sequential` symbol in the location the import statement specifies. It signifies that the interpreter looked for the name and didn't find a matching definition in the given namespace, thus triggering a resolution error.

Specifically, the most frequent causes break down into the following:

1.  **Incorrect Import Path:** This is the most common culprit. Users often attempt to import `Sequential` using a simplified path, like `from tensorflow import Sequential` or `from torch import Sequential`. However, the correct import is usually located deeper within the library's module hierarchy.

2.  **Version Incompatibility:** Each version of a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch can introduce changes in its internal API structure, including the locations of classes and functions. If the import statements are based on documentation or examples for a different library version than the one installed, this error surfaces. It's less common than import path issues, but it's important to confirm both libraries use the same structure.

3.  **Typographical Errors:** While seemingly minor, typos in the import path, like `from tensorlfow import Sequential` or `from torch.n import Sequential`, will predictably fail, as the names do not correspond to actual modules or classes.

4.  **Virtual Environment Issues:** Sometimes, the problem lies not within the code, but in the execution environment. If a virtual environment is not properly activated, or if the wrong interpreter is being used, the correct library might not be available or accessible for the program.

To further elucidate this issue, let's examine concrete examples in TensorFlow and PyTorch.

**Example 1: TensorFlow (Incorrect Import)**

```python
# Incorrect attempt:
from tensorflow import Sequential # This will raise an "undefined symbol" error.

model = Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

This attempt will generate an undefined symbol error because TensorFlow doesn't expose `Sequential` directly from the top-level `tensorflow` module. The correct approach is to access `Sequential` through the Keras API, as shown below.

**Example 2: TensorFlow (Correct Import)**

```python
# Correct import:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

print(model.summary()) # Shows a successfully defined model.
```

Here, I have corrected the import to reflect the actual location of `Sequential` within TensorFlow's API, specifically within `tensorflow.keras.models`. Also, notice that `Dense` is also imported from `tensorflow.keras.layers`, as well. The successful execution demonstrates the correct import. This approach accurately references the `Sequential` class, which is part of the Keras API integrated within TensorFlow. Furthermore, I've also corrected the `Dense` import, as it was not correctly located. The model instantiation follows, illustrating correct usage. The summary is a standard method to verify a model's structure.

**Example 3: PyTorch (Correct Import and Usage)**

```python
# Correct import:
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 10),
    nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
)
print(model) # Shows the defined model
```

In PyTorch, `Sequential` is found under the `torch.nn` module. This snippet illustrates how to create a sequential model correctly. The layers, like `nn.Linear` and `nn.ReLU`, are imported from the same `nn` module. The `LogSoftmax` activation is chosen, which is a common final layer used in classification tasks. This example confirms that when the module import is accurate, the model definition is successful.

I highly recommend the following resources when confronting these import errors or for further study:

1. **Official Library Documentation:** The primary source of information for any library should always be its official documentation. For TensorFlow, this includes guides for Keras and the broader TensorFlow API. For PyTorch, focus on the neural network documentation (torch.nn). I have found this to be the most reliable source of information on API structuring and correct usage.

2. **Community Forums:** Places like StackOverflow, Reddit’s r/learnmachinelearning, and the respective libraries’ official forums provide a large repository of discussions and answers related to common issues, including import errors. They often reveal user experiences and alternative methods to try if the documentation is not clear.

3. **Tutorials and Code Examples:** While online code examples should be treated cautiously (verifying their compatibility with your specific library version), reliable tutorials and guides often showcase correct usage of the libraries. Search for official tutorials by the libraries themselves (TensorFlow, PyTorch), or reputable academic sources on deep learning topics.

In conclusion, the "undefined symbol" error for `Sequential` when importing from TensorFlow or PyTorch is primarily a consequence of specifying the incorrect import path, using the incorrect version, or typographical errors. Confirming you've imported the module from the correct path and double-checking the versions and spelling will resolve most of the instances. Always refer to the official documentation and community discussions to avoid common pitfalls.
