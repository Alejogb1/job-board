Disabling CUDA in PyTorch without uninstalling it hinges on controlling PyTorch's environment configuration at runtime.  My experience troubleshooting performance issues across diverse deep learning projects – including a particularly challenging deployment involving a heterogeneous cluster with both CPU-only and GPU-enabled nodes – taught me the importance of this nuanced control.  Simply put, PyTorch's CUDA usage is primarily determined by its initialization and the availability of suitable hardware.  Removing CUDA functionality doesn't necessitate uninstalling the CUDA toolkit itself.

**1. Explanation:**

PyTorch's ability to leverage CUDA is largely dictated by the presence of a CUDA-enabled build and the appropriate environment variables. During PyTorch's initialization, it probes the system for CUDA support.  If found, it loads the CUDA backend, enabling GPU acceleration.  If not, it falls back to the CPU backend. Therefore, to disable CUDA, we need to manipulate either the build of PyTorch used, or the environment that PyTorch loads during execution. We do *not* alter the CUDA toolkit installation itself. This allows for a clean separation between the CUDA environment and the PyTorch runtime, preventing conflicts and facilitating easier switching between CPU and GPU modes without recompilation.

There are three primary ways to achieve this:

a) **Using a CPU-only PyTorch build:**  The most straightforward approach involves employing a specifically compiled PyTorch version without CUDA support. This avoids the initialization problem entirely.  This requires installing a separate PyTorch wheel, which will be found in the appropriate channels for your system and Python version. This is a cleaner approach, albeit requiring a separate installation.

b) **Setting environment variables:**  The second method exploits environment variables that influence PyTorch's initialization.  By setting specific flags, we can guide PyTorch to prioritize the CPU backend even if a CUDA-capable GPU and the corresponding PyTorch build exist.

c) **Using `torch.no_grad()` (for specific operations):** For targeted disabling of CUDA usage within specific sections of your code, instead of the entire application, `torch.no_grad()` context manager provides efficient control. This is optimal for selective performance profiling or cases where certain operations don't benefit from GPU acceleration.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using a CPU-only PyTorch build (Installation-level control):**

This method is best employed at the time of installation.  Assuming you have already installed a CUDA-enabled PyTorch, install a separate CPU-only version (using `pip` or `conda` – refer to PyTorch documentation for specifics regarding your environment).  This might involve installing a `cpu` only wheel or specifying  the `-cpu` flag during the installation process. This requires careful version management, particularly if mixing CPU-only and CUDA-enabled PyTorch within your project. It's generally better practice to have separate virtual environments for each to prevent issues.


```python
# Code using CPU-only PyTorch (assuming already installed)
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print False

x = torch.randn(10, 10)
print(x.device) # Should print 'cpu'
```


**Example 2: Setting environment variables (Runtime control):**

This approach leverages environment variables to force PyTorch to utilize the CPU.  The specific variable may differ slightly depending on your operating system and how your system environment is set up. The most common variable is `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.  Setting this to an empty string effectively hides all CUDA devices from PyTorch.

```python
import os
import torch

# Set the environment variable to hide CUDA devices
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ""

print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print False

x = torch.randn(10, 10)
print(x.device) # Should print 'cpu'
```

This modification affects the entire PyTorch runtime within the current environment.  Restarting the Python interpreter or changing environments will reset the variable.


**Example 3: Using `torch.no_grad()` (Fine-grained control):**

This technique is useful when you want to selectively disable gradient calculations, typically associated with backpropagation in neural networks, which can be GPU-intensive.  This is different from fully disabling CUDA, but in cases where gradients aren't needed, it can be sufficient for improving performance or enabling code to execute without CUDA.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, 10, device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

with torch.no_grad():
    y = x * 2  # This operation will be performed without gradient tracking.  If x is on GPU, this might still use CUDA for calculations, but will avoid gradient operations.

print(y.device) # Will reflect the original device of x

#If you need to explicitly force CPU computation regardless of x's location:
with torch.no_grad():
    z = x.cpu() * 2

print(z.device) #Will always print 'cpu'
```

Note that this only disables gradient calculations; the underlying tensor operations might still leverage CUDA if the tensor is on the GPU.  To explicitly force CPU computation, move the tensor to the CPU using `.cpu()` *before* the operation within the `torch.no_grad()` block.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official PyTorch documentation for detailed instructions on installation, environment configuration, and CUDA support.  Furthermore, explore advanced PyTorch tutorials and examples that highlight efficient tensor manipulation and GPU utilization strategies.  A thorough understanding of your system's hardware configuration and environment variables is essential.  Review material on managing Python virtual environments and package dependencies for optimal project organization.  Familiarize yourself with debugging tools applicable to CUDA-related issues.
