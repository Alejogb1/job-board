Model loss increase or fluctuation during training is a common issue stemming from a confluence of factors, rarely attributable to a single cause.  In my experience debugging hundreds of neural network training runs, the most frequently overlooked aspect is the interplay between learning rate scheduling, data pre-processing, and model architecture choices.  While debugging, it's crucial to methodically isolate and address these elements, rather than jumping to conclusions about inherent model limitations.

**1.  Understanding the Root Causes:**

Increased or fluctuating loss indicates the model is not effectively learning from the training data.  Several factors contribute to this:

* **Learning Rate:** An inappropriately high learning rate can cause the optimizer to overshoot the optimal weights, leading to oscillations and ultimately, increasing loss. Conversely, a learning rate that's too low might result in slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima, manifesting as sluggish reduction or plateauing loss.

* **Data Issues:**  Problems with the training data, such as class imbalance, noisy data, or insufficient data augmentation, significantly affect model performance.  A model trained on imbalanced data might overfit to the majority class, leading to poor generalization and seemingly erratic loss behavior. Noise can introduce spurious patterns, while insufficient augmentation can limit the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

* **Model Architecture:**  An inadequately designed model architecture, including incorrect layer sizes, activation functions, or regularization techniques, can lead to instability during training.  For instance, overly deep networks without proper regularization are prone to overfitting, which often manifests as initially decreasing loss followed by a sharp increase.

* **Regularization Issues:**  Improper application of regularization techniques, like dropout or weight decay, can hinder training.  Insufficient regularization might lead to overfitting, while excessive regularization can impede learning, leading to high loss values.

* **Optimizer Choice:**  The choice of optimizer itself impacts training dynamics.  While Adam is often a good starting point, other optimizers like SGD with momentum might be better suited to specific datasets or architectures.  Incorrect hyperparameter tuning for the chosen optimizer can also cause loss fluctuations.

* **Batch Size:**  A very small batch size can introduce high variance in the gradient estimations, causing unstable training. Conversely, very large batch sizes can lead to slow convergence and potential difficulties in escaping local minima.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these issues with Python code examples using TensorFlow/Keras.  Assume we're working with a simple sequential model for image classification.

**Example 1:  Impact of Learning Rate**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# High learning rate - likely to cause oscillations
optimizer_high = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer_high, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_high = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)


# Low learning rate - might lead to slow convergence
optimizer_low = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-6)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer_low, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_low = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)


# Appropriate learning rate -  requires experimentation
optimizer_moderate = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer_moderate, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_moderate = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

#Analyze history_high.history['loss'], history_low.history['loss'], history_moderate.history['loss'] to compare loss curves.
```

This example demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting the learning rate.  Experimentation with different learning rates is crucial, often involving learning rate schedulers for adaptive adjustments throughout training.


**Example 2:  Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

#Without Augmentation
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_no_aug = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

#With Augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)
datagen.fit(x_train)
history_aug = model.fit(datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32), epochs=10)

#Analyze history_no_aug.history['loss'], history_aug.history['loss'] to compare loss curves.
```

This code snippet highlights the beneficial impact of data augmentation.  By artificially expanding the training dataset, we improve model robustness and reduce overfitting, which can stabilize training and prevent loss fluctuations.


**Example 3:  Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model without dropout
model_no_dropout = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_no_dropout.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_no_dropout = model_no_dropout.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Model with dropout
model_dropout = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.25), # Adding dropout for regularization
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_dropout.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_dropout = model_dropout.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

#Analyze history_no_dropout.history['loss'], history_dropout.history['loss'] to compare loss curves.
```

This example shows how dropout regularization can prevent overfitting.  By randomly dropping out neurons during training, dropout forces the network to learn more robust features, leading to improved generalization and more stable loss curves.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of neural network training, I recommend exploring  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and research papers on specific optimizers and regularization techniques.  Focusing on practical tutorials and working through examples is invaluable.  Furthermore, careful examination of loss curves and metrics throughout training is essential for identifying and diagnosing training problems.  Thorough data analysis and visualization is also crucial for identifying potential issues within the dataset itself.  Remember, methodical debugging is key; start with the most common causes, and then investigate more complex issues only after exhausting the more straightforward ones.
