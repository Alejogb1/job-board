The fundamental difference in TensorFlow's `saved_model` loading between Linux and Windows stems not from inherent discrepancies within the `saved_model` format itself, but rather from the underlying operating system's handling of file paths and system libraries.  My experience working on cross-platform TensorFlow deployments for large-scale image processing projects highlighted this consistently.  While the serialized graph and variables within a `saved_model` are platform-agnostic, the loader's interaction with the filesystem and the runtime environment introduces subtle yet critical variations.

Specifically, the primary divergence lies in the interpretation of file paths.  Linux uses forward slashes (`/`) as path separators, whereas Windows employs backslashes (`\`).  While TensorFlow's loader handles path normalization internally to a degree, inconsistencies can arise when using relative paths, particularly within complex project structures. Further complications can emerge if the loading script isn't explicitly configured to handle platform-specific path conventions.  Another point of difference is in the availability and versioning of system libraries that TensorFlow relies upon.  These may have different naming conventions, locations, and dependency resolutions across the two OSes.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `saved_model` loader, at its core, is responsible for reconstructing the TensorFlow computation graph and restoring the model's variables from the files contained within the `saved_model` directory. This process involves parsing the protocol buffer files that define the graph structure and loading the variable tensors from checkpoint files.  The crucial point is that this internal process is largely OS-independent.  However, the *external* interaction with the filesystem and the runtime environment – including finding and loading shared libraries and resolving paths – is where OS-specific behavior becomes prominent.

On Linux, the loader will typically expect paths structured according to the POSIX standard.  It will interpret forward slashes correctly and leverage system calls compatible with Linux's system libraries.  In contrast, on Windows, the loader must correctly parse backslashes and interact with the Windows API, including potential interactions with the registry for dependency resolution.  Failure to correctly account for these differences can manifest as cryptic errors related to file not found, or shared library loading failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Path Handling Discrepancies**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

model_path = "my_model" # Relative path

try:
  loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(model_path)
  print("Model loaded successfully.")
except OSError as e:
  print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
  print(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")  # Check the current directory for debugging
```

This simple example highlights a common problem. If `my_model` is a relative path, its interpretation will differ between Linux and Windows depending on the current working directory. On Linux, it might search `./my_model`, while on Windows, it might produce unexpected results due to differences in how the current directory is resolved.  Explicitly providing an absolute path avoids this issue, making the code more portable.


**Example 2:  Explicit Path Handling for Portability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def load_model(platform):
  model_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "my_model") # Relative to script location

  # Platform-specific path adjustments. This is crucial for portability
  if platform == "windows":
    model_dir = model_dir.replace("/", "\\")

  try:
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(model_dir)
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
  except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    print(f"Model directory: {model_dir}")
  return loaded_model


#Example Usage
platform = "windows" # or "linux"
model = load_model(platform)

```

This example explicitly addresses the path issue.  By using `os.path.join` and `os.path.dirname(__file__)`, we create a path relative to the script's location. The conditional statement ensures the path separators are correct for the target platform. This increases the script's portability.


**Example 3:  Handling DLL Loading Issues on Windows**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# This example uses a hypothetical custom op scenario
try:
  # Load the model
  loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("my_model")
  # Check for custom operations' existence and handle DLL loading on Windows
  if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
      print("GPU detected, using GPU specific op")
      # Add further logic to check presence of specific DLLs and handle appropriately
      # e.g. check for 'my_custom_op.dll' in system PATH or known locations.
      # if not found, handle potential error.
      pass

except OSError as e:
  print(f"Error loading model or custom ops: {e}")
except Exception as e: # catch other potential exceptions that might occur with the custom op
  print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


```


This advanced example illustrates a situation where custom operations might be involved.  On Windows, these operations might rely on DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries). The code should include checks to ensure these DLLs are correctly loaded, potentially involving adding their paths to the system's environment variables or handling specific error codes related to DLL loading failures.  The omission of precise DLL handling is intentional to demonstrate the general concept.  Error handling is also crucial; it should account for both the primary `OSError` and other exceptions that could be raised during custom operation loading.
