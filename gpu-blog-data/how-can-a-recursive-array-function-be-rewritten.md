The core challenge in transforming a standard recursive array function to generate its recursive output mid-process stems from the inherent top-down execution flow of traditional recursion. Typically, a recursive function processes data, makes recursive calls, and then consolidates results at the top level after all recursive calls have returned. Shifting the output generation to the middle necessitates a restructuring of this control flow. This typically involves using helper functions or modifying the core recursive logic to accumulate intermediary results and selectively output them at the correct recursion depth. My experience building complex data transformation pipelines has shown me this requires careful state management and a different approach to how data is processed in each recursive step.

The typical recursive array processing function follows a pattern: It checks a base case, if not reached, it processes the current element, then recursively calls itself on the rest of the array, and finally, combines any return values. We need to disrupt this pattern. To output during the recursive call, rather than after it, we must make the current call aware of the required output structure and feed into it directly, rather than aggregating results and returning them. We’ll do this by constructing output structures during the recursive traversal, ensuring the output is built from the inside out, rather than from the outside in. This will require not only the array and recursive call, but also an additional argument, an accumulating structure where the partially generated output will be placed.

The key is to shift from a "return-and-combine" model to a "side-effect-within-recursion" model. Rather than relying on return values for our output, we'll modify the accumulator argument passed into each recursive call. This accumulator object will hold the partially constructed output at any given depth. The recursion itself is still primarily concerned with traversing the structure; the responsibility of how that traversal translates into output structure lies in the side effects that the recursion has on the accumulator.

Let's illustrate this with examples. Initially consider a straightforward recursive function that sums the elements of an array:

```python
def recursive_sum(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    return arr[0] + recursive_sum(arr[1:])

print(recursive_sum([1,2,3,4])) # Output: 10
```
This is a classic example of returning the result. The recursion goes all the way to the base case, and adds the values during the return process. To output in the middle, let's re-imagine this as generating a string that includes sub-sums. We need an accumulator to store the results as they're generated.

```python
def recursive_sum_mid_output(arr, accumulator, depth=0):
    if not arr:
        return

    current_sum = sum(arr) #calculate the current level sum
    indent = "  " * depth

    accumulator["output"] += f"{indent}Level {depth}: sum = {current_sum}\n"
    if len(arr) > 1:
      midpoint = len(arr)//2
      recursive_sum_mid_output(arr[:midpoint], accumulator, depth + 1)
      recursive_sum_mid_output(arr[midpoint:], accumulator, depth + 1)


accumulator = {"output": ""} #Initialize the accumulator
recursive_sum_mid_output([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], accumulator)
print(accumulator["output"])
# Expected Output:
# Level 0: sum = 21
#   Level 1: sum = 6
#     Level 2: sum = 3
#     Level 2: sum = 3
#   Level 1: sum = 15
#     Level 2: sum = 15

```
In this modified example, the `recursive_sum_mid_output` function no longer returns a sum. Instead, it modifies the `accumulator` by adding the formatted output string at the beginning of the recursive call. Crucially, the actual summing operation and output string formatting now occurs *before* any recursive calls. The output is built progressively with each call, by appending to the string within the `accumulator`.  The `depth` parameter is introduced to add indentation and make the output easier to understand. This is a direct example of producing the output "in the middle" of the recursive process. The processing occurs before recursion, not after it.

Consider a more complex example, where we might want to transform an array into a nested dictionary structure, reflecting the recursive traversal. The basic recursive structure stays the same, but we will output by writing into the accumulator structure in pre-order fashion.

```python
def array_to_nested_dict(arr, accumulator, depth=0):
    if not arr:
      return
    current_key = f"level_{depth}"
    accumulator[current_key] = {} # Create current level node

    if len(arr) > 1:
      midpoint = len(arr) // 2
      accumulator[current_key]["left"] = {} # Place for left node
      array_to_nested_dict(arr[:midpoint], accumulator[current_key]["left"], depth + 1)
      accumulator[current_key]["right"] = {} # Place for right node
      array_to_nested_dict(arr[midpoint:], accumulator[current_key]["right"], depth + 1)
    else:
      accumulator[current_key]["value"] = arr[0]

accumulator = {}
array_to_nested_dict([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], accumulator)
import json #used to print the dictionary
print(json.dumps(accumulator, indent = 2))

# Expected Output:
# {
#   "level_0": {
#     "left": {
#       "level_1": {
#         "left": {
#           "level_2": {
#             "value": 1
#           }
#         },
#         "right": {
#           "level_2": {
#             "value": 2
#           }
#         }
#       }
#     },
#     "right": {
#       "level_1": {
#         "left": {
#            "level_2": {
#             "value": 3
#           }
#         },
#         "right": {
#           "level_2": {
#             "left": {
#                 "level_3": {
#                     "value": 4
#                   }
#                 },
#             "right": {
#                 "level_3": {
#                     "value": 5
#                   }
#             }
#           }
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
```

In this example, the dictionary structure is directly built by writing into the `accumulator` argument within the function. Instead of returning nested dictionaries as a result, the `array_to_nested_dict` function places the dictionaries into the `accumulator` argument during traversal. This is not the same as generating a tree data structure and then converting that tree to a dictionary. It is more akin to constructing a building by placing concrete and steel as you move through the blueprint. The output dictionary is being built “in place,” mid-recursion.  The recursive calls proceed after current-level output structures are created and populated.

Finally, consider an example involving processing a tree structure, using recursion to produce an indented string representation of the tree’s nodes and their depths. In this case, our input will be a tree represented in nested lists, and the output is built by building an output string within the accumulator before descending into the child nodes.

```python
def tree_to_indented_string(tree, accumulator, depth=0):
    if not tree:
        return

    node_value = tree[0]
    indent = "  " * depth
    accumulator["output"] += f"{indent}- {node_value}\n" # add to the output

    for child_tree in tree[1:]:
      tree_to_indented_string(child_tree, accumulator, depth+1) # call recursion to get child tree representation

accumulator = {"output": ""}
tree_data = ["A", ["B", ["C"]], ["D", ["E", ["F"]]]]
tree_to_indented_string(tree_data, accumulator)
print(accumulator["output"])

# Expected Output:
# - A
#   - B
#     - C
#   - D
#     - E
#       - F

```

Here the key change is that string is added to accumulator before the recursive calls to the children of current node.  This means the “output” happens in the middle of the recursive calls, and not all at the end, as in typical recursive pattern.  This example demonstrates that the accumulator can be adapted for different output structures, and the essential logic of the output generation during recursion remains the same.

To enhance understanding of recursive techniques, I recommend exploring resources that focus on functional programming paradigms, as well as advanced algorithms involving tree and graph traversals. Texts covering data structure implementation are useful, and studying design patterns such as the Visitor pattern, which often involves recursive traversal techniques, can further your grasp of such problems. Books specifically dealing with algorithm complexity can give you a deeper knowledge of why and when recursive methods are appropriate, or, conversely, when iterative techniques might be more efficient. These resources will collectively provide a solid foundation for dealing with recursive algorithms and their effective transformation.
