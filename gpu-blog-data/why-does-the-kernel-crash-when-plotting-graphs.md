Kernel crashes during graph plotting after PyTorch import often stem from memory mismanagement, particularly when dealing with large tensors or insufficient system resources.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects – from high-throughput image classification to complex reinforcement learning environments – I've identified several root causes beyond simply insufficient RAM.  These include improper tensor deletion, inefficient data handling practices, and the interaction between PyTorch's memory management and the plotting library's resource requirements.

**1.  Memory Leaks and Tensor Management:**

PyTorch's dynamic computation graph relies on automatic differentiation, resulting in the creation and retention of numerous intermediate tensors.  If these tensors aren't explicitly deleted using `del` or if the garbage collector isn't sufficiently effective, memory consumption can rapidly escalate.  This is exacerbated when plotting functions, often implemented in libraries like Matplotlib, attempt to access and process potentially massive datasets derived from PyTorch tensors.  The combination of  PyTorch's memory usage and the plotting library's demands can overwhelm available system resources, leading to a kernel crash.  Furthermore, using PyTorch's `DataLoader` without careful consideration of `batch_size` and `num_workers` parameters can lead to excessive memory consumption, as the dataloader pre-fetches data into memory.

**2.  Incompatibilities Between PyTorch and Plotting Libraries:**

Certain versions of PyTorch and plotting libraries might have known incompatibilities that manifest as crashes under specific conditions.  For example, during early stages of PyTorch development, I encountered frequent crashes when attempting to visualize tensor data using older versions of Matplotlib.  These incompatibilities can stem from differing memory management schemes, data transfer protocols, or even subtle bugs in either library's implementation.  Ensuring compatibility by reviewing release notes and utilizing well-tested and updated versions is paramount.

**3.  System Resource Constraints:**

Even with correct tensor management practices, insufficient system resources – RAM, swap space, and processing power – can still lead to kernel crashes.  While many users focus solely on RAM, the interplay between RAM, swap space, and CPU usage is critical.  Excessively relying on swap space (using hard drive space as virtual memory) can dramatically slow down computations, potentially causing a cascading failure within the plotting process.  Similarly, intense CPU usage from PyTorch calculations coupled with the demands of the plotting library can overload the system, forcing the kernel to terminate.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Improper Tensor Deletion**

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a large tensor
large_tensor = torch.rand(10000, 10000)

# Perform some calculations (replace with your actual code)
result = large_tensor.sum()

# Incorrect: relying on garbage collection
# This is prone to memory leaks, especially with many such tensors.
# result = large_tensor.sum()


# Correct: Explicitly delete the large tensor
del large_tensor

# Plot the result (replace with your plotting code)
plt.plot(result.numpy()) # Convert to numpy array for matplotlib compatibility.
plt.show()
```

In this example, the crucial difference lies in explicitly deleting `large_tensor` using `del`. This prevents the tensor from remaining in memory, reducing the chance of exceeding system limits.  Simply relying on Python’s garbage collector isn't sufficient for large tensors.


**Example 2: Efficient Data Handling**

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate data, efficiently managing memory usage
dataset = torch.rand(100000, 10) # smaller tensor

# Instead of loading everything into memory at once, process in batches:
batch_size = 1000
for i in range(0, len(dataset), batch_size):
  batch = dataset[i:i + batch_size]
  # Process the batch, calculate something relevant
  processed_data = batch.mean(dim=1)
  # Plot or further process this smaller result.
  plt.plot(processed_data.numpy())  # Plotting a smaller chunk at a time
  plt.show() # Ensure the previous plot is displayed and releases resources.

```
This approach avoids loading the entire dataset into memory simultaneously, instead processing it in manageable batches.  This strategy is particularly beneficial when dealing with datasets that exceed available RAM.  Plotting should be done within the batch loop or on the processed data in a smaller form, preventing resource exhaustion.


**Example 3:  PyTorch DataLoader and Batch Processing**

```python
import torch
import torch.utils.data as data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset (replace with your actual dataset)
class MyDataset(data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.data = torch.randn(size, 10)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Create a DataLoader with appropriate batch size and num_workers
dataset = MyDataset(100000)
dataloader = data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1000, num_workers=0) # num_workers = 0 for simplicity, adjust as needed

# Process data in batches and plot
for batch in dataloader:
    # Process batch
    processed_batch = batch.mean(dim=1)
    # Plot results (avoid plotting each batch individually if data is too large, accumulate and plot later.)
    plt.plot(processed_batch.numpy())
plt.show()
```

This demonstrates utilizing `DataLoader` for efficient batch processing. The `num_workers` parameter (set to 0 here for simplicity) can be adjusted based on the number of CPU cores, but increasing it excessively can lead to issues if not managed carefully.  The key is to handle the data in smaller, manageable chunks and plot aggregated information or summaries to avoid overloading memory and the plotting system.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For more detailed understanding of PyTorch memory management, consult the official PyTorch documentation.  Explore advanced topics such as custom memory allocators and CUDA memory management for high-performance computing scenarios.  For efficient data handling and plotting with large datasets, research the capabilities of libraries like Dask and Vaex, which are designed for out-of-core computations and visualization.  The documentation for Matplotlib and other plotting libraries is essential for understanding their resource requirements and best practices for handling large datasets.  Finally, examining your system's performance metrics – RAM usage, CPU load, and swap space – using system monitoring tools provides invaluable insights into potential resource bottlenecks.
