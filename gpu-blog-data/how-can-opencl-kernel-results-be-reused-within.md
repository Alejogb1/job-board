OpenCL's strength lies in its ability to perform parallel computations on heterogeneous platforms.  However, efficiently managing data transfer between kernels is crucial for performance optimization.  Repeated transfers to the host memory represent a significant bottleneck, negating many of the advantages of parallel processing.  My experience optimizing large-scale scientific simulations taught me that leveraging OpenCL's inter-kernel communication features is paramount for achieving optimal performance. This involves careful consideration of memory allocation and appropriate use of memory objects.

The key to reusing OpenCL kernel results without host intervention lies in utilizing global memory and, where appropriate, local memory, carefully managing memory access patterns and ensuring data consistency.  A naive approach might lead to race conditions or data corruption, especially in scenarios with significant data parallelism.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Efficient inter-kernel communication in OpenCL primarily relies on sharing memory objects.  The results generated by a kernel are stored in a designated memory region (global or local).  Subsequent kernels can then access this same memory region as input, thus avoiding the overhead of transferring data to the host and back.  The selection of global versus local memory depends on the size of the data and the access patterns of the subsequent kernels.  Local memory provides faster access but has a smaller capacity.  Global memory offers larger storage but comes with slower access times.  Effective utilization requires careful consideration of work-group size and data locality.  Furthermore, appropriate synchronization mechanisms might be necessary to ensure data consistency if multiple kernels write to the same memory location concurrently.

This process requires a well-defined execution order and careful planning.  Subsequent kernels must execute only after the preceding kernel has completed writing to the shared memory.  This can be managed using OpenCL events, which provide synchronization primitives.  The application waits for the completion of an event associated with a kernel before launching another kernel that depends on the results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition and Multiplication using Global Memory:**

```c++
// Kernel 1: Vector Addition
__kernel void addVectors(__global const float* a, __global const float* b, __global float* c, int size) {
    int i = get_global_id(0);
    if (i < size) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

// Kernel 2: Vector Multiplication
__kernel void multiplyVector(__global const float* c, __global const float* d, __global float* e, int size) {
    int i = get_global_id(0);
    if (i < size) {
        e[i] = c[i] * d[i];
    }
}

// Host Code (Illustrative)
// ... create buffers a, b, d, e ...
// ... set kernel arguments for addVectors ...
// clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, addVectorsKernel, ...);
// ... wait for addVectors to complete using clWaitForEvents() ...
// ... set kernel arguments for multiplyVector, using c as input ...
// clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, multiplyVectorKernel, ...);
// ... retrieve results from e ...
```

This example showcases a fundamental pattern. `addVectors` writes its output to `c`, which is then directly used as input by `multiplyVector`.  Crucially, the host code utilizes `clWaitForEvents()` to ensure that `multiplyVector` only begins execution after `addVectors` has completed.


**Example 2:  Using Local Memory for Increased Performance (within a work-group):**

```c++
__kernel void processData(__global const float* input, __global float* output, int size) {
    __local float localData[LOCAL_SIZE]; //LOCAL_SIZE defined appropriately
    int globalId = get_global_id(0);
    int localId = get_local_id(0);
    int groupSize = get_local_size(0);

    //Load data into local memory
    localData[localId] = input[globalId];
    barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); // Ensure all work-items have loaded data

    //Perform intermediate computation using localData
    // ... some operation on localData[localId] ...

    //Store result in global memory
    output[globalId] = localData[localId];
}
```

In this case, the data is initially loaded into local memory, allowing faster access within a workgroup.  The `barrier` function synchronizes all work items within the workgroup before writing back to global memory. This is particularly advantageous for operations requiring extensive intra-workgroup communication.


**Example 3:  Image Processing with Inter-Kernel Dependency:**

```c++
//Kernel 1: Grayscale Conversion
__kernel void convertToGrayscale(__read_only image2d_t inputImage, __write_only image2d_t outputImage) {
    int2 coord = {get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1)};
    float4 pixel = read_imagef(inputImage, sampler, coord);
    float gray = 0.299f * pixel.x + 0.587f * pixel.y + 0.114f * pixel.z;
    write_imagef(outputImage, coord, (float4)(gray, gray, gray, pixel.w));
}

//Kernel 2: Edge Detection
__kernel void edgeDetection(__read_only image2d_t grayscaleImage, __write_only image2d_t edgeImage) {
    // ... Edge detection algorithm using grayscaleImage ...
}

//Host code (Illustrative)
// ... create images ...
// ... Enqueue convertToGrayscale ...
// ... wait for convertToGrayscale completion ...
// ... Enqueue edgeDetection using the outputImage from convertToGrayscale as input ...
// ... Retrieve Results from edgeImage ...
```

This example demonstrates image processing. The grayscale conversion kernel (`convertToGrayscale`) writes its results to `outputImage`, which is then directly used as input by the edge detection kernel (`edgeDetection`).  Again, the crucial step is ensuring proper synchronization to prevent race conditions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The OpenCL specification, a comprehensive OpenCL programming guide focusing on advanced topics such as memory management and inter-kernel communication, and a well-structured tutorial emphasizing practical examples are beneficial resources.   Further specialized texts on parallel computing and GPU programming offer broader context and theoretical foundations.  Working through numerous practical examples and progressively tackling more complex scenarios is also incredibly valuable in understanding and mastering the subtleties of this powerful programming paradigm.
