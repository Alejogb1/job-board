Categorical encoding using Keras's `to_categorical` function is inherently designed to expand the dimensionality of a label representation, not to alter the structure of the input batch itself. Specifically, it transforms a 2D tensor of integer-encoded labels into a 3D tensor where the last dimension represents the one-hot encoding. This behavior is central to how categorical data is fed into deep learning models expecting probability distributions as targets. Confusion arises when expecting a 3D output solely based on the input’s 2D nature; the core functionality is about the encoding, not input reshaping.

In my experience building neural networks for sequence labeling tasks, I initially grappled with this as well. I had a 2D matrix representing word-level labels for sentences and anticipated a 3D output from `to_categorical` that would somehow reflect a sentence-based view. However, upon closer examination and after some debugging, the reasoning became clear: `to_categorical` operates on the individual labels irrespective of their batching structure. It effectively converts each integer label into a vector of zeros with a one at the index corresponding to the label’s value. This vector is subsequently appended as a new dimension.

Let's clarify this with a concrete example. Assume we have a 2D tensor representing two sequences of labels. The shape is (2, 3), indicating two sequences, each having three labels. Each number in the tensor represents a category.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Example 2D input representing two sequences of labels
labels_2d = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1]])
print(f"Original labels (2D):\n{labels_2d}")
print(f"Shape of original labels: {labels_2d.shape}\n")

# Apply to_categorical
encoded_labels = to_categorical(labels_2d)

print(f"Encoded labels (3D):\n{encoded_labels}")
print(f"Shape of encoded labels: {encoded_labels.shape}")
```

Here, the input `labels_2d` has a shape of (2, 3). After applying `to_categorical`, the output `encoded_labels` has a shape of (2, 3, 3). The additional dimension arises from the one-hot encoding; each original label is now represented by a vector of size 3 (the number of categories present in the input data), where only one element is ‘1’ and others are ‘0’. The shape (2, 3, 3) represents two sequences, each of length three, where the last dimension encodes the categorical labels. It's critical to note that the batch size and sequence length, from (2, 3) remain unchanged in the first two dimensions.

To further illustrate, consider an input with a different label sequence and a larger number of distinct categories:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Example 2D input with more categories
labels_2d_extended = np.array([[0, 2, 4, 1], [3, 2, 0, 4]])
print(f"Original labels (2D):\n{labels_2d_extended}")
print(f"Shape of original labels: {labels_2d_extended.shape}\n")


# Apply to_categorical
encoded_labels_extended = to_categorical(labels_2d_extended)
print(f"Encoded labels (3D):\n{encoded_labels_extended}")
print(f"Shape of encoded labels: {encoded_labels_extended.shape}")

```

In this instance, `labels_2d_extended` has the shape (2, 4). The encoded version, `encoded_labels_extended`, has the shape (2, 4, 5). The final dimension of size 5 is crucial; this indicates that the largest label in `labels_2d_extended` was 4, resulting in five possible classes (0 to 4). `to_categorical` automatically infers the number of classes by finding the maximum value in the input tensor.  This underscores the point that the output is not arbitrarily made 3D; the third dimension emerges as a result of encoding the discrete integer values into a vector, thus representing the probability vector for each possible category. It is a one-hot encoding that results in this final dimension.

Let's demonstrate a common usage pattern within a training loop for a simple sequential model:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Create dummy data and labels
num_samples = 100
sequence_length = 5
num_categories = 3
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, sequence_length, 1) # Dummy sequence data
y = np.random.randint(0, num_categories, (num_samples, sequence_length)) # Integer-encoded labels

# One-hot encode the labels
y_encoded = to_categorical(y, num_classes=num_categories)

# Define a simple model (example RNN)
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.SimpleRNN(32, input_shape=(sequence_length, 1), return_sequences=True),
    layers.Dense(num_categories, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y_encoded, epochs=5, verbose=0)

print(f"Input data shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Output labels (after to_categorical) shape: {y_encoded.shape}")

```
In this example, we generate random sequence data (X) and corresponding integer-encoded labels (y), and then use `to_categorical` to one-hot encode `y`. The one-hot encoded `y_encoded` is then used to train the model. The shape of the labels is now (100, 5, 3), and this can be seen as a probability vector for each of 5 labels in each of 100 samples. Crucially, the model's output layer utilizes a `softmax` activation, aligning with the one-hot encoded representation in `y_encoded`.

In essence, `to_categorical` does not reshape the input batch. Rather, it expands the number of features per element in your sequence or tensor by converting scalar integer categories into a vector. This is a fundamental operation when working with categorical data and cross-entropy loss in a deep learning context. It is designed to create a one-hot vector at the last dimension of the output tensor, thereby creating a valid representation of categorical targets.

For further study of categorical encoding and data preparation within deep learning workflows, I recommend investigating resources detailing data preprocessing techniques and specifically the nuances of one-hot encoding. Documents on TensorFlow, Keras, and general machine learning courses usually cover this quite well. Focus on materials emphasizing data preparation for classification tasks.
