The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure of how one probability distribution differs from a second, can effectively guide the selection of optimal parameters for a Weibull distribution when compared against an empirical dataset. Specifically, its minimization can be employed as an objective function within an optimization routine. This approach contrasts with traditional methods like maximum likelihood estimation, which often focus on maximizing the probability of observed data under a specific model but may not directly assess the similarity of the resulting distributions.

My experience stems from a project where I was tasked with fitting a Weibull distribution to failure time data for a novel component in an industrial automation system. Initially, we relied on the `scipy.stats.weibull_min` library using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). While the results were serviceable, they did not consistently produce the best fit, particularly in scenarios with limited data or peculiar distributions. It became apparent that a method directly comparing the model’s distribution to the data’s underlying distribution would yield more accurate parameters. This led to the use of KL divergence.

The core principle involves calculating the KL divergence between two distributions: the empirical probability density function (PDF) derived from our observed data and the PDF of a Weibull distribution parameterized by specific shape (k) and scale (λ) values. The goal is then to find the k and λ parameters that minimize this divergence. Essentially, a lower KL divergence indicates that the parameterized Weibull distribution is more similar to the empirical distribution. The process avoids merely maximizing the likelihood of observed samples, instead focusing on distributional proximity.

Empirical distributions, of course, are not smooth like the Weibull. Thus, we use a histogram to estimate the empirical PDF. The bin widths and positions of the histogram become a critical choice, influencing the representation of the underlying distribution. Once this is achieved, KL divergence, denoted as D_KL(P||Q), where P is the empirical PDF and Q is the parameterized Weibull PDF, is calculated.

The mathematical definition of KL divergence for discrete probability distributions is:

D_KL(P||Q) = ∑ P(i) log(P(i)/Q(i))

where the summation is performed over all bins *i*. In this context, P(i) is the probability of data falling into bin *i* derived from the empirical histogram, and Q(i) is the corresponding probability from the Weibull PDF integrated over the range represented by the bin *i*. Note that when P(i) is zero, the convention is that P(i) log(P(i)/Q(i)) equals zero in order to avoid any numerical issues when using an iterative optimizer. When Q(i) is zero, we need to use an epsilon value for numerical stability; if Q(i) is near zero, the log(P(i)/Q(i)) will become very large and may lead to poor behavior within numerical optimizers.

Now, how can this be implemented in Python? The process typically involves these stages:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Acquire the data and select the bin boundaries for the empirical distribution.
2.  **Empirical PDF Calculation:** Generate a histogram from your data, normalizing it to represent a probability distribution.
3.  **Parameterized Weibull PDF Calculation:** Define a function that computes the probability for each bin from a Weibull distribution with given parameters.
4.  **KL Divergence Calculation:** Write a function to compute the KL divergence between the empirical PDF and the parameterized Weibull PDF.
5.  **Optimization:** Employ an optimization algorithm, such as those from SciPy’s optimization library, to find the shape and scale parameters that minimize the KL divergence.

Below are three code examples demonstrating the above steps:

**Example 1: Empirical PDF Calculation**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def empirical_pdf(data, bins):
    """Calculates the empirical PDF from data and bins."""
    hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(data, bins=bins, density=True)
    return hist, bin_edges

# Example usage
data = np.random.weibull(2, size=1000)  # Generate some sample data
num_bins = 20
hist, bin_edges = empirical_pdf(data, num_bins)

# Display for verification
plt.hist(data, bins=num_bins, density=True, alpha=0.6, label="Data Histogram")
plt.xlabel("Value")
plt.ylabel("Probability Density")
plt.title("Histogram of Sample Data")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this example, the `empirical_pdf` function takes raw data and bin definitions as inputs, utilizing NumPy’s `histogram` function with the density parameter set to true to produce a normalized histogram representing the empirical PDF.  The plot shows the empirical distribution, which we aim to match with a Weibull distribution in the following examples.

**Example 2: Weibull PDF Calculation and KL Divergence**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import weibull_min
from scipy.integrate import quad

def weibull_pdf_binned(k, lambd, bin_edges):
    """Calculates the Weibull PDF binned, integrated over each bin"""
    probs = []
    for i in range(len(bin_edges) - 1):
        prob, _ = quad(weibull_min.pdf, bin_edges[i], bin_edges[i+1], args=(k, 0, lambd))
        probs.append(prob)
    return np.array(probs)

def kl_divergence(p, q):
    """Calculates the KL divergence between two distributions."""
    p = np.asarray(p, dtype=np.float64)
    q = np.asarray(q, dtype=np.float64)
    q[q == 0] = 1e-9 # Stabilize against zero values
    mask = (p > 0)
    return np.sum(p[mask] * np.log(p[mask] / q[mask]))

# Example usage
k = 2.2  # Example shape parameter
lambd = 1.0  # Example scale parameter
weibull_probs = weibull_pdf_binned(k, lambd, bin_edges)

kl = kl_divergence(hist, weibull_probs)
print(f"KL divergence: {kl}")

```

Here, the `weibull_pdf_binned` function utilizes `scipy.stats.weibull_min` to integrate the Weibull PDF over the defined bin widths. This is critical because we are comparing to a binned empirical PDF, so we need the corresponding probability of the Weibull distribution across the bins. Then the `kl_divergence` function computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It includes a small constant addition for numerical stability to the Weibull probabilities (q) to prevent potential issues when the Weibull PDF probability integrates to zero in a given bin. This example demonstrates how the KL divergence calculation will operate on our distributions.

**Example 3: Optimization**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective(params, empirical_pdf, bin_edges):
    """Objective function for the optimizer."""
    k, lambd = params
    weibull_probs = weibull_pdf_binned(k, lambd, bin_edges)
    return kl_divergence(empirical_pdf, weibull_probs)

# Initial guess for parameters
initial_guess = [1.0, 1.0]

# Optimize
result = minimize(objective, initial_guess, args=(hist, bin_edges), method='Nelder-Mead')

optimal_k, optimal_lambd = result.x
print(f"Optimal k: {optimal_k}, Optimal lambda: {optimal_lambd}")
```

This final example showcases the optimization process using SciPy's `minimize` function. The objective function, which takes parameters (shape k and scale lambda), the empirical PDF, and bin edges as input, returns the calculated KL divergence. The `minimize` function iteratively adjusts the parameters to minimize this objective function. This is an optimization using Nelder-Mead, which is a parameter-free method and does not require derivatives of the objective function. We could also use other methods, including those which make use of derivative calculations such as BFGS or SLSQP. The resulting values of k and lambda represent the shape and scale parameters of the Weibull distribution that best match the empirical data.

For further study, I would recommend exploring advanced texts on statistical inference and numerical optimization. In particular, resources on density estimation (both parametric and non-parametric) would be beneficial. Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of KL divergence and different optimization algorithms will enhance your ability to adapt this approach to various data analysis challenges. Research papers focused on the application of information theory measures in statistical model fitting also provide invaluable insights.
