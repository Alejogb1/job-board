The discrepancy in cross-validation scores when employing `KerasRegressor` from `scikeras` versus directly using Keras stems from fundamental differences in how these libraries manage model instantiation and training within the cross-validation process.  My experience working on large-scale model deployment projects, particularly those involving neural networks for time series forecasting, highlighted this critical distinction.  Directly using Keras within a scikit-learn cross-validation framework often leads to inconsistent or inaccurate results due to improper state management and the lack of inherent compatibility with scikit-learn's `cross_val_score` function.

Scikit-learn's `cross_val_score` expects an estimator object that adheres to its API.  This API includes methods like `fit` and `predict`, which manage the training and prediction phases. While Keras models possess `fit` and `predict` methods, they don't inherently integrate with scikit-learn's internal mechanisms for handling cross-validation folds and data splitting.  This leads to several potential pitfalls:

1. **Incorrect Data Handling:** Direct use of Keras might fail to properly partition data across folds, resulting in data leakage or inconsistent training sets across folds. Scikit-learn's cross-validation routines carefully manage data splitting to ensure proper model evaluation.  Directly using Keras circumvents this crucial step.

2. **State Management Issues:** Keras models maintain internal state during training.  Using Keras directly within a loop that iterates through cross-validation folds might lead to unintended state carryover between folds, corrupting the evaluation process.  This is because the model's internal weights and biases are not properly reset before each fold's training.

3. **Incompatible Parameter Handling:** Scikit-learn's cross-validation methods often handle hyperparameter tuning.  When using Keras directly, this integration is absent, potentially hindering proper hyperparameter optimization and leading to suboptimal model performance reflected in the cross-validation scores.

`KerasRegressor` from `scikeras`, on the other hand, acts as a wrapper, meticulously integrating Keras models into the scikit-learn ecosystem.  It addresses the aforementioned shortcomings by explicitly managing model instantiation, training, and prediction within the context of scikit-learn's cross-validation framework. This ensures correct data handling, state management, and hyperparameter interaction.


Let's illustrate with code examples.  Consider a simple regression problem with a sequential Keras model:

**Example 1: Direct Keras use (Incorrect)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
print(scores) # Inconsistent and likely incorrect results
```

This approach is flawed because the Keras model `model` isn't a valid scikit-learn estimator.  The `cross_val_score` function doesn't handle the intricacies of Keras model training and resets within the cross-validation folds correctly.

**Example 2:  Using KerasRegressor (Correct)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from scikeras.wrappers import KerasRegressor
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)

def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

model = KerasRegressor(model=create_model, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
print(scores) # Consistent and reliable results
```

Here, `KerasRegressor` ensures proper interaction with scikit-learn. The `create_model` function facilitates the creation of the Keras model for each fold, ensuring each fold starts with a fresh, untrained model.

**Example 3:  Demonstrating Hyperparameter Tuning with KerasRegressor**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from scikeras.wrappers import KerasRegressor
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)

def create_model(units=64):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

model = KerasRegressor(model=create_model, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
param_grid = {'model__units': [32, 64, 128]}
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
grid_result = grid.fit(X, y)
print("Best: %f using %s" % (grid_result.best_score_, grid_result.best_params_))
```

This example shows seamless hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`, a functionality unavailable or highly complex when using Keras directly.  `KerasRegressor` elegantly handles the parameter passing and model retraining across different hyperparameter combinations and cross-validation folds.

In conclusion, the improved cross-validation scores achieved using `KerasRegressor` are not simply coincidental. They are a direct consequence of `scikeras`'s carefully designed integration with scikit-learn's cross-validation procedures.  This integration addresses crucial aspects of data management, state control, and hyperparameter interaction, providing a robust and reliable method for evaluating and optimizing Keras models within a scikit-learn workflow.  Therefore, for accurate and consistent cross-validation, employing `KerasRegressor` is strongly recommended over directly using Keras within scikit-learn's cross-validation functions.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The scikit-learn documentation, specifically the sections on cross-validation and model selection.  The Keras documentation, focusing on model compilation and training.  A comprehensive textbook on machine learning covering both neural networks and ensemble methods.  A practical guide on deep learning focusing on implementation and deployment aspects.
