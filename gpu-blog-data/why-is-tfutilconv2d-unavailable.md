TensorFlow's evolution has resulted in the deprecation of several utility functions initially provided within its lower-level modules, including `tf_util.conv2d`. This specific function, once a common shortcut for constructing convolutional layers, no longer exists as part of the official TensorFlow API in its modern 2.x versions, and its absence stems from a concerted effort to promote higher-level abstraction and ease of use. I encountered this firsthand when migrating an older machine learning project that relied heavily on such custom utilities to TensorFlow 2.3. The core issue isn't the loss of convolution functionality itself, but rather the shift toward using `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` and its associated methods as the preferred and supported means of building convolutional neural networks.

The rationale for this change is twofold. First, the `tf_util` module represented an ad-hoc collection of helper functions that did not adhere to the structured API design goals of later TensorFlow versions. It contained inconsistencies and relied on older TensorFlow backends, which became more challenging to maintain as TensorFlow evolved. Second, the `tf.keras` API provides an improved and more intuitive structure for model definition. Its `layers` module encapsulates the operations required to build neural networks and removes direct access to low-level TensorFlow operations, making it easier for users to define models in a consistent and platform-agnostic manner. The loss of `tf_util.conv2d`, therefore, is not a loss of functionality, but a move towards a more sustainable and principled architecture. The function's original purpose – performing a 2D convolution – is fundamentally achieved through `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` in the contemporary framework. This shift requires adapting to a slightly different programming style, but ultimately enhances the clarity and maintainability of TensorFlow projects.

Let me illustrate the transition with a few practical examples. In an older project, I might have employed `tf_util.conv2d` something like this:

```python
# Assume input_tensor is defined
import tensorflow as tf
# Hypothetical tf_util implementation, not part of official API
def conv2d(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, strides=1, padding='SAME', activation=None):
  initializer = tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.01)
  W = tf.compat.v1.get_variable('W', shape=[kernel_size, kernel_size, input_tensor.shape[-1], filters], initializer=initializer)
  b = tf.compat.v1.get_variable('b', shape=[filters], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
  conv = tf.nn.conv2d(input_tensor, W, strides=[1, strides, strides, 1], padding=padding)
  conv = tf.nn.bias_add(conv, b)
  if activation:
      conv = activation(conv)
  return conv

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) #Batch size of 1, 28x28x3 image
conv_output = conv2d(input_tensor, 32, 3, activation = tf.nn.relu) #First convolution with custom util function
print(conv_output)

```

This code example demonstrates how I used to define a 2D convolutional layer using a custom `conv2d` implementation similar to what `tf_util` may have provided. Notice the manual handling of variables, biases, and activation functions. It's more verbose and involves direct manipulation of low-level TensorFlow operations. The hypothetical function defined here is closer to the underlying implementation, but the user manages more implementation details. It also highlights how one might need to be very specific with the variable shapes and strides.

The equivalent code using `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` looks significantly different:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, ReLU

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) # Batch size of 1, 28x28x3 image
conv_layer = Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='relu')
conv_output = conv_layer(input_tensor)
print(conv_output)
```

Here, the `Conv2D` class handles the variable initialization and low-level details, simplifying the process. We specify the necessary parameters within the layer's constructor and then call the layer on the input tensor. It is notably more succinct and easier to read, showcasing the advantage of the `keras` API's abstraction. Further, the activation function is easily set as a parameter within the layer itself.

A further example, focusing on creating a multi-layer convolutional network might have looked like this using the custom implementation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# Hypothetical tf_util implementation, not part of official API (repeated)
def conv2d(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, strides=1, padding='SAME', activation=None):
  initializer = tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.01)
  W = tf.compat.v1.get_variable('W', shape=[kernel_size, kernel_size, input_tensor.shape[-1], filters], initializer=initializer)
  b = tf.compat.v1.get_variable('b', shape=[filters], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
  conv = tf.nn.conv2d(input_tensor, W, strides=[1, strides, strides, 1], padding=padding)
  conv = tf.nn.bias_add(conv, b)
  if activation:
      conv = activation(conv)
  return conv

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) # Batch size of 1, 28x28x3 image
conv1 = conv2d(input_tensor, 32, 3, activation=tf.nn.relu)
conv2 = conv2d(conv1, 64, 3, activation=tf.nn.relu) #Requires correct dimensions based on previous output to be implemented
print(conv2)

```

This example shows how custom functions need to be carefully chained together, requiring the user to keep track of the dimensions of the input and output tensors for subsequent layers.

The equivalent using `tf.keras.layers` and `tf.keras.models.Sequential` is much cleaner and robust:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, ReLU
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)),
    Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation='relu')
])

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) #Batch size of 1, 28x28x3 image
conv_output = model(input_tensor)
print(conv_output)
```

Here, the `Sequential` model structure clearly defines the flow of data through the network. The model handles the dimension calculations automatically, provided the input shape is correctly defined in the first layer. This removes a significant source of error and simplifies the model definition.

In conclusion, the absence of `tf_util.conv2d` signifies TensorFlow's shift toward a more structured and higher-level API. Its functionality is effectively superseded by `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`, which offers a more maintainable and streamlined approach to building convolutional neural networks. This change necessitates adapting to the `keras` API, but it ultimately makes the framework easier to use and ensures a more sustainable development approach.

For those transitioning from older TensorFlow code, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections related to `tf.keras`. The "TensorFlow guide" and the specific "tf.keras" API docs are invaluable. Additionally, the numerous online tutorials covering `tf.keras` provide practical examples that can assist in understanding the modern way of building TensorFlow models. These resources together will provide a comprehensive understanding of building models with this new paradigm, negating the need for functions like `tf_util.conv2d`.
