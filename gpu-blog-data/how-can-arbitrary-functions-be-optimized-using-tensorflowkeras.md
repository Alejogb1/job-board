Optimizing arbitrary functions using TensorFlow/Keras requires a shift from direct gradient-based training, commonly used for neural networks, towards techniques that treat the function as a black box. The core challenge lies in the fact that TensorFlow's automatic differentiation relies on symbolic manipulations of differentiable operations within a computation graph. We don't have access to this when dealing with externally defined or opaque functions. Therefore, we resort to methods like gradient-free optimization or surrogate modeling combined with TensorFlow operations.

My experience working on inverse problem solvers often necessitated optimizing non-differentiable simulation outputs. Direct backpropagation through the solver was computationally prohibitive or simply not possible; therefore, these alternate methods became crucial. The initial step involves defining an objective function representing the function to be minimized or maximized, which accepts inputs and produces a single scalar output – the objective. This objective is the target for our optimization.

Gradient-free optimization algorithms, such as those provided by SciPy or other dedicated optimization libraries, excel in situations where the function's derivative is unavailable. Methods like the Nelder-Mead algorithm or differential evolution explore the input space, guided by the objective's value, to identify minima or maxima. The challenge then becomes translating those insights into a format amenable to TensorFlow. We do this by embedding the gradient-free optimizer’s input parameter updates and evaluations within the TensorFlow computational graph to use the power of Tensor manipulation, data management, and hardware acceleration available in the platform.

The second approach involves creating a surrogate model—typically a differentiable function approximated with a neural network—that learns to predict the output of the original black-box function. This surrogate model, now differentiable by design, enables the use of standard TensorFlow optimizers. Training occurs by sampling the black box function at various input locations, mapping the inputs to their outputs, and using those input/output pairs as a dataset to train the neural network. Once trained, the surrogate model serves as a proxy objective function, allowing efficient gradient-based optimization.

It's important to consider both the computational cost and the accuracy of these different optimization techniques. The gradient-free optimization path is less dependent on the functional form but may be computationally intensive as it requires evaluating the function many times, especially with higher dimensionality of inputs. The surrogate modeling approach reduces evaluation cost after the initial training phase, however, it requires careful model selection and can only be as good as its ability to accurately approximate the black-box function.

Here are three code examples, illustrating these approaches using TensorFlow and Python:

**Example 1: Gradient-Free Optimization with SciPy and TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def arbitrary_function(x):
    # Example black-box function, non-differentiable
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.sin(x) + x**2).numpy()  # Force eval to be a scalar for SciPy

def scipy_objective(x, tf_var):
  tf_var.assign(tf.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=tf.float32))
  return arbitrary_function(tf_var)

def optimize_with_scipy(initial_guess, num_iters=100):
    tf_var = tf.Variable(initial_guess, dtype=tf.float32)
    result = minimize(scipy_objective,
                       initial_guess,
                       args=(tf_var,),
                       method='Nelder-Mead',
                       options={'maxiter': num_iters,
                                'disp': False} )
    return result.x

initial_guess_tf = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32)
optimized_result = optimize_with_scipy(initial_guess_tf.numpy())
print("Optimized Parameters using SciPy:", optimized_result)
```
*Commentary:* This example combines SciPy’s Nelder-Mead optimizer with a TensorFlow variable. The `scipy_objective` function takes the current parameter guess (x) and updates the TensorFlow variable accordingly. The `minimize` function then utilizes the NumPy version of the `arbitrary_function` output. Although the optimization itself is not taking place within TensorFlow’s computational graph, the process is tied to TensorFlow’s variable for the initial starting point and final result.

**Example 2: Surrogate Model Training with a Neural Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def arbitrary_function(x):
    # Example black-box function
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.sin(x) + x**2)

def generate_training_data(num_samples, input_dim):
    inputs = tf.random.uniform((num_samples, input_dim), minval=-5, maxval=5)
    outputs = arbitrary_function(inputs)
    return inputs, outputs

def build_surrogate_model(input_dim):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    return model

def train_surrogate_model(model, inputs, outputs, epochs=100):
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    model.fit(inputs, outputs, epochs=epochs, verbose=0)
    return model

def optimize_surrogate(model, initial_guess):
  x = tf.Variable(initial_guess, dtype=tf.float32)
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
  for _ in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      loss = model(tf.reshape(x,(1,-1)))[0]
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [x])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [x]))

  return x.numpy()

input_dim = 2
num_samples = 1000
inputs, outputs = generate_training_data(num_samples, input_dim)
surrogate_model = build_surrogate_model(input_dim)
trained_model = train_surrogate_model(surrogate_model, inputs, outputs)
initial_guess_tf = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32)
optimized_result = optimize_surrogate(trained_model, initial_guess_tf)

print("Optimized Parameters using Surrogate Model:", optimized_result)
```
*Commentary:* This code demonstrates the surrogate model approach. The `generate_training_data` function creates sample input/output pairs from the `arbitrary_function`. A basic neural network is constructed using Keras and trained on the generated data. Finally, the trained surrogate model’s output is minimized using the standard TensorFlow optimizer. The computational graph is completely inside TensorFlow, enabling hardware acceleration.

**Example 3: Simplified Optimization with Surrogate Model (Direct)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def arbitrary_function(x):
    # Example black-box function, non-differentiable
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.sin(x) + x**2)

def create_surrogate_and_optimize(input_dim, initial_guess, num_samples=1000, epochs=100, num_optimization_steps=100):

  inputs = tf.random.uniform((num_samples, input_dim), minval=-5, maxval=5)
  outputs = arbitrary_function(inputs)

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])

  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  model.fit(inputs, outputs, epochs=epochs, verbose=0)

  x = tf.Variable(initial_guess, dtype=tf.float32)
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

  for _ in range(num_optimization_steps):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      loss = model(tf.reshape(x,(1,-1)))[0]
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [x])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [x]))

  return x.numpy()

input_dim = 2
initial_guess = [1.0, 2.0]
optimized_result = create_surrogate_and_optimize(input_dim, initial_guess)
print("Optimized Parameters using combined method:", optimized_result)
```
*Commentary:* This third example merges surrogate model training and optimization into a single function, showcasing a more concise implementation. The entire optimization is done within a TensorFlow graph and provides a direct result without needing intermediate variables.

These examples provide a practical foundation for optimizing arbitrary functions using TensorFlow/Keras, demonstrating gradient-free methods and surrogate modeling. However, optimal results depend on the specifics of the black-box function and the choice of hyper-parameters.

For resources, I suggest focusing on these general areas:
1. **Scientific computing with Python:** Libraries like SciPy and NumPy provide essential tools for numerical computation and gradient-free optimization algorithms. Books and online tutorials are easily available.
2. **TensorFlow tutorials:** Start with the basic TensorFlow and Keras documentation, especially pertaining to gradients, custom training loops, and data management.
3. **Surrogate modeling literature:** Research material on Gaussian process regression, neural network architectures for regression tasks, and techniques for evaluating surrogate model accuracy.
4. **Optimization Theory and algorithms:** In-depth study of optimization techniques, including gradient-based (first and second-order methods), as well as gradient-free or evolutionary methods. A deeper theoretical understanding enhances the ability to select effective solutions.
These areas provide an effective starting point for mastering the techniques. Experimentation is key to adapting these approaches to the specifics of each optimization problem.
