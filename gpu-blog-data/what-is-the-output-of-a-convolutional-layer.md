A convolutional layer in AlexNet, or any convolutional neural network (CNN), does not output a single value or a simple representation. It produces a three-dimensional volume of feature maps, often described as a tensor, that captures the spatial hierarchies learned from the input data. This output is the result of a series of mathematical operations applied to the input, and this tensor forms the input to subsequent layers in the network.

To elaborate, a convolutional layer applies a series of learnable filters, or kernels, across the input. Each filter slides across the spatial dimensions of the input volume, performing element-wise multiplication and summation with a local region of the input (defined by the filterâ€™s spatial extent). This process, known as convolution, generates a two-dimensional activation map. The mathematical operation performed is a dot product between the filter and the input patch, followed by the addition of a bias term. This process is then repeated with multiple filters, each designed to detect a distinct feature in the input. The set of all activation maps generated by the convolution operation stacks along the depth dimension, creating a three-dimensional volume as the output of the layer.

The depth of this output volume is equal to the number of filters used in the convolutional layer. For example, if a convolutional layer uses 96 filters, its output will have a depth of 96, with each of the 96 feature maps representing the response of a specific filter. Each location within these feature maps signifies the presence, strength, or absence of the corresponding feature at that particular location in the input. The spatial size of the output feature map depends on the size of the input, the size of the filters, the stride (the number of pixels the filter moves between operations), and padding (pixels added around the input).

Let me demonstrate with three simplified examples assuming a grayscale input for clarity:

**Example 1: Basic Convolution with Single Filter**

Imagine an input image represented by a 5x5 matrix, and a single 3x3 filter. Let's further simplify by using a stride of 1 and no padding. This configuration is not common but helpful for illustration.

```python
import numpy as np

# Input Image (5x5)
input_image = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                        [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
                        [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])

# Single 3x3 Filter
filter_kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1],
                          [1, 0, -1],
                          [1, 0, -1]])

# Manual Convolution Operation
output_map = np.zeros((3, 3)) # Output map size is (5-3+1) x (5-3+1) = 3x3
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        output_map[i, j] = np.sum(input_image[i:i+3, j:j+3] * filter_kernel)

print("Input Image:\n", input_image)
print("\nFilter Kernel:\n", filter_kernel)
print("\nOutput Feature Map (Single Filter):\n", output_map)
```

In this example, the 3x3 filter is moved across the input image. The result is a 3x3 output map. If we used another filter, that would produce another 3x3 map. The complete output would be a three-dimensional tensor of (3,3, number_of_filters). This simple example illustrates the spatial reduction due to the filter size and no padding.

**Example 2: Multiple Filters and Depth**

Let's assume the same 5x5 input, but now with two filters of the same size. This will illustrate the notion of depth.

```python
import numpy as np

# Input Image (5x5)
input_image = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                        [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
                        [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])

# Two 3x3 Filters
filter_kernel1 = np.array([[1, 0, -1],
                           [1, 0, -1],
                           [1, 0, -1]])

filter_kernel2 = np.array([[0, 1, 0],
                           [-1, 0, 1],
                           [0, -1, 0]])

# Manual Convolution Operation
output_map1 = np.zeros((3, 3))
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        output_map1[i, j] = np.sum(input_image[i:i+3, j:j+3] * filter_kernel1)


output_map2 = np.zeros((3, 3))
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
      output_map2[i, j] = np.sum(input_image[i:i+3, j:j+3] * filter_kernel2)

# Stack the feature maps
output_volume = np.stack((output_map1, output_map2), axis=-1)

print("Input Image:\n", input_image)
print("\nFilter Kernel 1:\n", filter_kernel1)
print("\nOutput Feature Map 1:\n", output_map1)
print("\nFilter Kernel 2:\n", filter_kernel2)
print("\nOutput Feature Map 2:\n", output_map2)
print("\nOutput Volume (Stacked Feature Maps, Depth = 2):\n", output_volume)
```

The crucial aspect here is the output `output_volume`, a 3x3x2 tensor. The two feature maps, each resulting from a separate filter, are stacked, representing the depth of the volume. This concept is directly extensible to hundreds of filters. This signifies the fundamental output structure of a convolutional layer.

**Example 3: Applying Strides**

Here, let us revisit example one but this time with a stride of two:

```python
import numpy as np

# Input Image (5x5)
input_image = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                        [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
                        [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])

# Single 3x3 Filter
filter_kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1],
                          [1, 0, -1],
                          [1, 0, -1]])

# Manual Convolution Operation with stride 2
output_map = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Output map size is calculated based on stride.
i_output = 0
for i in range(0, 4, 2): # stepping with 2
    j_output = 0
    for j in range(0, 4, 2): # stepping with 2
        output_map[i_output, j_output] = np.sum(input_image[i:i+3, j:j+3] * filter_kernel)
        j_output += 1
    i_output += 1

print("Input Image:\n", input_image)
print("\nFilter Kernel:\n", filter_kernel)
print("\nOutput Feature Map (Single Filter, Stride 2):\n", output_map)
```

In this instance, a stride of 2 resulted in a 2x2 feature map. The spatial dimension decreased because the filter moved by two pixels. This demonstrates the impact of strides on the size of the output feature maps.

In AlexNet, the convolutional layers utilize various filter sizes, strides, and numbers of filters, leading to different output volume dimensions. Each layer transforms the input into more abstract representations, building complex feature hierarchies. For instance, the first convolutional layer in AlexNet outputs a volume with spatial dimensions reduced due to the stride and no padding, and with depth equal to the number of filters used. The subsequent layers further transform this volume, progressively extracting more complex patterns from the input image.

In summary, the output of a convolutional layer is not a single value, but a three-dimensional volume of feature maps, generated through convolution operations involving filters, strides, padding, and the number of filters. These output volumes are the core building blocks of CNNs, representing hierarchical feature representations which propagate through the network. These volumes are also subject to non-linear activation functions, which introduce more sophisticated transformations of the feature maps before being passed on to the next layer.

To further understand the workings of CNNs, I would recommend studying resources that discuss convolution operations in detail. Works focusing on practical implementations of CNNs, such as those in libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, are also extremely valuable. Visualizations of feature maps are also incredibly helpful to build intuition about what a CNN is actually learning. Further resources include textbooks dedicated to deep learning with a strong emphasis on convolutional architectures. These resources delve deeper into the mathematical underpinnings of convolution and discuss the practical considerations for designing convolutional neural networks. Additionally, exploring academic papers which analyze the AlexNet architecture can also provide insights regarding the specific purpose and functionality of each layer within the network.
