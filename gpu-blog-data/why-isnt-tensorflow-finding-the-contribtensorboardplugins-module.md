The absence of `contrib.tensorboard.plugins` in TensorFlow stems from the restructuring undertaken in TensorFlow 2.0.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, involving both custom model deployments and large-scale data processing pipelines, reveals this to be a common pitfall for developers transitioning from older TensorFlow versions.  The `contrib` module, once a repository for experimental and less-stable features, was removed to streamline the core TensorFlow library and improve maintainability.  TensorBoard functionality, previously nested within `contrib`, has now been integrated directly into the TensorFlow ecosystem or moved to separate packages.

**1. Explanation of the Change and Solution:**

Prior to TensorFlow 2.0, extensions and experimental features resided within the `contrib` module.  This led to a somewhat fragmented structure.  The migration to TensorFlow 2.0 involved a significant refactoring effort, focusing on API simplification and performance enhancements.  A key aspect of this refactoring was the removal of the `contrib` module.  Features once housed within this module, including TensorBoard plugins, are now located elsewhere.  To leverage TensorBoard plugins in TensorFlow 2.0 and beyond, one needs to import them directly from their respective packages, and in some cases, install additional packages.  This necessitates a shift in import statements and, potentially, the installation of separate TensorBoard plugin packages via pip.  Simply searching for the old path will result in an `ImportError`.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Import Attempt (Pre-TensorFlow 2.0 Style)**

```python
# This will fail in TensorFlow 2.0 and later
try:
    from tensorflow.contrib.tensorboard.plugins import projector
    # ... code using projector ...
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: {e}") #This will almost certainly execute
```

This code snippet illustrates the obsolete approach.  Attempting to import `projector` (a common plugin) from the `contrib` module will invariably fail in TensorFlow 2.0 and later versions due to the removal of the `contrib` directory.  The `try...except` block is crucial for handling the anticipated `ImportError`.  In a production environment, more robust error handling, perhaps including logging and alternative fallback mechanisms, would be necessary.

**Example 2: Correct Import (TensorBoard Projector Plugin)**

```python
# Correct import for TensorFlow 2.x and later.
try:
    import tensorboard
    from tensorboard.plugins.projector import ProjectorConfig
    #... code using ProjectorConfig ...
except ImportError as e:
  print(f"ImportError: {e} - ensure you've installed 'tensorboard' and potentially the projector plugin separately")
```

This corrected example showcases the appropriate import method.  The `tensorboard` package itself must be installed (`pip install tensorboard`).  Note that some plugins may require separate installations (as stated in the improved `except` block's print statement).  The example directly imports the `ProjectorConfig` class, which is now located within the `tensorboard.plugins.projector` module.  The use of `try...except` is retained for graceful error handling, essential for production-level code.

**Example 3: Handling Plugin Installation via pip (Example with the Profiling Plugin)**

```python
import subprocess
import sys

try:
    import tensorboard
    from tensorboard.plugins.profile import ProfilePlugin
    # ... Code using ProfilePlugin ...
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: {e}. Attempting to install TensorBoard Profiler plugin...")
    try:
        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "tensorboard-plugin-profile"])
        print("TensorBoard Profiler plugin installed successfully. Re-running...")
        import tensorboard #reload
        from tensorboard.plugins.profile import ProfilePlugin
        # ... Code using ProfilePlugin ...
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error installing plugin: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

```
This demonstrates a more advanced technique.  It handles the potential absence of a specific plugin—the Profiler in this instance—by attempting to install it using `pip` within the Python script itself.  The use of `subprocess.check_call` ensures that the installation attempt is properly monitored and any errors are raised, improving robustness. Note the re-import after successful installation. The `sys.exit(1)` provides a clean exit code, signaling a failure to the operating system.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

1. **TensorFlow official documentation:**  The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive and up-to-date information regarding the API, including TensorBoard usage.
2. **TensorBoard documentation:** This dedicated documentation offers details on specific TensorBoard plugins and their usage.
3. **TensorFlow tutorials and examples:**  Exploring the provided tutorials and examples can offer practical insight into integrating TensorBoard plugins into your projects.  Pay close attention to the examples demonstrating TensorFlow 2.x usage.


Through my years of experience, I've learned that carefully examining the error messages provided by the interpreter is crucial.  The exact wording of the `ImportError` often indicates the precise package that is missing.  Combining this with a thorough understanding of the TensorFlow 2.0 restructuring—the removal of `contrib` being a critical aspect—allows for efficient resolution of such import issues.  Thorough testing and robust error handling, as demonstrated in the code examples, are paramount for creating reliable and maintainable TensorFlow applications.  Finally, consulting the official documentation remains the best approach for navigating the evolving TensorFlow ecosystem and its associated tools like TensorBoard.
