The core challenge in combining PyTorch models, specifically regarding dataset input, lies in ensuring consistent data formatting and efficient data pipelining across the different model components.  My experience building complex natural language processing systems has highlighted the criticality of this aspect;  improper data handling consistently led to performance bottlenecks and subtle, hard-to-debug errors.  The solution necessitates a clear understanding of your models' input requirements and the application of PyTorch's data loading capabilities.

**1.  Understanding Model Input Requirements:**

Before diving into data input strategies, it's crucial to meticulously examine the input expectations of each individual model within your ensemble. This involves more than just looking at the input shape; consider data types (e.g., floating-point precision), normalization schemes, and any specific preprocessing steps each model necessitates.  Inconsistencies here are a major source of errors.  For instance, one model might expect normalized word embeddings while another requires raw token IDs.  Failing to address these differences directly will lead to unexpected behaviour, often manifesting as inexplicable performance drops or runtime exceptions. Documenting these requirements is paramount, especially when dealing with multiple models or collaborating on a project.

**2.  Data Pipelining with PyTorch's `DataLoader`:**

PyTorch's `DataLoader` class is the cornerstone of efficient data handling, particularly when working with multiple models.  It allows for batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading, significantly boosting training speed and mitigating memory issues.  The key lies in structuring your data to be compatible with the `DataLoader`'s requirements.  This typically involves creating a custom dataset class that inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and implementing `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods.  These methods define how the dataset is accessed and the format of the data returned.  The `DataLoader` then utilizes this information to efficiently feed data to your models.

**3.  Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple concatenation of model outputs.**

This example assumes two models, `model_a` and `model_b`, which process the same input data but produce different representations. We concatenate their outputs before feeding them to a final layer.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = torch.randn(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features

dataset = MyDataset(data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)

# Dummy models (replace with your actual models)
model_a = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)
model_b = torch.nn.Linear(10, 7)
final_layer = torch.nn.Linear(12, 1) # 5 + 7 features from previous models


for batch in dataloader:
    output_a = model_a(batch)
    output_b = model_b(batch)
    combined_output = torch.cat((output_a, output_b), dim=1)
    final_output = final_layer(combined_output)
    # Process final_output
```

This demonstrates a straightforward approach where outputs are concatenated.  Note the careful consideration of the `dim` parameter in `torch.cat` to ensure correct tensor dimensions.  The crucial element here is using the `DataLoader` to efficiently iterate through the data.

**Example 2: Sequential model application with intermediate data transformation.**

This example shows a scenario where the output of one model becomes the input for another, requiring a data transformation step in between.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

# ... (MyDataset definition from Example 1) ...

# Dummy models (replace with your actual models)
model_a = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)
model_b = torch.nn.Linear(5, 2) # model_b expects 5 input features


dataset = MyDataset(data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)


for batch in dataloader:
    output_a = model_a(batch)
    # Intermediate transformation (e.g., applying activation function)
    transformed_output = torch.sigmoid(output_a)
    output_b = model_b(transformed_output)
    # Process output_b
```

Here, the output of `model_a` undergoes a sigmoid transformation before being fed to `model_b`. This illustrates the flexibility in incorporating data manipulation within the pipeline.  The choice of transformation depends entirely on the specific needs of the combined models.


**Example 3: Handling different data modalities with a custom collate function.**

This scenario addresses situations where your combined models accept different data types (e.g., text and images).

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MultiModalDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, text_data, image_data):
        self.text_data = text_data
        self.image_data = image_data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.text_data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.text_data[idx], self.image_data[idx]

def collate_fn(batch):
    text_batch = [item[0] for item in batch]
    image_batch = [item[1] for item in batch]
    # Process and return the batched data
    return torch.stack(text_batch), torch.stack(image_batch)

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
text_data = torch.randn(100, 10)
image_data = torch.randn(100, 3, 224, 224)

dataset = MultiModalDataset(text_data, image_data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, collate_fn=collate_fn)

#Dummy models
text_model = torch.nn.Linear(10,5)
image_model = torch.nn.Linear(3*224*224,5)


for text_batch, image_batch in dataloader:
    text_output = text_model(text_batch)
    image_output = image_model(image_batch.view(image_batch.size(0),-1))
    #Combine outputs

```

This employs a custom `collate_fn` to handle different data types within a batch. This function ensures that data is appropriately prepared before being passed to the models.  The use of a `collate_fn` is essential for handling complex data structures efficiently.


**4.  Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `DataLoader` and custom datasets, are invaluable.  Thoroughly understanding tensor manipulation and PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities is crucial.  Explore resources on advanced PyTorch techniques for handling large datasets and optimizing training pipelines. Consider consulting texts focused on deep learning architectures and ensemble methods for broader context.  The application of data augmentation and validation strategies should also be carefully studied.
