In my experience debugging neural networks, I've frequently encountered a situation where gradients across different parameters or even different layers end up with the same numerical value, or very close values. This phenomenon, often observed during initial training stages or with specific network configurations, primarily arises from the way backpropagation computes gradients, coupled with particular choices in weight initialization and activation functions. The core issue isn't a flaw in the backpropagation algorithm itself, but rather a consequence of the mathematical operations involved and the state of the network at that given moment.

The backpropagation algorithm calculates gradients using the chain rule. Essentially, the gradient of the loss function with respect to a particular parameter is derived by sequentially multiplying local gradients from each layer back to the parameter in question.  Consider a simplified scenario: a single neuron with weights `w`, input `x`, a bias `b`, an activation function `σ`, and output `y`. The neuron's output is `y = σ(w*x + b)`.  During backpropagation, the gradient of the loss `L` with respect to the weight `w`, denoted as `∂L/∂w`, will be `∂L/∂y * ∂y/∂(w*x+b) * ∂(w*x+b)/∂w`.

The term `∂L/∂y` is the loss derivative with respect to the neuron's output. `∂y/∂(w*x+b)` is the derivative of the activation function, and `∂(w*x+b)/∂w` is simply `x`. Crucially, if the weights are initialized randomly and all activations result in similar output values, these derivative terms, particularly `∂L/∂y` and `∂y/∂(w*x+b)`, can become approximately equal for many parameters across the network. Further, if the inputs `x` are also distributed such that they have a similar magnitude, the resulting gradients will also be similar. This effect is most pronounced in the early stages of training when weights are small and activations aren't well-differentiated.

Another contributing factor is the use of specific activation functions. For instance, the sigmoid activation, with its limited derivative range (0 to 0.25), can often result in vanishing gradients during early training.  If the neuron's weighted sum `w*x + b` is frequently large (positive or negative), the sigmoid will be saturated, and its derivative will be close to zero. When this low derivative is multiplied through the backpropagation chain, it can effectively nullify the gradient, leading to similar, negligible values. Similarly, ReLU activations, if many neurons are not active due to negative weighted sums, will output zero. This means the derivatives through these neurons will also be zero, leading to a common zero gradient.

Here are examples illustrating different aspects of this behavior:

**Example 1: Identical Gradients in a Simple Network**

This example demonstrates how random weight initialization and identical activations can lead to uniform gradients early in the process.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))

# Initialize weights and biases with random values
w1 = np.random.randn(2, 3) # Layer 1
b1 = np.random.randn(3)
w2 = np.random.randn(3, 1) # Layer 2
b2 = np.random.randn(1)

# Input
x = np.array([0.5, 0.7])

# Forward pass
z1 = np.dot(x, w1) + b1
a1 = sigmoid(z1)
z2 = np.dot(a1, w2) + b2
y_hat = sigmoid(z2)

# Loss (example - Mean Squared Error for simplicity)
y_true = np.array([1])
loss = 0.5 * (y_hat - y_true)**2

# Backpropagation

# Layer 2
d_loss_dyhat = (y_hat - y_true)
d_yhat_dz2 = sigmoid_derivative(z2)
d_z2_dw2 = a1
d_z2_da1 = w2
d_loss_dw2 = d_loss_dyhat * d_yhat_dz2 * d_z2_dw2

# Layer 1
d_a1_dz1 = sigmoid_derivative(z1)
d_z1_dw1 = x
d_loss_da1 = d_loss_dyhat * d_yhat_dz2 * d_z2_da1
d_loss_dw1 = np.outer(x, d_loss_da1 * d_a1_dz1)

print("Gradients for w1 (Layer 1):", d_loss_dw1)
print("Gradients for w2 (Layer 2):", d_loss_dw2)

```

In this simplified two-layer network, notice that if `a1` outputs similar values for all three hidden units, the derivative terms at the output layer ( `d_loss_dyhat` and `d_yhat_dz2`) will also have similar magnitudes. Moreover, as the same `a1` is used for computing `d_loss_dw2`, the elements of `d_loss_dw2` will also tend to have similar magnitudes. Further, with random initialization of `w1` and `w2`, the derivatives in the first layer will also be similar, as shown by the output. Running this example multiple times will likely generate gradients with values in close proximity of each other.

**Example 2: ReLU Saturation and Zero Gradients**

This example shows how the behavior of ReLU can result in many zero gradients, which is the common value.

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def relu_derivative(x):
    return np.where(x > 0, 1, 0)

# Initialize weights and biases
w1 = np.random.randn(2, 3)
b1 = np.random.randn(3)
w2 = np.random.randn(3, 1)
b2 = np.random.randn(1)

# Input
x = np.array([0.5, -0.7])

# Forward pass
z1 = np.dot(x, w1) + b1
a1 = relu(z1)
z2 = np.dot(a1, w2) + b2
y_hat = z2

# Loss (example - Mean Squared Error for simplicity)
y_true = np.array([1])
loss = 0.5 * (y_hat - y_true)**2


# Backpropagation
d_loss_dyhat = y_hat - y_true
d_yhat_dz2 = 1
d_z2_dw2 = a1
d_z2_da1 = w2
d_loss_dw2 = d_loss_dyhat * d_yhat_dz2 * d_z2_dw2

# Layer 1
d_a1_dz1 = relu_derivative(z1)
d_z1_dw1 = x
d_loss_da1 = d_loss_dyhat * d_yhat_dz2 * d_z2_da1
d_loss_dw1 = np.outer(x, d_loss_da1 * d_a1_dz1)



print("Gradients for w1 (Layer 1):", d_loss_dw1)
print("Gradients for w2 (Layer 2):", d_loss_dw2)
```

Here, if certain elements of `z1` are negative, then the `relu` activation will output zero, and the derivative is also zero. This causes the term `d_loss_da1 * d_a1_dz1` to be zero in places, causing the gradients in `d_loss_dw1` to also be zero. This clearly highlights the potential for homogeneous gradients when using ReLU.

**Example 3:  Initialization Effects**

This example shows how small values for weight can lead to small and similar gradients.  This example uses sigmoid.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))


# Initialize weights and biases with very small random values
w1 = np.random.randn(2, 3) * 0.01
b1 = np.random.randn(3) * 0.01
w2 = np.random.randn(3, 1) * 0.01
b2 = np.random.randn(1) * 0.01


# Input
x = np.array([0.5, 0.7])


# Forward pass
z1 = np.dot(x, w1) + b1
a1 = sigmoid(z1)
z2 = np.dot(a1, w2) + b2
y_hat = sigmoid(z2)

# Loss (example - Mean Squared Error for simplicity)
y_true = np.array([1])
loss = 0.5 * (y_hat - y_true)**2


# Backpropagation

# Layer 2
d_loss_dyhat = (y_hat - y_true)
d_yhat_dz2 = sigmoid_derivative(z2)
d_z2_dw2 = a1
d_z2_da1 = w2
d_loss_dw2 = d_loss_dyhat * d_yhat_dz2 * d_z2_dw2

# Layer 1
d_a1_dz1 = sigmoid_derivative(z1)
d_z1_dw1 = x
d_loss_da1 = d_loss_dyhat * d_yhat_dz2 * d_z2_da1
d_loss_dw1 = np.outer(x, d_loss_da1 * d_a1_dz1)

print("Gradients for w1 (Layer 1):", d_loss_dw1)
print("Gradients for w2 (Layer 2):", d_loss_dw2)
```

In this case, with very small weights, the weighted sums (`z1` and `z2`) before activation will also be small, which pushes the sigmoid function close to its linear range. With the sigmoid derivative being closer to 0.25 in all cases, the gradients end up with small values. This is not ideal since the gradients will not be able to update the weights correctly, leading to slow training, or no improvement at all.

To mitigate these issues, several techniques can be employed. Proper weight initialization methods, such as Xavier/Glorot or He initialization, are crucial. These methods ensure that the weights are not too small (as in Example 3) and do not cause exploding or vanishing gradients. Using activation functions with non-zero derivative for a wider range of inputs, like Leaky ReLU, can help with problems seen in Example 2. Additionally, employing batch normalization, which normalizes activations in layers, can stabilize gradients. Finally, using regularization techniques can help to distribute the gradient more evenly during optimization.

For resources, I would recommend the original papers detailing different weight initialization schemes and batch normalization. The concepts around backpropagation are core to deep learning.  Various introductory texts to deep learning are also helpful in solidifying these concepts.  Exploring a good library's implementation, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, is also beneficial. Understanding the underlying mechanics is key to effective neural network design and optimization.
