The core issue with repeated retracing of `tf.function` calls stems from the dynamic nature of Python and the way TensorFlow's graph compilation interacts with it.  My experience debugging similar performance bottlenecks in large-scale TensorFlow models points to inconsistencies in input shapes or data types provided to the `tf.function` as the most common culprit.  TensorFlow's eager execution mode allows for flexible code execution, but when a `tf.function` is called, TensorFlow attempts to construct a static computation graph.  If the input characteristics change between calls, TensorFlow must rebuild this graph, leading to retracing â€“ and a significant performance penalty.

**1. Explanation:**

`tf.function` transforms a Python function into a TensorFlow graph. This graph represents a sequence of operations that can be optimized and executed efficiently on hardware accelerators like GPUs.  However, this optimization requires TensorFlow to know the shapes and types of all inputs beforehand.  If the shape or type of any tensor argument varies between function calls, TensorFlow cannot reuse the previously compiled graph.  Instead, it must re-trace the function, creating a new graph for the new input characteristics.  Eleven consecutive retracings strongly suggest a pattern of inconsistent input to your `tf.function`.

This inconsistency can manifest in several ways:

* **Variable-Sized Inputs:** If your function accepts lists, tuples, or tensors whose lengths or dimensions are not constant across calls, each call will trigger a retrace.
* **Dynamic Data Types:**  Passing inputs with varying data types (e.g., sometimes `tf.int32`, sometimes `tf.float32`) will lead to recompilation.
* **Unhashable Inputs:**  If you're using objects as inputs that don't support proper hashing (e.g., custom classes without `__hash__` defined correctly), TensorFlow will not be able to effectively cache compiled graphs.  Two seemingly identical inputs might lead to a retrace if they don't hash to the same value.
* **External State Dependency:** The function's behavior depends on variables or objects that are modified outside the function's scope between consecutive calls. This makes the function's graph dynamic.
* **Control Flow Variations:**  Conditional statements (e.g., `if` statements) within the `tf.function` whose branches are executed differently on each call. This dynamic nature can force retracing.


Identifying the exact source requires careful analysis of your code and input data.  Let's examine some typical scenarios and how to address them.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Variable-Sized Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def process_data(data):
  return tf.reduce_sum(data)

# Retracing occurs because 'data' has different shapes
process_data(tf.constant([1, 2, 3]))
process_data(tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
process_data(tf.constant([1,2]))
```

* **Problem:** The `process_data` function receives tensors of varying lengths. Each length necessitates a new graph compilation.
* **Solution:** Ensure consistent input shape using padding or dynamic shaping techniques.  If the varying size is intrinsic to the data, consider alternative approaches like ragged tensors or dynamic shapes within the `tf.function`.


**Example 2:  Dynamic Data Type**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def mixed_type_op(x, y):
  return x + y

# Retracing occurs due to changing data types of x
mixed_type_op(tf.constant(1, dtype=tf.int32), tf.constant(2.0))
mixed_type_op(tf.constant(1.0), tf.constant(2.0))
mixed_type_op(tf.constant(1, dtype=tf.int64), tf.constant(2.0))

```

* **Problem:**  The data type of `x` changes across calls, causing retracing.
* **Solution:** Explicitly define the data types of inputs either through type hints or by casting inputs to a consistent data type before calling `tf.function`.


**Example 3:  Unhashable Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyData:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

@tf.function
def use_custom_class(data):
    return data.value * 2

data1 = MyData(10)
data2 = MyData(10) #  Even though values are same, they are different objects

use_custom_class(data1)
use_custom_class(data2) # Retrace due to different object instances
```

* **Problem:** The `MyData` class, without a properly defined `__hash__` method, leads to different hash values for `data1` and `data2` even though their `value` attribute is the same.
* **Solution:**  Implement a `__hash__` method in the `MyData` class, ensuring that objects with equal `value` attributes also have the same hash value.  Alternatively, use immutable data structures (tuples) as inputs if applicable.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further diagnose the problem, I recommend carefully reviewing the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.function` and its behavior.  Pay close attention to sections on function tracing and graph construction.  Using a TensorFlow profiler can pinpoint performance bottlenecks.  Debugging tools within your IDE can assist in examining the types and shapes of variables at runtime.  Examining the TensorFlow logs for warnings related to retracing can be valuable. Finally, a thorough understanding of Python's object model and mutability can aid in identifying sources of dynamic behavior within your function.
