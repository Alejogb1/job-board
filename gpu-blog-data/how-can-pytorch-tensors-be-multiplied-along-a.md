PyTorch's tensor multiplication capabilities extend beyond standard element-wise and matrix multiplication.  Creating a new dimension for multiplication is crucial for various tasks, particularly in handling batched operations or incorporating higher-order interactions in deep learning models.  My experience optimizing recurrent neural networks highlighted the need for efficient strategies in this area;  specifically, achieving this without resorting to explicit looping significantly improved performance.

**1.  Understanding the Problem and Solution Space**

The core challenge lies in manipulating tensor shapes effectively.  Standard multiplication operators (`*`, `@`) operate on existing dimensions.  To multiply along a new dimension, we need to leverage broadcasting or reshaping techniques to align the tensors for multiplication along the desired axis.  The choice between broadcasting and reshaping depends on the specific dimensions of your tensors and the desired outcome.

Broadcasting allows for implicit expansion of tensor dimensions, provided the dimensions are compatible. Reshaping offers greater control over dimension rearrangement before multiplication.  Furthermore, understanding the distinction between element-wise and matrix multiplication is critical.  Element-wise multiplication operates on corresponding elements across tensors of identical shape, while matrix multiplication requires specific alignment of dimensions adhering to the rules of linear algebra.

**2.  Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Broadcasting for Multiplication Along a New Dimension**

```python
import torch

# Input tensors
tensor_A = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor_B = torch.randn(5)

# Broadcasting tensor_B to a shape compatible for multiplication along a new dimension in tensor_A
tensor_B_expanded = tensor_B.reshape(1, 1, 5)  # Reshape to (1, 1, 5) for broadcasting

# Multiplication along a new dimension (axis=2).
result = tensor_A.unsqueeze(2) * tensor_B_expanded # Unsqueeze adds new dim before broadcasting

print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([3, 4, 5])
print(result)
```

This example demonstrates how broadcasting facilitates multiplication along a new dimension.  `tensor_B` is initially reshaped to a 3D tensor, which can then be broadcast implicitly to align with the 3D tensor created by `unsqueeze` applied to `tensor_A`.  The resulting `result` tensor has a shape (3, 4, 5) where the dimension of size 5 was effectively added as a result of the multiplication.  The unsqueeze function adds a singleton dimension (size 1) along axis 2 making the tensors compatible for broadcasting, and elementwise multiplication creates the new dimension.

**Example 2: Reshaping for Matrix Multiplication Along a New Dimension**

```python
import torch

# Input tensors
tensor_A = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor_B = torch.randn(5, 4)

# Reshaping tensors to enable matrix multiplication along a new dimension
tensor_A_reshaped = tensor_A.reshape(3, 1, 4)
result = torch.bmm(tensor_A_reshaped, tensor_B.transpose(0,1)) #batch matrix multiply


print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([3, 5, 4])
print(result)
```

Here, reshaping is used to enable matrix multiplication (`torch.bmm`)  along a newly added dimension.  `tensor_A` is reshaped to (3, 1, 4), creating a batch dimension of size 1. `tensor_B` is transposed to allow for proper matrix multiplication.   `torch.bmm` performs a batch matrix multiplication, resulting in a tensor with shape (3, 5, 4).  The new dimension (size 5) is introduced through matrix multiplication. Note that `torch.bmm` expects the batch dimension to be the leading one and assumes the matrices to be multiplied to be the last two dimensions.

**Example 3:  Combining Broadcasting and Reshaping for Complex Scenarios**

```python
import torch

tensor_A = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
tensor_B = torch.randn(5, 4, 6)

# Reshape tensor_A to enable broadcasting then multiplication along a new dimension
tensor_A_reshaped = tensor_A.reshape(2, 3, 1, 4)

# Broadcasting tensor_B and then performing element wise multiplication
result = tensor_A_reshaped * tensor_B.unsqueeze(1)

print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([2, 3, 5, 4, 6])
print(result)

```

This demonstrates a more complex scenario requiring a combination of reshaping and broadcasting. `tensor_A` is reshaped to (2, 3, 1, 4) to align with `tensor_B` for broadcasting along a new dimension. The `unsqueeze` operation adds a singleton dimension to align the shapes for element wise multiplication which effectively performs multiplication across the new dimension introduced by the broadcasting operation.  The resulting tensor has dimensions reflecting the combination of all input dimensions, along with the added dimension resulting from the multiplication operation.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch tensor manipulation, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation. Thoroughly reviewing the sections on tensor operations, broadcasting, and reshaping is essential.  Exploring advanced topics such as automatic differentiation and tensor manipulation through various backends would also be beneficial.  Additionally, working through tutorials and examples focused on building neural networks with PyTorch will provide invaluable practical experience in applying these techniques.  Finally,  familiarity with linear algebra concepts is crucial to comprehending the underlying mathematical operations.
