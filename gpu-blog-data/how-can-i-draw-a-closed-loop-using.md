Closing a loop with `mark_line` in Altair presents a common challenge: lines inherently connect successive data points, but to complete a closed shape, the first and last points often need to be identical, leading to repetition. This can be avoided through strategic data manipulation and understanding Altair's encodings. I've encountered this while visualizing sensor data where a cyclical trajectory needed to be represented without the redundant endpoint.

Fundamentally, the core issue stems from how `mark_line` interprets its input. It draws a line segment between each successive data point provided in the dataset. To create a closed shape – a polygon rather than a broken line – we must ensure that the last data point seamlessly connects to the first. Simply duplicating the initial point is the naive approach, but we can achieve the desired effect by instead leveraging Altair's encoding mechanisms to dynamically calculate and add the closing segment.

Let’s consider a typical case: visualizing a shape described by a list of x and y coordinates, perhaps resulting from some calculation. Rather than manually appending the first point, we can construct our data in a manner that facilitates a smooth loop closure. The key is to add a layer with an additional point implied by the transformation of the original data.

Here's my first code example, illustrating a naive approach and its result:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 3, 2, 1],
    'y': [1, 2, 4, 1]
})

chart_naive = alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
).properties(
    title='Naive Approach - Unclosed Shape'
)

chart_naive
```

This code produces a chart with a line connecting (1,1) to (3,2) to (2,4) to (1,1). However, it does not render as a truly closed shape; the end point simply is placed above the first point. The polygon we expect is not drawn as it is not the intended behavior of `mark_line` itself. It renders a line of successive data point and is working exactly as intended, so let's look at how we can change that.

To create a closed shape without repeating data points, we leverage the `transform_window` and `transform_fold` features within Altair. I often find it crucial to understand the difference between *data shaping* and *visual encoding*. Rather than merely encoding existing data, we must transform the data to represent the desired shape.

Here's my second example demonstrating a more effective solution:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 3, 2],
    'y': [1, 2, 4]
})

chart_closed = alt.Chart(data).transform_window(
        index='count()',
        groupby=[]
    ).transform_fold(
        ['x', 'y'],
        as_ = ['coord_type', 'value']
    ).transform_window(
        first_value='first(value)',
        groupby=['coord_type']
    ).transform_filter(
        alt.datum.index == 1
    ).transform_calculate(
        end_value='if(datum.coord_type == "x", datum.first_value, datum.first_value )'
    ).transform_aggregate(
        end_x='first(end_value)',
        end_y='first(end_value)',
        groupby=[]
    ).transform_joinaggregate(
        max_index='max(index)',
    ).transform_calculate(
        x='if(datum.coord_type == "x", datum.value, datum.end_x )',
        y='if(datum.coord_type == "y", datum.value, datum.end_y )',
        is_end_point='if(datum.index > datum.max_index, true, false)'
    ).mark_line(
        clip = True
    ).encode(
        x='x:Q',
        y='y:Q',
        opacity = alt.condition(alt.datum.is_end_point == False, alt.value(1), alt.value(0))
    ).properties(
        title='Closed Shape Using Transformations'
    )
chart_closed
```

This example, while seemingly complex, breaks down into logical steps. First, I transform the x and y coordinates into a series of coordinate-value pairs using `transform_fold`. Then, I calculate the `first` value for each x and y coordinate. Then I filter out any coordinate of length 1. We create an `end_value` by calculating the original `first` values. Then, aggregate the value to create the new end points, which are the first points we started with. Finally, we compute the value of the coordinate, and whether it should be seen or not by checking its index. We then use an opacity encoding to hide the extra lines we've created for the end caps, rendering only the proper polygon. This is superior to manually appending the first point because we are instead dynamically creating the closing segment which can be useful for more complex operations. It also means we can change data and it will simply work without adjusting the input coordinates.

The core concept here is not *appending* a data point but *creating* a closing segment using transformed data. It is important to note that the `clip=True` argument is essential here to ensure the correct rendering. We are making use of the transform operators to create additional points that we then hide with opacity.

As an extension, let’s examine a slightly more complex scenario involving a circular path where the initial coordinate is implicitly determined from the parameters. This requires a calculation. This is again often the type of data I typically encounter in my work with sensor data.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

num_points = 20
angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, num_points, endpoint=False)
radius = 5

data_circular = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': radius * np.cos(angles),
    'y': radius * np.sin(angles)
})


chart_circular = alt.Chart(data_circular).transform_window(
        index='count()',
        groupby=[]
    ).transform_fold(
        ['x', 'y'],
        as_ = ['coord_type', 'value']
    ).transform_window(
        first_value='first(value)',
        groupby=['coord_type']
    ).transform_filter(
        alt.datum.index == 1
    ).transform_calculate(
        end_value='if(datum.coord_type == "x", datum.first_value, datum.first_value )'
    ).transform_aggregate(
        end_x='first(end_value)',
        end_y='first(end_value)',
        groupby=[]
    ).transform_joinaggregate(
        max_index='max(index)',
    ).transform_calculate(
        x='if(datum.coord_type == "x", datum.value, datum.end_x )',
        y='if(datum.coord_type == "y", datum.value, datum.end_y )',
        is_end_point='if(datum.index > datum.max_index, true, false)'
    ).mark_line(
        clip=True
    ).encode(
        x='x:Q',
        y='y:Q',
        opacity = alt.condition(alt.datum.is_end_point == False, alt.value(1), alt.value(0))
    ).properties(
        title='Closed Circle with Calculated Data'
    )

chart_circular
```

Here, we begin by calculating x and y coordinates based on a radius and a series of angles. As before, we must close the loop using the same pattern as before. The code calculates the coordinates for a circle and correctly renders it as a closed shape. Again, the `clip` property is essential here. The transform operations are critical. The ability to derive a new series of data points to close the shape means we do not have to worry about any manual additions, which I have found to be beneficial when developing more complex and dynamic data visualization.

In summary, avoiding data point repetition when using `mark_line` for closed shapes in Altair hinges on strategically employing data transformations. The core approach consists of dynamically generating the final closing segment using `transform_window`, `transform_fold`, and related operators. This method is flexible and maintains the integrity of the underlying data without manual duplication.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing documentation on Vega-Lite's transform functions, as these are the foundation of Altair's transformations. Experimenting with different transformations beyond `transform_window` and `transform_fold`, such as `transform_aggregate` or `transform_calculate`, can broaden one's capability to handle various data shaping challenges. Studying examples that focus on coordinate transformation and manipulation can also prove informative. Finally, consulting examples in the Altair documentation that use transforms will aid in better understanding how it all works.
