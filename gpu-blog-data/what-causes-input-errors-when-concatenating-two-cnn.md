The most common cause of input errors when concatenating two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branches stems from mismatched feature map dimensions at the point of concatenation. Specifically, the height, width, and crucially, the depth (number of channels) of the output feature maps from each branch must be identical for a successful concatenation operation. I’ve debugged this exact issue countless times during development, often encountering it when experimenting with architectural variations.

The root of the problem lies in the way CNNs process input. Each convolutional layer applies filters that reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) and potentially alter the depth (number of channels). Operations like pooling and strided convolutions contribute to this reduction. If two branches within the network are configured with different convolution parameters, strides, padding, or number of filters, their resulting feature maps will inherently differ in shape. Concatenation, unlike other merging operations like addition, requires strict dimensional compatibility.

A frequent scenario I've encountered is diverging kernel sizes. One branch might utilize smaller kernels focused on detailed feature extraction while the other utilizes larger kernels for a wider receptive field. Although this is architecturally sound and a common technique, it necessarily alters feature map shapes. Consider the case of two branches, each beginning with an identical input, but undergoing distinct processing. The first uses two convolutional layers of stride 1 and 32 output channels, preserving spatial dimension while increasing depth. The second uses one strided convolutional layer with stride 2 and 64 output channels, reducing spatial dimension while increasing depth. When concatenating, the resulting dimensions will likely not match. In this instance, we have a mismatch of both spatial and channel dimensions. Attempting to concatenate these feature maps will produce a mismatch error, preventing the gradient from flowing through the combined path.

Another prevalent issue arises when different pooling mechanisms are utilized in separate branches. For instance, one branch may employ max pooling for dimension reduction, while the other employs average pooling or no pooling at all. This choice directly impacts the output size of the feature maps, creating a conflict during the concatenation attempt. It’s a situation that I've frequently seen when implementing networks combining different receptive field sizes and needing to combine the extracted features.

Further contributing to the problem is the use of variations in padding. Padding, particularly "same" padding, is often employed to maintain input and output dimensions, but even slight differences in its implementation within different branches can lead to feature maps of incompatible sizes. For instance, different padding settings combined with varied strides cause a misalignment. Although the user expects same shape, the mathematical result will lead to different shape when the strides are not carefully selected in conjunction with different padding schemes.

To illustrate, here are three code examples using TensorFlow, highlighting common error scenarios and the correct approach:

**Example 1: Mismatched spatial dimensions due to stride**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input shape (batch, height, width, channels)
input_shape = (None, 64, 64, 3)
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:])

# Branch 1: No strided convolution
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')(input_tensor)
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')(branch1)

# Branch 2: Strided convolution
branch2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), strides=2, padding='same')(input_tensor)
branch2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same')(branch2)


#Attempting to concatenate will lead to an error because the output feature maps from branch 1 and branch 2 differ in spatial dimensions
try:
    concatenated = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=concatenated)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, the second branch uses a strided convolution (stride=2), which reduces the spatial dimensions of the output. Consequently, the concatenation throws a ValueError because spatial dimensions of the two outputs do not match. The 'same' padding in the second conv layer does not ensure spatial dimensions are identical at concatenation since the first convolutional layer in branch 2 contains strides, thus shrinking the spatial dimension.

**Example 2: Mismatched channel dimensions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input shape (batch, height, width, channels)
input_shape = (None, 64, 64, 3)
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:])

# Branch 1: 32 output channels
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')(input_tensor)
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')(branch1)

# Branch 2: 64 output channels
branch2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same')(input_tensor)
branch2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same')(branch2)

# Attempting to concatenate will lead to an error because the output feature maps from branch 1 and branch 2 differ in the channel dimensions
try:
    concatenated = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=concatenated)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here, the issue lies in the number of output channels. While both branches utilize the same spatial transformations, they differ in their channel outputs which leads to an error upon concatenation. This situation frequently occurs in networks where multi-scale feature aggregation is needed, requiring careful planning of channel depth per branch.

**Example 3: Correct concatenation using consistent output shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input shape (batch, height, width, channels)
input_shape = (None, 64, 64, 3)
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:])

# Branch 1: Explicit strides and channels to match branch 2
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), strides=2, padding='same')(input_tensor)
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same')(branch1)

# Branch 2: Strided convolution and channel size to match branch 1
branch2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), strides=2, padding='same')(input_tensor)
branch2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same')(branch2)


concatenated = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=concatenated)
print("Model built successfully")
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates how to correctly concatenate outputs by ensuring that all intermediate operations result in matching feature map dimensions in terms of both spatial shape and depth. In this case, both branches use the same strides and the same number of channels per convolutional layer which results in compatible output shapes.

Regarding resources for further study, exploring textbooks on deep learning that detail CNN architecture would be a significant help.  Specifically, chapters that cover operations such as convolution, pooling and their impact on feature map size. Secondly, examining the official documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch, especially the API documentation for the convolution layers and concatenation functions. Finally, a thorough review of relevant papers describing popular architectures, such as ResNet or Inception, provides practical examples of how concatenations are implemented without errors. I have consistently found that gaining mastery in these three domains will greatly help in the correct design of multi-branch architectures.
