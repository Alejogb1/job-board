The failure of JAWS to announce `aria-expanded` state changes often stems from a mismatch between the ARIA attribute's implementation and the underlying DOM structure, specifically regarding the relationship between the element possessing `aria-expanded` and its controlled content.  In my years debugging accessibility issues, I've encountered this problem numerous times, frequently stemming from improper nesting or a lack of explicit role assignments on the controlled element.  The screen reader needs a clear, unambiguous association to understand the relationship and accurately report the state change.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`aria-expanded` is designed to communicate the expanded/collapsed state of a widget, typically a disclosure element like an accordion panel or a collapsible menu.  JAWS, and other screen readers, rely on this attribute in conjunction with other ARIA roles and attributes to determine the context and provide appropriate feedback.  If the `aria-expanded` attribute is present but the structure isn't semantically correct, or if the screen reader can't infer the relationship between the triggering element and the expanded content, then the state change won't be announced.

Several common pitfalls lead to this issue:

* **Missing or Incorrect Roles:** The element with `aria-expanded` should have a corresponding role that indicates its interactive nature.  Commonly used roles include `button`, `tab`, `heading` (if the expandable section is part of a heading hierarchy), or `gridcell` (for expandable table rows).  Without a clear role, the screen reader struggles to understand the element's purpose and the significance of the `aria-expanded` attribute.

* **Improper Nesting:** The content controlled by the expandable element must be properly nested and clearly associated. This often involves using a container element to encapsulate the content. The lack of a clear parent-child relationship between the element with `aria-expanded` and the content it controls confuses the screen reader's parsing of the DOM.

* **Lack of Live Regions:** For dynamic updates, using a live region (via `aria-live` attribute) on the controlled content can improve the announcement reliability. While not strictly required for simple expansions, it's beneficial, particularly in more complex scenarios with asynchronous updates.

* **JavaScript Conflicts:** Conflicting JavaScript frameworks or poorly written JavaScript can interfere with the accessibility tree that screen readers use. This could lead to the state change not being properly reflected in the accessibility tree, causing JAWS to ignore or misinterpret the `aria-expanded` change.  This is less common with basic implementations but becomes more relevant in intricate applications.

* **Incorrect Attribute Value:**  While seemingly trivial, ensure the value of `aria-expanded` is strictly "true" or "false," and not variations like "TRUE" or "1".


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```html
<button aria-expanded="false" role="button" aria-controls="panel1">
  Show Panel
</button>
<div id="panel1" aria-hidden="true" style="display:none;">
  This is the content of the panel.
</div>
```

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('button');
const panel = document.getElementById('panel1');

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true');
  panel.style.display = button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true' ? 'block' : 'none';
  panel.setAttribute('aria-hidden', button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true' ? 'false' : 'true');
});
```

This example demonstrates a proper implementation. The button has a clear role, the `aria-expanded` attribute accurately reflects the state, and the `aria-controls` attribute establishes a clear link between the button and the panel.  The JavaScript ensures that both the `aria-expanded` and `aria-hidden` attributes are updated consistently with the visual changes, and `aria-hidden` provides an additional cue to the screen reader.

**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation (Missing Role)**

```html
<div aria-expanded="false">
  Show Panel
  <div>
    This is the content of the panel.
  </div>
</div>
```

In this case, the lack of a proper role on the outer `div` makes it ambiguous for JAWS.  The screen reader might not recognize the intent of the `aria-expanded` attribute, leading to no announcement.  Adding a `role="button"` to the outer div would resolve this.

**Example 3: Incorrect Implementation (Improper Nesting and JavaScript Issue)**

```html
<button aria-expanded="false">Show Panel</button>
<div>Other Content</div>
<div>This is the content of the panel.</div>
```

```javascript
//Incorrect and unreliable JavaScript to handle the state change, not updating aria-expanded
const button = document.querySelector('button');
const panel = document.querySelectorAll('div')[1]; //Selects the second div

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  panel.style.display = panel.style.display === 'none' ? 'block' : 'none';
});
```

Here, the nested panel content is not directly associated with the button, and the javascript entirely ignores the ARIA attributes, leading to the expanded state change not being reflected in the accessibility tree.  A better approach would be to wrap the panel content in a container with a clear role and update both visual and ARIA states.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I suggest reviewing official W3C ARIA documentation, specifically the sections on `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and live regions.  Consult the JAWS screen reader documentation for detailed information on its ARIA support and troubleshooting techniques.  Furthermore, I highly recommend researching best practices on creating accessible JavaScript and utilizing automated accessibility testing tools to identify potential issues.  These tools can offer valuable insights into how screen readers interact with your web application.  Finally, studying the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide will provide a robust understanding of how to effectively use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility.
