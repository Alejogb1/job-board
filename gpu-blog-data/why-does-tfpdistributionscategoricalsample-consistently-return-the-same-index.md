The core reason a TensorFlow Probability (tfp) `Categorical().sample()` call might repeatedly return the same index stems from a deterministic state within the underlying random number generator, particularly when not explicitly seeded. Let me explain this based on my experience debugging similar issues with variational inference models.

TensorFlow Probability relies on TensorFlow's random number generation mechanisms. When constructing a `tfp.distributions.Categorical` instance and subsequently calling `sample()`, if you haven't provided a seed to TensorFlow's random operations, it defaults to a globally managed, deterministic state. This global state is initialized when the TensorFlow session starts (or the graph is built, in the case of TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution) but is not automatically advanced or modified across multiple calls unless you do so explicitly. Consequently, each `sample()` call in the same session or within the same graph will effectively pull the same 'random' value from the same position in the global pseudo-random sequence, resulting in the same output index.

The behavior isn’t a bug; it's a predictable outcome of how pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) operate. These generators create seemingly random sequences using mathematical algorithms, and they require an initial seed to start the sequence. If the same seed is provided or if no seed is given, the sequence produced will be identical each time the generator is initialized. The global generator in TensorFlow maintains that initial seed, which is why repeated calls within the same execution context can lead to non-random behavior.

To illustrate, consider this common situation. I often build custom layer blocks for deep learning models, and incorrect random behavior would manifest as my models failing to diversify learning paths. If I were to instantiate `tfp.distributions.Categorical` without seeding, the resulting samples within that layer across batches would, at the beginning, only return one of the possibilities in my model. This can, and often does, lead to poor convergence. Here's what that would look like, and how I would rectify this issue:

**Code Example 1: The Problem – Unseeded Categorical Distribution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Define probabilities for the Categorical distribution (example)
probabilities = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]

# Create the Categorical distribution
categorical = tfp.distributions.Categorical(probs=probabilities)

# Sample from the distribution multiple times (without seeding)
samples1 = categorical.sample(10)
samples2 = categorical.sample(10)

# The problem: samples1 and samples2 are identical

print("Samples 1:", samples1)
print("Samples 2:", samples2)

```

In this example, you’ll notice that `samples1` and `samples2` produce the same sequence of indices. This highlights the deterministic behavior. Without the addition of the `seed` argument or setting of TensorFlow's random seed,  the default generator maintains the exact same state between calls.

**Code Example 2: The Solution – Seeding the Operation**

To resolve this, you should seed the `sample()` function directly or use the `seed` attribute available during the construction of the `Categorical` object. This changes the internal state of TensorFlow’s random generator. Here is how I typically address it with a manual seeding approach during sampling, as this approach offers a lot of flexibility:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Define probabilities for the Categorical distribution (example)
probabilities = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]

# Create the Categorical distribution
categorical = tfp.distributions.Categorical(probs=probabilities)

# Sample from the distribution with different seeds
samples3 = categorical.sample(10, seed=42)
samples4 = categorical.sample(10, seed=123)

# Correct behavior: samples3 and samples4 are different

print("Samples 3:", samples3)
print("Samples 4:", samples4)

```

In this adjusted example,  I’ve passed different seed values to the `sample()` function on each call. This effectively "jumps" the random number generator to different portions of its sequence, generating varied outputs.  Note that I explicitly use different integers to differentiate the random sequences.

**Code Example 3: Seeding on Construction**

While seeding during sampling is good, another useful strategy is to provide a seed during the construction of the categorical object. When you call sample, you will be creating a new random sequence each time you call sample, as the generator is not being reset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Define probabilities for the Categorical distribution (example)
probabilities = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]

# Create the Categorical distribution with a seed
categorical_seeded = tfp.distributions.Categorical(probs=probabilities, seed=42)

# Sample from the distribution multiple times
samples5 = categorical_seeded.sample(10)
samples6 = categorical_seeded.sample(10)

# Correct behavior: samples5 and samples6 are different (given a specific seed)

print("Samples 5:", samples5)
print("Samples 6:", samples6)

```

Here the random sequences are different, but predictable, given a specific starting seed during the construction of the object. When no seed is passed, however, the system’s global default seed is used, which will result in the same issues if not appropriately configured at the global level.

When you are troubleshooting stochastic problems, ensuring that you are generating unique random sequences is necessary. When the model gets run in distributed settings, ensuring that every worker has a unique seed is essential, otherwise you may see your models diverging in unexpected ways. I have had issues where different hardware led to the same seed being generated. In other words, you should not expect unique random numbers simply because different hardware is present, you should seed correctly at the code level.

To ensure reproducible stochastic behaviour, use `tf.random.set_seed()` at the beginning of the script, or during your setup of `tf.config.experimental.enable_device_placement_with_tf_standard()`. Seeding the global random state before any TF operations will help establish consistent results, especially across multiple runs of the script. Additionally, if you are working with Keras models, it is advisable to set the random seed when constructing layers that need random initialization. This ensures that even the random weight initialization is consistent between models, which is sometimes overlooked.

In summary, when using `tfp.distributions.Categorical().sample()`, the underlying deterministic nature of TensorFlow's pseudo-random number generator necessitates explicit seed management. This ensures different sequences are generated across multiple sampling calls, achieving proper stochasticity. Without this consideration, you can encounter issues that are difficult to diagnose when you have to rely on randomized behaviours for a model, including not getting the appropriate random initializations for the stochastic nature of variational autoencoders or Bayesian deep learning.
For further reading on TensorFlow's random number handling, I would recommend the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering random number generation and seeding. I find that consulting the code repository of TensorFlow Probability provides a good overview of how distributions are implemented.
Finally, exploring tutorials on variational inference and Bayesian deep learning often reveals best practices around utilizing random numbers effectively in probabilistic modeling.
