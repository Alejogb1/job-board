The inability of a Jupyter Notebook server to connect to GPU 2 typically stems from a mismatch between the server's configuration, the CUDA driver installation, and the runtime environment's visibility to the available GPUs.  I've encountered this issue numerous times over the years while working on large-scale machine learning projects, frequently involving multi-GPU setups.  The problem rarely lies solely with the notebook server itself; rather, it's a multifaceted challenge demanding a systematic investigation across several layers of the system.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The connection process involves several steps. First, the operating system must correctly identify and initialize all available GPUs.  Next, the CUDA driver must be installed and configured to allow applications to access these GPUs.  Crucially, the Python environment (and any relevant libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch) within the notebook server needs to be aware of, and able to utilize, the specific GPU(s) you intend to use.  Failure at any of these stages will prevent the connection.

Common causes include:

* **Incorrect CUDA Driver Installation:**  The CUDA driver may not be properly installed or configured for all GPUs, or a mismatch may exist between the driver version and the CUDA-enabled libraries used within the notebook environment.  A successful installation should show all GPUs listed when querying the driver (e.g., using `nvidia-smi`).
* **Conflicting Driver Versions:**  Multiple CUDA driver versions installed simultaneously can lead to instability and prevent access to specific GPUs.  A clean installation, uninstalling older versions, is often necessary.
* **Permissions Issues:** The notebook server process may lack the necessary permissions to access GPU 2. This is often linked to user privileges or group memberships.
* **CUDA-Aware Library Configuration:** TensorFlow or PyTorch might not be correctly configured to use CUDA, or they may be defaulting to CPU computation.  Environment variables and configuration files play a crucial role here.
* **GPU Device Visibility:** The notebook kernel's runtime environment might not have visibility to GPU 2 due to system configuration issues or resource allocation problems.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Driver Installation and GPU Visibility:**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

This command, executed from the terminal, provides critical information about the GPUs accessible to the system.  It displays GPU utilization, temperature, memory usage, and crucially, whether the driver is correctly recognizing all GPUs, including GPU 2.  If GPU 2 isn't listed or shows an error status, the CUDA driver needs immediate attention.  I've frequently debugged this by checking driver installation logs and ensuring compatibility with the operating system.

**Example 2: Checking TensorFlow GPU Availability within the Notebook:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))

tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)
```

This code snippet, executed within a Jupyter Notebook cell, checks TensorFlow's awareness of available GPUs.  `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` returns a list of physical GPUs visible to TensorFlow.  If GPU 2 is absent, then TensorFlow's configuration needs review.  `tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)` helps in identifying which operations are placed on which GPU during execution, aiding in troubleshooting if TensorFlow is still operational but avoiding GPU 2.

**Example 3:  PyTorch GPU Usage Verification:**

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.device_count())
print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))  #Replace 0 with appropriate index if GPU 2 is not device 0

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda:1') #Replace 1 with appropriate GPU index for GPU 2
    x = torch.randn(10, 10).to(device)
    print(x.device)
else:
    print("CUDA is not available")
```

This Python code uses PyTorch's CUDA capabilities to verify GPU access.  `torch.cuda.device_count()` shows the total number of GPUs PyTorch recognizes.  `torch.cuda.get_device_name()` provides the name of a specific GPU; note the correct index for GPU 2 must be used.  Attempting to move a tensor (`x`) to a specific GPU (`device`) can directly test connectivity.  A `RuntimeError` indicates a problem with the device selection or CUDA configuration.  In past projects, this helped isolate issues related to incorrectly specified device IDs or missing CUDA libraries in the runtime path.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Toolkit documentation provides essential information on driver installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.  The TensorFlow and PyTorch documentation offer detailed guides on GPU support, configuration, and best practices.  Familiarize yourself with the system administration documentation for your operating system, particularly concerning hardware access permissions and resource management.  Consult the documentation for your specific GPU hardware as well.  Finally, I find the NVIDIA developer forums invaluable for seeking help on specific hardware and driver-related issues.  Leveraging these resources, combined with systematic problem-solving, will often resolve connectivity issues.
