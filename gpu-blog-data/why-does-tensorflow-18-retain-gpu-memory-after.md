TensorFlow 1.8's persistent GPU memory allocation, even after explicit session closure, stems from a combination of factors relating to its underlying memory management and the interaction between the Python runtime and the CUDA driver.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale machine learning projects highlights this as a crucial point often overlooked.  The core problem isn't simply the session's lifecycle; it's the lifecycle of the underlying CUDA resources.

**1.  Explanation of the Memory Retention Mechanism**

TensorFlow 1.8, unlike later versions, doesn't aggressively reclaim GPU memory upon session closure.  This is because the session, in essence, acts as a container for operations and variables. While `sess.close()` deallocates Python-level objects associated with the session, it doesn't directly instruct the CUDA driver to release the allocated memory. The CUDA driver maintains its own independent memory pool, and TensorFlow 1.8 relies heavily on the driver's internal memory management.  The session's closure only signals the end of the Python-managed part of the workflow; the CUDA-managed resources remain untouched unless explicitly freed.

Further compounding this, TensorFlow 1.8's eager execution wasn't as prominent as in later versions. This meant that many operations were compiled into a graph, and the memory allocated for that graph was not always immediately released when the graph was no longer needed. The lack of fine-grained control over resource allocation within the graph itself contributes to this persistent memory usage.  Finally, the interaction with other libraries, particularly custom CUDA kernels or libraries integrated within the TensorFlow graph, might lead to additional memory held outside the direct control of the TensorFlow session.  This requires examining the specific dependencies involved to ensure they are correctly releasing their resources.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the issue and potential mitigation strategies, assuming a basic setup with a GPU available.  Remember to replace placeholders like `device_name` with your actual GPU device.

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Problem**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume TensorFlow 1.8 is installed

with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)) as sess:
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    c = a + b
    sess.run(c)

# The session is closed, yet GPU memory may remain allocated.
# Verify GPU memory usage using system monitoring tools (nvidia-smi, for example).
```

This simple example demonstrates that even after the session closes, the GPU memory might not be immediately released.  The `log_device_placement=True` flag is crucial for verifying that the operations are indeed executing on the GPU.

**Example 2:  Using `tf.reset_default_graph()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)) as sess:
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    c = a + b
    sess.run(c)
    sess.close()
    tf.reset_default_graph()

# `tf.reset_default_graph()` helps clear the graph, potentially leading to some memory release.
# However, it might not be completely effective in TensorFlow 1.8.
```

`tf.reset_default_graph()` attempts to clear the default graph, thereby releasing the associated resources.  While helpful, it doesn't guarantee complete memory reclamation in TensorFlow 1.8 due to the reasons outlined above.  The effectiveness of this method often depends on the complexity of the graph and the underlying CUDA memory management.

**Example 3:  Illustrative (Not Practical for Production): Manual CUDA Memory Management (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import ctypes  # For interacting with CUDA directly (Advanced and Not Recommended)

# ... (TensorFlow operations within a session as in Example 1) ...

# Extremely advanced and not recommended for production code.  This is purely illustrative.
# Directly interacting with CUDA memory requires expert knowledge and is highly system-dependent.
# Proper error handling and resource management are crucial and omitted for brevity.

# Example using a hypothetical CUDA memory freeing function (replace with actual CUDA calls if needed).
# This section is highly system and CUDA version dependent.  This is only for illustrative purposes.
hypothetical_cuda_free_memory()

sess.close()
```

This example hints at directly interacting with CUDA to release memory.  However, directly manipulating CUDA memory is extremely advanced, platform-specific, and prone to errors if not handled meticulously. It is **strongly discouraged** for typical TensorFlow usage.  This approach highlights the fundamental limitation: the memory is held by the CUDA driver, outside of TensorFlow's direct control in version 1.8.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

To address this issue effectively within TensorFlow 1.8's constraints, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for version 1.8 (available in archived resources).  Furthermore,  thorough understanding of CUDA programming and memory management is invaluable for debugging such problems.  Examining the system-level GPU memory usage via tools like `nvidia-smi` is essential for monitoring memory leaks and the efficacy of different approaches.  Finally, carefully review the documentation for any custom CUDA kernels or libraries used alongside TensorFlow to ensure they properly release their resources.  In many cases, migrating to TensorFlow 2.x or later (which features improved memory management) is the most efficient solution.  The documentation for TensorFlow 2.x's memory management should be explored as a long-term solution.  The improved eager execution in later versions offers greater granularity over resource allocation and release.
