In PyTorch's batch normalization layers (specifically, `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`, and `torch.nn.BatchNorm3d`), the maintenance of `running_mean`, `running_var`, and `num_batches_tracked` is fundamental for accurate inference when batch size may differ or be absent. However, scenarios exist where we need these statistics frozen during training, effectively reverting to a behavior closer to instance normalization within the batch norm framework. Specifically, a common approach for techniques like adversarial training or domain adaptation may require these statistics to remain constant during the training process. I've encountered these situations numerous times while working with generative models and adaptation algorithms, where modifying batch statistics mid-training produced instability. The key here isn't to disable batch normalization; it's about halting the *update* of these tracked statistics.

The primary mechanism for controlling the update process lies within the `BatchNormNd` module itself. By default, during the training phase (i.e., when the model is in `model.train()` mode), these running statistics are updated using an exponential moving average, with `momentum` acting as the smoothing factor. During evaluation (`model.eval()`), these saved statistics are used instead of calculating them from the current batch. However, we have direct access to prevent the update during the training mode using the `track_running_stats` parameter or by manually manipulating the parameters internally.

The `track_running_stats` argument within the batch normalization constructor provides a simple, declarative switch to control this behavior. When set to `False`, the `running_mean`, `running_var`, and `num_batches_tracked` parameters are not updated during training, and the layer operates using the statistics derived from the current batch, effectively behaving more like instance normalization. It’s important to recognize this is *not* the same as completely deactivating batch normalization, the scale and bias will still operate on the batch normalized values, and the layer is still learning via backpropagation, just without updating its internal statistics. This method is my preferred approach due to its clarity and maintainability. The layer acts as a 'standard' batch norm during training, just with the running stats fixed; inference will use the last recorded batch mean and variance.

Alternatively, one could achieve the same result by directly setting the `running_mean`, `running_var`, and `num_batches_tracked` attributes to require no gradients (`requires_grad=False`) and setting their values to some fixed tensor or constant *before* starting training. This manual method also works, but is less straightforward and more error-prone.

Below are three code examples illustrating these approaches.

**Example 1: Using `track_running_stats = False`**

This code snippet shows how to initialize a batch normalization layer with `track_running_stats` disabled.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize batchnorm1d with tracking disabled
batch_norm_no_track = nn.BatchNorm1d(num_features=10, track_running_stats=False)

# Generate dummy input for demonstration
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 10) # Batch of size 32, 10 features

# Switch to training mode
batch_norm_no_track.train()

# Pass tensor through the batch normalization layer
output_tensor = batch_norm_no_track(input_tensor)

# Print the running mean (should be unchanged)
print("Running Mean:", batch_norm_no_track.running_mean)
print("Running Var:", batch_norm_no_track.running_var)

# Generate another input
input_tensor_2 = torch.randn(32, 10)
#Pass another input through the layer
output_tensor_2 = batch_norm_no_track(input_tensor_2)

print("Running Mean after another batch:", batch_norm_no_track.running_mean)
print("Running Var after another batch:", batch_norm_no_track.running_var)


```

In this first example, the printed `running_mean` and `running_var` attributes remain at their initialized values (zero and one respectively). No updates will occur while in the `train()` mode. This clearly demonstrates the effect of disabling the tracking functionality. Importantly, though batch norm’s mean and variance calculation is not updated, its scale and bias parameters still update via backpropagation, and gradient flow continues through the layer.

**Example 2: Manually Freezing Running Statistics**

Here is how to manually freeze the running statistics parameters of a BatchNorm layer. This should typically be done before the start of the training loop.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize batchnorm1d
batch_norm_manual = nn.BatchNorm1d(num_features=10)

# freeze running stats, requires_grad set to false
batch_norm_manual.running_mean.requires_grad = False
batch_norm_manual.running_var.requires_grad = False
batch_norm_manual.num_batches_tracked.requires_grad = False

# Generate dummy input for demonstration
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 10)

# Switch to training mode
batch_norm_manual.train()

# Pass tensor through the batch normalization layer
output_tensor = batch_norm_manual(input_tensor)
print("Initial Running Mean:", batch_norm_manual.running_mean)
print("Initial Running Variance:", batch_norm_manual.running_var)
# Pass another input
input_tensor_2 = torch.randn(32, 10)
output_tensor_2 = batch_norm_manual(input_tensor_2)


# Print the running mean and variance (should be unchanged)
print("Running Mean after another batch:", batch_norm_manual.running_mean)
print("Running Variance after another batch:", batch_norm_manual.running_var)
```

In this second example, we directly access the `running_mean`, `running_var`, and `num_batches_tracked` parameters and set their `requires_grad` attribute to `False`, effectively freezing their values. The values, as shown by printing them before and after the second forward pass, do not change despite the layer being in training mode. Again, gradient flow will occur through the layer.

**Example 3: Combining Multiple BatchNorm Layers with Frozen Statistics**

In this example, we look at combining several layers in a small model, with two batch norm layers and a linear layer, with the statistics frozen. This is to better showcase that back propagation still occurs, with only the recorded batch statistics frozen.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Create a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.batchnorm1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(10, track_running_stats=False)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.batchnorm2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(5, track_running_stats=False)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.batchnorm1(x)
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.batchnorm2(x)
        return x


model = SimpleModel()

# Generate a dummy input and target
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 10)
target_tensor = torch.randn(32, 5)


# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training Loop

model.train()

# Pass data through the model and calculate loss
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(input_tensor)
loss = criterion(output, target_tensor)

# Print parameters
print("BatchNorm1 Scale Before:", model.batchnorm1.weight)
print("BatchNorm2 Scale Before:", model.batchnorm2.weight)

# Backpropagate
loss.backward()

# Update parameters
optimizer.step()

# Print parameters
print("BatchNorm1 Scale After:", model.batchnorm1.weight)
print("BatchNorm2 Scale After:", model.batchnorm2.weight)


# Check that the running mean hasn't changed
print("BatchNorm1 Running Mean:", model.batchnorm1.running_mean)
print("BatchNorm2 Running Mean:", model.batchnorm2.running_mean)
```
In this final example, we see the `BatchNorm` layer’s scale parameters have updated via backpropagation, but the running means and variances remain frozen during training as desired. This shows both the desired result of non-updating running statistics, while also confirming back propagation still functions.

For further understanding of PyTorch’s `BatchNorm` behavior, I’d recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation. In addition, looking into the math behind batch normalization and exponential moving averages will provide insight into the workings of the running statistics. Research articles and books on deep learning also explore batch normalization and related normalization techniques in depth.

In summary, preventing PyTorch's batch normalization layers from updating their running statistics during training can be achieved using `track_running_stats=False` during initialization or manually by freezing the statistics tensors themselves. I’ve found the former more readable and less error-prone for implementing this behavior in practical training setups. The choice depends on personal preference, but the underlying mechanism is the same – preventing updates to the batch norm layer's internal statistics while still using backpropagation to train the remaining parameters.
