MySQL's query optimizer can sometimes choose not to use an index when executing an INNER JOIN, even though one appears suitable, which can manifest as a `NULL` value in the `key` column of the `EXPLAIN` output. This behavior typically stems from the query planner determining that a full table scan is more efficient under specific circumstances. I've encountered this several times while working on performance optimization for large databases, and it frequently arises when there's significant data skew or where the join criteria don't align optimally with existing indexes.

The crux of this issue lies in how MySQL evaluates the cost of different query execution plans. When an `INNER JOIN` is used, the database is not obligated to return rows from the "left" table if there's no matching row in the "right" table; it only returns combinations that meet the join condition. Consequently, the optimizer might decide that scanning the entire "right" table directly, without leveraging any indexes, and then applying the join criteria, is the fastest path. This can occur when the selectivity of the join is poor and a large fraction of the table must be evaluated regardless, making index seeking less beneficial than a direct scan.

Conversely, `LEFT JOIN` forces a different approach. It requires the database to produce results from all rows of the left table even when there's no matching row in the right table. To ensure that, the query optimizer must analyze the left table and attempt to efficiently find matching records within the right table. Because of this, it often results in better index usage when applicable. The query plan might then be forced to use an index on the join column of the right table in this situation. Essentially, the difference in the guaranteed data output forces a different execution approach.

Let's consider three scenarios and their respective `EXPLAIN` output, highlighting how this behavior is manifested. I'll base these on the context of user activity and product information.

**Scenario 1: INNER JOIN with Limited Selectivity**

Suppose we have two tables: `users` and `orders`. The `users` table has an `id` column (primary key), and the `orders` table has a `user_id` column (foreign key, potentially indexed), along with other fields such as `order_date` and `total_amount`. A simple `INNER JOIN` might look like this:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT u.username, o.order_date
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
```

Assume the database is large with millions of user records and orders spanning multiple years, but relatively few orders from January 2023. Because of the limited selectivity of the order date filter, along with the join operation, the query planner may decide it is faster to scan the entire `orders` table then look up matching `users` instead of the other way around. In this scenario, the output could show:

```
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+-------+----------+-------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows  | filtered | Extra       |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+-------+----------+-------------+
|  1 | SIMPLE      | o     | NULL       | ALL  | user_id_idx  | NULL | NULL    | NULL | 1000000 |    10.00 | Using where |
|  1 | SIMPLE      | u     | NULL       | eq_ref | PRIMARY      | PRIMARY | 4     | o.user_id |    1    | NULL        |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+-------+----------+-------------+
```

Notice that the `orders` table (`o`) shows `key` as `NULL`, indicating a full table scan is being performed, while the `users` table shows the primary key is used. Although a `user_id_idx` was a possible key for `orders`, it was not used by the optimizer. This highlights the key point: MySQL might ignore an index if it believes a full table scan is more optimal given the current state of the data and constraints.

**Scenario 2: LEFT JOIN, Index Usage Enforced**

Now, let's change the join to a `LEFT JOIN` but retain other aspects of the scenario.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT u.username, o.order_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31' OR o.order_date IS NULL;
```

The added `OR o.order_date IS NULL` clause is important, as it guarantees that the optimizer now *must* include all users. This alters how the query planner chooses the best execution approach.

```
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+--------------------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type | possible_keys | key        | key_len | ref   | rows  | filtered | Extra                    |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+--------------------------+
|  1 | SIMPLE      | u     | NULL       | ALL  | NULL          | NULL       | NULL    | NULL  | 500000  |   100.00  | NULL                     |
|  1 | SIMPLE      | o     | NULL       | ref | user_id_idx   | user_id_idx | 4     | u.id  |  100   |     10.00 | Using where; Using index |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------------+---------+-------+-------+----------+--------------------------+
```

Here, the `orders` table shows `key` as `user_id_idx`. The optimizer recognized that using the index is beneficial because it needs to consider each user and efficiently find associated order records. It cannot arbitrarily decide not to read all `users` data, which consequently alters the decision of index application on the second join table.

**Scenario 3: INNER JOIN with Index Usage**

For completeness, let's illustrate when the `INNER JOIN` *does* use the index. Suppose we adjust the `WHERE` clause significantly.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT u.username, o.order_date
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.id IN (SELECT user_id from orders WHERE order_date > '2023-05-01');
```

Here, we are selecting a subset of users based on having placed an order after '2023-05-01'. This condition changes the selectivity quite significantly. This is typically what one would expect in any database that is optimized correctly.

```
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------------+---------+-------------------+------+----------+-------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type | possible_keys | key        | key_len | ref               | rows | filtered | Extra       |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------------+---------+-------------------+------+----------+-------------+
|  1 | SIMPLE      | o    | NULL       | index| user_id_idx  | user_id_idx | 4     | NULL| 100  | 100.00 | Using where; Using index   |
|  1 | SIMPLE      | u     | NULL       | eq_ref | PRIMARY      | PRIMARY    | 4     | o.user_id        |  1    | 100.00 | NULL        |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+------------+---------+-------------------+------+----------+-------------+
```

The output now shows `user_id_idx` used by the query optimizer on the `orders` table within the subquery and for the join, indicating that index usage is preferred under the given constraints. This makes sense because the initial subquery greatly reduces the number of users, which will then be used in the outer query.

These examples illustrate that the presence of an index does not guarantee its use. The query optimizer analyzes different execution paths and selects the one it deems most efficient at the time of query execution based on the table data and constraints. `LEFT JOIN` generally leads to more consistent index utilization, as the forced inclusion of left-table data can lead to more targeted operations on right tables.
