The disparity in CUDA memory consumption between a standalone PyTorch script and a Jupyter Notebook session often stems from differing memory management practices and the lifecycle of CUDA tensors.  In my experience debugging similar issues across various deep learning projects—including a large-scale image classification model and a recurrent neural network for time-series prediction—I've found that the primary culprit is usually the automatic garbage collection behavior of the Python interpreter, coupled with the more explicit memory management required in standalone scripts.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Jupyter Notebooks, by their interactive nature, tend to exhibit more frequent garbage collection cycles.  Each cell execution is effectively a discrete unit, and when a cell completes, Python's garbage collector will reclaim unused memory, including CUDA memory allocated to tensors.  This happens relatively promptly, preventing a continuous accumulation of memory allocated to objects no longer actively in use.

In contrast, a standalone PyTorch script, especially one processing a large dataset or complex model, might lack this frequent release of memory.  A long-running script often creates tensors sequentially without explicitly releasing them, leading to a steady buildup of allocated CUDA memory.  While Python's garbage collector will eventually intervene, the trigger for garbage collection might not be frequent enough to prevent exceeding the GPU's memory capacity, especially if the script involves numerous large tensors created within nested loops or recursive functions.  Furthermore, the reference counting mechanism within Python, while usually efficient, can sometimes fail to promptly identify and deallocate objects, particularly cyclical references involving large tensors. The default behavior of `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is not guaranteed to clear all memory.

Another contributing factor is the scope of variables.  In a notebook, variables defined within a cell are automatically removed from memory after the cell finishes executing, unless explicitly assigned to a variable in a subsequent cell.  A standalone script, however, might maintain numerous large tensors in memory for a prolonged period, particularly if the script's structure isn't carefully designed for efficient memory management.  Lack of explicit memory management using constructs like `del` or `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` exacerbates this issue.

Finally, the initialization of the PyTorch environment can also play a role.  A Jupyter notebook often initializes CUDA resources on demand for each cell. A standalone script, however, might initialize all necessary resources at the beginning, potentially reserving more memory than ultimately needed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Memory Management in a Standalone Script:**

```python
import torch

data_size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 1 GB
num_iterations = 100

for i in range(num_iterations):
    tensor = torch.rand(data_size, device='cuda') # Allocates 1 GB of CUDA memory each iteration
    # ... perform operations using 'tensor' ...

# Tensor 'tensor' is no longer used after each iteration but not explicitly deleted.
# Garbage collection may not be immediate, leading to a memory buildup.
```

This script demonstrates the issue.  The `tensor` variable occupies 1GB of CUDA memory within each iteration. Though the loop ends, garbage collection might not immediately reclaim the memory, leading to potential out-of-memory errors with sufficient iterations.  Modifying the script to explicitly deallocate memory after each iteration would mitigate this:

```python
import torch

data_size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 1 GB
num_iterations = 100

for i in range(num_iterations):
    tensor = torch.rand(data_size, device='cuda')
    # ... perform operations using 'tensor' ...
    del tensor  # Explicitly delete the tensor
    torch.cuda.empty_cache() # Force immediate memory release

```


**Example 2:  Leveraging `torch.no_grad()` in a Standalone Script:**

During model inference, the gradient calculation is unnecessary.  The following example demonstrates the potential memory savings from utilizing `torch.no_grad()`:

```python
import torch

model = MyModel().to('cuda') #Load pre-trained model to CUDA
data = torch.rand(batch_size, input_dim).cuda()

with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(data) # Inference without gradient calculation, reducing memory usage.

```


**Example 3:  Efficient Memory Management in a Jupyter Notebook:**

The same potentially memory-intensive operation in a Jupyter Notebook setting would likely not cause an out-of-memory error due to the cell-based execution and more frequent garbage collection:

```python
import torch

data_size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 1 GB

tensor = torch.rand(data_size, device='cuda')
# ... perform operations using 'tensor' ...

# Cell execution ends; 'tensor' is garbage collected automatically
# without requiring explicit 'del' statement.
```

Note that even in Jupyter, extremely large tensors might still cause memory issues if the notebook's kernel doesn't have the opportunity to execute garbage collection before the next operation. However, the frequency of garbage collection in Jupyter significantly reduces the likelihood of this scenario.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on memory management and CUDA tensor handling.  Reviewing advanced Python programming concepts related to memory management and garbage collection would also be beneficial.  A comprehensive understanding of CUDA programming and GPU memory allocation would be essential for optimizing memory usage in deep learning applications.  Finally, profiling tools designed for PyTorch applications are crucial in identifying memory bottlenecks and optimizing resource utilization.  These tools provide detailed insights into memory allocation and deallocation, helping pinpoint memory leaks and inefficiencies in your code.
