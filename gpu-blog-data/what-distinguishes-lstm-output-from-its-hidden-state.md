The core distinction between LSTM output and its hidden state lies in their intended functionality and the information they encapsulate.  While both represent the network's internal representation of the input sequence at a given time step, the output is specifically designed for downstream tasks, whereas the hidden state serves primarily as an internal memory mechanism for the network itself.  This fundamental difference shapes their interpretation and utilization within broader architectures. My experience building sequence-to-sequence models for financial time series prediction has highlighted this disparity numerous times.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

An LSTM unit processes sequential data by maintaining a cell state, a continuous memory track, and three gates: input, forget, and output.  The input gate regulates the flow of new information into the cell state, the forget gate controls the removal of old information, and the output gate determines which parts of the cell state contribute to the unit's output. Crucially, the hidden state acts as a summary of the cell state,  a vector representation influenced by both the current input and the previously processed sequence information held in the cell state.  The output, however, is a projection of this hidden state, tailored specifically for a particular task.  It undergoes a linear transformation (and potentially a non-linear activation function) to produce a vector that is directly relevant to the desired output of the LSTM layer.

The hidden state, on the other hand, remains internal to the LSTM. It's passed directly to the next time step as part of the recurrent connection, allowing information from earlier parts of the sequence to influence later computations.  It isn't directly intended for external interpretation or use. Its role is purely intra-network; it serves as a form of contextualized memory for the LSTM, guiding the processing of subsequent input elements.  Consider this: the hidden state represents the LSTM's complete internal understanding of the sequence up to a specific point, while the output is a carefully selected subset of that understanding, optimized for a given predictive task.

The dimensions of the output and hidden state vectors are often the same, especially when a single LSTM unit is considered. However, in stacked LSTMs (LSTMs where the output of one layer feeds into the input of the next), the output of one layer becomes the input of the next, highlighting the distinct roles each vector plays.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the distinction using Keras, a high-level API for building neural networks.  Iâ€™ve utilized these extensively in my work with both TensorFlow and Theano backends.

**Example 1: Simple LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)), #returns hidden state at each timestep as output
    keras.layers.Dense(units=10) #output layer, operating on the LSTM's output
])

#Sample Input data (replace with your data)
input_data = tf.random.normal((100, 20, 5)) #Batch size, timesteps, features

#Inference
output_seq, hidden_states = model(input_data)

print("Output Sequence Shape:", output_seq.shape)
#e.g., (100, 20, 10) if timesteps = 20 and output units = 10. This represents the model's output at each timestep.

#Accessing hidden state directly (requires modifications to the LSTM layer or model construction for direct access)
#This is not a standard access method in Keras, highlighting the internal nature of the hidden state.
#Note:  The specifics of accessing hidden states depend on the backend and LSTM implementation.
#This might involve custom LSTM layer implementation or using intermediate layer outputs from an unrolled model.
```

This example utilizes `return_sequences=True`, explicitly generating an output for every time step. The output's dimension depends on the units specified in the `Dense` layer.  Accessing the hidden state directly within the standard Keras workflow isn't straightforward, reinforcing its internal nature.


**Example 2: Accessing Hidden State (Illustrative, Requires Custom Layer)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomLSTM(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLSTM, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_state=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        output, h_state, c_state = self.lstm_layer(inputs) #returns output and hidden/cell states
        return output, h_state


model = keras.Sequential([
    CustomLSTM(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=10)
])

output, hidden_state = model(input_data)

print("Output Shape:", output.shape)
print("Hidden State Shape:", hidden_state.shape)
```

This code demonstrates how one might access the hidden state, but necessitates a custom layer.  This highlights the hidden state's role as an internal mechanism, not directly exposed by default. The hidden state is accessed by utilizing `return_state=True` within the custom LSTM implementation.


**Example 3:  LSTM for many-to-one sequence classification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)), #only final hidden state is outputted
    keras.layers.Dense(units=num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

#Sample Input data (replace with your data)
input_data = tf.random.normal((100, 20, 5)) #Batch size, timesteps, features

#Inference
output = model(input_data)

print("Output Shape:", output.shape) # (100, num_classes) - Classification probabilities for each sample
```

Here, `return_sequences=False` (the default) is implicitly used.  The model only outputs the final hidden state, making the model suitable for tasks like sequence classification. The output directly represents the classification decision.  The internal workings are not exposed.
