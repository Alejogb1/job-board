TensorFlow's assignment operation, specifically targeting elements within a tensor, operates on a crucial interplay of indexing and data type validity. The permissible indices for such assignments depend heavily on the tensor’s dimensionality and data type, and deviation from these rules results in runtime errors. I’ve encountered this firsthand while developing custom layers for a generative model, where incorrectly assigning to a sub-tensor significantly impacted the model’s learning capacity.

Fundamentally, TensorFlow permits integer-based indexing for element-wise assignment. For a one-dimensional tensor, only a single integer index is required, representing the position within the vector. For higher dimensional tensors, the number of indices must match the rank (number of dimensions) of the tensor. Each index corresponds to a coordinate within its respective dimension, akin to addressing elements within a multi-dimensional array. Notably, Python-style negative indexing, indicating positions from the end of a dimension, is also supported.

The tensor data type plays a crucial role as well. The data type of the assigned value must either match the tensor’s data type or be implicitly convertible. Attempting to assign a floating-point value to an integer tensor, without explicit casting, will result in a `TypeError`. This requirement stems from TensorFlow's static type system designed to optimize performance.

Consider a rank-2 tensor, often conceived as a matrix. Here, two indices, typically referred to as row and column indices, are needed to uniquely identify and modify a single element. Slicing operations are also valid when assigning to a sub-tensor but they are not single element assignments as we are discussing here, rather they operate on multiple elements.

Here's a breakdown with concrete examples:

**Example 1: Rank-1 Tensor (Vector) Assignment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a rank-1 integer tensor
vector_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=tf.int32)

# Valid assignment: index 0 (first element)
modified_vector_1 = tf.Variable(vector_tensor)
modified_vector_1[0].assign(10) # Assign 10 to the first element
print(modified_vector_1.numpy())

# Valid assignment: Negative index -1 (last element)
modified_vector_2 = tf.Variable(vector_tensor)
modified_vector_2[-1].assign(-5) # Assign -5 to the last element
print(modified_vector_2.numpy())

# Invalid assignment (index out of range) will cause an error
# modified_vector_3 = tf.Variable(vector_tensor)
# modified_vector_3[5].assign(6) # Causes an IndexError at runtime
```

In this example, I initialize a simple integer vector. The first assignment modifies the element at index `0` to `10`. The second utilizes negative indexing, modifying the last element at index `-1` to `-5`. The commented section showcases an incorrect assignment attempt using an index `5`, which is out of bounds and would cause a runtime error. This underscores the criticality of adhering to index bounds.

**Example 2: Rank-2 Tensor (Matrix) Assignment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a rank-2 integer tensor (a 2x3 matrix)
matrix_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Valid assignment: Row 0, Column 1
modified_matrix_1 = tf.Variable(matrix_tensor)
modified_matrix_1[0, 1].assign(10)  # Modifies element at row 0, column 1
print(modified_matrix_1.numpy())

# Valid Assignment: Row 1, Column 2
modified_matrix_2 = tf.Variable(matrix_tensor)
modified_matrix_2[1, 2].assign(20)
print(modified_matrix_2.numpy())


# Invalid assignment (incorrect rank) will cause an error
# modified_matrix_3 = tf.Variable(matrix_tensor)
# modified_matrix_3[0].assign(10) # This would cause a TypeError at runtime

# Invalid assignment (index out of range) will cause an error
# modified_matrix_4 = tf.Variable(matrix_tensor)
# modified_matrix_4[2, 1].assign(20) # Causes an IndexError at runtime
```

This example demonstrates assignment within a matrix. The tensor requires two indices to identify a specific element. `modified_matrix_1[0, 1]` modifies the value at the second column of the first row, illustrating the row-major indexing scheme. The commented sections highlight typical errors: attempting assignment using a single index for a rank-2 tensor will result in `TypeError`. Likewise, indexing out of range such as trying to access element `[2,1]` of a 2x3 matrix is invalid and results in an `IndexError`.

**Example 3: Data Type Consistency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a float32 tensor
float_tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# Valid assignment: Same data type
modified_float_1 = tf.Variable(float_tensor)
modified_float_1[1].assign(5.5)
print(modified_float_1.numpy())


# Implicit Conversion : from integer to float is valid
modified_float_2 = tf.Variable(float_tensor)
modified_float_2[0].assign(4)
print(modified_float_2.numpy())


# Invalid Assignment: different data type without casting: Causes error
# integer_tensor = tf.constant([1,2,3],dtype=tf.int32)
# modified_int_1 = tf.Variable(integer_tensor)
# modified_int_1[1].assign(4.2) # causes TypeError without casting

# Valid Assignment with explicit casting:
integer_tensor = tf.constant([1,2,3],dtype=tf.int32)
modified_int_2 = tf.Variable(integer_tensor)
modified_int_2[1].assign(tf.cast(4.2,tf.int32)) # casting the value
print(modified_int_2.numpy())


```

This example focuses on the type compatibility rules. The first two assignments showcase valid operations with float assignments to the float tensor. It also shows how TensorFlow allows the integer to float assignment implicitly. The commented section exemplifies the error you get when assigning a float directly to an int tensor without casting. Finally, the last part shows the correct assignment via `tf.cast` that converts the `4.2` to the correct integer data type, before assignment to the tensor. It should be also noted that during casting data loss may occur as we see the result is `4`.

In summary, indexing in TensorFlow for assignment follows a strict system dictated by the tensor’s dimensionality and the data type. Integer indices correspond to the element position, negative indices work from the end of the dimension, and the number of indices should equal the rank. Data type compatibility is strictly enforced and needs to be explicitly addressed using casting if types do not match.

For more thorough understanding, I recommend reviewing TensorFlow's official documentation, specifically focusing on sections related to tensor creation, indexing, and variable assignments. Textbooks focusing on advanced machine learning with TensorFlow often delve into these concepts with detailed examples. Additionally, the online TensorFlow community forums can be an excellent place to learn best practices and find answers to specific scenarios.
