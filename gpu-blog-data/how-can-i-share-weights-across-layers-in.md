Weight sharing in Keras, particularly across distinct layers, presents a nuanced challenge often overlooked in introductory tutorials.  My experience implementing custom layers for complex sequence-to-sequence models highlighted the critical need for precise control over weight matrices.  Simply duplicating weights isn't sufficient; maintaining consistent gradients during backpropagation requires a more sophisticated approach.  The fundamental strategy revolves around creating custom layers that explicitly share the same weight tensors, thereby enforcing parameter equality across multiple layers.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The naïve approach – creating multiple layers and manually assigning the same weight matrices – is flawed. Keras, by default, creates independent weight tensors for each layer, even if initialized with identical values. This leads to independent updates during training, negating the intended weight sharing.  To achieve genuine weight sharing, we must leverage Keras's custom layer functionality and rely on mechanisms that directly bind multiple layers to a single, shared weight tensor. This ensures that the gradients computed for each layer contribute collectively to the update of this shared tensor. The process involves three key steps:

* **Creating a shared weight tensor:** This tensor will act as the source of weights for all layers that need to share parameters.  It should be initialized appropriately depending on the layer type (e.g., using `tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform` for dense layers).

* **Defining a custom layer:** This layer will take the shared weight tensor as an input and perform the necessary operations (e.g., matrix multiplication for dense layers, convolution for convolutional layers). Critically, this layer should *not* create its own weight tensors.  It will use the shared tensor exclusively.

* **Instantiating multiple layers using the custom layer:**  Multiple instances of the custom layer are created, each referencing the same shared weight tensor.  This establishes the weight sharing mechanism.

The efficiency gains from weight sharing depend on the specific application. It is most beneficial when the same transformation is needed in multiple parts of the network, and learning the transformation repeatedly is redundant.  It's crucial to recognize that incorrect implementation can lead to unexpected behavior and inaccurate results; the weight sharing must be integrated seamlessly into the backpropagation process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Weight sharing in Dense Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SharedWeightDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, shared_weights, **kwargs):
        super(SharedWeightDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.shared_weights = shared_weights # Receive shared weights as input

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.shared_weights)

# Create shared weights
shared_weights = tf.Variable(tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()(shape=(10, 5)))

# Create two dense layers sharing the same weights
layer1 = SharedWeightDense(units=5, shared_weights=shared_weights)
layer2 = SharedWeightDense(units=5, shared_weights=shared_weights)

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1,10))
output1 = layer1(input_tensor)
output2 = layer2(output1)

print(output1)
print(output2)
```

This example defines a custom dense layer `SharedWeightDense` that receives pre-initialized weights.  Two instances of this layer use the same `shared_weights` variable, ensuring weight sharing. Note the absence of `kernel` or `bias` initialization within the custom layer.


**Example 2: Weight Sharing in Convolutional Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SharedWeightConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size, shared_weights, **kwargs):
        super(SharedWeightConv2D, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.filters = filters
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.shared_weights = shared_weights

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, self.shared_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')


#Example shared weights, requires careful shape definition according to filters, kernel size and input channels.
shared_weights = tf.Variable(tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()(shape=(3,3,3,64))) #Example 3x3 kernel, 3 input channels, 64 output filters


layer1 = SharedWeightConv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), shared_weights=shared_weights)
layer2 = SharedWeightConv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), shared_weights=shared_weights)

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))  #Example input shape
output1 = layer1(input_tensor)
output2 = layer2(output1)

print(output1.shape)
print(output2.shape)
```

This extends the concept to convolutional layers. The `shared_weights` tensor must be appropriately shaped for the convolution operation, reflecting the filter size, number of input and output channels.  The strides and padding parameters need adjustment based on the specific application.  Note the careful consideration given to input tensor shape to ensure compatibility.


**Example 3:  Sharing Weights across Different Layer Types (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SharedWeightLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, operation, shared_weights, **kwargs):
        super(SharedWeightLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.operation = operation
        self.shared_weights = shared_weights

    def call(self, inputs):
        if self.operation == 'dense':
            return tf.matmul(inputs, self.shared_weights)
        elif self.operation == 'conv':
            return tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, self.shared_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported operation")

shared_weights = tf.Variable(tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()(shape=(10, 5))) #Example shape for dense and conv layers (adjust as needed)

dense_layer = SharedWeightLayer(operation='dense', shared_weights=shared_weights)
conv_layer = SharedWeightLayer(operation='conv', shared_weights=shared_weights)

#Requires reshaping to make compatible between dense and convolution layers.

dense_input = tf.random.normal((1,10))
conv_input = tf.reshape(dense_input,(1,1,1,10)) #Example reshaping


dense_output = dense_layer(dense_input)
conv_output = conv_layer(conv_input)

print(dense_output)
print(conv_output)
```

This example demonstrates a more flexible custom layer that can perform different operations (dense or convolutional) using the same shared weights. This requires careful consideration of weight tensor shape and input reshaping to ensure compatibility across different layer types.  This approach is advanced and requires a deeper understanding of tensor operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation itself provides invaluable insights into custom layer creation.  Reviewing material on tensor manipulations in TensorFlow is crucial for understanding the intricacies of weight sharing, especially for complex layer configurations.  Understanding the fundamentals of backpropagation and gradient descent is also necessary to comprehend how weight sharing impacts the training process. Finally, consult advanced deep learning textbooks for a theoretical foundation in weight sharing strategies and their applications.  These resources, used in conjunction with practical experimentation, will solidify your understanding of this technique.
