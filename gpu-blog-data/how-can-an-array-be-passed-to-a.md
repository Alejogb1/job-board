Passing arrays to sequential neural networks hinges on understanding the inherent structure of both the data and the model.  My experience developing forecasting models for high-frequency financial data has highlighted the critical role of proper data preprocessing and input shaping.  The network expects a specific input tensor format, not just a raw array.  Failure to conform to this expectation results in shape mismatches and model execution errors.  The primary challenge lies in converting a potentially multi-dimensional array into a format compatible with the network's input layer.  This often involves reshaping, expanding dimensions, and potentially normalizing the data.

**1. Explanation:**

Sequential neural networks, built using frameworks like Keras or TensorFlow/tf.keras, operate on tensors. While an array in Python (a NumPy array, for instance) might seem similar, the crucial difference lies in how the network interprets its dimensions.  A simple sequential model might have an input layer expecting a vector of a certain length.  If your input is a single observation, represented as a 1D array, this can be fed directly after appropriate scaling (discussed below).  However, if your data consists of multiple observations, each represented by a 1D array, you'll need to transform it into a 2D tensor where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature.  For time-series data, this typically corresponds to a sequence of observations over time. Further complexities arise with multi-variate time series or image data where higher dimensional arrays are required.  In these cases, the array needs reshaping into a tensor with an appropriate number of dimensions.  For example, with image data, the array will often be reshaped to (number of images, height, width, channels).

Before feeding the data, normalization is almost always crucial.  Neural networks often perform better with input features scaled to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1.  This prevents features with larger values from disproportionately influencing the network's learning process.  Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling and standardization (z-score normalization).  Furthermore, depending on the specific network architecture, you might need to consider sequence padding or truncation if your sequences have varying lengths.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Single observation, single feature:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Sample data: a single observation with one feature
data = np.array([10.5])

# Normalize the data (min-max scaling to [0,1])
min_val = np.min(data)
max_val = np.max(data)
normalized_data = (data - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)


# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),  # Input layer expecting a vector of size 1
    Dense(units=1, activation='linear')  # Output layer
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Reshape to ensure correct input shape (though unnecessary here since it's already a 1D array)
reshaped_data = np.reshape(normalized_data, (1,1)) #reshaping for consistency

# Train the model (replace with your actual training data)
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.array([0.8]), epochs=10) #Example output, replace with actual target

#Prediction
prediction = model.predict(reshaped_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

This example demonstrates the simplest scenario: a single observation with a single feature.  The input shape is explicitly defined as `(1,)`, indicating a 1D vector of length 1.  Normalization is applied to improve network performance.

**Example 2: Multiple observations, single feature:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Sample data: multiple observations, each with one feature
data = np.array([10.5, 12.2, 11.8, 13.1, 12.5])

# Normalize the data (min-max scaling)
min_val = np.min(data)
max_val = np.max(data)
normalized_data = (data - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)), # Input layer, each datapoint is processed individually
    Dense(units=1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Reshape for individual processing
reshaped_data = np.reshape(normalized_data, (len(normalized_data),1))

# Train the model (replace with your actual training data and targets)
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.array([0.1,0.5,0.4,0.8,0.6]), epochs=10)


#Prediction
prediction = model.predict(reshaped_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

Here, multiple observations are handled.  The `input_shape` remains (1,), as the network processes each observation independently.  The data is reshaped to ensure compatibility with the model's input layer.


**Example 3: Time-series data (multiple observations, multiple features):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample time-series data: multiple observations, each with multiple features
data = np.array([[10.5, 20.1], [12.2, 22.5], [11.8, 21.9], [13.1, 23.8], [12.5, 22.2]])

# Normalize the data (using standardization for demonstration)
mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
std = np.std(data, axis=0)
normalized_data = (data - mean) / std

# Reshape for LSTM input (samples, timesteps, features)
reshaped_data = np.reshape(normalized_data, (normalized_data.shape[0], 1, normalized_data.shape[1]))

# Define the LSTM model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=50, activation='relu', input_shape=(1, data.shape[1])),
    Dense(units=1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model (replace with your actual training data and targets)
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.array([0.1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.8, 0.6]), epochs=10)

#Prediction
prediction = model.predict(reshaped_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

This example uses LSTM, suitable for time-series data. The data is reshaped to (samples, timesteps, features).  Note the use of standardization for normalization.  The `input_shape` in the LSTM layer reflects this three-dimensional tensor structure.  Choosing an appropriate recurrent architecture is crucial for time-series applications, and this example showcases one.
