Reshaping Keras tensors to precise dimensions frequently arises in model development, particularly when integrating layers with differing input/output shapes.  My experience building and deploying production-ready deep learning models, encompassing projects ranging from image classification to time-series forecasting, has highlighted the crucial role of tensor manipulation.  Incorrect reshaping can lead to runtime errors, hindering model training and prediction accuracy.  Understanding the underlying mechanics of Keras's tensor manipulation tools is, therefore, paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras tensors, underpinned by NumPy arrays, are multi-dimensional arrays representing data.  Reshaping involves changing the tensor's dimensions while preserving the underlying data.  This is often necessary to align input data with the expectations of specific layers within a Keras model.  For example, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) expects a specific input shape (e.g., (batch_size, height, width, channels) for image data), and if your input tensor deviates from this, reshaping becomes crucial.  The core methods employed are `tf.reshape()` (TensorFlow backend) and `numpy.reshape()`.  The critical distinction lies in understanding the total number of elements within the tensor must remain constant during the reshaping operation.  Attempting to reshape a tensor into a dimension with a different number of elements will result in a `ValueError`.

The `tf.reshape()` function provides flexibility in specifying target dimensions. You can provide a complete tuple defining the new shape explicitly or use `-1` as a placeholder.  When `-1` is used, the unspecified dimension is automatically inferred based on the total number of elements and the explicitly specified dimensions.  This is particularly helpful when one dimension is to be determined dynamically based on the input data or the desired output structure.  Similarly, `numpy.reshape()` offers the same functionality, operating directly on the underlying NumPy array representation of the Keras tensor.  Careful consideration of the data order (row-major or column-major) is essential, particularly when dealing with higher-dimensional tensors to avoid unintended data rearrangement.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Explicit Reshaping using `tf.reshape()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'tensor' is a Keras tensor of shape (100, 28, 28) representing 100 images of size 28x28
tensor = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28))

# Reshape to (100, 784) – flattening the images into a vector
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (100, 784))

print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped tensor shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates explicit reshaping using `tf.reshape()`.  The original tensor, representing 100 images of 28x28 pixels, is flattened into a vector of 784 features per image. The shape is explicitly defined to (100, 784).  This is a common operation before feeding data to a fully connected layer in a CNN.


**Example 2: Implicit Reshaping using `-1` with `tf.reshape()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28))

# Reshape to (100, -1) – inferring the second dimension
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (100, -1))

print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped tensor shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")
```

Here, `-1` is used to let TensorFlow automatically infer the second dimension based on the total number of elements and the explicitly specified first dimension (100).  This simplifies reshaping when one dimension can be derived from others.  This often streamlines code and reduces the risk of manual calculation errors.


**Example 3: Reshaping using `numpy.reshape()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tensor = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28))

# Convert Keras tensor to NumPy array
numpy_array = tensor.numpy()

# Reshape using NumPy
reshaped_array = np.reshape(numpy_array, (100, 784))

# Convert back to Keras tensor if needed
reshaped_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(reshaped_array)

print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped tensor shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")
```

This example illustrates the use of `numpy.reshape()`.  It showcases a common workflow where a Keras tensor is temporarily converted to a NumPy array for reshaping and then converted back.  This approach is beneficial when dealing with more complex reshaping operations or leveraging NumPy's extensive array manipulation capabilities.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for detailed explanations and advanced techniques on tensor manipulation. The TensorFlow API documentation provides exhaustive information on functions like `tf.reshape()`, including error handling and best practices.  Furthermore, review the NumPy documentation for comprehensive understanding of array manipulation techniques.   A practical guide on deep learning with Keras, specifically focusing on model architecture and data preprocessing, will offer valuable insights into practical tensor reshaping applications.  Understanding linear algebra fundamentals, particularly matrix and vector operations, is also critical for grasping the underlying principles of tensor reshaping.
