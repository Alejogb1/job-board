The `InvalidArgumentError` you're encountering in TensorFlow/Keras when using a custom loss function with a non-scalar second input stems from a fundamental mismatch between the expected output structure of your loss function and the internal workings of the backpropagation algorithm.  My experience debugging similar issues over the years has shown this to be a common pitfall, particularly when transitioning from simpler loss functions like mean squared error to more complex, application-specific formulations.  The error arises because the gradient calculation expects a scalar loss value for each training example, enabling efficient computation of gradients across the entire batch.  Your non-scalar output disrupts this process.

Let me clarify.  The backpropagation algorithm relies on calculating gradients with respect to each weight in your model.  These gradients are derived from the partial derivatives of the loss function.  Crucially, this requires a scalar loss value for each data point in your training batch.  If your custom loss function returns a tensor of shape (batch_size, N), where N > 1, the gradient calculation cannot proceed directly as it encounters multiple loss values per training example.  The system doesn't know how to aggregate these multiple loss values into a single gradient contribution for each weight.

The solution is to ensure your custom loss function returns a scalar loss value for each training example. This typically involves aggregating the multiple loss components into a single scalar using operations like `tf.reduce_mean`, `tf.reduce_sum`, or other appropriate reduction functions based on the specifics of your loss function.

Here are three code examples illustrating this concept, along with accompanying commentary explaining how they address the issue.  I've encountered each of these scenarios in my work designing and optimizing deep learning models for image classification and time series forecasting.

**Example 1:  Multi-task Learning with Individual Component Losses**

Imagine a multi-task learning scenario where you predict both image classification (loss_classification) and bounding boxes (loss_bbox).  A naive approach might return both losses separately.  The corrected version explicitly averages the components:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def multitask_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  y_true_class, y_true_bbox = y_true[:, :10], y_true[:, 10:] #Example split for 10 class classification
  y_pred_class, y_pred_bbox = y_pred[:, :10], y_pred[:, 10:]

  loss_classification = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true_class, y_pred_class)
  loss_bbox = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true_bbox, y_pred_bbox)

  #Incorrect approach - Returns a tensor of shape (batch_size, 2)
  # return [loss_classification, loss_bbox]

  #Correct approach - Returns a scalar for each training example
  total_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_classification + loss_bbox, axis=-1)  # axis=-1 averages across components
  return total_loss

model.compile(loss=multitask_loss, optimizer='adam')
```

The crucial change is the introduction of `tf.reduce_mean(loss_classification + loss_bbox, axis=-1)`. This averages the classification and bounding box losses for each training example, resulting in a scalar loss for backpropagation.  Before this correction, the model would fail with the `InvalidArgumentError` due to the list of losses.


**Example 2:  Weighted Average of Losses Across Different Output Dimensions**

Consider a scenario with multiple output dimensions, each contributing differently to the overall loss.  Different weights might reflect different importance for each part of the prediction.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    loss1 = tf.keras.losses.mse(y_true[:, 0], y_pred[:, 0])
    loss2 = tf.keras.losses.mae(y_true[:, 1:], y_pred[:, 1:])

    # Incorrect approach
    # return tf.stack([loss1, loss2], axis=1)

    # Correct approach: weighted average across dimensions
    weighted_loss = 0.7 * loss1 + 0.3 * tf.reduce_mean(loss2, axis=-1)
    return weighted_loss

model.compile(loss=weighted_loss, optimizer='adam')
```

Here, we apply different weights to different loss components before aggregating them into a scalar loss value for each sample.  The `axis=-1` in `tf.reduce_mean` ensures that we average the losses along the appropriate dimension before weighting. This produces a single scalar value representing the total loss for each training example.


**Example 3:  Custom Loss with Per-Pixel Loss (e.g., Image Segmentation)**

In image segmentation, a common approach involves calculating a loss for each pixel.  Directly returning the per-pixel loss tensor is incorrect.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def pixelwise_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Assume y_true and y_pred are of shape (batch_size, height, width, channels)

    # Incorrect: Returns a tensor of shape (batch_size, height, width)
    # pixel_losses = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)

    # Correct: Average pixel-wise losses for each image in batch
    pixel_losses = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(pixel_losses, axis=[1, 2, 3])  # Average over height, width, and channels
    return average_loss

model.compile(loss=pixelwise_loss, optimizer='adam')
```

The corrected version averages the per-pixel losses across the spatial dimensions (height and width) and channels, yielding a single scalar loss for each training image.  This addresses the core issue of the non-scalar output that triggered the `InvalidArgumentError`.

In summary, the critical element is to ensure your custom loss function returns a scalar representing the loss for each training example.  Failure to do so results in the `InvalidArgumentError` as the gradient calculation process cannot handle a multi-dimensional loss value.  The examples provided demonstrate various scenarios and solutions employing appropriate TensorFlow functions for aggregation.

For further understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on custom loss functions and backpropagation.  Additionally, a thorough review of the fundamentals of automatic differentiation and gradient descent would greatly enhance your understanding of this error and how to prevent it.  Finally, carefully analyzing the shapes of your tensors at each stage of your loss function's computation is indispensable for efficient debugging.
