The distinction between CUDA heap and global memory hinges on their allocation mechanism and intended use within the CUDA programming model, directly impacting performance and memory management complexity. Global memory provides a vast, persistent storage space accessible by all threads within a grid, while the CUDA heap serves as dynamically allocatable memory managed by the device runtime. This difference dictates where and when each should be employed.

Global memory resides in device DRAM. It is allocated via `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMallocPitch`, or analogous API calls and remains allocated until explicitly freed using `cudaFree`. Consequently, it’s often used for large data structures needed throughout the lifetime of a kernel execution, like input and output arrays, precomputed look-up tables, and model parameters. Its scope extends across the entire device, meaning different kernel launches can access the same global memory allocation. Performance considerations with global memory center around minimizing access latency by adhering to coalesced memory access patterns and avoiding bank conflicts.

The CUDA heap, however, is managed internally by the device's runtime environment through calls to `cudaMallocAsync`. This means allocations from the heap are typically short-lived and geared toward more dynamic memory needs inside a kernel. The heap's memory manager handles fragmentation, allocation and deallocation, and often resides within device memory itself. The scope of heap allocations is normally limited to the kernel launch that performed the allocation. It's important to note that using the heap introduces the overhead of dynamic memory management, which is not present with the statically allocated global memory. Heap allocations should be reserved for situations where the size of memory required is not known at compile time, or where a large number of small allocations are needed, making the manual management of global memory impractical.

While global memory is managed manually through `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree`, heap allocation using `cudaMallocAsync` has its corresponding `cudaFreeAsync`. The asynchronous nature of `cudaMallocAsync` and `cudaFreeAsync` means the runtime might not immediately process memory operations on the host thread, which can provide an opportunity for overlapping host and device work and further optimization. It's crucial to ensure memory operations initiated by these asynchronous calls are synchronized correctly, using cudaStreamSynchronize or device synchronization, before accessing or relying on their results.

A critical distinction lies in the persistence of data. Data in global memory persists between kernel launches unless explicitly freed, facilitating data reuse. Conversely, heap allocations are generally confined to the scope of their launching kernel. While technically, memory allocated using `cudaMallocAsync` can persist by making it a static or global object, this strategy should be approached with caution as it circumvents the typical usage model of the heap, potentially introducing memory leaks.

Let's consider some code examples to solidify these concepts. Suppose we have a simple kernel that performs element-wise addition on two arrays, and outputs a result to a third. Here's the global memory allocation approach:

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void add_arrays(float *a, float *b, float *c, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024;
  size_t byte_size = size * sizeof(float);

  float *h_a = new float[size];
  float *h_b = new float[size];
  float *h_c = new float[size];

  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    h_a[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    h_b[i] = static_cast<float>(i * 2);
  }

  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, byte_size);
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, byte_size);
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, byte_size);

  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, byte_size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, byte_size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  add_arrays<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, byte_size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    std::cout << "h_c[" << i << "] = " << h_c[i] << std::endl;
  }


  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  delete[] h_a;
  delete[] h_b;
  delete[] h_c;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `d_a`, `d_b`, and `d_c` are allocated in global memory. This is persistent across the kernel launch and requires explicit allocation and deallocation. Note that the allocation happens before the kernel call, and the deallocation after the result is retrieved.

Now, consider a scenario where we need a temporary buffer within the kernel to perform some intermediate calculations. Here’s how a heap-allocated buffer might be used in a modified kernel:

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void process_with_heap(float *in, float *out, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(i >= size) return;

    float *temp_buffer;
    size_t temp_buffer_size = size/blockDim.x * sizeof(float);
    cudaMallocAsync((void**)&temp_buffer, temp_buffer_size);

    if (temp_buffer != nullptr){
      temp_buffer[threadIdx.x] = in[i] * 2.0f;
      __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads within the block finish copying into temp_buffer
    
     //Do some intermediate computation on temp buffer...simplified as a copy.
      out[i] = temp_buffer[threadIdx.x];

     cudaFreeAsync(temp_buffer);
   }
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024;
  size_t byte_size = size * sizeof(float);

  float *h_in = new float[size];
  float *h_out = new float[size];
    for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
    h_in[i] = i * 1.0f;
  }

  float *d_in, *d_out;
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_in, byte_size);
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_out, byte_size);
  cudaMemcpy(d_in, h_in, byte_size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  process_with_heap<<<blocksPerGrid,threadsPerBlock>>>(d_in, d_out, size);
    cudaMemcpy(h_out, d_out, byte_size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
        std::cout << "h_out[" << i << "] = " << h_out[i] << std::endl;
    }

    cudaFree(d_in);
    cudaFree(d_out);

    delete[] h_in;
    delete[] h_out;
  return 0;
}
```
Here, `temp_buffer` is allocated from the device heap within the kernel, its lifetime limited to this kernel’s execution. Notice the usage of `cudaMallocAsync` and `cudaFreeAsync` alongside the `__syncthreads()` call, ensuring all threads within a block have completed writing to temp\_buffer before accessing it to ensure correct data and avoiding race conditions.

Finally, let's examine a case illustrating that the scope of heap memory is tied to the kernel instance where it was allocated. The following code attempts to access the heap memory allocated in the previous kernel from a new kernel launch, demonstrating that it's invalid:

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void allocate_on_heap(float **ptr) {
   float *temp_buffer;
    size_t buffer_size = 10 * sizeof(float);
    cudaMallocAsync((void**)&temp_buffer, buffer_size);

    if(temp_buffer) {
      *ptr = temp_buffer;
    }
    
}

__global__ void access_heap(float *ptr) {
    // Attempt to access the heap-allocated memory
    if(ptr != nullptr) {
        ptr[0] = 42.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    float* device_ptr = nullptr;
    float* retrieved_ptr = nullptr;

    allocate_on_heap<<<1,1>>>(&device_ptr);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    cudaMemcpy(&retrieved_ptr, &device_ptr, sizeof(float*), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    access_heap<<<1,1>>>(retrieved_ptr);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // Attempting to use retrieved_ptr here will result in undefined behavior.
    std::cout << "Data set, but will cause crash if accessing memory via pointer in different kernel." << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, even though we pass a pointer to the heap memory allocated in the first kernel to the second kernel, it will not be valid, since heap memory scope is within the kernel launch that allocated it. Attempting to access the memory pointed to by the retrieved pointer in a subsequent kernel is unsafe and can lead to undefined behavior and crashes. The data may reside in a deallocated location, or within some other allocation by the device runtime.

For deeper understanding, the CUDA Toolkit documentation is paramount, particularly sections regarding memory management. Textbooks on CUDA programming and high performance computing often delve into these specifics. Online resources like NVIDIA’s developer website offer tutorials, best practices, and example code that elaborate on efficient memory handling techniques. Furthermore, NVIDIA whitepapers often present performance analysis of different memory access strategies, providing a valuable insight to both static (global memory) and dynamic (heap memory) usage.
