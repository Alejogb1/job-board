The most common cause of a size mismatch error when loading a pre-trained GoogLeNet's `state_dict` arises from discrepancies between the layer names and/or shapes present in the pre-trained model and the architecture of the model you're attempting to load the weights into. This often occurs when modifications are made to the GoogLeNet architecture, even seemingly minor ones, or when a different pre-trained version is used than intended. I've personally encountered this several times in past projects, often during experimentation with fine-tuning or customization.

Essentially, the `state_dict` is a Python dictionary where keys represent the layer names within a model and values are the corresponding learned parameters (weights and biases). These keys must align *exactly* with the layer names in the model you are trying to load them into. Any deviation in the keys, or a change in the shape of the value tensors will cause this size mismatch. Such discrepancies can arise from variations in the specific implementation of GoogLeNet used. Some implementations may include auxiliary classifier layers, while others might not. Other differences might include varying activation functions or changes to pooling layer sizes.

To illustrate, consider the following situation. Imagine I have a locally trained GoogLeNet model from a past project, saved in `checkpoint.pth`, intended to be loaded into a new GoogLeNet instance. However, I inadvertently use the PyTorch library's pre-trained version, or vice-versa. The models are functionally "GoogLeNet," but the naming conventions of the layers within their `state_dict` will differ. Letâ€™s analyze a basic example:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# Assume we have a saved state_dict 'checkpoint.pth' from a custom trained GoogLeNet

# First: Load PyTorch's pre-trained GoogLeNet (with auxiliary classifiers by default)
googlenet_pretrained = models.googlenet(pretrained=True)

# Second: Try to load our saved state_dict
try:
    checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')
    googlenet_pretrained.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error Loading: {e}")

```
The code attempts to load a `state_dict` from `checkpoint.pth` into a standard, pre-trained GoogLeNet instance provided by PyTorch.  If `checkpoint.pth` contains a `state_dict` not compatible with the pre-trained model (perhaps from a custom model where auxiliary classifiers are removed, or a model with modified layers),  a `RuntimeError` will be triggered, likely specifying a size mismatch or missing key. The pre-trained GoogLeNet's `state_dict`, by default, contains layers and weights related to the auxiliary classifiers, while our checkpointed version may lack them. This mismatch prevents a direct load.

A more targeted example, demonstrating a direct size mismatch, would occur if one were to adjust the input dimensions of the first convolution layer. For example:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

#Define a modified GoogLeNet with altered input dimensions

class ModifiedGoogLeNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=1000):
        super(ModifiedGoogLeNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 64, kernel_size=7, stride=2, padding=3) # Changed input channel to 1
        self.features = models.googlenet(pretrained=True).features #Reuse layers from pretrained model
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.fc = nn.Linear(1024, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.conv1(x)
      x = self.features(x)
      x = self.avgpool(x)
      x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x


modified_googlenet = ModifiedGoogLeNet()

# Load state_dict of pretrained model
pretrained_model = models.googlenet(pretrained=True)

try:
  modified_googlenet.load_state_dict(pretrained_model.state_dict())
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error Loading: {e}")


```
Here, a `ModifiedGoogLeNet` class is defined, which takes the architecture from a pre-trained GoogLeNet but modifies the first convolution layer's input channels to `1`. This alteration makes it incompatible with the `state_dict` from the standard pre-trained model, whose initial convolution layer expects 3 input channels. The loading process fails, since a direct transfer of the `state_dict` entries into this modified structure is not possible as shape of initial weights will conflict directly.

One might also encounter this error when only loading a portion of a pre-trained state dict. Suppose you wish to only use the feature extraction portion of the GoogLeNet model, extracting the weights only from `features` portion of the model as I did in the modified model above, and then building on it. Consider the following example:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(FeatureExtractor, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential( *list(models.googlenet(pretrained=True).children())[:-3] )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.features(x)

feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()

pretrained_model = models.googlenet(pretrained=True)


try:
  feature_extractor.load_state_dict(pretrained_model.state_dict())
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error Loading: {e}")
```
Here, we have built a simple class which extracts feature portion of GoogLeNet as a sequential module and then attempt to load the entire state dict from pre-trained model into the feature extractor. We are likely to run into an error here since we have not defined the auxiliary classification components within our feature extractor. When we load the state_dict, we are attempting to load additional weights and biases that were never part of our model.

To mitigate these errors, a careful examination of the `state_dict` and the model architecture is necessary. It may involve a step-by-step approach where specific layers are loaded individually or where keys are selectively mapped to the appropriate layers. Debugging often requires inspecting the keys in both state dictionaries to pinpoint which layers differ, either in name or shape. It's not necessarily about the specific model (GoogLeNet, in this case), but more about the agreement between the state dictionary used for saving the model and the target model architecture.

Furthermore, I would recommend using model visualization tools, specifically those that output the model's layers and their names, to identify naming mismatches. Additionally, when modifying any existing model, ensure that you are not only aware of shape discrepancies, but you also account for changes in output dimensionality that may result from modifying intermediary layers. When working with a new architecture or implementation of existing models, verifying layer names and shapes using debugging tools is essential.

Several resources have aided me in similar situations. Specifically, deep learning library documentation, especially the section pertaining to custom layers and model modifications, provides the most reliable guidance. Technical blogs discussing transfer learning techniques frequently discuss `state_dict` compatibility issues, often in the context of fine-tuning. Finally, online communities and forums that are specific to machine learning libraries contain numerous user-reported solutions to these types of problems. These resources together have been quite helpful in resolving these issues when I have encountered them.
