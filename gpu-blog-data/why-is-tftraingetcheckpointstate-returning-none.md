The `tf.train.get_checkpoint_state()` function returning `None` almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the expected checkpoint directory structure and the actual state on disk.  My experience debugging this, across numerous large-scale TensorFlow projects, points to this as the primary culprit.  It's less frequently a problem with the function itself and more often a subtle error in how the checkpointing mechanism is implemented within the training pipeline.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.train.get_checkpoint_state()` relies on finding a specific file structure within a provided directory.  This structure, implicitly defined by TensorFlow's checkpointing system, involves a directory containing a `checkpoint` file. This `checkpoint` file is a simple text file containing a single line specifying the path to the latest checkpoint file (e.g., `model.ckpt-12345`).  If this file, or the directory itself, is missing or incorrectly structured, the function will return `None`.

Several common scenarios lead to this outcome. Firstly, the specified directory might simply not exist.  This often arises from typos in the path string passed to the function.  Secondly, the training process might have crashed before it successfully saved a checkpoint, leaving the directory empty or incomplete.  Thirdly, and this is crucial, the checkpoint might have been saved under a different name than anticipated, potentially due to a discrepancy between the `saver` object's name and the expected checkpoint filename.  Lastly, and often overlooked, the use of multiple training processes writing to the same directory simultaneously, without proper coordination, can lead to corrupted or missing checkpoint files, resulting in `None` being returned.

Addressing these issues requires systematic debugging, beginning with verifying the existence of the directory and then examining the contents to ensure the correct file structure is present.  Using tools like `ls -l` or file explorers allows visual inspection of the directory, which aids in quickly identifying missing components.  Inspecting the code that handles checkpoint saving is equally vital, looking for potential logic errors or exceptions that could prevent checkpoint creation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Directory Path:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

checkpoint_dir = "/path/to/my/checkpoints/incorrect_path"  # Potential typo here!

ckpt = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(checkpoint_dir)
if ckpt is None:
    print("No checkpoint found.  Verify the checkpoint directory path.")
else:
    print("Latest checkpoint:", ckpt.model_checkpoint_path)
```

This example highlights a common error: a simple typo in the directory path.  I've encountered this numerous times, often in large projects with complex directory structures.  Always double-check your paths!  Using an absolute path can minimize ambiguity.

**Example 2:  Missing Checkpoint File:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

checkpoint_dir = "/path/to/my/checkpoints"
saver = tf.train.Saver()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # ... training code ...

    # Incorrect saving:  Missing saver.save() call
    # This would leave the checkpoint directory empty or incomplete.
    #saver.save(sess, checkpoint_dir + "/model.ckpt")


ckpt = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(checkpoint_dir)
if ckpt is None:
    print("No checkpoint found. Check if the training process completed successfully and saved checkpoints.")
else:
    print("Latest checkpoint:", ckpt.model_checkpoint_path)
```

This example demonstrates a scenario where the training code might lack a crucial `saver.save()` call.  In my experience, forgetting to save checkpoints, or encountering exceptions during the saving process, is a frequent cause of this problem.  Always include robust error handling around checkpoint saving operations, particularly in long-running or distributed training jobs.

**Example 3:  Mismatched Saver Name:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

checkpoint_dir = "/path/to/my/checkpoints"
saver = tf.train.Saver(name="my_custom_saver") # Different name used here

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # ... training code ...
    saver.save(sess, checkpoint_dir + "/model.ckpt")

ckpt = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(checkpoint_dir)
if ckpt is None:
    print("No checkpoint found. Check for a mismatch between the saver object's name and the checkpoint files.") #The check-point files would not contain a suffix in accordance with a saver of this name.
else:
    print("Latest checkpoint:", ckpt.model_checkpoint_path)

```

This example illustrates how a custom `saver` name can lead to a mismatch. The default behavior of `saver.save()` appends a suffix reflecting the iteration to the checkpoint file name.  However, if you use a named saver, this behavior might change. The checkpoint file then will not conform to the expected naming convention in this directory. In some situations, the function will not find the checkpoint file because the file name does not match the expected pattern of filenames the function is looking for. Carefully examine the naming convention used when saving the checkpoints.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on saving and restoring models is essential.  Closely review the sections on checkpointing and the `tf.train.Saver` class.  A good understanding of the underlying file structure used by TensorFlow's checkpointing mechanism is crucial for effective debugging.  Additionally, consulting TensorFlow's troubleshooting guide can help in identifying less common causes of `None` returns from `get_checkpoint_state()`.  Finally, familiarity with your operating system's command-line tools for inspecting file systems (like `ls`, `find`, and `du`) is invaluable for verifying the existence and structure of files and directories.  Mastering these tools significantly speeds up debugging these types of issues.
