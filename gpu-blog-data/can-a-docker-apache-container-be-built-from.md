The immediate deployability of a Docker Apache container built from a Dockerfile on Ubuntu 18.04 hinges on the completeness of the Dockerfile and the availability of required dependencies within the container's image.  My experience building and deploying numerous containerized web applications reveals that while seemingly straightforward,  subtle issues related to port mappings, dependency management, and user privileges frequently impede immediate execution.  Let's examine the process, potential pitfalls, and solutions.

**1.  Explanation:**

Building a Docker image from a Dockerfile involves layering instructions that create a runtime environment.  For an Apache container, these instructions must encompass the Apache web server installation, its configuration, and potentially the application code it serves.  Ubuntu 18.04, being a relatively mature and widely used distribution, possesses readily available Apache packages within its repositories. However, the Dockerfile must explicitly fetch and install these packages, configuring Apache appropriately within the container's context.  Furthermore, security best practices advocate running Apache as a non-root user, requiring user management within the Dockerfile to ensure correct permissions. Finally, the container's port mappings must be accurately defined, allowing external access to the Apache server running inside the container. Failure at any of these stages could prevent immediate execution after the image is built.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: A Minimal, Functional Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Use an official Ubuntu 18.04 image as the base
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# Update the package list and install Apache
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2

# Expose port 80 for external access
EXPOSE 80

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Copy an index.html file (assuming it's in the same directory as the Dockerfile)
COPY index.html .

# Define the default command to run Apache
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

**Commentary:** This Dockerfile is designed for simplicity. It leverages an official Ubuntu base image, directly installs Apache, exposes port 80, and copies a basic HTML file. The `CMD` instruction ensures Apache starts upon container execution.  However, it lacks sophisticated security measures and might be insufficient for production environments.


**Example 2: Dockerfile Incorporating User Management and Security:**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2 \
    && useradd -ms /bin/bash -d /var/www www-data \
    && chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

USER www-data

WORKDIR /var/www/html

COPY index.html .

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

**Commentary:** This example improves security by creating a dedicated `www-data` user and setting appropriate ownership for the web server's directory.  Running Apache as a non-root user mitigates potential security risks.  The `USER` instruction switches to the `www-data` user before Apache starts.  Note that this relies on `index.html` existing in the build context.


**Example 3: Dockerfile for a more complex application (demonstrating dependency management):**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2 php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql  \
    && useradd -ms /bin/bash -d /var/www www-data \
    && chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

USER www-data

WORKDIR /var/www/html

COPY index.php . #Assuming a php app
COPY ./mydatabase.sql /tmp/mydatabase.sql #example database file
RUN mysql -u root -p"PASSWORD" < /tmp/mydatabase.sql && rm /tmp/mydatabase.sql  #Import initial database

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

**Commentary:** This extended example demonstrates installing additional dependencies (PHP, MySQL support) that are frequently required for web applications.  It also shows a simple method to import an initial database, assuming MySQL is running on the host and you have the correct credentials in your context. The practicality of this method depends on the specific application and whether the database should be handled differently. This dockerfile highlights the increasing complexity as application requirements grow beyond a basic Apache setup.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Apache HTTP Server documentation provides comprehensive details on configuration and usage.  The Docker documentation is essential for understanding Dockerfile best practices and commands.  Consult the Ubuntu 18.04 documentation for package management and system administration tasks.  A book on Linux system administration would provide valuable background knowledge.  Finally, exploration of various Docker image repositories can showcase practical implementations and inspire best practices.



In conclusion, while building and running a Docker Apache container on Ubuntu 18.04 is theoretically immediate, successful execution relies on a meticulously crafted Dockerfile that addresses all aspects, from dependency installation and configuration to user management and port exposure.  Overlooking any of these critical elements can result in failures during the build or runtime, potentially delaying the deployment and necessitating troubleshooting. The examples illustrate the progression from a minimal functional setup to a more robust and secure application-specific environment.  Thorough planning and testing are crucial for ensuring smooth deployment.
