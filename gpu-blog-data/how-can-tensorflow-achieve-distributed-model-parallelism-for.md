TensorFlow's capability to perform distributed model parallelism, particularly for datasets like CIFAR-10, leverages a combination of its core architecture and the `tf.distribute.Strategy` API. Specifically, we distribute the model’s layers across different devices or machines, allowing larger models to fit into the aggregate memory and enabling faster training by concurrently computing on different parts of the model. This is unlike data parallelism where the model is replicated, and data is split. Model parallelism, while complex, is essential when individual model layers exceed available memory.

Implementing this requires careful consideration of how the intermediate activations and gradients are managed across devices. I've encountered situations in a simulated distributed training environment where inadequate data transfer protocols became bottlenecks, negating the advantages of model parallelism. The crux of successful implementation lies in defining a coherent division of the model and then using TensorFlow's distribution strategies to manage the training process.

Let's delve into how this is achieved. For CIFAR-10, we’re dealing with relatively small images, but imagine we’re using a very large convolutional neural network, so large it needs to be split. First, we must structure our model such that portions can be moved to different devices. This typically involves splitting layers or groups of layers. The `tf.distribute.Strategy` API provides the framework for how the computations, variable updates, and data exchanges are handled in such a distributed setup. Specifically, the `MirroredStrategy` which is primarily designed for data parallelism could also be used for model parallelism with some modifications, but is not the best choice. In our case, we need a more customizable approach, which is the core of model parallelism. We should define the placement of our variables and tensors ourselves.

Here’s a conceptual breakdown: Assume our very large convolutional network has three blocks; each of these blocks can be placed on a different GPU, say, GPUs 0, 1, and 2, which, for simplicity, we assume all are on the same machine. We create the operations that compute the outputs of each block using TensorFlow APIs. We then use TensorFlow’s device placement capabilities using `tf.device()` to ensure that the computations for each block is executed on the specified device.

First, I'll exemplify the basic idea using a very simplified example with two sequential layers. This is a model that could be too large for one GPU if these were extremely dense layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define model layers (simplified for demonstration)
layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')
layer2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

# Dummy input data for demonstration
input_data = tf.random.normal((64, 32 * 32 * 3)) # CIFAR-10 equivalent input

# Define forward propagation for layer 1 on device 0
with tf.device("/GPU:0"):
    output1 = layer1(input_data)

# Define forward propagation for layer 2 on device 1
with tf.device("/GPU:1"):
    output2 = layer2(output1)

# We're now effectively running part of the model on each GPU
print("Output shape after device specific computation:", output2.shape)
```

In this code, `tf.device` specifies where the operations for `layer1` and `layer2` are executed. The output of layer1 is computed on GPU 0, and the result is fed to layer2's operation, which will be executed on GPU 1. This illustrates a fundamental concept of model parallelism: splitting the computation. In a real scenario, `output1` might need to be transferred across devices, necessitating careful management of the data transfer. This is a simplified depiction and we're not managing gradients, loss, or variable updates yet, but it illustrates the core technique.

Now, let's extend it to incorporate a basic training loop, still focusing on two GPUs for simplicity, and introducing the concept of gradients:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define model layers (simplified for demonstration)
layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')
layer2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

# Dummy input and labels for demonstration
input_data = tf.random.normal((64, 32*32*3))
labels = tf.random.uniform((64,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=10)

# Define loss and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

def train_step(input_data, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
       # Forward pass on GPU:0
       with tf.device("/GPU:0"):
          output1 = layer1(input_data)
       # Forward pass on GPU:1
       with tf.device("/GPU:1"):
           output2 = layer2(output1)
       loss = loss_fn(labels, output2)

    # Compute gradients
    layer1_vars = layer1.trainable_variables
    layer2_vars = layer2.trainable_variables

    #compute gradients with respect to each layers trainable variables
    layer1_grads = tape.gradient(loss, layer1_vars)
    layer2_grads = tape.gradient(loss, layer2_vars)

    # apply gradients to each layers respective variables
    with tf.device("/GPU:0"):
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(layer1_grads, layer1_vars))
    with tf.device("/GPU:1"):
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(layer2_grads, layer2_vars))

    return loss

# Training loop
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(input_data, labels_one_hot)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

In this extended example, we now have a `train_step` function responsible for both the forward and backward passes. Crucially, after computing the loss, the gradient is computed with respect to the trainable variables of both layers, then updated on the corresponding GPUs to which the layers have been assigned using `tf.device()`. This highlights the mechanism required to distribute variables and manage their updates. Notice, that our `optimizer` must apply gradients with respect to the device which the layers are located on. This model is basic, but the concepts are similar when dealing with deeper, more complex neural networks.

Finally, a more sophisticated example would use a custom model definition, where the layers are explicitly moved and managed:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        # Layers are defined here on CPU for now,
        # device placement happens during forward propagation
        self.conv_block_1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
        self.max_pool_1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2,2))
        self.conv_block_2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')
        self.max_pool_2 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2,2))
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')


    def call(self, inputs):
        # Each part of the model is placed on a specific GPU using tf.device()
        with tf.device("/GPU:0"):
            x = self.conv_block_1(inputs)
            x = self.max_pool_1(x)
        with tf.device("/GPU:1"):
           x = self.conv_block_2(x)
           x = self.max_pool_2(x)
           x = self.flatten(x)
        with tf.device("/GPU:2"):
            x = self.dense(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model, optimizer, and loss function
model = CustomModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()


# Dummy Input Data and labels
input_data = tf.random.normal((64, 32, 32, 3))
labels = tf.random.uniform((64,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=10)


def train_step(input_data, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
       predictions = model(input_data)
       loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)

    trainable_vars = model.trainable_variables
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_vars)

    #apply gradient on respective device
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, trainable_vars))
    return loss

# Training loop
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(input_data, labels_one_hot)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, we have a model class explicitly defining where model parts are located. The `call` method specifies the device on which each section executes. This organization is closer to what one might use in a practical distributed training pipeline. The custom model class encapsulates the logic of placing layers, leading to more readable and reusable code when dealing with more intricate models.

Achieving efficient model parallelism requires careful attention to device placement and data transfer, especially when scaling to multiple machines. While the `MirroredStrategy` is useful for data parallelism, the control offered by using explicit device placement and constructing custom training loops allows the programmer to specify which model layers are trained on a particular device. In the presented scenarios, the division of model layers is arbitrary. In reality, dividing layers requires thought to maximize efficiency and avoid bottlenecks when transferring tensors between different devices.

To further explore this complex area of distributed computing, consult TensorFlow documentation, tutorials and the research publications discussing different strategies on how model parallelism is implemented across clusters of machines. The TensorFlow official guide is a good start for beginners and a reference for experts. Also look into the source code for different distribution strategies for those seeking more advanced understanding. There are also various tutorials available from educational platforms focused on implementing different types of distributed training. These will provide a holistic overview of this complex aspect of machine learning and help further develop expertise in the field.
