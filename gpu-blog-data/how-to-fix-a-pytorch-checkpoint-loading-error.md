The fundamental issue when encountering a PyTorch checkpoint loading error related to storage size mismatch usually stems from alterations in the model’s architecture between the saving and loading phases. Specifically, if the number of parameters in a layer has changed, for instance, due to modifications in the number of filters in a convolutional layer or the size of a fully connected layer, the saved tensor representing that layer's weights will have a different shape than expected during loading. PyTorch stores these parameters as tensors, whose underlying storage is essentially a contiguous memory block; inconsistencies here directly trigger this error. I've frequently observed this after iterating on network architectures during research and later attempting to load older, pre-trained models for comparison.

The error often manifests as an exception during the `torch.load()` function call, accompanied by a message indicating a mismatch in the expected tensor sizes. It's not about corrupt checkpoint files, but rather the saved tensors not aligning with the current model definition. This error, while seemingly specific, underscores the critical need for precise versioning of model architectures and training workflows. Resolving it requires careful consideration of the model modifications and choosing the appropriate handling method, ranging from partial loading to architectural adjustment or retraining.

To address the issue effectively, several strategies can be implemented, depending on the nature of the mismatch. If the changes are minor – say, the addition of a few more output classes – a simple yet careful approach would be to load only the layers whose parameter sizes match and then initialize the newly added weights appropriately. In cases where more substantial architectural revisions occur, one might have to either carefully map the corresponding layers or, regrettably, retrain the model. The appropriate method hinges on balancing the goal of checkpoint reuse with the impact of architectural alterations on the model's performance.

Here’s a practical example involving a convolutional neural network. Suppose we have a model with a convolutional layer defined as follows:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 32 * 32, 10) # Assuming input of 32x32
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Model instance
original_model = SimpleCNN()
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32) # Batch size 1, 3 channels, 32x32 input

# Save a checkpoint.
torch.save(original_model.state_dict(), "original_checkpoint.pth")
```

Let's say we later modify the convolutional layer, increasing the number of output channels.

```python
# Modified Model
class ModifiedCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1) # Changed from 16 output channels to 32
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 32 * 32, 10) # Input to FC changed as well.
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

modified_model = ModifiedCNN()

try:
  modified_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("original_checkpoint.pth"))
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}") # This error will be triggered
```
As expected, the error will occur during the load attempt because the saved weights for `conv1` do not match the newly defined `conv1`. Specifically, the tensor saved had a shape suitable for 16 output channels, while the new one requires shapes appropriate for 32.

To address this, we can selectively load the weights of the matching layers:

```python
modified_model = ModifiedCNN()
loaded_state_dict = torch.load("original_checkpoint.pth")
model_state_dict = modified_model.state_dict()

#Filter out mismatched layers.
filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in loaded_state_dict.items() if k in model_state_dict and v.shape == model_state_dict[k].shape }
model_state_dict.update(filtered_dict) # Overwrite original model dict.
modified_model.load_state_dict(model_state_dict)

# Print the shape of the loaded weights.
print(f"Modified conv1 loaded shape: {modified_model.conv1.weight.shape}") #Shape of original conv1 weight is now loaded.
```

In this code, we've loaded the `original_checkpoint`, then compared its keys with those in the `modified_model`, along with shape matching of those keys. After this filtering process, we can use `model_state_dict.update` to overwrite only the shared keys with the loaded value. Here the updated model retains the previously trained `conv1` but will have randomly initialized `fc` layers. This method is useful when only specific layers have been changed or when reusing a base feature extraction model. This strategy prevents a crash but does not guarantee that the model will perform as intended after the modification, needing additional training or careful re-initialization of the modified layers.

Here’s a different scenario that highlights another technique. Suppose the `fc` layer was modified from `10` to `12` outputs:

```python
class ModifiedCNNv2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 32 * 32, 12) # Changed output from 10 to 12.

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x
        
modified_model_v2 = ModifiedCNNv2()

#Load everything except the fc layer and randomly intialize that.
state_dict = torch.load("original_checkpoint.pth")
state_dict.pop('fc.weight', None) # Remove incompatible weight tensor.
state_dict.pop('fc.bias', None) # Remove incompatible bias tensor.

modified_model_v2.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False) #strict = False ignores missing parameters.

print(f"Modified fc weight shape: {modified_model_v2.fc.weight.shape}") # Modified FC layer will be randomly initialized.
```
Here, we loaded all the compatible parameters, but explicitly removed the `fc` layer's parameters (both weights and biases) from the loaded dictionary using `pop` before passing them into the `modified_model_v2`. This ensures we can load other weights and the `fc` layer will be initialized using the default PyTorch initialization for the given layer definition, and `strict=False` ensures we are not raising an error due to the removed keys in the state dict.

These examples demonstrate that encountering such errors is not uncommon, and they can be effectively handled with a considered approach. The core of it lies in understanding the modifications, mapping appropriate layers, and initializing or adjusting the rest as needed. For more general information on PyTorch model loading, checkpointing practices and common caveats, one should consult resources provided by the PyTorch documentation team, as well as advanced model development tutorials. For insights into best practices when training models and the nuances of version control specific to machine learning, further exploration of literature on MLOps and model versioning is highly recommended. Investigating model serialization formats can also be quite beneficial.
