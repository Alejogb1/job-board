The core issue when gradients fail to propagate during distributed training with Ray and PyTorch lies in the detachment of tensors across process boundaries, specifically when using Ray's remote functions and actors. Autograd, PyTorch’s automatic differentiation engine, relies on a computational graph that tracks operations on tensors. If tensors are moved out of the process where they were originally created, the graph is effectively broken and backpropagation will not update weights in the manner one might expect.

When using Ray, model training often happens within remote functions or actors. These entities execute in separate Python processes managed by Ray's scheduler. When a model and its optimizer are instantiated within a main process and then passed to a remote function or actor, they’re effectively serialized, transmitted across process boundaries, and then deserialized within the remote process. The crucial point here is that each process has its own distinct memory space and, critically, its own autograd graph. When you calculate a loss inside a remote function, that loss and any intermediate tensors are part of that remote process’s autograd graph. Crucially, the original model located in the main process will be entirely unaware of these computations. The `loss.backward()` call, therefore, only operates on the tensors within the remote process's graph and not the original process where the optimizer is expected to update the model's weights.

Consider a simple, illustrative example. I've encountered this frequently when migrating local PyTorch training scripts to distributed setups using Ray. Imagine a basic training loop. First, the model and optimizer are created in the main script. Then, this model is transmitted to a remote function that does training. The remote function makes a prediction, computes a loss, and calls `backward()`. However, `optimizer.step()` will have no effect on the original model in the main process because the backpropagation operation happened in a completely distinct process. I have observed firsthand that even without specific errors being thrown, the network will simply not learn. This is because, in essence, the optimizer in your main process is not connected to the gradients calculated in the remote process.

Let me demonstrate three common scenarios, and how I’ve encountered these in past work. These examples highlight why simply placing training operations in a remote context breaks the backpropagation mechanism.

**Example 1: Incorrect Remote Training**

This example demonstrates the most common mistake where the training operation is entirely offloaded to Ray.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import ray

ray.init()

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

@ray.remote
def train_step(model, optimizer, data, labels):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = SimpleNet()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    labels = torch.randn(1, 1)

    # Incorrect usage: Training occurs remotely, but model update is lost
    trained_model = ray.get(train_step.remote(model, optimizer, data, labels))

    print("Weights after remote training (in main process):", list(model.parameters())[0].data)
    print("Weights of return trained model:", list(trained_model.parameters())[0].data)

    # Notice that weights of `model` are unchanged
```

In this first example, `train_step` executes remotely. The model and optimizer are sent to the remote function, and the loss is backpropagated there. However, the updated weights from that function are lost. The `trained_model` variable receives an updated copy, but the `model` in the main process remains unaffected. I've seen this cause extreme frustration when debugging seemingly correct scripts.

**Example 2:  Incorrect Use of Actors**

This shows a similar problem when using a Ray Actor which is persistent across training steps.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import ray

ray.init()

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

@ray.remote
class TrainerActor:
    def __init__(self, model, optimizer):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optimizer

    def train_step(self, data, labels):
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = self.model(data)
        loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = SimpleNet()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    labels = torch.randn(1, 1)

    trainer = TrainerActor.remote(model, optimizer)
    
    # Incorrect usage: The actor performs the training remotely but model in the main process is unaffected
    ray.get(trainer.train_step.remote(data, labels))

    print("Weights after remote training (in main process):", list(model.parameters())[0].data)

    # Actor's model's weights *have* been updated
    actor_model_state_dict = ray.get(ray.get(trainer.model.remote()).state_dict.remote())
    model.load_state_dict(actor_model_state_dict)

    print("Weights after retrieving state dict:", list(model.parameters())[0].data)
```

Here, we've created an actor to manage the model. While it appears more persistent, the core problem remains the same. The actor’s `train_step` method computes gradients in its own process. The original model and optimizer in the main process are not directly connected to these updates. Only after retrieving the model's state_dict can the main process receive an updated copy of the model and update its local copy using `load_state_dict`.

**Example 3: Correct Approach Using Gradient Aggregation**

This example provides a method for correctly updating a model using Ray.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import ray
from copy import deepcopy

ray.init()

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

@ray.remote
def compute_gradients(model_params, data, labels):
    model = SimpleNet()
    model.load_state_dict(model_params)
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    return [p.grad for p in model.parameters()]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = SimpleNet()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    labels = torch.randn(1, 1)

    num_workers = 2 # Use more in real applications
    for i in range(10):
        # Use multiple workers in a real distributed setting
       
       gradient_futures = [compute_gradients.remote(deepcopy(model.state_dict()), data, labels) for _ in range(num_workers)]
       gradients_list = ray.get(gradient_futures)
       
       aggregated_gradients = [torch.zeros_like(p) for p in model.parameters()]
       for gradients in gradients_list:
           for i, grad in enumerate(gradients):
               aggregated_gradients[i] += grad

       optimizer.zero_grad() # This is key to avoiding cumulative gradient
       for i, p in enumerate(model.parameters()):
          if p.grad is not None: # Avoid issues where some gradients are zero, e.g bias
            p.grad = aggregated_gradients[i] / num_workers # Average gradients
       optimizer.step() 

    print("Weights after proper gradient aggregation:", list(model.parameters())[0].data)
```

In this corrected example, the remote function only calculates the gradients. Crucially, the model itself remains in the main process. We first copy and load the original model parameters into the remote function to ensure we are working on the same model parameters. Then, after retrieving the computed gradients, we manually apply them to the model in the main process, after averaging them across all remote workers. This strategy maintains the critical linkage between the gradients calculated remotely and the optimizer in the main process. This solution, while requiring more code, correctly enables distributed training via Ray.

**Resource Recommendations**

To gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, I recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation and the Ray documentation on distributed training and remote function execution. Also reading resources about distributed model training patterns, such as parameter server approaches and gradient aggregation techniques, will prove invaluable. Consider studying examples provided in the Ray repository, paying close attention to data handling and model updates in the distributed contexts. Specifically, pay attention to code implementing data parallelism strategies.

In summary, the core issue is the separation of autograd graphs between Ray worker processes.  Directly training in a remote function breaks PyTorch's backpropagation. The solution requires careful orchestration of gradient computation and updates, often involving gradient aggregation in the main process.  Understanding these principles is critical for successfully implementing distributed PyTorch training with Ray.
