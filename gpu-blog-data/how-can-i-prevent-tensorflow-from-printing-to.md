TensorFlow's default behavior of logging verbose information, including warnings and device placement details, to standard error (stderr) can significantly clutter output, especially in automated environments or when running multiple models. I've encountered this issue numerous times while training models within containerized services, where clean logs are essential for monitoring and debugging. The core problem stems from TensorFlow's reliance on the Python logging module and its default configuration to direct certain log levels to stderr. Addressing this requires intercepting and reconfiguring these logging mechanisms.

The primary mechanism for controlling TensorFlow’s logging output is through the `tf.get_logger()` method, which retrieves the underlying logger instance used by TensorFlow. This logger, inherited from the standard Python `logging` module, allows customization of log levels and output destinations. By modifying this logger's settings, we can effectively suppress or redirect messages printed to stderr. The log levels, such as `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`, define the severity of the message. Messages with a severity lower than the set log level are filtered out. The default level often includes `INFO`, which explains why we see so much output. Additionally, the `logging` module utilizes 'handlers' to specify where output is directed – typically `StreamHandler` for printing to the console and `FileHandler` for writing to a file. We can manipulate these handlers or their formats to manage output.

Here’s an example of how to silence *most* of the noisy `INFO` logs from TensorFlow using the `tf.get_logger()` and setting the log level:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import logging

# Get the TensorFlow logger
tf_logger = tf.get_logger()

# Set the log level to WARNING to suppress INFO and DEBUG messages
tf_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# Your TensorFlow code here
tf.random.normal((2,2))
```
In this initial example, I obtain the logger instance using `tf.get_logger()`. I then utilize the `setLevel` method, setting the log level to `logging.WARNING`. Consequently, messages with log levels `INFO` and `DEBUG`, which are lower than `WARNING`, will be discarded. The TensorFlow code, `tf.random.normal((2,2))`, will execute without its accompanying informational messages printed to the console. Note that setting the log level won't eliminate all stderr output; `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` messages will still be displayed. This will also not prevent logs from other libraries that are routed directly through Python's `logging` module unless they are changed individually.

For a more comprehensive control, including redirection to a file or the null device, we can directly manipulate the logging handlers. This approach gives more flexibility when compared to simply changing the log level. For instance, we can suppress all console output, including those from other parts of the code that may use the Python logging system as well.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import logging
import os

# Get the TensorFlow logger
tf_logger = tf.get_logger()

# Remove existing handlers
for handler in tf_logger.handlers:
    tf_logger.removeHandler(handler)


# Create a NullHandler that discards all logs
null_handler = logging.NullHandler()
tf_logger.addHandler(null_handler)


# Your TensorFlow code here
tf.random.normal((2,2))

logging.info("this will not be displayed either")
```

In this second example, after obtaining the TensorFlow logger, I iterate through the existing handlers, removing each one using `removeHandler`. This clears any existing console output stream or file output setup done elsewhere. Subsequently, a `NullHandler` is instantiated and added to the logger’s handlers using the `addHandler` method. `NullHandler` is part of Python’s standard logging module and, as the name implies, discards all log messages. This effectively silences all logging events associated with the TensorFlow logger, and anything else that uses the same logging instance. The `logging.info` message at the end demonstrates the global suppression that has been implemented, where the output from other parts of the code that are using Python’s `logging` library is also suppressed. This is more powerful than setting a log level, as it prevents any message from reaching the stderr. Be aware that this can make debugging harder, so a file log may be better.

Finally, for scenarios requiring logging to a file instead of stderr, I modify the handler to be a `FileHandler`. This is particularly valuable in server environments, where it’s better to store logs to disk for later analysis, rather than print to a console. Here's how to redirect all TensorFlow logs to a file:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import logging

# Get the TensorFlow logger
tf_logger = tf.get_logger()

# Remove existing handlers
for handler in tf_logger.handlers:
    tf_logger.removeHandler(handler)


# Create a FileHandler for logging to a file
file_handler = logging.FileHandler("tensorflow_log.txt", mode="w") #overwrite if it exists.
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the FileHandler to the logger
tf_logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Set the log level as appropriate.
tf_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Your TensorFlow code here
tf.random.normal((2,2))
logging.info("testing")
```

In this third code example, after clearing the default handlers, I initialize a `FileHandler`, specifying "tensorflow\_log.txt" as the output file. The mode of "w" ensures any existing log file is overwritten with each run; you might need to change this in production systems, or use a logging rotation strategy. The `Formatter` sets the desired format for each logged event, and is attached to the `FileHandler` using `setFormatter`. The file handler is then added to the TensorFlow logger using `addHandler`. Finally, I set the log level to `INFO`, allowing all `INFO` and above to be written to the output file. Note that setting the log level is important when logging to a file. The `logging.info` method can be used in your code to output log information to your designated output log file.

In summary, suppressing TensorFlow's stderr output is achieved through manipulating the logger instance retrieved by `tf.get_logger()`. The most common solutions include setting the log level to `WARNING` or higher or removing existing handlers and replacing them with either a `NullHandler` to discard all logging output or a `FileHandler` to redirect output to a file. These strategies provide the necessary granularity for managing TensorFlow's logging behavior. It is crucial to remember that TensorFlow uses Python’s standard `logging` package, so the patterns that would normally apply in a Python logging context also apply when modifying TensorFlow’s log output.

For supplementary resources, I recommend exploring the official Python documentation on the `logging` module, which provides comprehensive details on log levels, handlers, and formatters. Consult the TensorFlow documentation related to `tf.get_logger()` for specific information about using the logger within TensorFlow. And I suggest studying software engineering texts that deal with log management and best practices, to build up a good understanding of effective logging design. These sources offer a more complete understanding of logging principles and implementation within Python and TensorFlow.
