TensorFlow's deep integration of Keras, even when a standalone Keras installation exists, stems from its function as the officially supported high-level API within the TensorFlow ecosystem, offering enhanced performance through optimized backend execution, better integration with TensorFlow features like distributed training, and a specific namespace design. This results in the recommendation to use `tf.keras` over independent Keras installations, and that recommendation's prominence.

The core distinction lies not in a conflict of installations, but in how Keras is treated within TensorFlow's overall architecture. Independent Keras, usually installed via `pip install keras`, utilizes one of several available backends (TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK) to perform its numerical computations. While this architecture provides flexibility and backend swapping potential, it introduces abstraction overhead and may not always leverage the full capabilities of each backend. In my experience building complex recurrent neural networks, switching backends was infrequent, and often less critical than direct optimization for a specific platform.

TensorFlow's `tf.keras`, on the other hand, is built directly into TensorFlow, compiled with its core functionalities. This direct integration allows for a more seamless and performant execution. Operations defined in `tf.keras` leverage TensorFlow's graph execution capabilities, potentially achieving faster runtime and enabling access to features such as TensorFlow's robust support for multi-GPU and distributed training. Furthermore, development cycles tend to align more closely, meaning that `tf.keras` is often the first to benefit from improvements or new functionalities released with TensorFlow updates. While independent Keras might eventually include similar features, the update cycles do not always coincide. Therefore, the choice isn’t about which “Keras” is better, but rather which implementation provides the best integration within the TensorFlow framework.

The highlighting of `tf.keras` also stems from avoiding inconsistencies in user code. When multiple installations exist, especially when version mismatches occur, it often leads to obscure bugs and debugging challenges. I experienced this first hand when building a computer vision model across different environments, and the subtle differences between installed versions severely complicated debugging. Using `tf.keras` provides a single, clearly defined implementation of Keras within the TensorFlow environment, eliminating the ambiguity of which Keras installation is in use. This also simplifies dependency management; if a project uses `tf.keras`, it naturally requires TensorFlow, a well-defined dependency. Conversely, independent Keras requires an explicit dependency on *both* Keras and a specified backend, leading to more complex setups. This simplification is crucial when developing and deploying models, ensuring consistency across platforms and reducing unforeseen issues related to versioning or backend conflicts.

Here are a few practical code examples illustrating this:

**Example 1: Basic Model Definition**

```python
# Using standalone Keras
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

independent_model = Sequential()
independent_model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
independent_model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Using tf.keras
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

tf_model = Sequential()
tf_model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
tf_model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# The core functionality is identical, but the import statements differ.
# Note: The independent Keras version requires setting a backend previously, 
# which is abstracted in the tf.keras case.
```

In this example, both approaches achieve identical functionality – building a simple neural network. However, the import statements reveal the distinction. The independent Keras version pulls directly from the `keras` package, whereas the `tf.keras` version is nested under the `tensorflow` namespace. Importantly, the `independent_model` relies on an underlying backend like TensorFlow to function, while `tf_model` automatically benefits from the deep integration with TensorFlow's execution capabilities.

**Example 2: Using TensorFlow-Specific Operations**

```python
# Using tf.keras with TensorFlow specific ops
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

tf_model_with_ops = Sequential()
tf_model_with_ops.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
tf_model_with_ops.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))


loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy() # Using a specific TF loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam() # Using a specific TF Optimizer

# independent Keras will not have access to these directly in the model building 
# without explicit backend configuration.
```

This example demonstrates the advantage of leveraging `tf.keras` with access to TensorFlow-specific operations. In many of my projects, I found myself relying more and more on the custom losses, metrics, and optimizers provided within TensorFlow. While an independent Keras installation can access these through a backend, the integration with `tf.keras` makes the access cleaner and more consistent. Using these directly, without additional backend concerns, simplifies development and ensures the execution is tailored to TensorFlow's optimized environment.

**Example 3: Subclassing Model for Custom Logic**

```python
# Using tf.keras for custom model subclassing
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import Model

class CustomModel(Model):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        return self.dense2(x)

custom_model = CustomModel(units=64)


#Independent Keras requires a slightly different syntax when subclassing.
```

This example showcases the flexibility provided by `tf.keras` when subclassing the Model class to implement custom logic. In my experience working with complex sequential models, subclassing provides a cleaner and more understandable way of defining layers and operations. Although independent Keras provides similar capabilities, the specific integration with TensorFlow's `Model` class offers better consistency and access to TensorFlow's functionality. This also means that model parameters and gradient calculations are automatically handled with TensorFlow's efficient graph execution. When working with highly customized or experimental models, this degree of control was essential to achieving desired results.

In summary, the recommendation to use `tf.keras` over a standalone Keras installation arises from its improved integration with the TensorFlow backend, more efficient execution due to its closer coupling with TensorFlow’s core, the elimination of potential conflicts in installations and dependencies, and seamless access to TensorFlow-specific features. While both are conceptually similar, the choice between the two depends largely on your development requirements. For anyone invested in TensorFlow's ecosystem, `tf.keras` is the clearly advantageous approach.

For further reading and resources: I highly recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the guides on Keras. The 'TensorFlow in Practice' series, often found in introductory Machine Learning publications, also provides excellent context. Finally, consulting a good textbook on Deep Learning, which uses TensorFlow, can provide insight into the rational behind `tf.keras`' design choices.
