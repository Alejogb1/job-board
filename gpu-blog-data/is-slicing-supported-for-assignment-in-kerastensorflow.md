Direct assignment via slicing within Keras/Tensorflow tensors is not directly supported in the same manner as with standard NumPy arrays.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models highlighted this limitation repeatedly. While you can access tensor elements using slicing, modifying the tensor *in-place* through this sliced view generally doesn't update the original tensor's underlying data.  This behavior stems from the frameworks' reliance on computational graphs and automatic differentiation.  Attempts at direct slice assignment often lead to unexpected behavior or errors, necessitating alternative approaches.

**1.  Explanation of the Underlying Mechanism:**

TensorFlow and Keras manage tensors differently from NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays reside directly in memory, allowing direct modification through slicing.  TensorFlow and Keras, however, often represent tensors as nodes within a computational graph. These nodes represent operations, not just data.  When you slice a TensorFlow/Keras tensor, you're not accessing the raw data directly but creating a new node in the graph representing the *slicing operation* applied to the original tensor.  Assigning values to this sliced view doesn't modify the original node; instead, it creates *another* node representing the assignment operation.  The result remains disconnected from the original tensor unless explicitly integrated back into the graph.  This behavior is crucial for maintaining the ability to track gradients during backpropagation, the core of many deep learning optimization algorithms.  Direct in-place modification would disrupt this crucial tracking mechanism.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the distinction between NumPy array slicing and TensorFlow/Keras tensor slicing, emphasizing the crucial differences in assignment behavior.

**Example 1: NumPy Array Slicing and Assignment:**

```python
import numpy as np

numpy_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
sliced_array = numpy_array[0, :]  # Slice the first row
sliced_array[0] = 10  # Modify the sliced array

print("Original array:\n", numpy_array)
# Output: Original array:
# [[10  2  3]
#  [ 4  5  6]]

print("Sliced array:\n", sliced_array)
# Output: Sliced array:
# [10  2  3]
```
In NumPy, the assignment directly modifies the original array.  This is because NumPy arrays are mutable and the slice creates a *view*, not a copy, of the underlying data.

**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras Tensor Slicing (Incorrect Attempt):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
sliced_tensor = tf_tensor[0, :]
sliced_tensor[0].assign(10) #Attempt at in-place modification

print("Original tensor:\n", tf_tensor.numpy())
# Output: Original tensor:
# [[1 2 3]
# [4 5 6]]

print("Sliced tensor:\n", sliced_tensor.numpy())
# Output: Sliced tensor:
# [1 2 3]
```
This attempt at in-place modification fails.  `assign` is not applicable for direct modification to a slice and is more commonly used to assign values to a specific variable in TensorFlow. The original tensor remains unchanged.

**Example 3: Correct Approach using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0]]) # index to modify: row 0, column 0
updates = tf.constant([10]) # Value to assign

updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tf_tensor, indices, updates)

print("Original tensor:\n", tf_tensor.numpy())
# Output: Original tensor:
# [[1 2 3]
# [4 5 6]]

print("Updated tensor:\n", updated_tensor.numpy())
# Output: Updated tensor:
# [[10  2  3]
#  [ 4  5  6]]
```
This example demonstrates a correct method for modifying a specific element within a TensorFlow tensor.  `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` allows targeted updates by specifying the indices and the corresponding values.  This approach is much more efficient than creating a completely new tensor with modified values, especially for large tensors.  This method is fundamentally different from direct slicing assignment.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation and the specifics of tensor updates. Thoroughly studying the differences between TensorFlow's tensor operations and those of NumPy will significantly improve understanding.  Further exploration of the TensorFlow API, including functions like `tf.concat`, `tf.stack`, and `tf.reshape`, provides a comprehensive toolset for tensor manipulation avoiding the pitfalls of direct slice assignments.  Finally, reviewing resources on computational graphs and automatic differentiation in the context of deep learning frameworks will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons for this behavior.  These resources will provide comprehensive context beyond the scope of this specific issue.
