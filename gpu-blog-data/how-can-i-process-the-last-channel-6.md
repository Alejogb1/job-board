A frequent challenge in convolutional neural network programming, especially when dealing with multi-channel image data or time-series information, is isolating and processing specific channels within a tensor. In this case, the input tensor has dimensions representing, potentially, a batch of 100 samples, each being a 24x24 spatial representation with 6 feature channels. Accessing and manipulating the final channel, channel number 6 (indexed as 5), necessitates precise indexing operations.

The most direct method is to leverage slicing functionality offered by numerical computing libraries like NumPy or tensor libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow. These libraries enable selecting specific portions of an array or tensor, which allows us to extract channel number 5 from the data. Slicing in Python operates based on the start, stop, and step indices within each dimension.

Here’s a practical breakdown: if our input tensor, which I'll refer to as `input_tensor`, has a shape of (100, 24, 24, 6), then the last dimension corresponds to the channels. To extract the final channel, we target index 5 within this last dimension while keeping all other dimensions intact.

**Code Example 1: Extracting the Last Channel in NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume input_tensor represents the 100x24x24x6 array
input_tensor = np.random.rand(100, 24, 24, 6)

# Extract the last channel (index 5)
last_channel = input_tensor[:, :, :, 5]

# Verify shape of the extracted channel
print(f"Shape of original tensor: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Shape of last channel: {last_channel.shape}")

# Display the first few elements of the extracted channel
print("\nFirst few elements of the extracted channel:")
print(last_channel[0, :2, :2])
```
This code snippet utilizes NumPy’s array indexing mechanism to extract the last channel. The slice `[:, :, :, 5]` instructs NumPy to select all elements along the first three dimensions (batch size, height, and width) and only elements with index 5 along the fourth dimension (the channel dimension). The output shows that the `last_channel` now has dimensions (100, 24, 24), demonstrating the successful extraction of a single channel. Printing a subset of `last_channel` provides an element-level confirmation.

**Code Example 2: Extracting the Last Channel in PyTorch**

```python
import torch

# Assume input_tensor represents the 100x24x24x6 tensor
input_tensor = torch.rand(100, 24, 24, 6)

# Extract the last channel (index 5)
last_channel = input_tensor[:, :, :, 5]

# Verify shape of the extracted channel
print(f"Shape of original tensor: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Shape of last channel: {last_channel.shape}")

# Display the first few elements of the extracted channel
print("\nFirst few elements of the extracted channel:")
print(last_channel[0, :2, :2])
```

The PyTorch example replicates the NumPy functionality. PyTorch tensors offer the same slicing syntax, making the operation highly transferable. The output confirms that a PyTorch tensor of shape (100, 24, 24) was created from the original tensor, again showcasing effective last-channel extraction. Just like with NumPy, displaying a small subset of the values confirms the extraction is not an empty tensor.

**Code Example 3:  Processing the Last Channel in TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor represents the 100x24x24x6 tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 24, 24, 6))

# Extract the last channel (index 5)
last_channel = input_tensor[:, :, :, 5]

# Verify shape of the extracted channel
print(f"Shape of original tensor: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Shape of last channel: {last_channel.shape}")

# Display the first few elements of the extracted channel
print("\nFirst few elements of the extracted channel:")
print(last_channel[0, :2, :2].numpy())
```

The TensorFlow implementation is identical in syntax. The use of `tf.random.normal` initializes the data with normal values. The key difference here is the need to convert the TensorFlow EagerTensor to a NumPy array using `.numpy()` to display numerical values directly. This output further supports the method's validity in TensorFlow.

Upon acquiring the last channel, subsequent operations can be performed using that selected slice, while leaving the original tensor untouched. These may include filtering, transformations, statistical analysis, or other further processing which requires a single channel.

There are several advantages to slicing: efficiency, ease of use, and direct integration into various deep learning frameworks. The memory footprint remains low as no copies are made until operations modify the extracted tensor itself. In contrast, manually iterating through each item or using complex nested looping would be highly inefficient, and significantly more difficult to implement.

It is also worth noting that indexing can be performed from the end by using the negative indices. Therefore, `input_tensor[:, :, :, -1]` would also target the last channel without explicitly knowing that its index is 5, and will behave identically to `input_tensor[:, :, :, 5]` in this case. While this method is more robust if the tensor’s number of channels changes, I personally prefer the former as it makes the process more clear for fellow programmers. However, both methods are equally valid and I would always be wary of any assumption that the last channel is always the 6th channel.

When it comes to learning more about these core operations, the official documentation for each library (NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) is invaluable. In addition to the documentation for the core numerical libraries, I’d also recommend that you take a look at introductory tutorials for image processing and deep learning using those frameworks. They offer practical examples that go beyond single channel extraction and that will help you contextualize the utility of these operations. Finally, for a more in-depth understanding of the mathematical foundations of tensors and indexing operations, you could refer to textbooks on linear algebra and tensor calculus. These resources will improve your theoretical knowledge as well as expand your knowledge on practical usage.
