Retrieving a batch of embeddings using `tf.nn.raw_rnn` requires a specific understanding of its input/output behavior, particularly when integrating with embedding lookups. The challenge is less about `raw_rnn` itself and more about appropriately preparing the sequence data and handling the output before it reaches the recurrent cells. I've frequently encountered this while working on sequence-to-sequence models for NLP tasks and learned a methodical approach to ensure data is correctly shaped and used within the RNN structure.

The core issue stems from the fact that `raw_rnn` operates on a sequence of timesteps, not on a collection of direct input vectors suitable for direct embedding lookups within its execution flow. Therefore, we must manage the embedding retrieval *before* supplying data to the `raw_rnn` function. We need to pre-process the input integer indices for the embedding matrix, converting them to the corresponding embeddings before entering the RNN, and then carefully extract the embedded output sequence from the overall RNN output.

Let's break down the steps, starting with preparing the inputs. Assume we have a batch of sequences, represented as a tensor of shape `[BATCH, SEQ_LEN]` where the values are integer indices pointing to rows in an embedding matrix of shape `[VOCAB_SIZE, EMBED_DIM]`. `raw_rnn` doesn’t handle the embedding lookup directly. This is a fundamental difference from simpler recurrent APIs.

**Step 1: Embedding Lookup**
We utilize `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` to transform the integer sequences into a sequence of dense embeddings. This process generates a tensor of shape `[BATCH, SEQ_LEN, EMBED_DIM]`. We perform this *before* calling `raw_rnn`. This transforms the data to a form that the RNN can consume as the sequence of feature vectors.

**Step 2: Constructing the RNN Cell and Initial State**
Next, we define the recurrent cell using `tf.nn.rnn_cell` and the initial state for each sequence in our batch. The `initial_state` is often a tensor of zeros, which has the same `dtype` as that used by our embedding layer, and a shape which is defined by the cell.  For example, for a `LSTMCell` there is a tuple of tensors, and for a `GRUCell` a single tensor.

**Step 3: Data Handling for `raw_rnn`**
`raw_rnn` takes a `time_major=True` or `time_major=False` argument. For simplicity here, we’ll use `time_major=False`. This means that our input tensor to the `raw_rnn` should have a shape of `[BATCH, SEQ_LEN, EMBED_DIM]` as computed in Step 1. We can then generate our sequence of cells, and then use this as input to `raw_rnn`.  We also need to prepare sequence length, a tensor of size `[BATCH]`, indicating the actual length of each sequence in the batch, which may vary. We should ensure `sequence_length` is of type `tf.int32` and does not use padding. We’ll want to mask out any values beyond a sequence's length when computing the loss later, which is common practice.

**Step 4: Extracting the Output**

`raw_rnn` returns a named tuple called `outputs` and another called `final_state`. The `outputs` object is of type `TensorArray` when using `time_major=False`, it needs to be converted into a tensor using `.stack()`, and it will have the shape `[BATCH, SEQ_LEN, HIDDEN_SIZE]`, if the state size of the rnn cells is equal to the hidden size. The `final_state` captures the final state of the recurrent cells after the entire sequence has been processed, and its exact structure depends on the chosen RNN cell. This is important for tasks such as sequence-to-sequence generation where this final state becomes the initial state of the decoder RNN.

Now, let’s illustrate this with some code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Embedding Retrieval with GRU Cell**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def embedding_lookup_and_raw_rnn_gru(
    input_indices, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_size, seq_lengths):
    """
    Retrieves embeddings and applies raw_rnn with a GRU cell.

    Args:
    input_indices: Tensor of shape [BATCH, SEQ_LEN] representing sequence of word IDs.
    vocab_size: Integer, the vocabulary size.
    embed_dim: Integer, the embedding dimension.
    hidden_size: Integer, the number of hidden units in the GRU.
    seq_lengths: Tensor of shape [BATCH], sequence length of each input.

    Returns:
    output: Tensor of shape [BATCH, SEQ_LEN, HIDDEN_SIZE], the RNN outputs.
    final_state: Tensor of shape [BATCH, HIDDEN_SIZE], final state.
    """

    embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embed_dim]))
    embedded_inputs = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, input_indices)

    cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(hidden_size)
    initial_state = cell.zero_state(
        batch_size=tf.shape(input_indices)[0], dtype=tf.float32)


    outputs, final_state = tf.nn.raw_rnn(
        cell,
        embedded_inputs,
        initial_state,
        sequence_length=seq_lengths,
        time_major=False
    )


    return outputs.stack(), final_state
    

# Example usage:
input_indices = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 0], [4, 5, 0, 0]], dtype=tf.int32) #Batch size 2, seq_len 4
vocab_size = 10
embed_dim = 6
hidden_size = 8
seq_lengths = tf.constant([3, 2], dtype=tf.int32)

output, final_state = embedding_lookup_and_raw_rnn_gru(
    input_indices, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_size, seq_lengths)
print(f"RNN output shape: {output.shape}")  # Expected: (2, 4, 8)
print(f"RNN final state shape: {final_state.shape}")  #Expected: (2, 8)
```

This first example shows a basic use case. The critical step is the pre-processing via the embedding lookup, preparing the input before the RNN. Note that zero paddings are handled appropriately.

**Example 2: LSTM Cell with Initial States and Multiple Layers**
Building on the previous example, we will now use an LSTM cell with custom initial states and create a multilayer RNN, while using a more explicit state and output shape handling.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def embedding_lookup_and_raw_rnn_lstm(
    input_indices, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_size, num_layers, seq_lengths):
    """
    Retrieves embeddings and applies multi-layer raw_rnn with a LSTM cell.

    Args:
        input_indices: Tensor of shape [BATCH, SEQ_LEN]
        vocab_size: Integer, the vocabulary size.
        embed_dim: Integer, the embedding dimension.
        hidden_size: Integer, the number of hidden units in each LSTM layer.
        num_layers: Integer, number of stacked LSTM cells.
        seq_lengths: Tensor of shape [BATCH], sequence length of each input.

    Returns:
        output: Tensor of shape [BATCH, SEQ_LEN, HIDDEN_SIZE], the RNN outputs.
        final_state:  Tuple of LSTMStateTuple, shape is (num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size) * 2.
    """
    embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embed_dim]))
    embedded_inputs = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, input_indices)

    cells = [tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(hidden_size) for _ in range(num_layers)]
    multi_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell(cells)

    batch_size = tf.shape(input_indices)[0]
    initial_state = multi_cell.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)
    outputs, final_state = tf.nn.raw_rnn(
        multi_cell,
        embedded_inputs,
        initial_state,
        sequence_length=seq_lengths,
        time_major=False
    )

    return outputs.stack(), final_state

# Example usage:
input_indices = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 0], [4, 5, 0, 0]], dtype=tf.int32)
vocab_size = 10
embed_dim = 6
hidden_size = 8
num_layers = 2
seq_lengths = tf.constant([3, 2], dtype=tf.int32)

output, final_state = embedding_lookup_and_raw_rnn_lstm(
    input_indices, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_size, num_layers, seq_lengths)
print(f"RNN output shape: {output.shape}") # Expected (2, 4, 8)
print(f"RNN final state shape: {len(final_state), len(final_state[0]), final_state[0][0].shape}") # Expected (2, 2, TensorShape([2, 8]))
```
This demonstrates the use of a multilayer LSTM, highlighting the structure of the returned final state and the shape of the generated output tensor. Note, we use `MultiRNNCell` to chain together multiple layers.

**Example 3: Handling Variable Sequence Lengths**
This final example shows how `raw_rnn` uses the `sequence_length` argument to handle variable length sequences, which is a common requirement in NLP applications.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def embedding_lookup_and_raw_rnn_variable_lengths(
    input_indices, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_size, seq_lengths):
    """
    Retrieves embeddings and applies raw_rnn with variable length sequences.

    Args:
        input_indices: Tensor of shape [BATCH, SEQ_LEN]
        vocab_size: Integer, the vocabulary size.
        embed_dim: Integer, the embedding dimension.
        hidden_size: Integer, the number of hidden units in the GRU.
        seq_lengths: Tensor of shape [BATCH], sequence length of each input.

    Returns:
        output: Tensor of shape [BATCH, SEQ_LEN, HIDDEN_SIZE], the RNN outputs.
        final_state: Tensor of shape [BATCH, HIDDEN_SIZE], final state.
    """
    embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embed_dim]))
    embedded_inputs = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, input_indices)

    cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(hidden_size)
    initial_state = cell.zero_state(
        batch_size=tf.shape(input_indices)[0], dtype=tf.float32)

    outputs, final_state = tf.nn.raw_rnn(
        cell,
        embedded_inputs,
        initial_state,
        sequence_length=seq_lengths,
        time_major=False
    )
    return outputs.stack(), final_state


# Example usage:
input_indices = tf.constant(
    [[1, 2, 3, 0, 0], [4, 5, 6, 7, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=tf.int32)
vocab_size = 10
embed_dim = 6
hidden_size = 8
seq_lengths = tf.constant([3, 4, 1], dtype=tf.int32)

output, final_state = embedding_lookup_and_raw_rnn_variable_lengths(
    input_indices, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_size, seq_lengths)

print(f"RNN output shape: {output.shape}") # Expected (3, 5, 8)
print(f"RNN final state shape: {final_state.shape}") # Expected (3, 8)
```

The key here is how `sequence_length` is used internally. The RNN will process each input vector until its associated sequence length is exhausted; after that, the cell state remains unchanged, which ensures we do not corrupt our computations.

**Resources for further study**

For a more detailed understanding of TensorFlow's RNN implementations, I would suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.nn.raw_rnn`,  `tf.nn.embedding_lookup`, and the various cell types within `tf.nn.rnn_cell`, such as `LSTMCell`, and `GRUCell`.  In addition, exploring comprehensive tutorials on sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation or text summarization provides valuable practical insights into how these components are used within full applications. Finally, studying research papers that introduce various recurrent neural networks is also quite helpful for deeply understanding how to leverage these APIs.
