The `geom_signif()` function within the `ggpubr` package in R frequently encounters computational issues, particularly when dealing with datasets containing many groups or significant data sparsity.  My experience debugging similar issues stems from several projects involving complex ANOVA analyses and post-hoc comparisons visualized via ggplot2. The root cause of "Computation failed" warnings and inaccurate legends usually lies in the internal calculations performed by the function, specifically its reliance on p-value adjustments and the underlying statistical test employed.  This often manifests when the data lacks sufficient variance within groups or when the chosen p-value adjustment method is inappropriate for the data structure.


**1.  Explanation of the Error and Potential Causes:**

`geom_signif()` simplifies the process of adding significance labels (typically p-values) to grouped bar plots or similar visualizations. It takes as input the results of a statistical test, usually a comparison of means (like an ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD or other post-hoc tests). The function then determines which group comparisons are statistically significant based on a specified significance level (usually 0.05).  It subsequently generates labels indicating significant differences above the bars in the plot.

The "Computation failed" warning originates from the underlying statistical computations, frequently related to the chosen method for correcting p-values for multiple comparisons.  For example, using the Bonferroni correction with a large number of comparisons can lead to overly conservative adjustments, resulting in extremely small adjusted p-values that are computationally challenging to handle.  In such cases, the function might encounter numerical instability and fail to produce accurate results, hence the error.

Another common culprit is insufficient data within groups. If several groups have very few data points, variance estimates can be unstable, leading to unreliable p-values and subsequent computational issues within `geom_signif()`. This applies particularly to methods that rely on variance estimates for testing.

Finally, incorrect specification of the test or comparison method can also yield this error. If the data violate the assumptions of the statistical test being used (for instance, normality and homogeneity of variance in ANOVA), the results might be unreliable, leading to errors in `geom_signif()`.  The legend inaccuracies are often a downstream effect of these underlying computational problems.  An incorrect test could lead to misinterpretation of significant differences, reflected incorrectly in the legend.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Insufficient Data and Bonferroni Correction**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Data with insufficient data points in some groups
data <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(rep(LETTERS[1:5], each = 2)),
  Value = c(10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 11, 13, 17, 19, NA)
)

# Attempting to use geom_signif with Bonferroni correction
ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Value, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("A", "B"), c("C", "D"), c("E", "A")),
              test = "t.test",  p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

#Result: Likely to produce "Computation failed" due to insufficient data, particularly with the NA value, and Bonferroni's conservative nature.
```

This example showcases the issue of limited data and the potential problem caused by the Bonferroni correction which becomes overly stringent with few data points, leading to computational problems and possibly inaccurate p-value assessments. The inclusion of `NA` exacerbates the problem.


**Example 2:  Large Number of Groups and the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure:**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Simulate data with many groups
set.seed(123)
data2 <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(paste0("Group", 1:20)),
  Value = rnorm(20*10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
)

# Attempting to use geom_signif with many comparisons
ggplot(data2, aes(x = Group, y = Value, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = combn(levels(data2$Group), 2, simplify = FALSE),
              test = "t.test", p.adjust.method = "BH")

#Result: Potential "Computation failed" due to the large number of pairwise comparisons, even if using a less conservative method such as Benjamini-Hochberg.  Legend might be incomplete or inaccurate.
```

This illustration demonstrates the problem of a high number of group comparisons. Even with a less stringent method such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, the sheer number of comparisons could strain the computation.  The legend may become cluttered or contain errors depending on the exact nature of the computation failures.


**Example 3:  Data Violation of Test Assumptions:**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

#Data that severely violates the assumption of normality for t-tests

data3 <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10)),
  Value = c(rgamma(10,shape=1, scale=10), rgamma(10,shape=1, scale=2))
)


ggplot(data3, aes(x = Group, y = Value, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("A", "B")), test = "t.test")

# Result: The t-test will be unreliable because of non-normality.  `geom_signif()` will output p-values, but they won’t be accurate, and this could lead to an inaccurate legend reflecting a false positive or negative.
```

Here, the data demonstrably violates the assumptions of a t-test – its skewed distribution makes the t-test inappropriate.   While the code will run, the resulting p-value and consequently the legend will be misleading. A non-parametric alternative, such as the Wilcoxon test, would be more appropriate.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The `ggpubr` package documentation.  A thorough understanding of statistical testing principles, specifically focusing on multiple comparisons adjustments and the assumptions of various statistical tests.  Consult a statistical textbook focusing on ANOVA and post-hoc tests for a detailed explanation of appropriate methodology for multiple comparisons.  R documentation on the `stats` package which underpins many of the statistical tests used within `ggpubr`.  Finally, consult a text focusing on data visualization best practices for communicating statistical significance effectively.
