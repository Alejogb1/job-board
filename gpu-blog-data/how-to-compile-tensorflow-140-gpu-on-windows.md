TensorFlow 1.4.0's GPU support on Windows 10 x64 necessitates a meticulous approach due to its reliance on specific CUDA and cuDNN versions.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, specifically those involving deep learning frameworks on Windows, reveals that incompatibility issues frequently stem from mismatched dependencies.  Successfully compiling this version hinges on precisely matching these dependencies with your hardware and driver configurations.  A failure to do so will likely result in compilation errors or runtime exceptions related to CUDA kernel launches.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The compilation process involves several steps: acquiring the necessary prerequisites (CUDA toolkit, cuDNN library, Visual Studio), configuring the build environment (setting environment variables), and invoking the TensorFlow build script.  Crucially, the versions of CUDA and cuDNN are tightly coupled to the TensorFlow version. TensorFlow 1.4.0 requires a specific CUDA toolkit version and a matching cuDNN version.  Using incompatible versions will almost certainly lead to build failures.  Identifying the correct versions is the first and often most challenging step.  I've personally spent considerable time troubleshooting build failures stemming from incorrect versioning, specifically in projects requiring compatibility with legacy hardware.

Prior to starting, verify your NVIDIA driver version is up-to-date and compatible with your GPU.  Outdated drivers can introduce unexpected errors during the compilation process.  Confirm CUDA support for your specific GPU model by consulting NVIDIA's documentation.  Failure to do this is a frequent source of errors I've encountered, often leading to cryptic error messages during the compilation phase.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate key aspects of the compilation process.  Remember to replace placeholders like `<CUDA_PATH>`, `<CUDNN_PATH>`, and `<PYTHON_PATH>` with your actual paths.

**Example 1: Setting Environment Variables (Batch Script):**

```batch
@echo off
setx CUDA_PATH "<CUDA_PATH>"
setx CUDNN_PATH "<CUDNN_PATH>"
setx PYTHON_PATH "<PYTHON_PATH>"
setx PATH "%PATH%;<CUDA_PATH>\bin;%CUDA_PATH>\lib\x64;%CUDNN_PATH>\bin"
echo Environment variables set.
pause
```

This batch script sets crucial environment variables.  The `setx` command permanently sets these variables, ensuring they're accessible across different command prompts.  The `PATH` variable is updated to include the CUDA and cuDNN directories, making the necessary libraries and binaries available to the compiler.  Correctly setting these variables is fundamental to prevent errors related to missing libraries. I frequently see newcomers omit this step, leading to unresolved symbol errors during linking.

**Example 2:  Building TensorFlow from Source (using Bazel):**

```bash
cd <tensorflow_source_directory>
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```

This command uses Bazel, TensorFlow's build system. The `--config=opt` flag optimizes the build for performance, while `--config=cuda` enables GPU support.  The target `//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package` builds the necessary files for creating a pip installable package.  The success of this step depends heavily on the correctly configured environment variables from Example 1.  A common mistake I've observed is not using the correct build configuration flags, leading to a build that lacks GPU support.

**Example 3:  Installing the Compiled Package:**

```bash
cd <tensorflow_source_directory>/bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package
pip install *.whl
```

After a successful build, this command installs the generated TensorFlow wheel file (`*.whl`) using pip. This installs the compiled TensorFlow library into your Python environment, making it ready for use.  Any issues in this phase are usually related to previous errors during compilation or conflicting Python package installations. I often see conflicting versions of numpy and other dependencies causing failures during this final step.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation:  Provides detailed instructions and troubleshooting guides.
*   The NVIDIA CUDA toolkit documentation:  Essential for understanding CUDA configuration and compatibility.
*   The NVIDIA cuDNN library documentation:  Crucial for setting up cuDNN correctly.
*   The Bazel documentation:  Necessary for understanding how to use TensorFlow's build system effectively.
*   A comprehensive guide on setting up a Windows development environment for C++ projects:  Understanding Windows development practices aids in troubleshooting potential issues with dependencies and environment variables.


In conclusion, successfully compiling TensorFlow 1.4.0 with GPU support on Windows 10 x64 requires attention to detail.  Precisely matching CUDA and cuDNN versions with the TensorFlow version, correctly setting environment variables, and utilizing Bazel properly are paramount.  Understanding the underlying build process and potential points of failure is crucial for effective troubleshooting.  The common errors I've observed relate primarily to version mismatches and improperly configured environment variables.  Thorough verification of each step and a methodical approach are essential to avoid complications and ensure a successful compilation.
