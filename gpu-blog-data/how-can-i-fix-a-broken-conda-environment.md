The root of the issue with a broken conda environment after PyTorch installation on an M1 Mac, specifically manifesting as an Intel MKL error, typically stems from architecture mismatches within the dependencies. The ARM64 architecture of Apple Silicon processors necessitates libraries compiled specifically for it, whereas many default packages, particularly those involving numerical computations like those in PyTorch, initially favored Intel's x86-64 architecture. This conflict, if not handled correctly during the installation process, results in the dreaded MKL error, indicating an attempt to load Intel-specific code on an incompatible chip.

My experience, often involving deep learning projects where PyTorch is foundational, has led me through these exact issues repeatedly. The recommended approach is not a single fix but rather a series of steps focused on ensuring architecture compatibility, often involving a rebuild of your environment using correct package versions. I will outline these steps and provide code examples for clarity.

The first step is to identify whether your conda environment is indeed using x86-64-compiled packages. We need to determine the platform of the Python interpreter currently active. This can be accomplished using the `sys` module in Python:

```python
import sys
print(sys.platform)
print(sys.version)
```

The expected output from `sys.platform` on an M1 Mac running an ARM64-compatible environment will be `darwin`, specifically `darwin arm64` for an actively running shell and python. If instead this returns with `darwin x86_64` this confirms that your installation is not using the native architecture. The `sys.version` information will be useful for determining the python version being used. The error is usually caused by the environment not being created specifically for the M1 architecture initially, or an older environment that was transitioned through copying, which might not rebuild correctly by only upgrading the existing environment.

With this identification complete, and if the underlying python interpreter is x86_64, we must create a new, native environment. This begins by specifying the `osx-arm64` platform when creating or updating our environment. This ensures that conda preferentially selects packages built for ARM64, including those that interface with optimized libraries.

```bash
conda create -n my_arm_env -c conda-forge python=3.10  -y --override-channels --platform osx-arm64
conda activate my_arm_env
```

This command instructs `conda` to create a new environment named `my_arm_env` with Python version 3.10 (adjust as needed), using the `conda-forge` channel which is often preferred for its wide range of architecture-specific builds. Crucially, the `--platform osx-arm64` flag forces conda to prioritize arm64 packages from the channels. The `-y` flag skips the confirmation step. This is not recommended for production environments, but for development this works well. The `--override-channels` flag ensures the `conda-forge` channel packages are preferred, including the ones that might be in the base channel.

After the environment is created and activated, you can now proceed with installing PyTorch and its associated packages. Note, that the `pip` command can be used with `conda` environments. However, this usually causes issues with versions or dependencies and it is recommended to only use `conda` to install packages unless specifically needed. The `pytorch` team now provides pre-compiled binary wheels directly for the arm64 architecture:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -y
```

This command installs the PyTorch, torchvision (for computer vision tasks), and torchaudio (for audio tasks) packages from the official PyTorch channel. These should now install the ARM64-compiled versions that resolve the MKL-related errors previously experienced. If, for some reason, a dependency still pulls an Intel-based package, it will become apparent when attempting to use PyTorch. In this case, one can inspect the installed packages with `conda list` and further investigate the source.

The most common situation where additional issues arise is if you have other dependencies in your project that use legacy libraries. Some older packages are not yet available in ARM64-compatible versions. In these cases, the strategy involves searching alternative packages that provide similar functionality but are compatible, or, if necessary, considering alternatives to the package that might be more suitable. An example would be to switch from an older linear algebra package to `numpy` which is well supported. If a package doesn't exist, attempting to build from source, although not detailed here, is another solution but may require significant technical expertise and is generally not recommended.

Finally, after resolving the installation, it is recommended to verify functionality by running a simple PyTorch test.

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
c = a + b
print(c)
```

The output from this python script will print whether a CUDA enabled device is present, which will most likely be false on Apple Silicon. It will then do a basic tensor operation, printing the result. A successful run indicates that PyTorch is correctly installed and configured for the ARM64 architecture, and the MKL error should not be present. The absence of the error during a simple matrix operation is the final confirmation that the configuration is correct.

Resources for further understanding and troubleshooting include the official conda documentation, which provides detailed information on environment management and package installation. The PyTorch website also offers extensive information on platform support and troubleshooting. Finally, researching and using `conda-forge` is also useful to learn about their package builds and documentation.
