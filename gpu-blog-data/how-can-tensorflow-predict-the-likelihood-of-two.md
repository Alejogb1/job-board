The core challenge in predicting the likelihood of two sentences following each other lies in effectively capturing the semantic relationship between them.  Simple n-gram models fall short due to their inability to handle long-range dependencies and contextual nuances.  My experience building conversational AI models has highlighted the need for more sophisticated approaches, particularly those leveraging contextual embeddings and recurrent neural networks.  This necessitates a move beyond simple frequency counts to a system capable of understanding sentence meaning.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Predicting the likelihood of sentence succession requires a model that can encode the meaning of individual sentences and then assess their compatibility.  This is fundamentally a sequence-to-sequence problem, often best addressed using encoder-decoder architectures within the TensorFlow framework.  The encoder processes the first sentence, generating a contextual representation (a vector of features). This representation encapsulates the sentence's semantic meaning.  The decoder then takes this representation as input, along with the second sentence, and predicts the probability of the second sentence following the first.  This probability reflects the model's assessment of semantic coherence.  Higher probabilities indicate a greater likelihood of sequential occurrence.

The effectiveness hinges on several factors:  the choice of embedding technique (word2vec, GloVe, ELMo, BERT), the architecture of the encoder and decoder (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers), and the training data employed.  Sufficient high-quality data, featuring diverse sentence pairs with clear sequential relationships, is crucial for model performance.  Furthermore, careful hyperparameter tuning is essential to optimize the model's ability to learn complex relationships.

My past work on a similar problem involved predicting the next utterance in a dialogue system. I experimented with various architectures before settling on a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, which significantly outperformed simpler LSTM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This was partly due to the Transformer's ability to handle long-range dependencies more effectively.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches within TensorFlow, focusing on key architectural choices.  These are simplified for illustrative purposes and would need significant adaptation for real-world deployment.

**Example 1:  LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_len),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Prediction (simplified; requires sentence tokenization and embedding lookup)
sentence1_embedding = model.predict(sentence1_tokens)
probability = model.predict([sentence1_embedding, sentence2_tokens])
```

*Commentary:* This example utilizes LSTMs for both encoding and decoding.  `vocab_size` and `embedding_dim` represent vocabulary size and embedding dimension respectively. `max_len` is the maximum sentence length.  The output is a probability distribution over the vocabulary, allowing for the prediction of the next word or phrase (a more sophisticated approach would be needed for complete sentence prediction).  This method, while simpler, may struggle with long sentences.


**Example 2:  Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import TFBertModel

# Load pre-trained BERT model
bert_model = TFBertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    bert_model,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Sigmoid for probability
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#Train the model (requires sentence pairs labeled as sequential or not)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Prediction (requires sentence tokenization and BERT tokenization)
input_ids = tokenizer(sentence1, sentence2, return_tensors='tf')
probability = model.predict(input_ids)
```

*Commentary:* This leverages a pre-trained BERT model for powerful contextual embeddings.  The final dense layer outputs a probability (0 to 1) representing the likelihood of sequential occurrence. This approach benefits from BERT's superior contextual understanding.  `tokenizer` refers to the BERT tokenizer for preprocessing. The binary cross-entropy loss is appropriate for a binary classification problem (sequential or not).


**Example 3:  Siamese Network Approach**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import TFBertModel

# Load pre-trained BERT model
bert_model = TFBertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Define the Siamese network
sentence1_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(max_len,), dtype=tf.int32)
sentence2_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(max_len,), dtype=tf.int32)

sentence1_embedding = bert_model(sentence1_input)[1] # Use [CLS] token embedding
sentence2_embedding = bert_model(sentence2_input)[1]

merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([sentence1_embedding, sentence2_embedding])
dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(merged)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[sentence1_input, sentence2_input], outputs=output)

# Compile and train (similar to Example 2)
```

*Commentary:* This employs a Siamese network architecture, comparing embeddings of the two sentences to determine their similarity.  The BERT model generates embeddings for each sentence, which are then concatenated and passed through a dense layer before producing a probability of sequential occurrence.  This approach explicitly focuses on the semantic similarity between the sentences.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed, I recommend reviewing research papers on sentence embeddings, encoder-decoder architectures, and Transformer networks.  Texts on natural language processing and deep learning, particularly those covering sequence modeling, would also be beneficial.  Finally, exploring TensorFlow's official documentation and tutorials related to text processing and sequence-to-sequence models will provide practical guidance.  Familiarizing oneself with various embedding techniques and their applications is essential for successful implementation.
