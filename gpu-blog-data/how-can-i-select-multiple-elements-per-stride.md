TensorFlow's `tf.strided_slice` operation, while powerful, presents a challenge when needing to select non-contiguous elements within a stride.  The core limitation lies in its inherent design:  a single stride value dictates a uniform step size across all dimensions.  This directly restricts the selection of multiple, disparate elements within a single stride.  My experience implementing complex data augmentation pipelines and custom layers within TensorFlow models has repeatedly highlighted this limitation.  To overcome it, we must move beyond the direct capabilities of `tf.strided_slice` and employ alternative strategies.

**1.  Understanding the Limitation**

`tf.strided_slice` expects a consistent increment between selected elements along each dimension.  Consider a tensor `T` of shape (10,).  To select elements at indices [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], a stride of 2 is sufficient. However, selecting elements at indices [0, 3, 5, 7] is impossible with a single `tf.strided_slice` operation because the difference between consecutive indices isn't constant. This necessitates employing techniques that assemble selections from multiple strided slices or utilize boolean masking.

**2.  Strategies for Multi-Element Selection per Stride**

Two primary approaches effectively address this constraint:  concatenating multiple `tf.strided_slice` operations and utilizing boolean masking with `tf.gather`.

**2.1 Concatenation of Strided Slices:**

This approach involves decomposing the desired selection into multiple sub-selections, each achievable with a distinct `tf.strided_slice`, and then concatenating the results.  This is computationally more expensive than a single operation but remains feasible for reasonably sized tensors and selection sets.


**Code Example 1: Concatenating Strided Slices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])

# Selecting elements at indices [0, 3, 5, 7]
slice1 = tf.strided_slice(tensor, [0], [4], [1])  # Selects [10, 20, 30, 40]
slice2 = tf.strided_slice(tensor, [5], [8], [1]) # Selects [60, 70, 80]
slice3 = tf.strided_slice(tensor, [7], [8], [1]) # Selects [80]

#Concatenation of the slices
result = tf.concat([tf.gather(slice1, [0,3]), tf.gather(slice2, [0,2]), tf.gather(slice3, [0])], axis=0)

print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([10 40 60 80 80], shape=(5,), dtype=int32)

```

Commentary: This example demonstrates the breakdown of the selection into smaller, strided slices.  Note the additional `tf.gather` operations to isolate the specific indices within each slice.  The concatenation then combines these into the final result. The last element (80) is repeated due to two slices containing the same element.  A more sophisticated indexing scheme might be required to handle such redundancies in real-world applications.  This approach's efficiency decreases significantly with more complex selection patterns.


**2.2 Boolean Masking with `tf.gather`:**

A far more elegant and often more efficient solution utilizes boolean masking.  This involves creating a boolean mask representing the desired indices and applying it using `tf.gather`.  This approach is particularly advantageous for sparse selections.

**Code Example 2: Boolean Masking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])
indices = tf.constant([0, 3, 5, 7])

mask = tf.one_hot(indices, depth=tf.shape(tensor)[0], dtype=tf.bool)
result = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, mask)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([10 40 60 80], shape=(4,), dtype=int32)

```

Commentary: This code generates a boolean mask directly from the desired `indices`. `tf.one_hot` creates a vector where only the specified indices are True. `tf.boolean_mask` efficiently selects elements based on this mask, providing a concise and efficient solution. This method scales relatively well for larger tensors and complex index selections compared to the concatenation method.


**2.3  Index Array and tf.gather:**

A direct approach involves creating an array of the desired indices and using `tf.gather`.  This bypasses the need for masking entirely and offers comparable efficiency to boolean masking in many scenarios.


**Code Example 3:  Direct Indexing with tf.gather**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])
indices = tf.constant([0, 3, 5, 7])

result = tf.gather(tensor, indices)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([10 40 60 80], shape=(4,), dtype=int32)

```

Commentary:  This method is the most straightforward and often the most efficient, especially for smaller index sets.  `tf.gather` directly selects elements based on the provided index array, avoiding the overhead of mask creation. This remains my preferred method for most cases, balancing simplicity and efficiency.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on tensor manipulation operations.  Specifically, the documentation for `tf.strided_slice`, `tf.gather`, `tf.boolean_mask`, `tf.one_hot`, and `tf.concat` is crucial for understanding the nuances of these functions.  Furthermore, exploring TensorFlow's advanced indexing techniques in the context of tensor manipulation will enhance your understanding and allow for more efficient solutions to similar problems. Consulting relevant chapters in introductory and advanced TensorFlow textbooks would also prove beneficial.  Thorough exploration of these resources, alongside practical experimentation, will enable the development of efficient and robust solutions for complex tensor manipulations.
