The core challenge in converting a boolean index array to an integer index array in CUDA lies in efficiently identifying and storing the indices where the boolean array holds `true` values.  Naively iterating through the array is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets common in CUDA applications.  My experience optimizing large-scale genomic alignment algorithms has highlighted the importance of minimizing global memory accesses in these scenarios.  Therefore, the optimal approach hinges on exploiting CUDA's parallel capabilities to concurrently locate and store these indices.

**1. Explanation**

The process involves two key steps:  (1) identifying the `true` values in the boolean array and counting their occurrences, and (2) constructing an integer array containing their original indices.  Directly performing this using a single kernel suffers from significant load imbalance, as threads processing segments with fewer `true` values will remain idle while waiting for others to complete.  A more efficient strategy leverages a two-kernel approach: a reduction kernel to count `true` values and a subsequent kernel to populate the integer index array.

The reduction kernel uses a parallel prefix sum algorithm to efficiently count the `true` values in each thread block.  This approach ensures that each block independently determines its count, minimizing communication overhead. The global count is then obtained by summing the block-wise counts. This global count then determines the size of the integer array to allocate.

The second kernel then utilizes the prefix sums to efficiently determine the index of each `true` value within the integer array.  Each thread in this kernel is responsible for processing a segment of the boolean array. By using the pre-calculated prefix sums (from the reduction kernel), a thread can directly determine the correct index in the output integer array for each `true` value it encounters. This eliminates redundant calculations and ensures efficient memory utilization.


**2. Code Examples**

The following examples illustrate the process using CUDA.  These examples assume a boolean array `boolArray` of size `N` residing in global memory.

**Example 1: Reduction Kernel (Counting True Values)**

```cuda
__global__ void countTrueValues(const bool* boolArray, int* blockCounts, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int count = 0;
    if (i < N) {
        count = boolArray[i];
    }
    __syncthreads(); // ensures all threads in the block have completed counting

    // Parallel prefix sum within each block
    int offset = 1;
    while (offset < blockDim.x) {
        int next = count + ((threadIdx.x + offset) < blockDim.x ? __shfl_up(count, offset) : 0);
        __syncthreads();
        count = next;
        offset *= 2;
    }

    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        blockCounts[blockIdx.x] = count;
    }
}
```

This kernel efficiently counts `true` values within each block using a parallel prefix sum. The results are stored in the `blockCounts` array.


**Example 2: Global Sum (Aggregating Block Counts)**

```cuda
int totalTrueValues = 0;
cudaMemcpy(hostBlockCounts, blockCounts, numBlocks * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

for (int i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++) {
  totalTrueValues += hostBlockCounts[i];
}
```

This code snippet performs the final summation of block counts on the host, to obtain the total number of `true` values. A more sophisticated solution could also perform the global sum on the device, for larger datasets.


**Example 3: Index Generation Kernel**

```cuda
__global__ void generateIndexArray(const bool* boolArray, int* indexArray, int* blockPrefixSums, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int index = 0;
    if (i < N) {
        if (boolArray[i]) {
            //Use prefix sum to get global index
            int blockIndex = blockIdx.x;
            int prefixSum = blockPrefixSums[blockIndex]; //Gets the prefix sum up to the start of this block.
            int localIndex = 0;
            //Calculate local index using parallel prefix sum within the block
            int offset = 1;
            int localCount = boolArray[i];
            while (offset < blockDim.x) {
                localIndex += __shfl_up(localCount, offset);
                offset *= 2;
            }
            index = prefixSum + localIndex;
            indexArray[index] = i;
        }
    }
}
```

This kernel utilizes the pre-computed block prefix sums to efficiently assign global indices to the `true` values, constructing the final integer index array.
