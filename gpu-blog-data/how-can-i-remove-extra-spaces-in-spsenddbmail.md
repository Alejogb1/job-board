SQL Serverâ€™s `sp_send_dbmail` procedure, while powerful for sending emails, often introduces undesirable extra spaces within the email body, particularly when constructing the message from dynamic SQL or variable concatenation. I've encountered this frustrating issue countless times during the development of automated reporting systems, where consistent formatting is critical. The problem stems from how SQL Server handles whitespace in strings and variables, and the way these are sometimes passed into the `@body` parameter of `sp_send_dbmail`. Directly addressing these extra spaces requires a combination of meticulous string manipulation within SQL.

The core issue lies in the inherent behavior of T-SQL variables and string concatenation. When you build a string dynamically, especially using `+` or `CONCAT`, any leading, trailing, or multiple internal spaces in the source variables are usually preserved. When these strings are then passed to `sp_send_dbmail`, those spaces become part of the email content. `sp_send_dbmail` itself does not add the extra spaces; it merely renders what is supplied within the `@body` parameter. Therefore, the solution needs to be implemented *before* the string is handed to `sp_send_dbmail`. There is also a common misconception that the `FORMAT()` function can help. While `FORMAT()` is useful for outputting strings in various formats, it does not remove or trim whitespace within the string.

The primary techniques to remove these unwanted spaces are string trimming using `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions, along with judicious use of `REPLACE` to eliminate internal multiple spaces. `LTRIM` removes leading spaces, `RTRIM` removes trailing spaces, and `REPLACE(string, '  ', ' ')` can collapse multiple spaces into single spaces. You might sometimes need nested applications of `REPLACE` if dealing with more than two spaces in succession. Furthermore, when inserting line breaks in your email message, be careful to ensure that those inserted line feeds do not inadvertently introduce extra spaces. For example, a line feed character could be followed by spaces because of how your string is constructed or stored.

Below are examples illustrating how to clean up the email body within the SQL before sending it with `sp_send_dbmail`.

**Example 1: Basic Trimming and Multiple Space Replacement**

This first example demonstrates the most basic cleanup, targeting leading, trailing, and internal multiple spaces.

```sql
DECLARE @EmailBody NVARCHAR(MAX);
DECLARE @Var1 NVARCHAR(100) = '   String   with  spaces    ';
DECLARE @Var2 NVARCHAR(100) = '  Another string  ';

SET @EmailBody = @Var1 + '  ' + @Var2;  -- Introduce extra spaces
-- Before processing the variable contains "   String   with  spaces      Another string  "
SET @EmailBody = LTRIM(RTRIM(@EmailBody)); -- Remove Leading and Trailing Spaces
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '  ', ' ');  -- Collapse multiple internal spaces to one
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '  ', ' ');  -- Collapse multiple internal spaces to one again for edge cases
-- After processing the variable now contains "String with spaces Another string"

--Send the Email, for this example only the variable assignment and string processing will be shown.
--EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
--	@profile_name = 'YourProfileName',
--	@recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
--	@subject = 'Test Email',
--	@body = @EmailBody;
SELECT @EmailBody as ProcessedBody; -- Output the processed body for review
```

**Commentary:**  Here, we have two sample strings that are concatenated to form the email body, intentionally creating several leading, trailing, and internal multiple spaces. We use `LTRIM` to remove the leading spaces and `RTRIM` to remove the trailing spaces from the combined string. Then, we use `REPLACE(@EmailBody, '  ', ' ')` to replace any occurrences of two spaces with one space. This operation is applied a second time to cover scenarios where three or more consecutive spaces existed originally. This basic approach should handle the most common space-related formatting issues. The commented out portion represents a send email command and is not executed as part of this demonstration.

**Example 2: Trimming with Line Breaks and Dynamic Content**

This example illustrates the handling of spaces alongside line breaks when integrating dynamic SQL results.

```sql
DECLARE @EmailBody NVARCHAR(MAX);
DECLARE @DynamicSQL NVARCHAR(MAX);
DECLARE @Results NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @DynamicSQL = N'SELECT ''      Line 1   '' + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10) + ''  Line 2   '' AS Result';

-- Executing Dynamic Query
EXEC sp_executesql @DynamicSQL, N'@ResultsOut NVARCHAR(MAX) OUTPUT', @ResultsOut = @Results OUTPUT

SET @EmailBody =  @Results

-- Before processing the variable contains "      Line 1   " + line break + "  Line 2   "
SET @EmailBody = LTRIM(RTRIM(@EmailBody));
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '  ', ' ');
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '  ', ' ');
-- After processing the variable now contains "Line 1" + line break + "Line 2"

--Send the Email, for this example only the variable assignment and string processing will be shown.
--EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
--	@profile_name = 'YourProfileName',
--	@recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
--	@subject = 'Test Email with Dynamic Content',
--	@body = @EmailBody;

SELECT @EmailBody AS ProcessedBody; -- Output the processed body for review
```

**Commentary:** This example uses dynamic SQL to generate output which includes spaces and a line break character. The key takeaway here is that spaces can be introduced at line breaks if the string is not handled carefully. The string is retrieved into a variable and then the standard cleanup using `LTRIM`, `RTRIM` and `REPLACE` is applied.  The line break itself does not typically create a problem, but spaces surrounding it often do. The dynamic SQL demonstrates how results retrieved into a variable might come with pre-existing unwanted whitespace. Again, only the variable processing is being demonstrated, not the sending of the email itself.

**Example 3:  String Concatenation with `CONCAT` and Cleaning**

This example emphasizes the usage of `CONCAT` which might be used with multiple variables and it also highlights a more thorough multi-step replacement of spaces to handle cases with varying degrees of whitespace.

```sql
DECLARE @EmailBody NVARCHAR(MAX);
DECLARE @Name NVARCHAR(100) = '   John   Doe  ';
DECLARE @City NVARCHAR(100) = '  New York   ';
DECLARE @OrderNumber INT = 12345;


SET @EmailBody =  CONCAT('  Name: ', @Name, ' , City:   ', @City, ', Order ID:', @OrderNumber, '    ');

-- Before processing the variable contains "  Name:    John   Doe   , City:     New York   , Order ID:12345    "
SET @EmailBody = LTRIM(RTRIM(@EmailBody));
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '    ', ' '); --Replace 4 spaces
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '   ', ' '); --Replace 3 spaces
SET @EmailBody = REPLACE(@EmailBody, '  ', ' '); --Replace 2 spaces
-- After processing the variable now contains "Name: John Doe , City: New York, Order ID:12345"


--Send the Email, for this example only the variable assignment and string processing will be shown.
--EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
--	@profile_name = 'YourProfileName',
--	@recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
--	@subject = 'Test Email with Dynamic Variables',
--	@body = @EmailBody;

SELECT @EmailBody as ProcessedBody; -- Output the processed body for review
```

**Commentary:**  This example employs `CONCAT` to construct the email body from multiple variables and constants, highlighting how such concatenation can also produce extra spaces. It then employs a more thorough space removal approach, handling scenarios where you might have four, three or two spaces in succession. The approach is to perform replaces from the most spaces to the least (4 spaces to 2 spaces). This can ensure more robust handling. The example does not send an email directly, but shows the processing of the variable.

**Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding, I recommend reviewing SQL Server documentation on string functions like `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`, `REPLACE`, and `CONCAT`. Understanding string handling within SQL is fundamental to controlling output sent through `sp_send_dbmail`. Practical experimentation, like that shown in these examples, is the best way to understand the application of these functions. In addition to built in T-SQL functions, consider SQL formatting best practices for code clarity when working with dynamically created SQL. While there are external libraries that could potentially assist with some of this functionality, using native T-SQL is generally the most efficient and appropriate solution for this specific issue, due to the performance requirements of database tasks.
