The RavenDB Mini Profiler's behavior of loading only on the initial page load stems from its integration with the request lifecycle and its reliance on the `IDisposable` pattern for resource management.  My experience debugging similar profiler implementations across numerous projects highlighted the crucial role of request-scoped dependencies and the proper handling of the `IDisposable` interface.  The profiler, in essence, registers itself with the application's request pipeline during the initial request.  Subsequent requests, unless explicitly handled, fail to re-register the profiler, resulting in its apparent absence.

This behavior isn't necessarily a bug, but rather a consequence of design choices prioritizing efficiency.  Continuously instantiating and registering the profiler for each request would introduce significant overhead, particularly in high-traffic scenarios.  Therefore, the initial page load serves as a convenient point to initialize the profiler, assuming a single profiler instance suffices for the entire user session.  However, this assumption, as I've encountered in various projects, breaks down when dealing with specific scenarios involving AJAX calls, asynchronous operations, or multiple tabs/windows.

**Explanation:**

The RavenDB Mini Profiler, like many profiling tools, likely hooks into the HTTP request pipeline.  It registers itself as a middleware component or uses a similar mechanism to intercept and analyze requests.  Upon application startup, this registration happens only once. Subsequent requests do not trigger the registration process unless explicitly programmed to do so.  This is fundamentally related to the application's dependency injection container and how it manages the lifecycle of the profiler instance.  If the profiler is registered as a singleton, only a single instance exists throughout the application's runtime, rendering it ineffective for tracking individual requests after the initial one.  Conversely, if it's registered as a transient or scoped service, the container will create a new instance for every request, but only if the request pipeline explicitly allows for this.

The `IDisposable` interface is vital here.  The profiler likely uses this interface to release resources (e.g., database connections, file handles, memory buffers) after processing a request.  If the profiler is not properly disposed of after the initial page load, the resources remain locked and could prevent the profiler from re-initializing on subsequent requests.


**Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate different ways the profiler's initialization could be structured, highlighting why it might load only on the first request.  These examples are illustrative and simplified for clarity and do not represent the exact internal implementation of RavenDB's Mini Profiler.

**Example 1: Incorrect Singleton Registration:**

```csharp
public class RavenDbMiniProfiler : IProfiler, IDisposable
{
    // ... Profiler implementation ...

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // ... Release resources ...
    }
}

// Startup.cs or equivalent
services.AddSingleton<IProfiler, RavenDbMiniProfiler>();
```

In this example, the profiler is registered as a singleton.  Only one instance is created. Subsequent requests won't create a new instance; thus, the profiler won't appear to 'load' because only the initial request utilized the already existing instance.

**Example 2:  Correct Scoped Registration (Ideal):**

```csharp
public class RavenDbMiniProfiler : IProfiler, IDisposable
{
    // ... Profiler implementation ...

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // ... Release resources ...
    }
}

// Startup.cs or equivalent
services.AddScoped<IProfiler, RavenDbMiniProfiler>();

// Middleware to ensure profiler initialization for each request:
public class ProfilerMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IProfiler _profiler;

    public ProfilerMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IProfiler profiler)
    {
        _next = next;
        _profiler = profiler;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        using (_profiler) // Ensures proper disposal after each request.
        {
            // Begin profiling...
            await _next(context);
            // End profiling and record results...
        }
    }
}

// Add middleware to pipeline in Startup.cs
app.UseMiddleware<ProfilerMiddleware>();
```

This example uses `AddScoped`, creating a new profiler instance for each request, and crucial middleware ensures proper initialization and disposal within the request lifecycle.  This approach addresses the initial load issue.  The `using` statement guarantees proper resource cleanup, which is vital for consistent profiler functionality.


**Example 3:  Improper Disposal:**

```csharp
public class RavenDbMiniProfiler : IProfiler, IDisposable
{
    // ... Profiler implementation ...

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // ... Missing resource release code ...
    }
}
```

Here, even with correct registration, a missing or flawed `Dispose()` method prevents proper resource cleanup, potentially leading to conflicts and the profiler's failure to load on subsequent requests.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend reviewing the documentation for your specific version of RavenDB.  Further exploration of ASP.NET Core middleware and dependency injection patterns will be invaluable.  A study of best practices for resource management in .NET using the `IDisposable` interface is essential for resolving such issues.  Finally, examining the source code of similar open-source profiling tools can offer significant insights into their implementation details.  Understanding these concepts and applying them meticulously will resolve the described issue.  Remember to always prioritize proper resource management and lifecycle handling to ensure the stability and reliability of your applications.
