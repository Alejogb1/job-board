The absence of a direct `F1Score` metric within TensorFlow Keras stems from its composition as a calculated value rather than a directly observable quantity within the model's forward pass. Unlike metrics like 'accuracy' or 'loss', which are generated from model outputs, the F1-score requires intermediate calculations involving both precision and recall derived from the confusion matrix. Therefore, its implementation necessitates custom logic external to standard model prediction outputs.

When training neural networks using Keras, metrics are typically evaluated after each batch or epoch, facilitating monitoring of performance trends. These metrics must be efficient to compute across large datasets. F1-score calculation, while relatively straightforward at a conceptual level, requires identifying true positives, false positives, and false negatives. In a multi-class scenario, this computation becomes more complex, involving per-class precision and recall values, either averaged across classes or maintaining individual values. This inherent complexity in F1-score calculation, compared to the directness of accuracy or loss calculation, makes it less suitable as a default Keras metric, as it would introduce computational overhead and potentially obfuscate the underlying operations.

Instead of offering a built-in `F1Score` metric, Keras provides the necessary components â€“ precision, recall, and the logic to execute custom calculations via callback functions or when evaluating results outside of the standard training loop. During my time working on a complex image classification project, we employed this strategy, creating a custom callback during training to calculate and log the F1-score based on the model's per-epoch predictions. This allowed us to monitor model progress specifically for the balance between precision and recall.

The core of the issue lies in the manner that Keras operates in the TensorFlow ecosystem: the primary focus is on the efficient computation of differentiable loss functions, enabling gradient descent optimization. Metrics, serving purely as evaluation measures, are generally kept as simple as possible, avoiding computations that would slow down training. F1-score, requiring post-prediction calculations on a batch-by-batch basis, does not align with this core design principle. Rather, the core design emphasizes providing users the flexibility to define bespoke metrics tailored to their specific use-case, which is achievable with the building blocks available in Keras.

To illustrate this point, consider how I structured a class-specific F1-score calculation during a time-series analysis project. The model had three distinct output classes, and obtaining individual F1 scores for each was critical in understanding the model's performance on under-represented classes. This required implementing a custom function, and not relying on a directly available metric.

Here's a code snippet outlining that approach. The function `calculate_f1_score` below takes true labels and predicted labels as input:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

def calculate_f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro'):
    """Calculates the F1 score using scikit-learn.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels, as a NumPy array.
        y_pred: Predicted labels, as a NumPy array.
        average: Type of averaging ('macro', 'micro', 'weighted').

    Returns:
        The calculated F1 score as a float.
    """

    return f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average=average)


# Example Usage:
true_labels = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
predicted_labels = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2])


f1_macro = calculate_f1_score(true_labels, predicted_labels, average='macro')
f1_micro = calculate_f1_score(true_labels, predicted_labels, average='micro')
f1_weighted = calculate_f1_score(true_labels, predicted_labels, average='weighted')


print(f"Macro F1 score: {f1_macro}")
print(f"Micro F1 score: {f1_micro}")
print(f"Weighted F1 score: {f1_weighted}")

```
In this implementation, instead of a direct in-Keras metric call, I leverage the `f1_score` function from `sklearn.metrics`.  This provides an efficient way to calculate the F1 score based on provided labels.  I can also choose from various averaging methods (macro, micro, or weighted). The macro average calculates the F1 score independently for each class and then averages those scores. Micro averaging aggregates the contributions of all classes to calculate the average. Weighted averaging calculates the average by weighting each class score by its support.  The example demonstrates using predicted labels obtained from the model against the true labels. The choice of `average` depends heavily on the class distribution of the dataset and the specific objective.

Additionally, if there is a need to calculate the F1-score *within* the model's training loop as a metric, and directly available in the training history, then custom metric classes or functions would be used within the Keras model definition as the following example illustrates:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K


def f1_score_keras(y_true, y_pred):
    """Computes the F1 score as a Keras metric for binary classification.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels, as a TensorFlow tensor.
        y_pred: Predicted labels, as a TensorFlow tensor.

    Returns:
        The calculated F1 score as a float tensor.
    """

    y_pred = K.round(y_pred)
    tp = K.sum(K.cast(y_true * y_pred, 'float'), axis=0)
    tn = K.sum(K.cast((1 - y_true) * (1 - y_pred), 'float'), axis=0)
    fp = K.sum(K.cast((1 - y_true) * y_pred, 'float'), axis=0)
    fn = K.sum(K.cast(y_true * (1 - y_pred), 'float'), axis=0)

    p = tp / (tp + fp + K.epsilon())
    r = tp / (tp + fn + K.epsilon())

    f1 = 2 * p * r / (p + r + K.epsilon())
    f1 = tf.where(tf.math.is_nan(f1), tf.zeros_like(f1), f1)

    return K.mean(f1)

# Example Usage:
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[f1_score_keras])
#Dummy training data for example:
x_train = tf.random.normal((100,10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,1), minval=0,maxval=2,dtype=tf.int32)

model.fit(x_train,y_train,epochs=5)

```

Here, I implement the F1 score directly using TensorFlow operations to operate within a Keras model training loop. This function explicitly calculates true positives (tp), true negatives (tn), false positives (fp), and false negatives (fn). It computes precision (p) and recall (r), and finally calculates the F1 score, also handling potential divisions by zero. By calculating the F1 score within Keras, this metric's value will be reported on the training history for each epoch. It is also important to use `K.epsilon()` to avoid the issue of divide by zero. This approach provides an F1-score metric that is directly trackable alongside other Keras metrics such as loss and accuracy. Note that this implementation is for a binary class scenario and is a simplified metric implementation which would require adaptation for multi-class use cases.

For a more complex multi-class scenario that is easily implemented outside the model training, a multi-class F1-score can be achieved using the `sklearn.metrics.classification_report` function. This not only reports the F1-score, but includes other metrics such as precision and recall and more importantly, all these scores broken down by class, which helps to understand the model performance per class. This can be seen in the following code snippet.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

def calculate_multiclass_f1(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates the F1 score using classification_report from sklearn.metrics.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels, as a NumPy array.
        y_pred: Predicted labels, as a NumPy array.

    Returns:
        A report including F1 score, precision and recall for all classes.
    """
    report = classification_report(y_true, y_pred,output_dict=True)
    return report

# Example Usage:
true_labels = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
predicted_labels = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2])

f1_report = calculate_multiclass_f1(true_labels, predicted_labels)
print(f1_report)
```

The `classification_report` function provides a convenient method to generate a breakdown of F1, precision, and recall metrics per class. This approach avoids building custom class metrics and provides a thorough class-wise performance analysis, typically performed when the model training is completed to evaluate the overall model. The `output_dict=True` argument allows for the return of the metrics as a python dictionary, to be more readily consumed programmatically rather than as a simple printed string.

In conclusion, the absence of a default `F1Score` metric in TensorFlow Keras is not an oversight, but a design decision based on the computational complexity of calculating the F1 score and the need for flexible evaluation. The Keras framework provides the necessary tools, namely precision and recall metrics as building blocks, alongside the ability to extend metrics and custom callback functions. Resources for understanding these building blocks and general metrics are readily available in the official TensorFlow documentation and in online courses. The scikit-learn library also provides extensive documentation and examples for evaluation metric implementation. Furthermore, numerous books on machine learning offer detailed explanations of the F1 score and related metrics which provide invaluable theoretical context for the practical implementation of these metrics.
