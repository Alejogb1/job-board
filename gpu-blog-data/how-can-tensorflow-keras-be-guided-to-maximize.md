Achieving high recall while maintaining a stringent precision threshold, specifically 0.95, in binary classification with TensorFlow Keras requires a nuanced approach beyond default training procedures. It's not simply about optimizing a single metric; it involves navigating the inherent trade-off between precision and recall. My experience building fraud detection models and diagnostic systems has shown that these conflicting goals often demand custom strategies.

The core challenge lies in the fact that standard loss functions, such as binary cross-entropy, optimize for a holistic balance between accuracy, precision, and recall, rarely favoring one over the others at specific setpoints. Consequently, directly training a Keras model using typical callbacks like `ModelCheckpoint` based on validation loss is unlikely to produce a model that satisfies the 0.95 precision at a maximum recall. This problem necessitates a targeted training process where precision takes precedence. This primarily involves two key techniques: custom metric tracking and dynamic loss weighting.

The first technique centers around creating a custom metric that directly tracks the precision value during training. This differs from relying on the standard Keras `Precision` metric, which is typically evaluated at the end of an epoch or after validation. Instead, we must evaluate precision on a batch-by-batch basis and halt training if this threshold of 0.95 is not satisfied. This allows us to abandon training runs that are veering off course and concentrate only on parameter sets that have achieved this condition. This acts as a critical filter, ensuring that only models having met the required level of precision are considered further for optimization and recall improvement. The second part focuses on loss function alteration; by manipulating the loss function dynamically based on the recall achieved in the previous training step, we create a feedback loop to guide the model towards a higher recall for the same precision value.

Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

**1. Custom Precision Callback**

This example shows a custom callback that monitors precision at each batch step:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

class PrecisionThresholdCallback(Callback):
    def __init__(self, precision_threshold=0.95):
        super(PrecisionThresholdCallback, self).__init__()
        self.precision_threshold = precision_threshold

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
            return

        y_true = self.model.y_batch  # assumes y batch is saved
        y_pred = self.model.predict_on_batch(self.model.x_batch)
        y_pred = tf.cast(tf.round(y_pred), tf.float32)

        true_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true * y_pred, 0, 1)))
        predicted_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_pred, 0, 1)))

        precision = true_positives / (predicted_positives + K.epsilon())
        precision = K.eval(precision)

        if precision < self.precision_threshold:
          self.model.stop_training = True
          print(f"\nStopping training at batch {batch}, precision {precision} below threshold.")

# Example of usage with data loading:
# Assuming x_train, y_train are TF tensors

class ModelWithBatchTracking(tf.keras.Model):
    def train_step(self, data):
      x,y=data
      self.x_batch=x
      self.y_batch=y
      return super().train_step(data)
# Assuming 'model' is a compiled Keras Model()
# model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
# model.compile(optimizer="Adam", loss="binary_crossentropy")
# model_with_batch = ModelWithBatchTracking(model)
# threshold_callback = PrecisionThresholdCallback(precision_threshold=0.95)
# model_with_batch.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, callbacks=[threshold_callback])

```
In this example:
*   The `PrecisionThresholdCallback` calculates precision at each batch by fetching prediction and true labels stored by the `ModelWithBatchTracking` model.
*   It halts training immediately when the batch precision drops below the threshold (0.95), avoiding wasting computation on undesirable parameter spaces.
*   The `ModelWithBatchTracking` class enhances the standard `keras.Model` to record the data batch, making it available to the callback for precision calculation. This eliminates the need to pass the entire training data to the callback.

**2. Dynamic Loss Weighting**

In this instance, I am using a custom loss function, as opposed to solely modifying weights applied to each input in a standard loss function. This implementation is tailored to a binary classification case, where the loss calculation depends on the achieved recall in a step, dynamically shaping the gradients.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def recall_weighted_loss(y_true, y_pred, recall_target = 0.90):

    y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32)
    y_pred = tf.clip(y_pred, K.epsilon(), 1-K.epsilon())

    true_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true * y_pred, 0, 1)))
    actual_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true, 0, 1)))

    recall = true_positives / (actual_positives + K.epsilon())

    cross_entropy_loss = K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    # This weight will heavily penalize models that do not achieve our recall.
    # The closer we are to our target, the lower the weight.
    recall_weight = tf.maximum(0.0, 1.0 - recall) * (1 + recall_target - recall)

    weighted_loss = cross_entropy_loss * (1 + recall_weight)

    return weighted_loss

# Example use during compilation
# model.compile(optimizer="Adam", loss=recall_weighted_loss(recall_target = 0.9))

```
Here:
*   The `recall_weighted_loss` computes a recall of the current batch.
*   A `recall_weight` is computed. This weight is higher when the recall is lower, penalizing models that do not perform well on recall in the current step. This helps push the model to learn parameters leading to better recall.
*   The `weighted_loss` combines the cross entropy loss with the recall weight, providing a feedback loop based on the current recall. The target recall value can be defined as a hyperparameter.
*   It is important to note that the target recall should be below the maximum recall achievable at 0.95 precision, otherwise the loss function would encourage models to over-fit.

**3. Combined Approach**

This final example demonstrates combining the two approaches:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.keras import Model

class PrecisionThresholdCallback(Callback):
    def __init__(self, precision_threshold=0.95):
        super(PrecisionThresholdCallback, self).__init__()
        self.precision_threshold = precision_threshold

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
            return

        y_true = self.model.y_batch  # assumes y batch is saved
        y_pred = self.model.predict_on_batch(self.model.x_batch)
        y_pred = tf.cast(tf.round(y_pred), tf.float32)

        true_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true * y_pred, 0, 1)))
        predicted_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_pred, 0, 1)))

        precision = true_positives / (predicted_positives + K.epsilon())
        precision = K.eval(precision)

        if precision < self.precision_threshold:
          self.model.stop_training = True
          print(f"\nStopping training at batch {batch}, precision {precision} below threshold.")

def recall_weighted_loss(y_true, y_pred, recall_target = 0.90):

    y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32)
    y_pred = tf.clip(y_pred, K.epsilon(), 1-K.epsilon())

    true_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true * y_pred, 0, 1)))
    actual_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true, 0, 1)))

    recall = true_positives / (actual_positives + K.epsilon())

    cross_entropy_loss = K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    # This weight will heavily penalize models that do not achieve our recall.
    # The closer we are to our target, the lower the weight.
    recall_weight = tf.maximum(0.0, 1.0 - recall) * (1 + recall_target - recall)

    weighted_loss = cross_entropy_loss * (1 + recall_weight)

    return weighted_loss

class ModelWithBatchTracking(Model):
    def train_step(self, data):
      x,y=data
      self.x_batch=x
      self.y_batch=y
      return super().train_step(data)

# Assuming model definition like tf.keras.Sequential
# model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
# model.compile(optimizer="Adam", loss=recall_weighted_loss(recall_target=0.9))
# model_with_batch = ModelWithBatchTracking(model)
# threshold_callback = PrecisionThresholdCallback(precision_threshold=0.95)
# model_with_batch.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, callbacks=[threshold_callback])

```

This combines the precision tracking of example one, with the recall-weighted loss function. Training is stopped as soon as the precision dips below 0.95. The dynamic weight on the loss function pushes the model to learn to predict more positive values when it can do so without sacrificing precision.

These methods, although specific, provide a structured route for achieving high recall at a strict precision. They involve more than merely setting different metric targets and require a good understanding of the underlying dynamics of training, and an ability to control them.

For further learning, resources like the TensorFlow documentation on custom callbacks and loss functions, and academic papers on imbalanced classification problems will provide more depth. Exploring the concept of cost-sensitive learning and the effect of different loss functions on model behavior are key to becoming more proficient in this field. Books focused on practical machine learning often provide a more hands-on approach for mastering these techniques, with numerous real-world examples.
