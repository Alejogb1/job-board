A key challenge in using bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM) networks for classification arises when target data contains a mixture of known binary labels (e.g., 0 or 1) and unknown or ‘missing’ values. These missing labels, often represented as a specific value like -1 or `null`, demand a tailored approach to avoid skewing model performance and evaluation metrics. Ignoring them would lead to incorrect loss calculations and ultimately, an unreliable model. Therefore, we must adjust how we calculate the loss during training and how we compute classification metrics post-training.

I've encountered this issue frequently in my past work, particularly in processing sensor data where labels might be inconsistently recorded. One specific project involved classifying user activity from accelerometer readings. Certain segments had clear binary labels (e.g., “Walking” or “Resting”), while other segments were unlabeled due to equipment malfunction or data collection errors.

The primary technique is to mask the missing labels during the loss calculation. Instead of simply feeding all training data into the loss function, we need to create a mask that essentially tells the function to ignore predictions for data points where the true label is unknown. This masking process ensures that the gradient updates are only driven by the data where we have concrete ground truth, and thus prevents the model from "learning" or being influenced by these unknowns.

The loss function commonly employed for binary classification with bi-LSTMs is binary cross-entropy. Without modification, it will compute a loss even for instances with unknown labels. To address this, we need a modified version that incorporates a mask. We can implement this masking at the batch level to maximize efficiency.

Here's an example in Python, using PyTorch, demonstrating how to mask the loss function. Assume `outputs` are the model's predicted probabilities after the sigmoid layer, `targets` are the ground truth labels (0, 1 or -1 for unknown), and the batch dimension is represented by `B`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def masked_binary_cross_entropy(outputs, targets):
  """
  Computes binary cross-entropy loss, masking unknown targets.
  Args:
    outputs: torch.Tensor of shape (B, 1), model predictions (probabilities).
    targets: torch.Tensor of shape (B, 1), ground truth labels (0, 1, or -1).
  Returns:
    torch.Tensor: Masked binary cross-entropy loss (scalar).
  """
  mask = (targets != -1).float() # Create mask where valid labels are 1, else 0.
  masked_targets = targets * mask # Mask targets to 0 when invalid (-1)
  bce_loss = nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy(outputs, masked_targets, reduction='none')  
  masked_bce_loss = bce_loss * mask # Apply the mask to the loss
  loss = masked_bce_loss.sum() / mask.sum()  # Compute masked mean
  return loss
```

In the provided code, the mask is created based on whether the corresponding target has a value of -1. The `binary_cross_entropy` is computed using the original outputs and masked versions of the target labels, so the BCE would calculate loss with target set to zero for mask entries.  This is because unknown labels contribute no information for optimization. The mask is then applied to the loss, and the final loss is computed by summing only the loss values corresponding to valid labels, normalized by the number of valid values.  Crucially, this ensures we are only penalizing the model for mistakes made on labeled data, preventing loss calculations from the unknown labels to wrongly influence the update.

Once the model is trained, classification metrics must also ignore instances with missing labels. Typical metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A modification similar to masking loss is also required in this post-training phase. We must filter predictions to evaluate them against only known labels. Consider this example:

```python
import torch

def masked_classification_metrics(outputs, targets, threshold=0.5):
    """
    Computes masked accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Args:
        outputs: torch.Tensor of shape (B, 1), model's predicted probabilities.
        targets: torch.Tensor of shape (B, 1), ground truth labels (0, 1, or -1).
        threshold: float, probability threshold for converting outputs to binary predictions.
    Returns:
        tuple: (accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score) as floats.
    """
    mask = (targets != -1).float() # Again the mask where valid labels are 1, else 0.
    masked_targets = targets[mask == 1] # Filter the targets by the mask
    masked_outputs = outputs[mask == 1] # Filter the outputs by the mask

    if len(masked_targets) == 0: # Handles case with no labeled entries in batch
        return 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

    predictions = (masked_outputs >= threshold).float().squeeze() # Get binary predictions based on the threshold
    masked_targets = masked_targets.float().squeeze() # Ensure targets and predictions are comparable

    correct_predictions = (predictions == masked_targets).float().sum()
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(masked_targets)


    tp = ((predictions == 1) & (masked_targets == 1)).float().sum()
    fp = ((predictions == 1) & (masked_targets == 0)).float().sum()
    fn = ((predictions == 0) & (masked_targets == 1)).float().sum()

    precision = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0.0
    recall = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0.0
    f1_score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) if (precision + recall) > 0 else 0.0

    return accuracy.item(), precision.item(), recall.item(), f1_score.item()
```

This function operates by applying the same mask generated using `targets != -1` and then filters both the outputs and targets. Only these filtered values are used in calculating the final metrics. The threshold is used to convert probabilities into binary predictions. It returns the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as floating point values. This will handle cases where no labels exist in a batch by returning a metric of 0.

Finally, consider a case with sequence input to a bi-LSTM model. Here we would need to apply masking to each timestep of the sequence and each element of a batch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MaskedBiLSTMClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(MaskedBiLSTMClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, bidirectional=True, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, 1) # Linear layer outputs 1 probability
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x, mask):
        """
         Args:
          x: torch.Tensor of shape (B, T, input_size), sequence input.

        Returns:
          torch.Tensor: Predicted probabilities, shape (B, T, 1)
        """
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        output = self.fc(lstm_out)
        output = self.sigmoid(output)

        return output

        return 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

    predictions = (masked_outputs >= threshold).float()
    masked_targets = masked_targets.float()

    f1_score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) if (precision + recall) > 0 else 0.0
    return accuracy.item(), precision.item(), recall.item(), f1_score.item()
```

In this bi-LSTM based model, masking is applied in the `forward` function. The masking is also utilized in both loss calculation (`masked_bce_sequence_loss`) and metric evaluation (`masked_sequence_metrics`) ensuring that all calculations ignore the unknown target labels at every timestep. This function shows how masking is applied in a sequential data setting.

In summary, handling mixed binary and unknown target values when using a bi-LSTM for classification requires careful masking during both training and evaluation phases. For further information on this, exploring documentation related to sequence modeling and loss function implementation in PyTorch or TensorFlow, coupled with reading about data masking techniques in machine learning would be helpful. Additionally, research into techniques like handling imbalanced datasets, especially related to binary classification can be useful in improving the performance of bi-LSTM models.
