Custom PyTorch modules, designed to encapsulate specific neural network operations, typically receive input tensors through their `forward` method. The crux of handling multiple parameters, beyond the input tensor, lies in the flexibility of Python function signatures within the `forward` method’s definition. These parameters, while not directly passed during a standard model invocation with input data, are typically managed during the instantiation of the module, or, if required, during a model call through explicit argument passing. My experience building custom modules for complex generative models has repeatedly confirmed the importance of understanding this distinction.

Let's examine the mechanics. A PyTorch module derives from `torch.nn.Module`. The `__init__` method initializes any parameters that persist throughout the module's lifetime—weights, biases, and other constant or learnable values. These are typically declared as `torch.nn.Parameter` objects to enable automatic gradient computation during training. In contrast, parameters that only influence the `forward` computation for specific calls are passed directly to the `forward` method. These might include values determining the application of dropout, a temperature parameter in a softmax, or any contextual variables that impact a computation.

The `forward` method, in turn, can accept an arbitrary number of positional or keyword arguments. The standard practice is to use a single tensor as the primary input, with additional parameters supplied as necessary. This is not a limitation; it is a deliberate design that permits the flexible application of complex computations within a module. Importantly, we are not concerned with how these parameters are determined at the point of a module's forward computation, but rather how to effectively define and pass these parameters into the `forward` method.

To illustrate this principle, consider these examples:

**Example 1: Fixed Parameters during Initialization**

In the first scenario, let's embed two constant parameters directly in the module, passed to the `__init__` method during instantiation. These parameters, although not directly passed when invoking the module with data, shape the computation within the forward method and are fixed values for all forward passes for the lifespan of the module.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ParameterizedModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        super(ParameterizedModule, self).__init__()
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2

    def forward(self, x):
        return x * self.param1 + self.param2

# instantiation of the custom module
module_instance = ParameterizedModule(2.0, 1.0)
input_tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
output_tensor = module_instance(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor)
# Output: tensor([3., 5., 7.])
```

Here, `param1` and `param2` are floating-point values passed during the construction of `ParameterizedModule`. They modify the tensor `x` within the `forward` computation. Although we don't specify these parameters again when calling `module_instance(input_tensor)`, they are still active in determining the result of the computation. This approach is optimal for settings where certain coefficients, shifts, or other static aspects of the calculation are needed. If the parameters were required to be learned via backpropagation, they would be declared as `torch.nn.Parameter` objects, enabling gradient calculation.

**Example 2: Dynamic Parameters Passed to `forward`**

Moving towards dynamic parameter handling, let’s redefine the module to receive parameters within the `forward` method call itself. This approach is particularly useful for cases when certain parameters have to be updated with every forward pass.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DynamicParameterizedModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
       super(DynamicParameterizedModule, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, x, param1, param2):
      return x * param1 + param2

# instantiation of the custom module
module_instance = DynamicParameterizedModule()
input_tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
output_tensor = module_instance(input_tensor, 2.0, 1.0)
print(output_tensor)
# Output: tensor([3., 5., 7.])

output_tensor_2 = module_instance(input_tensor, 3.0, 0.5)
print(output_tensor_2)
#Output: tensor([3.5000, 6.5000, 9.5000])
```

Here, the `param1` and `param2` values are received directly during the `forward` method call. They’re not stored within the module’s state. This offers maximal flexibility, but the user is responsible for providing these additional parameters at each call. This is useful if parameters have to change based on the situation (e.g. temperature parameter in softmax or a dropout probability). This approach allows us to change the module's behavior on every forward pass without modifying the module instance itself. In contrast to example 1, the parameters are not part of the module's internal state.

**Example 3: Mixed Approach: Internal and External Parameters**

Finally, we can combine the fixed initialization approach with dynamically passed parameters to have a module with internal parameters that also allows for additional external parameters on a forward pass. This gives a good degree of flexibility by having parameters baked-in while also allowing temporary external parameters to modify behavior on the forward pass.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MixedParameterizedModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, param1_internal):
        super(MixedParameterizedModule, self).__init__()
        self.param1_internal = param1_internal

    def forward(self, x, param2_external):
        return x * self.param1_internal + param2_external

# instantiation of the custom module
module_instance = MixedParameterizedModule(2.0)
input_tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
output_tensor = module_instance(input_tensor, 1.0)
print(output_tensor)
# Output: tensor([3., 5., 7.])

output_tensor_2 = module_instance(input_tensor, 0.5)
print(output_tensor_2)
#Output: tensor([2.5000, 4.5000, 6.5000])
```

In this scenario, `param1_internal` is initialized as part of the module, while `param2_external` is provided during the call to the `forward` method. The computation now depends both on the persistent module parameter and the dynamic parameter. This hybrid setup is often encountered in more sophisticated neural networks.

When considering the most suitable approach, evaluate the use case. If parameters do not change on each forward pass, initialisation via the constructor makes sense. If parameters are temporary or must change, passing them via `forward` is necessary. The hybrid approach is suitable if some parameters are invariant, while others are dynamic. The goal is to design the module interface such that its usage is both clear and efficient.

For further reading, I'd recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `torch.nn.Module`. Books and courses focusing on deep learning using PyTorch also offer detailed insights into the subject. Tutorials and examples available from PyTorch's main repository are also useful resources. In addition to the basic `nn.Module`, exploring the submodules like `nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d` and how they utilize parameters is also beneficial. Finally, working through specific implementations of common neural network architectures allows practical reinforcement of these fundamental concepts.
