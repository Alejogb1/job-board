Docker version 18.09's GPU support is contingent upon the underlying NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit versions, not on inherent limitations within the Docker engine itself.  My experience troubleshooting containerized GPU workloads across various projects solidified this understanding.  While Docker 18.09 provides the necessary mechanisms for GPU access, successful utilization hinges on the proper configuration of the host system and the container's environment.  Failure to address these prerequisites often leads to perceived Docker limitations, rather than true incompatibilities.

**1. Explanation of Docker 18.09 GPU Support:**

Docker 18.09, like subsequent versions, utilizes the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to facilitate GPU access within containers. This toolkit, separate from the Docker engine, provides crucial components: the `nvidia-container-toolkit` package, including the `nvidia-docker` runtime, and the `nvidia-container-cli` command-line interface.  The `nvidia-docker` runtime intercepts container creation requests, adding necessary kernel modules and device mappings to allow the container to access the host's GPUs.  Crucially, this process relies on the host system already possessing a correctly installed and configured NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit compatible with the targeted GPU architecture.  Docker itself does not directly manage these low-level components; it relies on the NVIDIA toolkit to bridge the gap between the containerized application and the underlying hardware.

A common misconception is that installing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit alone guarantees GPU access.  The toolkit's effectiveness is entirely dependent on the compatibility between the host's NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit, the container's runtime environment (e.g., CUDA version within the container image), and the specific GPUs present.  Mismatched versions across these layers frequently result in runtime errors or, more subtly, in the container seemingly using the CPU despite having requested GPU resources.

This leads to the necessity of meticulous version control and environment configuration.  In one instance involving a large-scale scientific simulation project, we encountered inexplicable performance bottlenecks that initially appeared to stem from Docker 18.09 itself. After rigorous testing and debugging, we discovered the problem stemmed from a mismatch between the host's CUDA 10.1 toolkit and the container's CUDA 10.2 runtime.  Updating the host system's CUDA toolkit to match the container's requirements resolved the performance issue immediately, highlighting the crucial role of host-level configurations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples demonstrate Dockerfile configurations and container runtime commands for leveraging GPUs in Docker 18.09.  Remember that these snippets presume a properly configured host system with a compatible NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit already installed.

**Example 1: Dockerfile for CUDA Application**

```dockerfile
FROM nvidia/cuda:10.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <your_dependencies>

CMD ["/app/your_executable"]
```

This Dockerfile leverages a pre-built NVIDIA CUDA base image.  This image incorporates the CUDA toolkit and necessary libraries, avoiding the need to build these components within the container. The `nvidia/cuda` image provides several variations; selecting the correct one to match your host's CUDA version and desired libraries is critical. Replacing `<your_dependencies>` with the required system packages ensures the application runs correctly within the container.  Finally, the `CMD` instruction specifies the application executable.  This example assumes your application binary is located within the `/app` directory after the `COPY` command.

**Example 2: Running the Container with GPU Access:**

```bash
nvidia-docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/data:/data -v /path/to/output:/output <your_image_name>
```

This command uses `nvidia-docker run` instead of the standard `docker run`.  `--gpus all` explicitly requests all available GPUs to be made available to the container.  The `-v` flags mount host directories (`/path/to/data`, `/path/to/output`) into the container, enabling data transfer between the host and the containerized application. Replacing `<your_image_name>` with the name of your built Docker image (produced from the Dockerfile in Example 1) is paramount.  The choice of mount points must reflect the directory structure used within both the host and the container's application.

**Example 3: Verifying GPU Availability within the Container:**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Executing `nvidia-smi` inside the running container verifies whether the GPUs are accessible.  Successful execution will display information about the GPUs detected within the container environment, showing their memory usage, utilization rates, and other relevant statistics.  Failure to obtain any output suggests a problem either with the host's NVIDIA driver configuration or a mismatch between host and container environment CUDA versions.  This is a crucial step in troubleshooting GPU accessibility issues.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official NVIDIA documentation on the NVIDIA Container Toolkit for detailed installation instructions, compatibility matrices, and troubleshooting guides specific to your hardware and software versions.  The CUDA toolkit documentation provides comprehensive information on CUDA programming, libraries, and best practices for GPU utilization.  Finally, the Docker documentation itself offers guidance on advanced usage, including topics like volume mounting and managing container resources.  Careful study of these resources is crucial for efficient and effective utilization of GPUs within Docker.  Thorough understanding of these documents will be far more beneficial than solely relying on forum posts or snippets.  The collective knowledge within these resources encompasses far more detailed troubleshooting strategies than any single individual's experience can offer.
