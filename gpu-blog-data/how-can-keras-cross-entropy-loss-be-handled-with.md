Cross-entropy loss in Keras, particularly during multi-objective training, presents a challenge when labels are missing for certain objectives in a given sample. The default behavior of most loss functions, including categorical and binary cross-entropy, assumes complete label sets. In the absence of a mechanism to gracefully handle missing data, the loss calculation will either produce incorrect gradients or trigger errors, effectively halting effective learning. A viable strategy involves masking the loss contribution for objectives where labels are unavailable. I have encountered this exact scenario developing a multi-modal model that aimed to predict both object classification and object depth from image data; some training samples included only the object classification labels, while others included depth data.

The core principle lies in modifying the computed loss such that only the outputs associated with available labels contribute to the backpropagation. Instead of relying on Keras' built-in losses directly applied to all outputs, the approach involves writing a custom loss function. This custom function will: a) identify missing label positions, b) compute the usual cross-entropy for available labels, and c) apply a mask to the loss to zero-out contributions from missing labels. This ensures backpropagation only occurs based on valid objective signals, preventing the model from learning incorrect or detrimental information. This method prevents errors while still effectively guiding gradient descent.

The implementation utilizes `tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy` and leverages TensorFlow’s ability to handle logical operations efficiently, avoiding loops and other inefficient mechanisms when calculating per-sample loss. This custom loss function can be integrated directly into the Keras model’s training process, allowing for seamless integration with other training procedures.

Here are some code examples demonstrating this process:

**Example 1: Handling Missing Labels with Binary Cross-Entropy**

This first example demonstrates how a custom function can handle missing labels with binary cross-entropy. I use this approach most often when dealing with image segmentation tasks where some samples may lack region-of-interest annotations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def masked_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, mask_value=-1):
    """
    Calculates binary cross-entropy loss with masking for missing labels.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels. Can contain `mask_value` to indicate missing label.
        y_pred: Predicted probabilities.
        mask_value: Value representing a missing label.

    Returns:
        Masked binary cross-entropy loss.
    """
    mask = tf.not_equal(y_true, mask_value) # Create boolean mask
    y_true = tf.where(mask, y_true, tf.zeros_like(y_true, dtype=y_true.dtype)) # Replace masked labels with 0 for loss
    loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred) # Calculate base loss
    mask = tf.cast(mask, loss.dtype) # Convert boolean mask to float
    loss = loss * mask # Apply loss mask
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / tf.reduce_sum(mask) # Average loss over available labels
    return loss
```

In this function, `mask_value` is set to -1 which flags positions where there is no corresponding label.  The `tf.not_equal` operator creates a boolean mask indicating where the true labels are not equal to the `mask_value`.  Next, `tf.where` replaces the `mask_value` positions with 0s, ensuring that the standard binary cross-entropy can be computed without errors. The mask is cast to the same data type as the calculated loss. The loss is multiplied by this mask, effectively nullifying the contribution of missing data positions. Finally, the loss is divided by the number of valid labels to produce an average loss. This approach ensures we don’t accumulate a large loss if many labels are missing.

**Example 2: Extending to Categorical Cross-Entropy with a One-Hot Encoding Schema**

This example covers the situation when categorical cross-entropy is needed, such as in the case of multi-class classification. The mask value, in this case, is still a single value, such as -1, in the original single-integer label format. However, we must take care to create a correct one-hot encoding.

```python
def masked_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, mask_value=-1, num_classes=None):
    """
    Calculates categorical cross-entropy loss with masking for missing labels, expects integer labels
    and converts them to one-hot encoding.

    Args:
        y_true: True labels as integers, shape: (batch_size, label_dim). Can contain mask_value to indicate missing labels.
        y_pred: Predicted probabilities, shape: (batch_size, num_classes).
        mask_value: Value representing a missing label.
        num_classes: The total number of classes
    Returns:
       Masked categorical cross-entropy loss.
    """

    mask = tf.not_equal(y_true, mask_value) # Create boolean mask
    valid_labels = tf.boolean_mask(y_true, mask) # Extract valid labels
    y_true_masked = tf.one_hot(valid_labels, depth=num_classes) # Convert to one-hot encoded valid labels
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true_masked, tf.boolean_mask(y_pred, mask)) # Calculate base loss
    mask = tf.cast(mask, loss.dtype) # Convert boolean mask to float
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / tf.reduce_sum(mask) # Average loss over available labels
    return loss
```

Here, the `y_true` input labels are integer values. This is because masking requires a consistent value to indicate an absence of labels within the raw data. We mask the true labels as before and extract valid labels. The valid integer labels are then converted to a one-hot encoded representation. The base cross-entropy loss is calculated using only the predicted labels corresponding to the valid labels.  After applying the mask and calculating the average, the result represents the masked categorical cross-entropy loss.

**Example 3:  Integration with Custom Model Output Layers**

This example shows how to integrate this masking strategy when your model has separate output branches for multiple objectives and some labels are available for only one objective. In my work, I often deal with models that perform multi-modal outputs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

class MultiObjectiveModel(Model):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, depth_dim):
        super(MultiObjectiveModel, self).__init__()
        self.base = layers.Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')
        self.class_out = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
        self.depth_out = layers.Dense(depth_dim, activation='relu') # Example regression output

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.base(x)
        class_prob = self.class_out(x)
        depth_out = self.depth_out(x)
        return class_prob, depth_out

def multi_objective_loss(y_true, y_pred, mask_value = -1, num_classes = None):
    """
    Custom loss for two outputs: classification and regression, using the mask strategy.

    Args:
       y_true: Tuple (class_labels, depth_labels).  `class_labels` have mask_value for missing classification.
       `depth_labels` have mask_value for missing depth labels.
       y_pred: Tuple (class_prob, depth_out).
       mask_value: Value for missing labels
       num_classes: Number of classification classes.
    Returns:
        Combined weighted loss.
    """
    class_labels, depth_labels = y_true
    class_prob, depth_out = y_pred
    class_loss = masked_categorical_crossentropy(class_labels, class_prob, mask_value, num_classes) # Masked categorical
    depth_mask = tf.not_equal(depth_labels, mask_value)
    depth_labels = tf.where(depth_mask, depth_labels, tf.zeros_like(depth_labels, dtype=depth_labels.dtype))
    depth_loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(depth_labels, depth_out) # MSE regression
    depth_loss = depth_loss * tf.cast(depth_mask, depth_loss.dtype)
    depth_loss = tf.reduce_sum(depth_loss) / tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(depth_mask, tf.float32))


    total_loss = 0.5 * class_loss + 0.5 * depth_loss  # Adjusted for weighting (weights are illustrative)
    return total_loss


# Example Usage:

num_classes = 10
depth_dim = 1
model = MultiObjectiveModel(num_classes, depth_dim)

# Define sample input and output
inputs = tf.random.normal((2, 32, 32, 3))
labels = (tf.constant([1, -1]), tf.constant([1.0, -1.0])) # Classification label for only the first sample, depth only for first sample
predictions = model(inputs) # predictions shape = ([batch_size, num_classes], [batch_size, depth_dim])
loss = multi_objective_loss(labels, predictions, mask_value=-1, num_classes=num_classes)

print("Total Loss:", loss) # total loss is computed considering missing labels
```
In this last example, the `MultiObjectiveModel` has two output branches: a classification head and a regression head. The corresponding loss function, `multi_objective_loss`, computes the respective loss based on masking. A similar method is used for mean squared error loss (depth objective), as missing labels can not be included in its loss calculation.  The `mask_value` and class count (where needed) are passed to the custom loss functions. Finally, the total loss is a weighted sum of individual losses. The overall multi-objective loss considers missing data for individual objectives. The custom loss functions effectively mask the output for which ground truth labels are missing.

For further study on this topic, several resources offer valuable information. The TensorFlow documentation provides an in-depth understanding of the available Keras loss functions, along with details on custom loss implementation. Books on deep learning often delve into the subtleties of multi-objective training and loss functions. Additionally, research papers on multi-modal machine learning frequently discuss various techniques for handling missing data, including mask-based approaches.
