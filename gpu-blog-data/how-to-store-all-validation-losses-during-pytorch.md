During my work on a high-throughput anomaly detection system using convolutional autoencoders, I encountered the necessity of meticulously tracking validation losses throughout the training process.  Simply recording the final loss proved insufficient for analyzing training dynamics and optimizing hyperparameters.  Accurate monitoring of validation loss over epochs provides crucial insights into model convergence, potential overfitting, and the efficacy of regularization techniques.  The straightforward solution, however, requires careful implementation to avoid memory bloat and maintain computational efficiency.

The core issue lies in the typical PyTorch training loop, which usually only reports the final validation loss after each epoch. To capture the entire progression, we need to append each epoch's validation loss to a list or array.  This requires modifying the training loop structure to explicitly store these values.  Directly modifying the existing training loop can be error-prone; a cleaner approach involves creating a dedicated logging mechanism.  This approach facilitates modularity, making it easier to integrate with different training scenarios and logging systems.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution involves augmenting the standard PyTorch training loop with a data structure (typically a Python list) to store validation losses.  This list will accumulate losses computed after each validation pass.  The structure of the training loop should be designed to accommodate this logging step without disrupting the core training process.  Ideally, this logging should be encapsulated within a function to improve code readability and maintainability.  Further enhancements could include saving this data to a file (e.g., a CSV or a more structured format like HDF5) for persistence and later analysis.  Consideration must also be given to memory management, particularly when training on very large datasets, where storing all validation losses for many epochs may become computationally expensive.  In such cases, strategies like periodic saving or using rolling buffers can be employed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Validation Loss Logging:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model definition, data loaders, etc.) ...

validation_losses = []

def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... (Training loop) ...

        model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            running_val_loss = 0.0
            for i, data in enumerate(val_loader):
                inputs, labels = data
                outputs = model(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                running_val_loss += loss.item()
            epoch_val_loss = running_val_loss / len(val_loader)
            validation_losses.append(epoch_val_loss)
            print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Validation Loss: {epoch_val_loss:.4f}')
        # ... (Rest of the training loop) ...

    return validation_losses

#... (Call to train_model function) ...

print(validation_losses) # Displays all validation losses.
```

This example demonstrates a basic approach. The `validation_losses` list directly appends each epoch's average validation loss. This is simple and suitable for smaller datasets and fewer epochs.

**Example 2: Using a Logging Class:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class TrainingLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validation_losses = []

    def log_validation_loss(self, loss):
        self.validation_losses.append(loss)

    def save_to_file(self, filename):
        # Implementation to save validation_losses to a file.  Could use CSV, NumPy's save, or similar.
        pass

#... (Model definition, data loaders, etc.) ...

logger = TrainingLogger()

def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs, logger):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... (Training loop) ...

        model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            running_val_loss = 0.0
            for i, data in enumerate(val_loader):
                inputs, labels = data
                outputs = model(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                running_val_loss += loss.item()
            epoch_val_loss = running_val_loss / len(val_loader)
            logger.log_validation_loss(epoch_val_loss)
            print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Validation Loss: {epoch_val_loss:.4f}')
        # ... (Rest of the training loop) ...

    logger.save_to_file("validation_losses.csv") # or another suitable format.
    return logger.validation_losses

#... (Call to train_model function) ...

print(logger.validation_losses)
```

This improves organization by encapsulating logging within a dedicated class.  The `save_to_file` method adds persistence, preventing data loss.  Error handling and more robust file writing should be added in a production setting.


**Example 3:  Handling Large Datasets with a Rolling Buffer:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import collections

#... (Model definition, data loaders, etc.) ...

buffer_size = 100 # Adjust as needed.
validation_losses = collections.deque(maxlen=buffer_size)

def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... (Training loop) ...

        model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            running_val_loss = 0.0
            for i, data in enumerate(val_loader):
                inputs, labels = data
                outputs = model(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                running_val_loss += loss.item()
            epoch_val_loss = running_val_loss / len(val_loader)
            validation_losses.append(epoch_val_loss)
            print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Validation Loss: {epoch_val_loss:.4f}')
            if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0: #Save every 10 epochs to prevent memory overflow
                print(f'Saving validation losses to file at epoch {epoch + 1}')
                #Save validation losses to file. Implementation left as an exercise.

        # ... (Rest of the training loop) ...

    return list(validation_losses) # Convert deque back to list for printing

#... (Call to train_model function) ...

print(validation_losses)
```

This example utilizes a `collections.deque` to implement a rolling buffer, limiting memory usage.  Only the last `buffer_size` validation losses are retained.  Periodic saving to disk is crucial for retaining the entire history.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann.  A thorough understanding of PyTorch's training loop and data handling is essential.  Consult documentation on PyTorch's `torch.utils.data` module for efficient data loading.  Familiarize yourself with Python's standard library modules for file I/O and data structures (especially `csv` and `collections`).  Explore options for more sophisticated data logging and visualization using libraries like TensorBoard.  Understanding memory management in Python will be crucial for handling very large datasets.
