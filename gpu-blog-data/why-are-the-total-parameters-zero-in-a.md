The reported zero parameter count in a TensorFlow 2 Keras nested model subclass stems from a crucial misunderstanding regarding how Keras tracks trainable variables within custom layers and the inheritance hierarchy.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects has highlighted the significance of properly defining and accessing these variables within the nested structure.  The issue isn't necessarily that parameters are absent, but rather that Keras's built-in counting mechanisms aren't correctly accessing them due to improper scoping or inheritance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras employs a mechanism to automatically track trainable weights and biases within layers.  In standard sequential or functional models, this works seamlessly.  However, in custom subclasses, particularly nested ones, we need to ensure that the `build` method of each custom layer correctly initializes these variables and that they are properly accessible within the parent class.  If a nested layer's weights are not correctly registered with Keras during the `build` method, the `model.summary()` call will not reflect them, resulting in a reported zero parameter count.  The problem frequently arises from:

* **Incorrect variable scope:** If variables are created outside the `self.add_weight` method, Keras will not be aware of their existence and will not track them for training or reporting.  This is particularly problematic when using nested classes, where variables created in the inner class might be inaccessible to the outer class's `build` method and consequently, to Keras's tracking mechanism.

* **Incorrect `build` method implementation:** The `build` method of each custom layer is critical.  It is where variables are declared and shaped based on input tensor shapes.  A missing or incorrectly implemented `build` method in a nested layer will prevent the weights from being registered.  Furthermore, failing to call the `super().build(input_shape)` in child classes when inheriting from a parent layer can disrupt the propagation of variable tracking information.

* **Hidden layers or incorrect layering:**  Improperly nested layers, or layers that don't receive input during model building (e.g., due to structural issues within the nested architecture), may not have their variables initialized. This leads to zero parameters being reported as these layers remain unbuilt.

Addressing these points requires a careful examination of the layer's architecture, the `build` method implementation, and the variable creation process within each custom layer.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Scope:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class InnerLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(InnerLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        # Incorrect: weights are not tracked by Keras
        self.w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([input_shape[-1], self.units]))
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

class OuterLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(OuterLayer, self).__init__()
        self.inner = InnerLayer(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.inner(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([OuterLayer(10)])
model.build((None, 5)) # Needs input shape for build to execute correctly
model.summary() # Will show zero parameters for OuterLayer and InnerLayer
```

In this example, the `InnerLayer` creates a weight tensor `self.w` outside the `self.add_weight` method.  This makes the weight invisible to Keras, resulting in the zero parameter count.

**Example 2: Correct Variable Scope:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class InnerLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(InnerLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

class OuterLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(OuterLayer, self).__init__()
        self.inner = InnerLayer(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.inner(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([OuterLayer(10)])
model.build((None, 5))
model.summary() # Will show correct parameters
```

Here, `self.add_weight` correctly registers the weight tensor with Keras.  The `model.summary()` will now accurately display the parameters.


**Example 3: Missing `super().build()` in Child Class:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class BaseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BaseLayer, self).__init__()

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], 10),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

class DerivedLayer(BaseLayer):
    def build(self, input_shape):
      # Missing super().build(input_shape)
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], 5),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([DerivedLayer()])
model.build((None, 5))
model.summary() # Parameters might be partially or incorrectly reported
```

This illustrates a situation where omitting `super().build(input_shape)` in `DerivedLayer` leads to incorrect parameter reporting. The base layer's weight might not be properly accounted for.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend revisiting the official TensorFlow 2 documentation on custom layers and the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class.  Careful study of the examples provided there, combined with thorough testing of your `build` method in a simplified context, will help pinpoint the source of the problem.  Furthermore, tracing the variable creation and initialization process using debuggers such as pdb is crucial for understanding the flow of execution and identifying any discrepancies.  Finally, understanding the concept of variable scope in TensorFlow, and how it interacts with layer inheritance, is fundamental for correctly constructing and using nested models.  Consulting TensorFlow's API documentation on variable management will provide further insight.  These steps, coupled with a systematic approach to debugging, are key to successfully constructing and training complex nested Keras models.
