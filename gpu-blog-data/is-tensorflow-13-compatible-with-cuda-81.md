TensorFlow 1.3's compatibility with CUDA 8.1 is contingent upon several factors, most critically the specific TensorFlow 1.3 build and the underlying operating system.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects in 2017 frequently involved wrestling with precisely this compatibility issue. While the official documentation was sometimes less than explicit, practical experience revealed a nuanced compatibility landscape.  In short, direct support wasn't guaranteed, necessitating careful configuration and, in some cases, workaround strategies.

**1.  Explanation of TensorFlow 1.3 and CUDA Compatibility:**

TensorFlow's reliance on CUDA for GPU acceleration means that the TensorFlow build must be compiled against a specific CUDA toolkit version.  This is not a simple one-to-one mapping; TensorFlow releases typically support a range of CUDA versions, but the edges of that range often present challenges.  CUDA 8.1 fell within a period of rapid development for both TensorFlow and the CUDA ecosystem.  Consequently, while TensorFlow 1.3 *might* have worked with CUDA 8.1, it wasn't a universally assured compatibility.  The likelihood of success depended on:

* **TensorFlow 1.3 Build:**  Different builds of TensorFlow 1.3 might exhibit varying levels of compatibility.  Pre-built binaries from the TensorFlow website, particularly those provided for specific distributions like Ubuntu 16.04, were more likely to have undergone more rigorous testing than custom builds.  Custom compilations required meticulously matching CUDA libraries and header files with the TensorFlow source code.

* **Operating System and Drivers:**  The underlying operating system and its associated NVIDIA drivers played a crucial role.  Incorrect driver versions could lead to instability and incompatibility, irrespective of the TensorFlow and CUDA versions.  Problems often arose from using drivers newer than those tested with the specific TensorFlow release.  Conversely, very old drivers could also cause issues due to missing features or bug fixes.

* **cuDNN Version:** The cuDNN library, an essential component for deep learning operations on NVIDIA GPUs, also needed careful consideration.  cuDNN version compatibility with both TensorFlow and CUDA 8.1 had to be verified.  An incorrect cuDNN version could lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior.

Failure to carefully align these three components—TensorFlow build, CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN—could result in errors ranging from silent failures (GPU computation not utilized) to explicit runtime exceptions.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of the compatibility issue.  Note that these snippets are illustrative and might require modification depending on the specific TensorFlow build and environment.

**Example 1: Successful GPU Detection (Ideal Scenario):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    devices = sess.list_devices()
    for d in devices:
        print(d)
```

This code attempts to detect available GPUs using TensorFlow's API.  A successful outcome would show a non-zero number of GPUs and detailed information about them, confirming that TensorFlow has correctly identified and initialized the CUDA-enabled GPU.  Failure here often indicated a deeper problem, perhaps a mismatch between the TensorFlow build and CUDA.


**Example 2:  Explicit CUDA Device Assignment (Addressing Potential Conflicts):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Force TensorFlow to use a specific GPU
tf.config.set_visible_devices([tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0]], 'GPU')

with tf.compat.v1.Session(config=tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)) as sess:
  # ... your TensorFlow operations here ...
```

This example demonstrates explicitly selecting a GPU device for computation. This can be useful when multiple GPUs are present or when there's a suspicion of conflicting device assignments. The `log_device_placement=True` flag helps debug placement issues by logging device assignments.  This was often crucial in resolving issues arising from conflicts between TensorFlow and other GPU-using processes.

**Example 3: Handling Potential CUDA Errors (Error Handling):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

try:
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        # ... your TensorFlow operations here, potentially using placeholders or variables for data ...

        # Example operation
        a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(100, 100), dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.constant(np.random.rand(100, 100), dtype=tf.float32)
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        result = sess.run(c)
        print("Matrix Multiplication Result Shape:", result.shape)

except tf.errors.OpError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow operation error: {e}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Runtime error: {e}")
```

This code incorporates error handling to catch potential CUDA-related exceptions.  These exceptions could range from memory allocation errors to incorrect kernel launches.  The `try...except` block attempts to gracefully handle such errors, providing more informative diagnostic messages than the standard TensorFlow error messages.  During my debugging sessions, this approach proved invaluable in identifying the root cause of CUDA-related failures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation from the 1.x era.  Reviewing the release notes for TensorFlow 1.3 and the CUDA toolkit documentation for version 8.1 is also essential.  Finally, exploring archived community forums and Stack Overflow threads from 2017 focusing on TensorFlow 1.3 and CUDA 8.1 could uncover solutions to specific problems encountered.  Detailed examination of NVIDIA's CUDA programming guide will also be beneficial for understanding the underlying GPU programming model.  Thoroughly understanding the interactions between these components is crucial for successful deployment.
