The appearance of NaN and Inf values in a TensorFlow custom cost function, even with clipping applied, often stems from numerical instability during the gradient calculation, rather than solely from the input data.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale recommendation system and a complex physics simulation, reveals that gradient explosions are the primary culprit, even when input values seem appropriately constrained.  Clipping input tensors only addresses the issue at the input level; it doesn't prevent numerical instability during the intermediate steps of the backpropagation process.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's automatic differentiation relies on the chain rule to compute gradients.  The chain rule involves numerous multiplications and additions, potentially leading to extremely large or small values during the backpropagation process.  Even if input tensors are clipped to prevent extreme values, these intermediate calculations can still produce values outside the representable range of floating-point numbers, resulting in NaN (Not a Number) or Inf (Infinity) values.  This is especially problematic in deep networks with many layers or complex activation functions that amplify small numerical errors.

The clipping operation, typically implemented using functions like `tf.clip_by_value`, modifies the input tensor directly. However, this doesn't impact the gradient calculations themselves.  Gradients are computed based on the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters. These derivatives are often expressed as a sequence of operations involving the input tensor, its activations, and the network's weights.  If any step within this sequence generates a value exceeding the floating-point limits, the result will propagate through the graph, potentially corrupting the entire gradient calculation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Gradient Explosion in a Simple Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  diff = y_true - y_pred
  squared_diff = tf.square(diff) # Potential source of large values
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff) # Mean might not prevent overflow
  return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss=custom_loss, optimizer=optimizer)

# ... training loop ...
```

*Commentary*:  In this example, squaring the difference between `y_true` and `y_pred` can lead to large values, particularly if the predictions are significantly off. Even with clipped inputs, if the difference is large enough, the square can exceed the floating-point limits. The mean operation may not always prevent this overflow.


**Example 2:  Improved Loss Function with Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  diff = y_true - y_pred
  clipped_diff = tf.clip_by_value(diff, -100.0, 100.0) # Clip difference directly
  squared_diff = tf.square(clipped_diff)
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff)
  return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  # ... same model as before ...
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01, clipnorm=1.0) #Gradient clipping
model.compile(loss=custom_loss, optimizer=optimizer)

# ... training loop ...
```

*Commentary*:  This improved version incorporates gradient clipping at the optimizer level (`clipnorm`). This directly limits the magnitude of the gradients, preventing gradient explosion.  Clipping the difference before squaring also provides an additional layer of safety, but gradient clipping is crucial.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential NaN/Inf values During Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    diff = y_true - y_pred
    #Check for NaNs/Infs before proceeding
    if np.isnan(diff).any() or np.isinf(diff).any():
      print("NaN or Inf detected in difference!")
      return tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32) #Return a placeholder value

    squared_diff = tf.square(diff)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff)
    return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  # ... same model as before ...
])

#... Compile and train using the modified loss function...

```

*Commentary*: This demonstrates a defensive programming approach.  By checking for NaNs or Infs before further calculations, you can prevent the propagation of these problematic values and handle them gracefully (in this case, by returning a placeholder).  Early detection improves debugging and avoids unexpected behavior further down the pipeline.  More sophisticated error handling might involve logging the problematic inputs or adapting the training process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops and gradient computation.
*   A comprehensive textbook on numerical methods for machine learning.
*   Advanced tutorials on debugging TensorFlow models and addressing numerical instability.


In conclusion, while clipping input values is a beneficial preprocessing step, it's not a panacea for NaN/Inf issues in custom cost functions.  Understanding the mechanism of gradient calculation and employing techniques like gradient clipping at the optimizer level, and careful handling of potential overflows within the loss function itself, are crucial for creating robust and numerically stable training processes in TensorFlow.  Thorough testing and debugging are essential, particularly in scenarios involving complex models and custom components.  Prioritizing defensive programming by incorporating checks for NaN/Inf values within the loss function provides an additional safeguard to prevent training failures.
