The asynchronous nature of JavaScript Promises, coupled with the specific execution environment of AWS Lambda functions, often leads to the observed behavior where `console.log` statements within a Promise's `.then()` block don't appear during the initial invocation. This isn't a bug in the Promise implementation or Lambda itself, but rather a consequence of the cold start phenomenon and the timing of log flushing.  My experience debugging similar issues across hundreds of Lambda functions has shown this to be a prevalent source of confusion.

**1. Explanation:**

AWS Lambda functions are ephemeral.  Each invocation may result in a fresh container being spun up, especially during cold starts.  A cold start occurs when no instance of your function is readily available. This initialization process can take a noticeable amount of time, during which your code executes.  Crucially, the output stream used for `console.log` might not be fully established or buffered until some time after the function's execution context is initialized.  Therefore, if your Promise resolves quickly, its associated `console.log` may be written to the log after the Lambda function's execution has already completed and the container is being shut down. The log output gets flushed, but because the container is being terminated, the logs may not be immediately visible in the CloudWatch console.

Furthermore, the Lambda runtime's internal logging mechanism plays a part.  It's not a strictly real-time system.  Logs are buffered and flushed periodically or when the function completes execution. A quickly resolving Promise might fall into the gap between the log being written and the buffer being flushed.  Subsequent invocations often exhibit different behavior because the container is already warm (already running), and the logging stream is immediately available.  Therefore, the `console.log` statement within the Promise's `.then()` appears consistently in warm invocations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Issue:**

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise Resolved"), 10); // Short delay
  });

  myPromise.then((result) => {
    console.log("Promise result:", result);
  });

  console.log("Function Start");
};
```

In this example, the Promise resolves very quickly. The `console.log` within the `.then()` block might be missed during a cold start because the function might complete before the logging buffer is flushed. The "Function Start" log, however, will always appear because it's outside the asynchronous operation.

**Example 2:  Introducing a Delay:**

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise Resolved"), 1000); // Increased delay
  });

  myPromise.then((result) => {
    console.log("Promise result:", result);
  });

  console.log("Function Start");
};
```

Increasing the delay in the `setTimeout` function gives the Lambda runtime more time to initialize and establish the logging stream before the Promise resolves.  This significantly increases the likelihood of the `console.log` within the `.then()` block being visible, even during a cold start.  The probability of observing the issue reduces drastically.

**Example 3:  Using async/await and a try-catch block:**

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  console.log("Function Start");
  try {
    const result = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // Simulate potential failure
        Math.random() > 0.5 ? resolve("Promise Resolved") : reject("Promise Rejected");
      }, 500);
    });
    console.log("Promise result:", result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Promise Error:", error);
  }
};
```

This example leverages async/await, a more readable approach to handling asynchronous operations.  The `try...catch` block ensures that any errors during the Promise execution are properly logged. Even with a short delay, the increased chance of logging the result or error improves the chance of observing logs in a cold start compared to Example 1. The `console.log` before the `await` will always be present, serving as a benchmark for function start.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official AWS Lambda documentation on the execution environment and logging.  The AWS documentation on asynchronous programming in JavaScript within Lambda is also invaluable. Exploring advanced debugging techniques within the AWS console, including CloudWatch logs filtering and X-Ray tracing, would prove highly beneficial in pinpointing such issues across a larger scale deployment.  Finally, studying best practices for handling asynchronous operations within Lambda will assist in mitigating future occurrences of this issue.  Specifically, focus on proper error handling and the strategic use of delays to account for cold starts.
