The ability to impose linear constraints on learned parameters during optimization is achievable in PyTorch, although it requires a more hands-on approach than typical unconstrained training. I've encountered situations where direct parameter manipulation was necessary, specifically when developing custom recurrent neural networks for time-series analysis, where certain parameter relationships needed to be strictly enforced.

The standard PyTorch optimizer does not inherently support constrained optimization, meaning that methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam primarily update parameters based on the gradient of the loss function, without directly acknowledging imposed linear constraints. Consequently, implementing these constraints requires us to intervene after the gradient calculation, projecting parameters onto the feasible space dictated by the constraints. A constraint in the form of `Ax = b` defines the acceptable values for learned parameters `x`, where `A` is a matrix of coefficients and `b` is a vector specifying constant values. The constraint, in practice, is implemented by modifying parameter values, forcing them to satisfy these pre-defined relationships after each update.

To clarify, when we say a "linear combination" is being constrained, we mean that parameters aren't allowed to move freely in every possible direction; their movement is restricted such that certain sums or differences of parameters (represented by matrix `A`) must equal certain constant values (represented by vector `b`). Thus we would seek to maintain that `Ax = b` is always true of our parameters `x`. This requires a projection after the parameter update, because the optimizer could violate it.

The core idea lies in modifying parameters after each optimization step but before the next gradient calculation. Given a constraint matrix `A` and constraint vector `b`, and our learnable parameters stored as a vector `x`, we must ensure that the update maintains `A * x = b`. This is not a native PyTorch feature, requiring explicit, step-by-step parameter modification, as described in the following three code examples.

**Example 1: Simple Sum Constraint**

Consider a scenario where we want two learnable parameters, `param1` and `param2`, to always sum to 1. This could be useful in situations such as learning probabilities that should always sum to one, but it's a simple case to illustrate. Our constraint matrix A is `[1 1]` and the constraint vector `b` is `[1]`.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define learnable parameters
param1 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))
param2 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))

# Define optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD([param1, param2], lr=0.1)

# Constraint definitions: A*x = b
A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0]])  # Shape: (1, 2)
b = torch.tensor([1.0])        # Shape: (1,)

def project_parameters(params, A, b):
    x = torch.cat([p.view(-1) for p in params]) # Concatenate to a single vector
    projection = (x - (A @ x - b) @ A.T / torch.sum(A @ A.T))
    
    # Separate projected parameters
    p1_size = params[0].numel()
    params[0].data.copy_(projection[0:p1_size].view(params[0].shape))
    params[1].data.copy_(projection[p1_size:].view(params[1].shape))
    
    

# Dummy loss function
def loss_function(p1, p2):
    return (p1 - 0.5)**2 + (p2 - 0.5)**2

# Training loop
for i in range(100):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss = loss_function(param1, param2)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  project_parameters([param1,param2],A,b)

print(f"param1: {param1.item():.4f}, param2: {param2.item():.4f}, sum: {param1.item() + param2.item():.4f}")

```

In this example, the `project_parameters` function calculates a projection onto the constraint space after each parameter update. The core calculation comes from subtracting the term `(Ax - b) * A.T / sum(A * A.T)` from the original parameter vector `x`, enforcing `Ax=b`. We are specifically using a simple form of projection derived from linear algebra that is optimal when A is a single row vector as in this case (one constraint). The parameters, after some training iterations, will maintain their sum to approximately 1. This illustrates the basic mechanism needed to enforce constraints. Note that we manually unpack and update the original parameters in PyTorch rather than using direct assignment.

**Example 2: Parametric Relationship**

Now, assume we want a parameter `param3` to always be equal to twice the value of `param4`. The constraint in this instance would mean `param3 - 2 * param4 = 0`. In matrix form, this is represented by A = `[1 -2]`, and `b` = `[0]`.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define learnable parameters
param3 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))
param4 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))


# Define optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD([param3, param4], lr=0.1)

# Constraint definitions: A*x = b
A = torch.tensor([[1.0, -2.0]]) # Shape: (1, 2)
b = torch.tensor([0.0])         # Shape: (1,)
    
def project_parameters(params, A, b):
    x = torch.cat([p.view(-1) for p in params])
    projection = (x - (A @ x - b) @ A.T / torch.sum(A @ A.T))
    
    # Separate projected parameters
    p1_size = params[0].numel()
    params[0].data.copy_(projection[0:p1_size].view(params[0].shape))
    params[1].data.copy_(projection[p1_size:].view(params[1].shape))


# Dummy loss function
def loss_function(p3, p4):
    return (p3 - 1)**2 + (p4 - 2)**2
    
# Training loop
for i in range(100):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss = loss_function(param3, param4)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  project_parameters([param3,param4],A,b)

print(f"param3: {param3.item():.4f}, param4: {param4.item():.4f}, param3 - 2*param4: {param3.item() - 2*param4.item():.4f}")

```
The structure is essentially the same as in example one; however, A and b now define the different constraint. The code demonstrates that `param3` will remain approximately double the value of `param4` as training continues while the loss function is optimized. This example shows that constrained optimization is possible between multiple parameters with coefficients.

**Example 3: Multiple Constraints**

Suppose we have three parameters, `param5`, `param6`, and `param7`. Let's say we impose two constraints: `param5 + param6 = 1`, and `param6 + param7 = 0.5`. Our constraint matrix `A` would be `[[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`, and `b` would be `[1, 0.5]`. This now requires use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, as a direct projection will no longer work when A has more than one row.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
    
# Define learnable parameters
param5 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))
param6 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))
param7 = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))

# Define optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD([param5, param6, param7], lr=0.1)

# Constraint definitions: A*x = b
A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]]) # Shape: (2, 3)
b = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.5])                        # Shape: (2,)


def project_parameters(params, A, b):
    x = torch.cat([p.view(-1) for p in params])
    pinv_A = torch.linalg.pinv(A)  # Calculate the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse
    projection = x - (pinv_A @ (A @ x - b))
    
    # Separate projected parameters
    p1_size = params[0].numel()
    p2_size = params[1].numel()
    params[0].data.copy_(projection[0:p1_size].view(params[0].shape))
    params[1].data.copy_(projection[p1_size:p1_size+p2_size].view(params[1].shape))
    params[2].data.copy_(projection[p1_size+p2_size:].view(params[2].shape))



# Dummy loss function
def loss_function(p5, p6, p7):
    return (p5 - 2)**2 + (p6 + 1)**2 + (p7 - 0)**2

# Training loop
for i in range(100):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss = loss_function(param5, param6, param7)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  project_parameters([param5,param6,param7],A,b)

print(f"param5: {param5.item():.4f}, param6: {param6.item():.4f}, param7: {param7.item():.4f}")
print(f"param5 + param6: {param5.item() + param6.item():.4f}, param6 + param7: {param6.item() + param7.item():.4f}")

```

In this final example, the key modification is the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (`torch.linalg.pinv(A)`) in the projection step when A is no longer a single row vector. This is because a direct projection will not minimize the perturbation when there are multiple constraints. This ensures that parameters adhere to all imposed constraints. We can see both constraint equations approximately hold while parameters are being optimized by the loss.

For further understanding, I would recommend consulting linear algebra resources focusing on projections onto affine subspaces and optimization theory, particularly concerning constrained optimization. The theory of projection matrices is crucial for grasping the mechanics of parameter updates. Also, papers on constrained optimization in machine learning, focusing on methods beyond Lagrangian multipliers, would provide further insights. Finally, PyTorch documentation on parameter manipulation, focusing on `.data` and `copy_()`, will solidify the practical aspects. These resources collectively offer a robust understanding of implementing constrained parameter updates in PyTorch.
