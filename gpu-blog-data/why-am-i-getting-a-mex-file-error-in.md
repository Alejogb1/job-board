The root cause of MEX-file errors encountered during `gpuDevice` initialization, specifically when utilizing `GPUstart` (assuming this refers to a custom function or a function within a specific toolbox initiating GPU access), often stems from inconsistencies between the MEX-file's compilation environment and the runtime environment of MATLAB.  Over the years, I've debugged numerous instances of this, primarily when transitioning between different CUDA toolkits or encountering issues with dynamically linked libraries (DLLs).  The error manifests because the MEX-file, compiled for a specific CUDA version and set of libraries, cannot find the necessary dependencies at runtime.  This explanation requires careful examination of the compilation process and the system's configuration.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The MEX-file, a compiled C or C++ file that extends MATLAB's functionality, relies on specific system libraries and CUDA toolkits.  During compilation, the compiler links against these libraries, creating dependencies embedded within the MEX-file.  When you execute the MATLAB code including the `GPUstart` function (or similar), MATLAB attempts to load the MEX-file and resolve these dependencies.  If the runtime environment differs from the compilation environment (e.g., CUDA toolkit version mismatch, missing libraries, or incorrect path settings), MATLAB will fail to resolve the dependencies, leading to the MEX-file error.  This is further complicated by the potential for multiple CUDA toolkits being installed concurrently, leading to conflicts.  Furthermore, the MATLAB installation itself might not be correctly configured to recognize the necessary CUDA libraries.  This frequently occurs when moving MEX-files between machines or different MATLAB installations, especially those on diverse operating systems.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three hypothetical scenarios and associated code snippets:

**Example 1: CUDA Toolkit Mismatch**

```c++
// myGPUKernel.cu
#include "mex.h"
#include <cuda.h>

void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[]) {
  // ... CUDA kernel code ...
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    mexErrMsgIdAndTxt("myGPUKernel:cudaError", cudaGetErrorString(err));
  }
  // ... rest of the MEX-file code ...
}
```

Suppose this `myGPUKernel.cu` file was compiled with CUDA Toolkit 11.8 and then executed in a MATLAB environment with only CUDA Toolkit 11.4 installed.  The `cudaGetLastError()` function might return an error even if the CUDA kernel itself is correct, because the runtime environment lacks the necessary CUDA libraries associated with version 11.8.  The error message will likely refer to a missing or incompatible CUDA library.  The solution involves recompiling the MEX-file using the CUDA toolkit that matches the runtime environment or installing the required CUDA toolkit version.


**Example 2: Missing Libraries**

```c++
// myGPUFunction.cpp
#include "mex.h"
#include "myCustomLibrary.h" // Assume this library contains GPU-related functions

void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[]) {
    // ... code utilizing functions from myCustomLibrary ...
}
```

In this scenario, `myCustomLibrary.h` and its associated DLL/shared library might not be correctly linked during compilation or be missing from the MATLAB runtime path.  Compilation might succeed, but execution fails because MATLAB cannot find `myCustomLibrary`.  To rectify this, ensure that `myCustomLibrary` is correctly linked during MEX-file compilation (using appropriate compiler flags) and the associated DLL is in a location MATLAB can access (either in the MATLAB path or in a system directory).

**Example 3: Incorrect Path Configuration**

This is often a subtle issue, particularly when dealing with multiple installations of CUDA or other dependencies.  Consider a situation where the `GPUstart` function attempts to load a library dynamically.  Let's assume a simplified example:

```matlab
function GPUstart()
  loadlibrary('myGPULibrary', 'myGPULibrary.h'); % Assume this library is necessary for GPU operations
  % ... rest of the GPU initialization code ...
end
```

If `myGPULibrary.dll` (or equivalent on other operating systems) is not in a directory included in MATLAB's dynamic library search path, `loadlibrary` will fail, causing a MEX-file error indirectly.  The error message might not directly implicate the `loadlibrary` call but manifest as a broader MEX-file error due to the cascade of dependencies.  Correcting this involves adding the correct directory to the MATLAB path using `addpath` or configuring the system's environment variables.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official MATLAB documentation on MEX-files, CUDA programming, and the specific toolbox you are using. Thoroughly review the compiler documentation for the chosen compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, GCC) regarding linking libraries and managing dependencies. Explore the MATLAB documentation related to setting environment variables and managing the MATLAB path.  Finally, scrutinize the error messages themselves: they usually provide clues about the specific missing library or the nature of the incompatibility.  Systematic troubleshooting, by carefully checking each dependency step-by-step, is essential in resolving these issues.  Debugging tools provided by the compiler (such as debuggers) can be invaluable in identifying the precise point of failure.  Log files generated during compilation and MEX-file execution are also important for diagnosis.
