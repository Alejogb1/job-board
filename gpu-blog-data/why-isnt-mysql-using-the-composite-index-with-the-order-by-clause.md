Here's my response:

The absence of a composite index being utilized by MySQL's query optimizer despite its seemingly optimal fit with an `ORDER BY` clause is frequently attributable to cardinality imbalances within the index itself, coupled with the nuances of how the optimizer selects the most efficient query execution plan. From my experience optimizing countless database schemas, I’ve observed that understanding these underlying mechanics is crucial for predictable and high-performance query execution.

The primary function of a composite index is to accelerate data retrieval by satisfying both the `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses within a single index lookup. Logically, this avoids the costly process of sorting records separately after retrieving them from disk. However, MySQL's optimizer doesn’t blindly choose an index simply because its columns seem compatible with the query. It analyzes various execution paths, considering factors like the selectivity of the index columns (how much data they filter), their cardinality (number of distinct values), the overall size of the table, and other query-specific details. When the optimizer decides not to use the composite index for the `ORDER BY`, it's often because a full table scan with an in-memory sort or another available index proves to be more efficient for the specific data distribution. This seemingly counter-intuitive behavior arises because the optimizer aims for the lowest overall cost, which isn't always equivalent to minimizing the number of rows accessed by the index.

Several scenarios can lead to this suboptimal index usage. A significant discrepancy in the cardinality between the leading columns of the composite index and the trailing columns is one. For instance, if the first column of your index has a very low cardinality (e.g., gender, status), and the subsequent column has a high cardinality (e.g., timestamp), it may be cheaper for the optimizer to perform a full table scan or use a different index and then sort the result set in memory than to use the composite index. The optimizer might realize that traversing a large portion of the index entries corresponding to a single value of the low-cardinality first column before getting to the more selective timestamp column is more expensive than a full table scan if the result set is large enough. It is also important to recognize that an index is useful primarily for narrowing down the selection set using a `WHERE` clause. While the index *can* be used for sorting in many cases, this behavior can be bypassed if the query doesn't sufficiently narrow the selection, or if the sorting cannot be accomplished efficiently due to cardinality issues.

Let's look at some examples to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: The High-Cardinality, Trailing-Column Problem**

Suppose I have a table called `events` with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(20),
    event_timestamp DATETIME,
    user_id INT,
    event_data TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_event_type_timestamp ON events (event_type, event_timestamp);
```

And I run the query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_type = 'login' ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC;
```

In a situation where the `event_type` column has a limited number of distinct values (low cardinality), and the `event_timestamp` column is very specific (high cardinality), the optimizer might choose not to use `idx_event_type_timestamp`. It might be cheaper for the optimizer to do a full table scan, read the `event_type` column, filter in memory the 'login' events, and then do a sort on `event_timestamp`. This may seem counter-intuitive, but if the 'login' events represent a large portion of the entire table, the optimizer may calculate that the full table scan followed by a filesort is less expensive in terms of resource allocation (IO, CPU).
The optimizer in this scenario will likely choose a full table scan.

**Example 2: Lack of Selective WHERE Clause**

Imagine I have a table called `products` with this structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
   product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   category VARCHAR(50),
   price DECIMAL(10, 2),
   created_at DATETIME
);

CREATE INDEX idx_category_created_at ON products (category, created_at);
```

Now I execute:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Here, I don't have a `WHERE` clause specifying any restriction based on the leading column of the index `category`. MySQL cannot utilize `idx_category_created_at` effectively for the `ORDER BY` since it is effectively performing a sort across the entirety of the data. The `category` field is not contributing to filtering in this query. The optimizer won't bother scanning the index, knowing that it must read *all* the entries from the index just to extract the `created_at` data.  Instead, a full table scan followed by a filesort operation (where sorting is done after data retrieval) is often chosen as it’s more efficient than reading and traversing the full index and then sorting. The optimizer avoids the overhead of the index scan if it knows the index scan wouldn't help filter results.

**Example 3: Selective WHERE Clause, but Not First Column of Index**
Consider this table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
   user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   country_code VARCHAR(3),
   registration_date DATETIME,
   last_login DATETIME
);

CREATE INDEX idx_reg_date_country ON users(registration_date, country_code);
```

And this query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE country_code = 'US' ORDER BY registration_date DESC;
```

Although `registration_date` appears in the index, MySQL may not leverage this index effectively for sorting. The `WHERE` clause references `country_code`, the trailing column in the index, not the leading column. The optimizer would have to do an index scan and find all entries for the `country_code = 'US'`, which is not ideal and it will then need to perform a filesort after retrieving rows. It is often more efficient to do a full table scan followed by a filter and in memory sort.  Therefore, the index is not effectively utilized for the order by operation. To optimize this specific query it is advisable to have an index `CREATE INDEX idx_country_reg_date ON users(country_code, registration_date)`

To address situations like these, several strategies are at your disposal. Firstly, ensure that the order of columns within the index matches the order they appear in the `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses. The most selective column in the `WHERE` clause should be the leading column in the index to reduce the working set. In addition, the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause should ideally follow in the same order within the index, which facilitates sequential access and avoids additional sorting steps. Secondly, when your query lacks a selective `WHERE` clause, you should be mindful that MySQL may not use the index, and consider using other indexes that do narrow the results or use other techniques like table partitioning, if possible. Thirdly, be aware of the cardinality of the columns within your index.  Columns with low cardinality as the leading column in an index can make that index less useful for your `ORDER BY` statements, especially when large tables are involved. Fourthly, periodically analyze your tables (using `ANALYZE TABLE`) to ensure that the query optimizer has accurate statistics about the distribution of data, which will influence index selection.

Beyond specific indexing, understanding the MySQL EXPLAIN output is fundamental. It reveals the execution plan MySQL has chosen, including which indexes it is using and the order in which it accesses the tables. This knowledge allows you to identify the performance bottlenecks and to fine-tune your queries and indexes accordingly. Learning to interpret the output of the `EXPLAIN` statement is paramount for database performance tuning.

For learning more about database indexing and query optimization, I recommend reading books that focus on relational databases and specifically MySQL performance. Resources such as the official MySQL documentation are indispensable for understanding the specifics of the query optimizer. In addition, there are several online blogs and courses dedicated to the topic of advanced query tuning, which provides real-world experiences, best practices, and more in-depth explanations on the query optimization process. Thoroughly researching the fundamental concepts of indexing and query optimization will enhance your understanding of why MySQL may not always use a composite index, and will equip you to build higher performing applications.
