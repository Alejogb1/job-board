PyTorch's gather operation, while straightforward for single-dimension tensors, requires careful consideration when extending to multiple dimensions.  The core challenge lies in correctly specifying the indices for gathering across multiple axes, understanding how broadcasting interacts with the indexing mechanism, and optimizing for performance depending on the data structure and desired outcome.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems heavily involved these types of operations, leading to several insights I'll share here.

**1. Understanding the Multi-Dimensional Gather:**

A single-dimension gather operation selects elements from a tensor based on a 1D index tensor.  The multi-dimensional equivalent extends this concept.  Instead of a single index per element, we provide indices for each dimension.  The crucial point is that the shape of the index tensor must correspond to the dimensions being gathered *and* the desired output shape. This means that the index tensor itself possesses dimensionality. Each element within this index tensor specifies the position along a particular dimension.

Consider a 3D tensor `data` of shape (N, H, W).  A single-dimensional gather might select elements along the N-dimension. However, a multi-dimensional gather allows selecting elements based on indices specified across the N, H, and W dimensions simultaneously.  This requires a similarly shaped index tensor; for example, if we wish to gather elements based on selection along each dimension individually, the index tensor would need shape (N, H, W). Importantly, the values within this index tensor represent *the indices* used to select from the corresponding dimension in `data`.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple 2D Gather**

```python
import torch

data = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Data:\n", data)

indices = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3],
                       [1, 0, 3, 2],
                       [2, 3, 0, 1]])

gathered = torch.gather(data, 1, indices)  #Note index along dimension 1
print("\nGathered Data:\n", gathered)
```

This example demonstrates a gather along the second dimension (axis 1).  The `indices` tensor selects elements from each row of `data`. Notice that the first row of `indices` selects elements [0, 1, 2, 3] from the first row of `data`, which are [0, 1, 2, 3].  The second row of `indices` selects elements [1, 0, 3, 2] from the second row of `data`, resulting in [4, 5, 7, 6].  The `dim` parameter in `torch.gather` explicitly specifies the dimension along which the gather operation is performed.


**Example 2:  Advanced Multi-Dimensional Gather with Broadcasting**

```python
import torch

data = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
print("Data:\n", data)

indices_dim1 = torch.tensor([1, 0])  #Indices for dimension 0
indices_dim2 = torch.tensor([2, 1, 0, 3]) #Indices for dimension 2

#Broadcasting to achieve multi-dimensional gather.
indices_dim1 = indices_dim1[:,None,None].expand(2,3,4)
indices_dim2 = indices_dim2[None,None,:].expand(2,3,4)

#Concatenating to construct the indices for the gather operation along multiple dimensions.
indices_combined = torch.cat([indices_dim1.unsqueeze(-1), indices_dim2.unsqueeze(-1)], dim=-1)
gathered = torch.gather(data, 1, indices_combined[:,:,0])
print("\nGathered Data:\n",gathered)
```

This example showcases advanced gather techniques using broadcasting to create multiple index tensors, then combining them to perform a gather on multiple dimensions. Note the use of `.unsqueeze` and broadcasting  to expand the dimension to match the shape of `data`. This allows index tensors created for a particular dimension to interact correctly with those for other dimensions. In this example, it would be necessary to manually perform this gathering for each dimension (as this is not directly supported by `torch.gather`) for clarity.

**Example 3:  Sparse Gathering with Advanced Indexing**

```python
import torch

data = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
print("Data:\n", data)

row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])
col_indices = torch.tensor([1, 2, 0])
depth_indices = torch.tensor([2, 3, 1])

# Stacking indices to create a multi-dimensional index array.
multi_indices = torch.stack([row_indices, col_indices, depth_indices], dim=1)

# Advanced indexing to perform the gather
gathered_data = data[multi_indices[:,0], multi_indices[:,1], multi_indices[:,2]]
print("\nGathered Data:\n",gathered_data)

```

This example demonstrates sparse gathering using advanced indexing. This is particularly useful when dealing with scattered indices where the efficiency of `torch.gather` may not be fully utilized.  The indices are stacked and then used to directly index into the tensor `data`, effectively performing a multi-dimensional gather in a more concise way.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation thoroughly.  Pay close attention to the detailed explanations of the `torch.gather` function and its parameters.  Furthermore, exploring PyTorch's examples and tutorials, focusing on those that handle multi-dimensional arrays, would provide practical, hands-on experience. Studying advanced indexing techniques within the PyTorch documentation would also enhance your understanding of alternative approaches for multi-dimensional gathering. Finally, textbooks on tensor manipulation and linear algebra offer a foundational understanding of the underlying mathematical principles.  These resources, used in conjunction with each other, provide a strong learning pathway.  Addressing performance bottlenecks may require additional literature on efficient tensor operations in PyTorch.
