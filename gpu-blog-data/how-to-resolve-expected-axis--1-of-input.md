The "Expected axis -1 of input shape..." error in TensorFlow typically stems from a mismatch between the expected dimensionality of a tensor and the actual dimensionality provided to a TensorFlow operation.  This often arises from incorrect data preprocessing, misunderstanding of tensor reshaping requirements, or flawed model architecture design.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, ranging from image classification to time-series forecasting, has honed my approach to resolving these dimensionality conflicts efficiently.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue revolves around the `axis` parameter in many TensorFlow functions.  This parameter specifies the axis (dimension) along which an operation is performed.  TensorFlow utilizes zero-based indexing for axes, meaning the first dimension is axis 0, the second is axis 1, and so on.  The `-1` axis is a special case, referring to the last axis of the tensor. The error message indicates a discrepancy between the number of axes expected by a function and the number of axes present in the input tensor at that specific axis.  This can occur in various scenarios:

* **Incorrect Input Shape:** The most frequent cause is providing a tensor with an unexpected number of dimensions. For example, a function might expect a 2D tensor (e.g., a matrix), but receives a 1D tensor (a vector) or a 3D tensor (e.g., a batch of images).

* **Data Preprocessing Errors:** Errors in data loading, normalization, or augmentation can alter the tensorâ€™s dimensionality. This is especially common when working with image data where channels (RGB) contribute to the dimension.  Incorrect handling of batches can also introduce discrepancies.

* **Inconsistent Model Design:** Mismatches between the output of one layer and the input expectation of the subsequent layer in a neural network frequently produce this error.  The output shape of a convolutional layer might not align with the expected input of a dense layer, for instance.

* **Incorrect Reshaping:**  Explicit or implicit reshaping operations (e.g., `tf.reshape`, `tf.transpose`) may unintentionally alter the tensor's shape leading to the error. Failing to account for batch sizes is a prevalent mistake here.

Diagnosing the exact cause requires careful examination of the code, particularly focusing on data preprocessing steps, layer definitions within the model, and the shapes of tensors at various points in the execution.  The use of TensorFlow's `tf.shape` function is invaluable for inspecting tensor dimensions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Shape to a Dense Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)), # Input shape is correct here
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect input:  A single image without batching. The model expects a batch of images.
incorrect_input = tf.random.normal((28,28)) 
try:
  model.predict(incorrect_input)
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}") # This will likely print the "Expected axis -1..." error


# Correct input: A batch of images.  Shape is (batch_size, 28, 28)
correct_input = tf.random.normal((10, 28, 28))
model.predict(correct_input) # This should execute successfully.
```

*Commentary:* This example highlights how failing to provide a batch dimension can trigger the error. The `Flatten` layer expects a batch size as the first dimension, but the `incorrect_input` only provides the image dimensions.


**Example 2: Mismatch after Convolutional Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),  #Output shape needs to be considered for next layer.
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Expecting a flattened vector.
])

# Check output shape before Dense Layer:
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1,28,28,1))
intermediate_output = model.layers[1](model.layers[0](dummy_input))
print(f"Shape after MaxPooling and before Flatten:{intermediate_output.shape}")

# The Flatten layer correctly handles the shape for the Dense layer
model.predict(dummy_input)

```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how the output shape of a convolutional layer (`Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D`) needs to be carefully considered before feeding it into a `Dense` layer. The `Flatten` layer adapts this to a 1D vector, but if this is missing or incorrectly placed, a dimension mismatch will cause the error.


**Example 3: Incorrect Reshaping:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 28, 28)) # Batch of 10, 28x28 images

# Incorrect Reshaping:  Trying to reshape to a shape that doesn't match total number of elements
try:
  reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (10, 785)) # 785 is not 28*28
  print(reshaped_tensor.shape)
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"Error during reshaping: {e}")

# Correct Reshaping:
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (10, 28*28)) # Correct total number of elements.
print(reshaped_tensor.shape)
```

*Commentary:*  This example showcases how improper use of `tf.reshape` can lead to the error.  The dimensions specified in the `reshape` function must be consistent with the total number of elements in the original tensor. A simple calculation error could trigger the error.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation thoroughly, paying close attention to the sections on tensor manipulation, layer architectures, and data preprocessing.  Focusing on the shape parameters of various functions is crucial.  A good understanding of linear algebra and tensor operations will significantly improve your debugging skills in this area.  Familiarizing yourself with TensorFlow's debugging tools, such as the `tf.print` function for intermediate tensor shapes and visualization tools like TensorBoard for visualizing model architectures, is equally important.  Practicing with smaller, simpler examples before tackling complex projects will build a firm foundation.
