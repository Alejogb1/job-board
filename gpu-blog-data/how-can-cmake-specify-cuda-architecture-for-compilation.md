CUDA architecture specification within CMake necessitates a nuanced approach, deviating from standard compiler flags.  My experience optimizing large-scale scientific simulations underscored the importance of precise architecture targeting to maximize performance and avoid runtime errors.  Directly embedding architecture flags into the compiler invocation via `add_executable` is insufficient; CMake's architecture-specific compilation requires leveraging the `cuda_add_executable` function (or its equivalent for libraries) along with careful management of compiler and linker flags. This avoids the potential for inconsistent builds across different platforms and CUDA toolkits.

The core principle involves conditionally setting compiler flags based on the target CUDA architecture.  This is achieved through CMake's target properties and generator expressions.  Ignoring this can result in code compiled for an architecture incompatible with the target hardware, leading to crashes or significant performance degradation. I've encountered this firsthand during a project involving heterogeneous GPU clusters, where a lack of precise architecture specification caused unpredictable runtime behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CMake doesn't directly understand CUDA architectures intrinsically.  Instead, it provides the mechanism to pass appropriate compiler and linker flags to the NVCC compiler.  The process involves several steps:

* **Identifying the Target Architecture:**  This must be determined at build time, either through user-defined variables, CMake's built-in capabilities to detect CUDA toolkits, or querying the system for available architectures.  The latter approach is generally preferred for maximum portability and flexibility.

* **Conditional Compilation Flags:**  Based on the identified architecture, appropriate `-arch` flags are constructed for NVCC. This necessitates generator expressions or conditional logic within the CMakeLists.txt file.  These flags dictate the specific instruction set to which the CUDA code will be compiled.

* **Passing Flags to NVCC:**  The generated flags are then passed to the NVCC compiler using CMake's target properties mechanism.  This ensures that the compiler receives the necessary instructions to target the specified architecture.

* **Handling Multiple Architectures:**  For supporting multiple architectures, separate compilation stages or a unified approach with shared code might be necessary, depending on the complexity of the codebase. Often, a combined architecture can be specified where the compiled code supports a range of hardware.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Single-Architecture Compilation:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(CUDA_Example)

set(CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "sm_75") # Specify target architecture

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

cuda_add_executable(my_cuda_program main.cu)
target_link_libraries(my_cuda_program ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
set_target_properties(my_cuda_program PROPERTIES CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "${CUDA_ARCHITECTURES}")
```

This example utilizes `cuda_add_executable` to build a CUDA executable, setting the `CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` property directly, making it explicit to the build system.  `find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)` ensures the CUDA toolkit is found; its absence will result in a build failure.  This is a basic illustration; error handling and more robust architecture detection are missing, making it less suitable for production environments.


**Example 2: Conditional Compilation Based on System Detection:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(CUDA_Example2)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

#Attempt to get available architectures, defaulting to a fallback
execute_process(COMMAND ${CUDA_NVCC_EXECUTABLE} --version OUTPUT_VARIABLE CUDA_VERSION OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
string(REGEX MATCHALL "Compute Capability: (\d+)\.(\d+)" CAPABILITIES ${CUDA_VERSION})
if (NOT CAPABILITIES)
  message(WARNING "Unable to automatically detect compute capability, defaulting to sm_70")
  set(CUDA_ARCH "sm_70")
else()
  set(CUDA_ARCH "sm_${CAPABILITIES}") #This will handle the most recent detected architecture
endif()


cuda_add_executable(my_cuda_program main.cu)
target_link_libraries(my_cuda_program ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
set_target_properties(my_cuda_program PROPERTIES CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "${CUDA_ARCH}")
```

Here, we attempt to infer the available CUDA compute capability from the `nvcc` version output, providing a fallback for systems where detection fails. This is a more robust approach than hardcoding the architecture. The use of `execute_process` allows CMake to interact with the system directly, making this approach highly portable.


**Example 3:  Supporting Multiple Architectures:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(CUDA_Example3)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

set(CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "sm_60;sm_70;sm_80") #Example for multiple architectures

cuda_add_executable(my_cuda_program main.cu)
target_link_libraries(my_cuda_program ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
set_target_properties(my_cuda_program PROPERTIES CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "${CUDA_ARCHITECTURES}")
```

This example demonstrates support for multiple architectures using a semicolon-separated list.  NVCC will then generate code compatible with all listed architectures. This approach results in larger executables but offers broad compatibility, often preferred for deploying to diverse hardware.  The use of a variable allows for easier modification and maintenance.  This becomes particularly relevant when dealing with a larger number of target architectures.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official CMake documentation is the primary resource.  Consult the CUDA Toolkit documentation for details on specific architecture codes and compiler flags.   The CUDA programming guide provides valuable context for understanding the relationship between code, architecture, and performance. Finally, explore advanced CMake techniques, particularly generator expressions, for more sophisticated conditional build logic.  These resources provide a comprehensive foundation for mastering CUDA architecture specification within CMake.
