The "No such layer: fc1" error in Keras typically stems from a mismatch between the layer's name used during model definition and the layer's name referenced during model access or manipulation.  This discrepancy arises frequently from typos, inconsistent naming conventions, or incorrect sequencing within the model's construction.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous deep learning projects has consistently pointed to these root causes.  Let's delve into the explanation and practical solutions.

**1. Explanation of the Error and Root Causes:**

The Keras `Sequential` model (and even the functional API) maintains an internal dictionary mapping layer names to layer objects.  When you create a layer using `Dense(units=64, name='fc1')`, Keras registers this layer under the name "fc1." Subsequently, any attempt to access or utilize this layer, for example, during weight extraction, layer freezing, or transfer learning, requires using the exact same name. Any deviation – a missing space, an incorrect case, or a simple typo – leads to the "No such layer: fc1" error.

The error doesn't always manifest immediately.  It might surface only when you attempt an operation downstream that explicitly relies on the layer's name. For instance, if you're building a custom training loop and try to access layer weights using `model.get_layer('fc1').get_weights()`, the error would be thrown if "fc1" is misspelled or not defined.  Similarly, when using Keras's built-in functionalities like model summary, `model.summary()`, or visualizing the model architecture using visualization tools, inconsistencies in layer naming would remain undetected until you access the layer by name.


Beyond simple typos, several other circumstances can trigger this error:

* **Incorrect Layer Order:**  If you reference a layer before it has been added to the model, Keras will naturally fail to find it. This occurs more frequently when utilizing the functional API, where layer connections are defined explicitly.

* **Name Conflicts:**  Using duplicate layer names in a single model leads to unpredictable behavior and often results in this error.  Keras will only register the last instance of a layer with a given name, silently overriding previous ones.

* **Dynamic Layer Creation:**  If layer names are generated dynamically (e.g., through loops or string manipulation), subtle errors in the name generation process can produce unexpected names that don't match the references. This often goes unnoticed during initial model building but becomes apparent later during use.

* **Load from a different model:** You are trying to access a layer from a model that does not contain it - perhaps by accidently loading the wrong model weights.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these scenarios with concrete examples.

**Example 1: Simple Typo**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,), name='fc1'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='fc2')
])

# Correct Access
weights = model.get_layer('fc1').get_weights()
print(weights)

# Incorrect Access - Typo in layer name
try:
    incorrect_weights = model.get_layer('f1').get_weights() #Typo here
    print(incorrect_weights)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates the most common cause: a simple typo in the layer name (`'f1'` instead of `'fc1'`). The `try-except` block handles the expected error, showcasing how this error manifests in practice.


**Example 2: Incorrect Layer Ordering (Functional API)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='fc1')(inputs)
#Incorrect access before layer creation
#incorrect_layer = model.get_layer('fc2') # this will error out

x = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='fc2')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)


try:
    incorrect_layer = model.get_layer('fc2').get_weights()
    print(incorrect_layer)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")


weights = model.get_layer('fc1').get_weights() # now accessable
print(weights)
```

Here, the functional API is used, showing the need for proper layer ordering. Accessing `'fc2'` before its definition within the model leads to the error.  The corrected section shows accessing layers after proper definition.


**Example 3: Dynamic Layer Name Generation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

num_layers = 3
layers = []
for i in range(num_layers):
    layer_name = f'dense_{i+1}' #Dynamic Layer Name Generation.

    layer = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name=layer_name)
    layers.append(layer)

model = keras.Sequential(layers)

# Correct Access
weights = model.get_layer('dense_1').get_weights()
print(weights)

# Incorrect Access - Off-by-one error in dynamic name
try:
    incorrect_weights = model.get_layer('dense_4').get_weights() #error introduced here
    print(incorrect_weights)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

This illustrates a more nuanced scenario where the layer names are generated dynamically.  A simple off-by-one error in the name generation loop (`'dense_4'`) leads to the error because no layer with that name exists in the model.  In real-world scenarios, such errors can be significantly harder to track.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the Keras `Sequential` and functional APIs, I suggest reviewing the official Keras documentation. Carefully examining the model-building sections and examples will provide a solid foundation.  The TensorFlow documentation also contains comprehensive tutorials on building and managing models.  Further, understanding Python's string manipulation and formatting capabilities is vital for accurate dynamic name generation.  Finally, a thorough grasp of debugging techniques, such as using print statements for intermediate layer verification and utilizing the Python debugger, is essential for effectively diagnosing these kinds of errors.  These resources, coupled with careful code review, will equip you to confidently build and debug complex Keras models.
