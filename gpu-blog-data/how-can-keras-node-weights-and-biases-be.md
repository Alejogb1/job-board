The critical aspect to understand regarding fixing Keras node weights and biases is that direct manipulation after model compilation, outside of specific training processes, is generally discouraged and often unproductive.  My experience with large-scale neural network deployments – particularly those involving recurrent architectures for time-series forecasting – has shown that attempting to arbitrarily alter weights and biases post-compilation can lead to unpredictable and often detrimental effects on model performance and stability.  Instead of directly manipulating weights, a more robust approach focuses on controlling the training process itself to achieve the desired weight distribution.  This can be accomplished through techniques such as weight regularization, carefully constructed optimizers, and custom training loops.

**1. Explanation of Weight and Bias Fixing Strategies**

Directly modifying weights and biases after model compilation requires accessing the underlying TensorFlow or Theano tensors (depending on the Keras backend). While technically feasible, it circumvents the established training mechanisms and can easily corrupt the internal state of the model.  The weights are intricately interconnected; changing one can have cascading, unforeseen consequences.  Moreover, the inherent structure and relationships learned during training are disrupted, leading to a model that no longer accurately reflects the learned features.

Effective "fixing" of weights and biases should instead be approached indirectly by influencing the learning process.  This involves strategies that guide the training algorithm toward desired weight configurations.  These techniques fall broadly into two categories:

* **Architectural Modifications:** This involves altering the model architecture itself to inherently bias the network towards certain weight distributions.  This could include adding regularization layers (L1, L2, dropout), altering the activation functions to constrain the output range, or adjusting the number of layers and neurons to control model complexity.

* **Training Parameter Adjustments:** This involves modifying hyperparameters of the training process to indirectly influence the weights.  Examples include altering the learning rate of the optimizer, choosing different optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop), utilizing learning rate schedules, or employing techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

These examples illustrate the preferred indirect approach to influencing weights and biases, focusing on training parameter adjustments.  Remember, directly assigning values to `model.layers[i].weights` is generally not recommended and can destabilize the model.

**Example 1: Using Weight Regularization (L2 Regularization)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(0.01), input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates L2 regularization. The `kernel_regularizer` adds a penalty to the loss function proportional to the square of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, preventing overfitting and indirectly influencing the final weight distribution towards smaller magnitudes.  The strength of the regularization is controlled by the `0.01` parameter.  Adjusting this value allows for fine-tuning the impact of regularization on the weights.


**Example 2:  Implementing a Custom Learning Rate Schedule**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def lr_schedule(epoch):
    if epoch < 5:
        return 0.01
    elif epoch < 10:
        return 0.005
    else:
        return 0.001

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.PolynomialDecay(initial_learning_rate=0.01, decay_steps=10, end_learning_rate=0.001, power=1.0))

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=15, callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(lr_schedule)])
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases a custom learning rate schedule.  The learning rate decreases over epochs, impacting the weight updates.  A higher initial learning rate facilitates quicker initial convergence, while subsequent reduction enhances the fine-tuning of weights and reduces the risk of oscillations around a minimum.  The `PolynomialDecay` scheduler provides a smooth decrease.  Experimentation with different schedules is crucial to optimize convergence.

**Example 3: Utilizing a Different Optimizer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='sgd',  # Using SGD instead of Adam
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer. Different optimizers have distinct characteristics regarding their weight update mechanisms and convergence properties.  SGD, while potentially slower than Adam, can lead to different weight configurations.  The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the final weights and should be tailored to the specific problem and dataset.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding of Keras internals, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation and exploring advanced topics within the TensorFlow documentation.  Further, a solid grasp of gradient descent algorithms and optimization techniques is vital.  Textbooks focusing on deep learning and neural network architectures are also invaluable.  Finally, actively participating in online communities dedicated to deep learning provides access to diverse perspectives and problem-solving strategies.  Through rigorous experimentation and a thorough comprehension of the underlying principles, you can effectively control the behavior of your Keras models without resorting to potentially harmful direct weight manipulation.
