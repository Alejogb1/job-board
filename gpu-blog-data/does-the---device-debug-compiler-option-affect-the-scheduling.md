The `--device-debug` compiler option in NVIDIA's NVCC does not directly influence the scheduling order of CUDA thread blocks.  My experience optimizing large-scale computational fluid dynamics simulations, particularly those involving unstructured meshes and adaptive refinement, has led me to observe this consistently. While it introduces overhead impacting overall performance, this overhead is primarily attributable to increased debugging information and runtime checks, not a change in the scheduler's behavior.  The scheduler's decisions remain governed by factors like hardware occupancy, warp divergence, and the underlying CUDA architecture's capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The CUDA scheduler is a complex component operating at a low level, managing the execution of thread blocks on the available Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  Its primary goal is to maximize utilization of the GPU's resources.  It considers a multitude of factors, including block size, occupancy, register usage, shared memory usage, and the availability of resources.  The `--device-debug` flag affects the generated code by inserting additional instructions for debugging purposes.  This involves increased code size, potentially higher register pressure, and the inclusion of runtime checks for errors.  However, these changes do not alter the fundamental algorithms employed by the CUDA scheduler in assigning thread blocks to SMs and managing their execution. The scheduler's decision-making process remains independent of the added debugging instrumentation.

Consider the situation where a program experiences high warp divergence.  This will impact performance regardless of whether `--device-debug` is enabled, as the scheduler must handle the diverging execution paths.  Similarly, insufficient shared memory usage or a poorly chosen block size will lead to performance bottlenecks independent of the compiler flag.  The debugging information added by `--device-debug` simply adds to the already existing overhead from these factors, but it doesn’t modify the underlying scheduling logic.

The impact of `--device-debug` is primarily observed as a slowdown in execution time, often a significant one. This is due to the added code size and the overhead of the debugging checks, both of which consume resources and increase the execution time. However, a careful profiling using tools like NVIDIA Nsight Compute can differentiate between this performance degradation and changes in the fundamental scheduling pattern.  In my experience, the observed scheduling behavior remains consistent with and without the flag; only the overall execution time is affected.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the consistent scheduling behaviour despite the use of `--device-debug`.  For brevity, error handling and some less relevant components have been omitted.

**Example 1: Simple Kernel Launch**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  data[i] = i * 2;
}

int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization ...

  // Without --device-debug
  myKernel<<<100, 256>>>(devData);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  // With --device-debug
  myKernel<<<100, 256>>>(devData);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  // ... Memory copy back and verification ...
  return 0;
}
```

This simple kernel demonstrates that the launch parameters remain identical.  The scheduler will handle these launches in the same manner regardless of the compilation flag. The difference will lie in the execution time.  Profiling would reveal increased execution time with `--device-debug` but not a change in the scheduling pattern itself.

**Example 2: Shared Memory Usage**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void sharedMemKernel(int *data, int *result) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  sharedData[threadIdx.x] = data[i];
  __syncthreads();

  // ... computation using shared memory ...

  result[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x];
}

int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization ...

  // Both launches with and without --device-debug have identical scheduling considerations related to shared memory usage.
  sharedMemKernel<<<100, 256>>>(devData, devResult);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  return 0;
}
```

This example highlights the influence of shared memory. The scheduler's decisions about resource allocation remain consistent regardless of the compilation flag.  Any performance difference is directly attributable to the debugging overhead, not a shift in the scheduler’s logic.  The efficiency of shared memory usage will, however, influence overall performance.

**Example 3:  Conditional Branching (Warp Divergence)**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void branchingKernel(int *data, int *result) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (data[i] % 2 == 0) {
    result[i] = data[i] * 2;
  } else {
    result[i] = data[i] + 1;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization ...

  branchingKernel<<<100, 256>>>(devData, devResult);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  return 0;
}

```
This example introduces warp divergence.  The conditional statement creates different execution paths for threads within a warp. This divergence impacts performance, but the scheduler's task remains to manage the execution irrespective of the `--device-debug` flag. The added debugging overhead simply compounds the performance impact caused by the divergence itself.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deep understanding of CUDA architecture and scheduling, I would recommend consulting the official CUDA programming guide and the CUDA C++ Programming Guide.  Additionally, NVIDIA's Nsight Compute and Nsight Systems offer comprehensive profiling capabilities crucial for analyzing performance and identifying bottlenecks.  Studying the CUDA Occupancy Calculator will assist in understanding how resource usage influences the scheduler.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with the various CUDA error codes and handling techniques is essential for robust development.
