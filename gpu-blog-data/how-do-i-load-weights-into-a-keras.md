Subclassed Keras models, inheriting directly from `tf.keras.Model`, offer maximal flexibility in defining custom architectures, but their weight loading mechanisms require a slightly different approach than sequential or functional API models. Unlike models built with those APIs, which often manage weight loading through convenient `load_weights` methods tied to model definitions, subclassed models necessitate explicit state management. I've navigated this challenge extensively, particularly while constructing bespoke generative models, and the key is to ensure both model structure and weight assignment align precisely.

Fundamentally, loading weights into a subclassed Keras model involves two primary steps: ensuring that the model's layers are instantiated identically to how they were when the weights were saved, and then manually transferring the saved weights to the corresponding instantiated layers. The `load_weights` method, while sometimes applicable, doesn’t handle the complexities of custom attribute management or non-standard layer configurations typically encountered with subclassed models. This process is not automatic; it requires understanding how Keras manages model variables and how they map to the saved weight files.

A subclassed model, being a Python class, demands an instantiation process which rebuilds the computational graph before the weights can be assigned. Saving weights only captures variable values and their order within a potentially implicitly defined graph. Loading requires the exact same process to re-create the corresponding variable locations to receive the saved values. Failure to replicate the instantiation process perfectly will result in errors, typically manifesting as shape mismatches or errors relating to missing layer variables. The typical approach is to build the model, initialize the layers, and then load the saved weight values.

Let's examine a practical illustration. Assume we have a simple subclassed model representing a custom variational autoencoder (VAE). We'll build the structure, save some random weights, then reload them into a fresh instance of the same model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class VariationalEncoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim, hidden_dim=128):
        super(VariationalEncoder, self).__init__()
        self.dense_hidden = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')
        self.dense_mean = tf.keras.layers.Dense(latent_dim)
        self.dense_log_var = tf.keras.layers.Dense(latent_dim)

    def call(self, x):
        h = self.dense_hidden(x)
        mean = self.dense_mean(h)
        log_var = self.dense_log_var(h)
        return mean, log_var

class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim, hidden_dim=128, output_dim=784):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.dense_hidden = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')
        self.dense_output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, z):
        h = self.dense_hidden(z)
        out = self.dense_output(h)
        return out

class VAE(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim, hidden_dim=128, output_dim=784):
        super(VAE, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = VariationalEncoder(latent_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.decoder = Decoder(latent_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.latent_dim = latent_dim

    def reparameterize(self, mean, log_var):
        eps = tf.random.normal(shape=tf.shape(mean))
        return mean + eps * tf.exp(log_var * 0.5)

    def call(self, x):
        mean, log_var = self.encoder(x)
        z = self.reparameterize(mean, log_var)
        out = self.decoder(z)
        return out
```

In this first code segment, we establish our VAE model comprised of the encoder and decoder which themselves are subclassed models. Critically, during construction, each layer within these models is created via the `__init__` method using `tf.keras.layers`. This ensures that the model structure, including dimensions and activation functions, is fully determined. The `call` methods then implement the forward pass logic utilizing those layers, thus defining the connections between them.

Now, let's proceed to instantiate, save, and load the weights.

```python
# Instantiation and forward pass to build the model graph
latent_dim = 32
vae = VAE(latent_dim)
example_input = np.random.rand(1, 784).astype(np.float32)
vae(example_input) # Builds the graph, required before saving

# Generate random weight values and save them
weights = vae.get_weights()
np.save('vae_weights.npy', weights)

# Create a new model
vae_loaded = VAE(latent_dim)

# Execute forward pass to build the graph of the loaded model
vae_loaded(example_input) # Must build the computational graph with the *same* input shape

#Load weights and manually set them
loaded_weights = np.load('vae_weights.npy', allow_pickle=True)
vae_loaded.set_weights(loaded_weights)

#Test that values are indeed same
initial_output = vae(example_input)
loaded_output = vae_loaded(example_input)

assert np.all(np.isclose(initial_output, loaded_output))
print("Weights successfully loaded!")
```

In this second code block, the model graph is built by running a forward pass on both instances of the model using a sample input of matching shape. It is crucial to call the models using example data prior to saving the weights and again after instantiating the second model so that the internal keras tensors are properly set up. The weights are then extracted using `get_weights()`, a method automatically supported by the subclassed model, and saved using `np.save`. Then, the weights are loaded from a numpy file and transferred to a new instance of the same model `vae_loaded` with the same structure. The `set_weights` method ensures that Keras manages the transfer of the loaded weights into the appropriate layer variables, but the graph *must* be constructed *before* using this method. Finally, the output of the original and the loaded model with the same input is checked to ensure they match using `np.isclose`.

Finally, let’s explore a slightly more complex scenario with custom regularization and a custom training step. This scenario highlights how weights from subclassed models that implement custom functionality will be handled similarly:

```python
class RegularizedVAE(VAE):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim, hidden_dim=128, output_dim=784, regularization_factor=0.01):
        super(RegularizedVAE, self).__init__(latent_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.reg_factor = regularization_factor

    def call(self, x):
      mean, log_var = self.encoder(x)
      z = self.reparameterize(mean, log_var)
      out = self.decoder(z)
      kl_loss = -0.5 * tf.reduce_sum(1 + log_var - tf.square(mean) - tf.exp(log_var), axis=-1)
      reconstruction_loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(x, out), axis=-1)
      self.add_loss(tf.reduce_mean(reconstruction_loss + self.reg_factor * kl_loss))
      return out

    def train_step(self, data):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            output = self(data) # Forward pass within the training step.
            loss = sum(self.losses) #Losses added in the model itself are taken from the "losses" method
        trainable_vars = self.trainable_variables
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_vars)
        self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_vars))
        return {"loss": loss}


#Instantiate and load data with similar technique as above
latent_dim = 32
reg_vae = RegularizedVAE(latent_dim)
example_input = np.random.rand(1, 784).astype(np.float32)
reg_vae(example_input) # Builds the graph required before saving
weights = reg_vae.get_weights()
np.save('reg_vae_weights.npy', weights)


# Reinstantiate the model and load weights
reg_vae_loaded = RegularizedVAE(latent_dim)
reg_vae_loaded(example_input) # Must build the computational graph with the *same* input shape
loaded_weights = np.load('reg_vae_weights.npy', allow_pickle=True)
reg_vae_loaded.set_weights(loaded_weights)

#Test that values are indeed same
initial_output = reg_vae(example_input)
loaded_output = reg_vae_loaded(example_input)
assert np.all(np.isclose(initial_output, loaded_output))

print("Weights successfully loaded for regularized VAE!")
```
Here, we have a `RegularizedVAE` inheriting from the `VAE` model. This subclassed model is customized with custom loss calculation and a custom training step. The loading procedure remains the same; the internal layers are created during instantiation, the graph is built by making an initial forward pass, then weights are saved and loaded into a new instantiation of the same model with matching architecture. Because the underlying layer structures are the same, the weights are appropriately transferred by `set_weights`, despite the custom logic included in the `RegularizedVAE`.

In summary, loading weights into subclassed Keras models requires ensuring the model's structure is identical across saving and loading. This involves reconstructing the model graph and then using the `set_weights` method to transfer the loaded values. As demonstrated above, even custom classes and architectures can have their weights loaded so long as the model structures are equivalent, the graph is established, and the weight tensors are correctly aligned to their variable counterparts.

For further investigation, I would recommend focusing on the official TensorFlow documentation concerning `tf.keras.Model` subclassing and the associated documentation for saving and loading models. The guides on how to build and train custom models provide invaluable information. Additionally, studying the internals of how TensorFlow manages variables, especially with respect to graph construction, provides more comprehensive understanding. I also recommend exploring examples provided by the TensorFlow team to see how other complex architectures are built and how their weights are managed. Understanding these resources will bolster practical implementation of similar solutions.
