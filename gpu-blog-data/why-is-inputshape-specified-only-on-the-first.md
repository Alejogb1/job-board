The specification of `input_shape` solely on the initial `Conv2D` layer in a sequential convolutional neural network (CNN), when using Keras or TensorFlow, arises from the nature of how these frameworks handle layer connectivity and data flow. I’ve observed this firsthand while building complex image classification models, where proper understanding of input dimensions is critical for success. Keras, like many other deep learning libraries, relies on the principle of inferring shapes whenever possible to reduce redundancy and potential user error.

The foundational idea rests on the concept of tensor propagation. When you define a sequential model, each layer transforms the input it receives into an output tensor. The subsequent layer then accepts the output tensor of its preceding layer as its input. This implies that after the initial layer, the dimensions of the data are determined through internal calculations within the network rather than explicit specifications from the user. The dimensions of this initial input tensor, however, are not inherently known to the network; they must be declared. This declaration informs the first layer about the characteristics of the data it’s going to receive so it can establish the correct weight matrices, bias vectors, and activation function application procedures.

The `input_shape` parameter provides Keras with the necessary spatial dimensions for the images (or data). For example, in the case of a standard RGB image, `input_shape` might be `(height, width, channels)`, where height and width represent the image dimensions, and channels are the color channels (3 for RGB). The first convolutional layer uses this information to initialize its filters (or kernels), which are mathematical entities used to extract features from the input. These filters are defined as three-dimensional tensors; hence, the shape of the initial input informs the depth of these filters. If no `input_shape` is specified, the framework lacks the necessary information to construct these filter tensors.

After the initial layer processes this input, it produces an output tensor which is no longer the same dimensions as the original input due to the convolutional operation and any subsequent pooling or striding. Specifically, the output tensor has a different "depth," or number of channels, which correspond to the number of feature maps created by the filters. Subsequent convolutional layers implicitly learn their input shapes based on the output dimensions of the layers prior. Therefore, explicitly declaring `input_shape` for any layer after the first would be both unnecessary and lead to errors, as it would contradict the flow of information within the model. Further layers do not *need* this explicit shape; they are compatible with and receive the output of the preceding layer, provided that the data is consistent. This implicit inference of the input shape streamlines model definition, reducing the cognitive load on the user and minimizing potential inconsistencies.

Now, let’s examine some code examples to illustrate this principle.

**Example 1: Simple Image Classification CNN**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),  # input_shape specified here
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),  # input_shape NOT specified
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()
```

In this example, we define a simple CNN for a grayscale image (the channel depth is 1). The first `Conv2D` layer receives the input data with the shape (28, 28, 1), specified via `input_shape`. The second `Conv2D` does *not* specify an `input_shape`; instead, it implicitly accepts the output of the first `MaxPooling2D` layer. If we were to provide an `input_shape` to the second convolution layer, it would raise an error because that input shape is already decided internally by the model. The subsequent layers, `Flatten` and `Dense`, likewise do not require an `input_shape`. The model summary, which is a printout of layer by layer parameter counts and output shape, clearly demonstrates the change in spatial dimensions as we move deeper into the network. We can see that the output of the first `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers forms the implicit input shape for the subsequent `Conv2D` layer.

**Example 2: Handling Different Input Sizes**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model1 = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model2 = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model1.summary()
model2.summary()
```

Here, we illustrate flexibility. We construct two models with the same architecture, except for the `input_shape` of the first layer.  `model1` is initialized to handle a 64x64 RGB input, while `model2` handles a 128x128 RGB input. Notice that the other layers remain the same. This further demonstrates that `input_shape`’s role is to define the very first input data characteristics to the network. The framework utilizes this information to make necessary calculations of the weights during training and it makes assumptions about the implicit input shapes for subsequent layers.

**Example 3: Incorrect `input_shape` usage (demonstrating error)**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

try:
    model = keras.Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(26, 26, 3)), #incorrect usage
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This final example showcases the error case when we incorrectly specify an `input_shape` for a second convolution layer. Keras detects that the output of the preceding `MaxPooling2D` layer does not match the explicitly provided `input_shape`, and an error is thrown, typically related to tensor shape mismatches. This highlights the rule that `input_shape` is reserved for the *first* layer and any other usage is likely incorrect. The error message clearly illustrates that the expected shape of the input tensor for the second `Conv2D` is derived from the output of the first `MaxPooling2D`, rather than the user-provided value.

For further learning, I would recommend exploring resources on convolutional neural network architecture, specifically focusing on feature map generation, pooling, and the concept of receptive fields. Textbooks on deep learning often contain a chapter on this. Additionally, the official Keras documentation provides ample explanation regarding `Sequential` model building and layer specification. Exploring the code of practical image classification examples on repositories such as Github can also provide a useful hands-on understanding. Furthermore, studying advanced neural network architectures that utilize alternative layer definitions can help reinforce your understanding of the importance of implicit shape inference when building a model.
