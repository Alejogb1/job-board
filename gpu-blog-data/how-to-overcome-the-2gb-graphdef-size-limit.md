The 2GB GraphDef size limitation in TensorFlow, particularly when dealing with extensive image transformations, stems from the serialized representation of the computation graph itself.  My experience optimizing large-scale image processing pipelines for satellite imagery analysis has highlighted this constraint frequently. The sheer number of operations involved in complex transformations, combined with the size of the input tensors, can quickly exceed this limit.  Overcoming this isn't about simply finding a larger memory space; it's about fundamentally restructuring the computation graph and leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities to manage the computational burden more efficiently.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The primary cause of exceeding the 2GB limit is the graph's representation of the entire computation, including all operations, variables, and their interconnections.  When performing numerous image transformations sequentially, a naive approach creates a monolithic graph. This single, large graph, when serialized into a `GraphDef` protocol buffer, easily surpasses the 2GB limit. The solution involves employing techniques that modularize the computation, allowing for the processing of smaller, more manageable subgraphs.  This reduces both the memory footprint and the serialization overhead.

Three primary strategies are highly effective:

* **Graph Partitioning:** Divide the overall transformation pipeline into smaller, independent subgraphs. This can be done based on logical units of the processing. For instance, separate preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization) from the core transformation (e.g., convolutional neural network inference) and post-processing (result aggregation). Each subgraph can then be saved and loaded independently, circumventing the single-graph size limitation.

* **TFRecord Datasets:**  For large datasets, loading all images into memory simultaneously is infeasible and exacerbates the GraphDef size issue. Utilizing TFRecord datasets is critical.  This allows loading and processing images in batches, significantly reducing memory consumption. By processing data in manageable chunks, the computational graph for each batch remains smaller.

* **Variable Scope Management:**  Proper use of `tf.variable_scope` and `tf.name_scope` is crucial for organizing variables and operations within the graph.  Careful naming conventions prevent unintended variable duplication, thus reducing the graph's complexity and overall size.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Graph Partitioning with separate preprocessing and inference.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def preprocess_image(image):
  # Resize, normalize, and other preprocessing steps
  image = tf.image.resize(image, [224, 224])
  image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)
  image = tf.subtract(image, 0.5)
  image = tf.multiply(image, 2.0)
  return image

def inference_model(image):
  # Define your inference model here (e.g., CNN)
  # ... your model definition ...
  return predictions

# Create input placeholder
input_image = tf.placeholder(tf.uint8, shape=[None, None, None, 3])

# Preprocessing subgraph
preprocessed_image = preprocess_image(input_image)

# Inference subgraph
with tf.variable_scope("inference"):
  predictions = inference_model(preprocessed_image)

# Save the preprocessing graph separately
tf.saved_model.save(
    tf.compat.v1.Session(),
    "preprocess_model",
    signatures={
        "preprocess": tf.function(preprocess_image).get_concrete_function(
            tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, None, None, 3], dtype=tf.uint8)
        )
    }
)

# Save the inference graph separately
tf.saved_model.save(
    tf.compat.v1.Session(),
    "inference_model",
    signatures={
        "inference": tf.function(inference_model).get_concrete_function(
            tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 224, 224, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
        )
    }
)

```

This example demonstrates how to separate the preprocessing and inference stages. Each stage is saved as a separate SavedModel, preventing a single, massive GraphDef.


**Example 2: Using TFRecord Datasets for efficient batch processing.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a function to create a TFRecord dataset
def create_tfrecord_dataset(tfrecord_path):
    dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(tfrecord_path)
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: parse_tfrecord_example(x)) #parse_tfrecord_example is a user-defined function to parse the record
    return dataset

# Assuming parse_tfrecord_example function is defined elsewhere
# ...definition of parse_tfrecord_example function...

# Create TFRecord dataset
dataset = create_tfrecord_dataset("images.tfrecord")

# Batch the dataset
batched_dataset = dataset.batch(32)

# Process the dataset in batches
for batch in batched_dataset:
    # Perform image transformations on the batch
    # ... your image transformation logic ...
```

This example demonstrates utilizing `TFRecordDataset` to load and process images in batches.  The computational graph for processing each batch remains relatively small, preventing the GraphDef from growing excessively.


**Example 3:  Efficient Variable Scope Management.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("model_a") as scope:
  layer1 = tf.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation=tf.nn.relu, name="conv1")
  layer2 = tf.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation=tf.nn.relu, name="conv2")
  scope.reuse_variables() # Reuse variables for model B, this reduces graph size compared to creating identical layers separately
  layer3 = tf.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation=tf.nn.relu, name="conv1")
  layer4 = tf.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation=tf.nn.relu, name="conv2")

```

This illustrates using `tf.variable_scope` to effectively manage variables, promoting reusability and preventing unnecessary duplication within the graph. The use of `scope.reuse_variables()` clearly showcases how to reuse layers without redefining them, leading to smaller graph sizes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable for understanding graph construction, variable management, and dataset handling.  Books on deep learning, particularly those focusing on TensorFlow implementation, provide in-depth explanations of efficient graph design and optimization strategies.  Furthermore, exploring advanced TensorFlow concepts like custom estimators and TensorFlow Extended (TFX) will further enhance the understanding of handling and managing larger datasets and computational graphs.  Familiarity with protocol buffer serialization will also prove beneficial.
