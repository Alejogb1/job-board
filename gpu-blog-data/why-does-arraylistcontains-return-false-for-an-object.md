The root cause of `ArrayList.contains()` returning `false` for an object, even when seemingly identical, almost invariably stems from a misunderstanding of how `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods function within the object's class.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous Java projects, particularly those involving custom object hierarchies, has highlighted this consistent pitfall.  The `contains()` method, at its core, utilizes these two methods to determine object equality.  Failure to correctly override them leads to inaccurate comparisons, resulting in the unexpected `false` return.

**1. A Clear Explanation**

`ArrayList.contains()` doesn't directly compare objects using the `==` operator (referential equality). Instead, it leverages the object's own `equals()` method to determine whether an object is present within the list.  If the object's `equals()` method isn't overridden to perform a meaningful comparison based on the object's attributes, it defaults to the `Object` class's implementation, which performs referential equality.  This means it checks if the references are the same, not if the object's *content* is the same.

Furthermore, the `hashCode()` method plays a crucial role.  The `ArrayList` (and other hash-based collections) use the hash code to quickly locate potential matches before calling `equals()`.  If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, they *must* have the same hash code.  Violating this contract severely impacts performance and can lead to `contains()` returning `false` even when an equal object exists within the list.

In essence, for `ArrayList.contains()` to function correctly with custom objects, you must carefully consider and implement both `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods.  The `equals()` method should define what constitutes "equality" for your objects based on their internal state, while the `hashCode()` method must ensure that equal objects have equal hash codes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation**

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    //Missing equals() and hashCode() methods
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
        people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
        Person alice2 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println(people.contains(alice2)); // Prints false
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the problem.  The `Person` class lacks the crucial `equals()` and `hashCode()` overrides.  Therefore, `contains()` only checks for referential equality, finding that `alice2` is a distinct object from the one added initially, even though their attributes are the same.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation**

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
        people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
        Person alice2 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println(people.contains(alice2)); // Prints true
    }
}
```

Here, the `equals()` method compares the `name` and `age` attributes.  The `hashCode()` method, using `Objects.hash()`, generates a hash code based on these attributes ensuring the contract is satisfied. This leads to `contains()` correctly identifying the presence of an equal object.


**Example 3: Handling Null Values**

```java
class Product {
    String name;
    String description;

    public Product(String name, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Product product = (Product) o;
        return Objects.equals(name, product.name) && Objects.equals(description, product.description);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, description);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
        products.add(new Product("Widget", null));
        Product widget2 = new Product("Widget", null);
        System.out.println(products.contains(widget2)); //Prints true

        Product widget3 = new Product("Widget", "A thing");
        System.out.println(products.contains(widget3)); // Prints false

    }
}
```

This example highlights the importance of null-safe comparisons within `equals()`. Using `Objects.equals()` handles potential `NullPointerExceptions` gracefully when comparing strings that might be null.  The second `println` statement shows that a difference in `description` properly results in `false`.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

Effective Java (Joshua Bloch): This book thoroughly covers best practices for object-oriented programming in Java, including detailed explanations of `equals()` and `hashCode()` and their implications.

Java Core Libraries Documentation:  The official documentation provides precise specifications for the `ArrayList` class and its methods, including the behavior of `contains()`.  Thorough examination of this documentation offers vital clarity.

A good introductory textbook on Data Structures and Algorithms. Understanding the underlying principles of hash tables will help clarify the role of `hashCode()` in the performance of `ArrayList.contains()`.
