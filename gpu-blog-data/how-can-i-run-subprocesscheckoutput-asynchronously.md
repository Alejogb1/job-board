The `subprocess.check_output` function in Python is inherently synchronous, meaning it blocks the calling thread until the subprocess completes. This behavior becomes problematic when dealing with I/O-bound operations like external process execution within concurrent or asynchronous programs. Directly using `check_output` in an asynchronous context severely degrades performance, negating the benefits of asynchrony by introducing blocking. Therefore, to achieve asynchronous execution of external commands, we must employ alternative strategies that integrate well with Pythonâ€™s asynchronous programming paradigms.

The core challenge lies in circumventing the blocking nature of `subprocess.check_output`. A synchronous call waits for completion, preventing other tasks from progressing. Asynchronous programming, conversely, relies on a non-blocking model, allowing multiple tasks to proceed without waiting idly for I/O operations to finish. This can be accomplished by leveraging Python's `asyncio` library, combined with mechanisms to run blocking operations in separate threads or processes.

The primary approach I typically use is to delegate the execution of the external command to a separate thread using `asyncio.to_thread`. This maintains the asynchronous nature of the main event loop, while the actual blocking operation runs concurrently within another thread.

The first example illustrates how to execute a command asynchronously using `asyncio.to_thread`. Assume a hypothetical command named `my_command` that takes a significant amount of time to complete.

```python
import asyncio
import subprocess

async def run_command_async(command):
    """
    Runs a shell command asynchronously using asyncio.to_thread.

    Args:
        command (str): The shell command to execute.

    Returns:
        bytes: The output of the command.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the command returns a non-zero exit code.
    """
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    return await loop.run_in_executor(
        None,  # Use the default thread pool executor
        lambda: subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True)
    )


async def main():
  try:
      output = await run_command_async("my_command")
      print("Command output:", output.decode())
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error: Command failed with return code {e.returncode}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, `run_command_async` accepts a shell command string. Within the function, `asyncio.to_thread` is used to offload the blocking call to `subprocess.check_output` into a separate thread. This ensures that the main asyncio event loop remains responsive, allowing other asynchronous operations to proceed concurrently. A `try-except` block catches potential `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exceptions, handling command failures gracefully. This specific implementation utilizes a default thread pool executor.

Another useful approach involves using the `asyncio.subprocess` module directly for more granular control. This allows setting up asynchronous streams for input, output, and error handling of subprocesses. However, `asyncio.subprocess` requires working with streams instead of direct output retrieval like `check_output`, hence it is not a drop-in replacement. The following code snippet demonstrates how to achieve asynchronous output collection using this module:

```python
import asyncio

async def run_command_async_stream(command):
    """
    Runs a shell command asynchronously using asyncio.subprocess.

    Args:
        command (str): The shell command to execute.

    Returns:
        str: The combined standard output and standard error of the command.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the command returns a non-zero exit code.
    """
    process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
        command,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE
    )

    stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()
    if process.returncode != 0:
        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(process.returncode, command, output=stdout, stderr=stderr)
    return (stdout + stderr).decode()


async def main_stream():
  try:
    output = await run_command_async_stream("my_command")
    print("Command output:", output)
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error: Command failed with return code {e.returncode}")
        print(f"Error Output:\n{e.output.decode()}")
        print(f"Error Error:\n{e.stderr.decode()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main_stream())
```
In this code, `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` is employed to launch the subprocess. Standard output and standard error are redirected to pipes, allowing for asynchronous reading.  `process.communicate()` retrieves both streams and waits until the process completes. Notably, the combined output is returned; handling standard error separately can be easily done when needed based on the specific requirements. Proper error handling is essential; the code explicitly raises `CalledProcessError` if the subprocess exits with a non-zero code. This allows the calling program to identify process failures, including the error output from the command itself.

Finally, consider using external libraries that provide asynchronous capabilities for working with subprocesses. One common solution is the `aiofiles` library, which can be helpful when dealing with file I/O that might occur when launching or handling the outputs of external processes. A basic scenario is when an output needs to be written to a file asynchronously. This can involve the `subprocess` calls previously illustrated, and it makes sense to combine it with asynchronous file operations.

```python
import asyncio
import subprocess
import aiofiles

async def run_command_async_to_file(command, output_file):
    """
    Runs a shell command asynchronously and writes the output to a file.

    Args:
        command (str): The shell command to execute.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the command returns a non-zero exit code.
    """
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    output = await loop.run_in_executor(
        None,
        lambda: subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True)
    )

    async with aiofiles.open(output_file, mode='wb') as f:
        await f.write(output)

async def main_file():
  try:
    await run_command_async_to_file("my_command", "output.txt")
    print("Command executed, output written to output.txt")
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error: Command failed with return code {e.returncode}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main_file())

```
Here, the previous threading strategy is utilized to execute the external command, and its output is captured. The output is then written to a specified file using the `aiofiles` library, which allows writing the data without blocking the main asyncio loop. This example shows the benefits of combining asynchronous techniques for both subprocess management and file I/O, essential for many real-world applications.

For further exploration of these concepts, I recommend referring to the Python standard library documentation for `asyncio` and `subprocess`. Furthermore, the documentation for external libraries like `aiofiles` and others providing asyncio-compatible functionality should be consulted for best practices when dealing with different scenarios. Understanding the subtleties of asynchronous programming is crucial for efficient resource usage and building responsive applications, so practical experimentation is highly beneficial. These approaches provide alternatives to the synchronous nature of `subprocess.check_output` when integrating with asynchronous workflows.
