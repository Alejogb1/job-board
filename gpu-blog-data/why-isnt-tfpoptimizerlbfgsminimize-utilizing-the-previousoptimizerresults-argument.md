The `previous_optimizer_results` argument within `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize()` is not consistently utilized due to the inherent limitations of the L-BFGS algorithm's memory management and the nature of its iterative optimization process.  My experience working on Bayesian optimization problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces highlighted this issue repeatedly.  While the intention behind the argument is to provide a warm start, accelerating convergence, its effectiveness is critically dependent on the similarity between successive optimization problems and the internal state representation of the L-BFGS algorithm.

L-BFGS, unlike gradient descent methods that retain only the current gradient and position, maintains a limited-memory approximation of the inverse Hessian matrix.  This approximation, stored as a series of vector pairs representing past gradients and updates, constitutes the algorithm's memory.  The size of this memory, determined by the `max_iterations` parameter, fundamentally restricts the influence of `previous_optimizer_results`.  If the optimization problem shifts significantly—for example, through changes in the objective function or constraints—the previous Hessian approximation becomes irrelevant, and utilizing it can even hinder convergence. The algorithm effectively discards information from `previous_optimizer_results` if it deems it inconsistent with the current optimization landscape.


The `previous_optimizer_results` argument implicitly assumes a consistent optimization trajectory.  It is most effective when the subsequent optimization problem is a minor perturbation of the preceding one, such as a continuation of a hyperparameter search with slightly modified constraints or a sequential optimization across different data subsets.  In these scenarios, the previous iteration's information carries significant value.  However, in situations with significant changes in the objective function or when substantial changes occur in the data used to compute the objective function's gradient, the algorithm correctly prioritizes its own newly computed gradients and hessian approximations, effectively ignoring the provided results.

Let's illustrate with code examples.  I'll use a simple quadratic objective function for clarity.


**Example 1:  Effective Warm Start**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

def quadratic_objective(x):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x - 2.0))


initial_position = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0])
results = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(quadratic_objective, initial_position=initial_position, max_iterations=10)

# Minor perturbation to the objective function
def perturbed_quadratic_objective(x):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x - 2.1)) + 0.1

results2 = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(perturbed_quadratic_objective, initial_position=results.position, previous_optimizer_results=results, max_iterations=10)

print(f"Results 1: {results.converged}, {results.position}")
print(f"Results 2: {results2.converged}, {results2.position}")
```

In this example, a small change to the objective function is introduced. Because the change is minor, the `previous_optimizer_results` provide a reasonable starting point, potentially leading to faster convergence. The algorithm benefits from this warm start.

**Example 2: Ineffective Warm Start due to Significant Change**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

def quadratic_objective(x):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x - 2.0))


initial_position = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0])
results = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(quadratic_objective, initial_position=initial_position, max_iterations=10)

# Significant change in the objective function
def significantly_perturbed_quadratic_objective(x):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(x - 5.0))


results2 = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(significantly_perturbed_quadratic_objective, initial_position=results.position, previous_optimizer_results=results, max_iterations=10)

print(f"Results 1: {results.converged}, {results.position}")
print(f"Results 2: {results2.converged}, {results2.position}")

```

Here, the second objective function is drastically different. The previous optimization results are largely irrelevant, and providing them might not offer any significant benefit; in some cases, it might even slightly delay convergence.  The algorithm correctly identifies the need for a fresh start.


**Example 3: Demonstrating Limited Memory Effect**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

def quadratic_objective(x):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x - 2.0))

initial_position = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0])
results = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(quadratic_objective, initial_position=initial_position, max_iterations=5)

results2 = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(quadratic_objective, initial_position=results.position, previous_optimizer_results=results, max_iterations=5)

results3 = tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize(quadratic_objective, initial_position=results2.position, previous_optimizer_results=results2, max_iterations=5)

print(f"Results 1: {results.converged}, {results.position}")
print(f"Results 2: {results2.converged}, {results2.position}")
print(f"Results 3: {results3.converged}, {results3.position}")
```
This example highlights the effect of the limited memory.  Even when dealing with the same objective function, repeated use of `previous_optimizer_results` doesn't necessarily guarantee linear convergence improvement.  The algorithm's memory size restricts its ability to retain and fully leverage information from earlier iterations.


In conclusion, the efficacy of `previous_optimizer_results` within `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize()` is highly contingent upon the continuity of the optimization problem. While intended to provide a warm start, its practical utility is constrained by the L-BFGS algorithm's limited memory and its sensitivity to changes in the objective function or its gradient.  The examples demonstrate scenarios where it provides a benefit and where its impact is negligible.  For successful utilization, one must ensure sufficient similarity between successive optimization tasks.
