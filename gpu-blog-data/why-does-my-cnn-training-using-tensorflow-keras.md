TensorFlow/Keras GPU utilization on Ubuntu 20.04, particularly concerning seemingly random GPU restarts during CNN training, frequently stems from resource contention and improper driver configuration, not necessarily inherent flaws within the TensorFlow framework itself.  In my experience troubleshooting this across various projects – including a large-scale image classification task involving satellite imagery and a smaller-scale medical image segmentation project – the issue consistently revolved around the interplay between TensorFlow's memory management, CUDA driver settings, and the overall system load.

**1.  Explanation:**

The problem manifests because TensorFlow, by default, aggressively allocates GPU memory.  When training deep CNNs, especially on large datasets, the memory demand can surge rapidly.  If the CUDA driver encounters an unexpected memory allocation request – exceeding available resources, or encountering fragmentation issues – it might trigger a defensive mechanism, restarting the GPU to reclaim memory and prevent system instability.  This isn't necessarily an error within TensorFlow; rather, it's a consequence of insufficient resources or improperly configured resource management.  Contributing factors often include:

* **Insufficient GPU VRAM:** The most obvious cause.  Training large CNNs requires substantial VRAM. If your GPU doesn't possess sufficient memory, or if other processes consume significant portions of it, TensorFlow's attempts to allocate further memory might lead to the restart.
* **CUDA Driver Version Mismatch:** Incompatibilities between the CUDA toolkit version, the NVIDIA driver version, and TensorFlow's CUDA support can trigger unpredictable behavior, including GPU restarts.  Ensuring all components are compatible and up-to-date is crucial.
* **Memory Fragmentation:**  Over time, repeated memory allocation and deallocation can lead to fragmentation.  This means available memory is scattered in small, unusable chunks, preventing TensorFlow from allocating the contiguous blocks it requires.  This can also manifest as out-of-memory errors.
* **System Load:** High CPU usage or disk I/O contention can negatively impact GPU performance and exacerbate memory allocation problems.  Background processes consuming resources can indirectly trigger the GPU restarts.
* **Incorrect TensorFlow Configuration:**  Improper settings within the TensorFlow configuration, particularly those related to memory growth and GPU device selection, can lead to inefficient memory usage and ultimately, restarts.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate approaches to mitigate the issue.  Each tackles a different aspect of the problem.


**Example 1:  Limiting Memory Growth (Recommended Approach):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

# ... rest of your model building and training code ...
```

This code snippet uses `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)`. This allows TensorFlow to dynamically grow the memory usage as needed, preventing it from immediately requesting the entire GPU memory at the start of training, thereby reducing the likelihood of exceeding available VRAM and triggering a restart.


**Example 2:  Specifying GPU Device and Memory Limits:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Select a specific GPU
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU') # Use only the first GPU
        tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(
            gpus[0],
            [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=4096)]) # Limit to 4GB VRAM
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)

# ... rest of your model building and training code ...
```

This example demonstrates specifying a particular GPU (`gpus[0]`) and limiting its available memory (`memory_limit=4096`).  Adjust `memory_limit` to suit your GPU's capacity and your training needs.  This approach can be beneficial if you have multiple GPUs and want to dedicate a specific amount of memory to your training process.


**Example 3:  Using a Smaller Batch Size:**

```python
# ... your model definition ...

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32) # reduced batch size
```

Reducing the `batch_size` decreases the amount of memory required for each training step. Smaller batch sizes generally require less VRAM, thus reducing the strain on GPU memory and lowering the risk of restarts. Experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal balance between training speed and memory consumption.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

1.  The official TensorFlow documentation.  Pay close attention to sections on GPU configuration and memory management.
2.  The NVIDIA CUDA documentation.  Familiarize yourself with CUDA driver installation and configuration.  Understanding the CUDA toolkit is crucial for effective GPU utilization.
3.  A comprehensive guide to Linux system administration, particularly covering process management and resource monitoring.  Being able to effectively monitor system resource usage is key to identifying bottlenecks.


By systematically investigating these aspects – ensuring sufficient VRAM, correctly configuring the CUDA driver, utilizing TensorFlow's memory management features, and understanding overall system load – you can effectively address and prevent GPU restarts during CNN training within your TensorFlow/Keras environment.  Remember to monitor GPU utilization during training using tools like `nvidia-smi` to identify potential resource conflicts.  Addressing memory fragmentation indirectly might require optimizing your data loading strategies to reduce the need for excessive memory allocation and deallocation cycles.
