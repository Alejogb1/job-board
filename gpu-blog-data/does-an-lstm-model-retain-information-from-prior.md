The recurrent nature of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks does not automatically guarantee the retention of information across *independent* training iterations, even though the cell state and hidden state maintain information across *time steps* within a single sequence during forward propagation. The key distinction here is between temporal dependencies within a sequence (the typical use case of LSTMs) and inter-iteration dependencies during iterative training (where multiple epochs process the same dataset). While information from previous iterations *influences* model weights, it's not directly "stored" in the way it is within a single sequence.

The weights of an LSTM network are modified during each training iteration based on the backpropagated error. The gradient descent algorithm updates these weights aiming to reduce the loss function. This means each iteration nudges the network parameters toward a configuration that better represents the observed data for the given iteration (or epoch). The "memory" from past training, in this sense, is only embodied within the *current state* of the weights, not in a dedicated memory system that persists between independent training runs.

To clarify further, imagine you train an LSTM on a dataset, save the model, and then load it and train it again with the *same* dataset, or a new one. During that second training run, the initial weights are not randomly initialized but are loaded from the saved model. The initial state of the LSTM is still initialized to zero. The training procedure begins afresh from this point. There's no direct memory of the gradients or the error surfaces encountered in the prior training session. However, the prior training has informed the starting weights for this new process. It's an indirect influence, not an active recall of the past.

The LSTM's cell state, essential for remembering long sequences within one pass of the forward calculation, is not maintained *between* training iterations. Instead, it is typically reset at the beginning of each training sequence (or batch). The cell state, along with the hidden state, is primarily concerned with managing information within the temporal dimension of an input sequence during a given training pass. The updated weights from each training iteration is the sole carrier of training history between iterations.

Let's illustrate with some conceptual code examples using a hypothetical Python interface. I will not use a specific framework to focus on the core principles. Assume our environment provides `LSTMCell`, which is a single LSTM cell, `dense_layer` for final output mapping, and `loss` for calculating the error:

**Example 1: Single Training Iteration**

```python
def train_single_iteration(lstm_cell, input_sequence, target_sequence, weights, learning_rate):
    batch_size = input_sequence.shape[0]
    sequence_length = input_sequence.shape[1]
    
    hidden_state = initialize_zeros((batch_size, lstm_cell.hidden_size))
    cell_state = initialize_zeros((batch_size, lstm_cell.hidden_size))

    outputs = []
    for t in range(sequence_length):
        input_t = input_sequence[:,t,:]
        hidden_state, cell_state = lstm_cell.forward(input_t, hidden_state, cell_state, weights)
        output_t = dense_layer.forward(hidden_state, weights['output_weights'])
        outputs.append(output_t)

    loss_value = loss(outputs, target_sequence)
    
    #Backprop and weight update logic is omitted for clarity, assumed to be implemented
    updated_weights =  backpropagation(loss_value, outputs, weights, learning_rate) 
    
    return updated_weights
```
In this snippet, we see the forward pass through the LSTM cell within a single sequence in one iteration. `hidden_state` and `cell_state` are initialized at the start of *this* sequence, and do not carry over information from previous iterations. This loop operates on the temporal dimension, handling one sequence. The changes to the weights after backpropagation is the sole mechanism that influences subsequent training iterations.

**Example 2: Multi-Iteration Training Loop**
```python
def train_multiple_iterations(lstm_cell, input_data, target_data, initial_weights, learning_rate, num_iterations):
    current_weights = initial_weights
    for iteration in range(num_iterations):
        input_sequence = input_data[iteration % len(input_data)]  #Simplified batch selection for example
        target_sequence = target_data[iteration % len(target_data)]
        current_weights = train_single_iteration(lstm_cell, input_sequence, target_sequence, current_weights, learning_rate)
    
    return current_weights
```
Here, the function emphasizes the iterative nature.  The model starts from `initial_weights`, possibly pre-trained, and updates them after each call to `train_single_iteration`. Each call has no direct memory of gradients calculated previously. Only the modified `current_weights` carry any remnant of prior iterations. If we initialize the `current_weights` to random values each time the `train_multiple_iterations` is invoked, it would result in a completely new model, devoid of any historical learning.

**Example 3: Demonstrating Persistence of Learned Weights**

```python
def save_weights(weights, filename):
   # Placeholder for saving weights. Actual implementation would depend on storage format.
   pass

def load_weights(filename):
   # Placeholder for loading weights
   return {} 
 
 # Training the Model
 initial_weights = initialize_random_weights(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
 trained_weights = train_multiple_iterations(lstm_cell, train_input_data, train_target_data, initial_weights, learning_rate, num_iterations=1000)

 save_weights(trained_weights, "model.weights")

 #Load the model and Continue Training
 loaded_weights = load_weights("model.weights")
 further_trained_weights = train_multiple_iterations(lstm_cell, train_input_data, train_target_data, loaded_weights, learning_rate, num_iterations=500) 
```

In this example, the saved model's learned state is embodied in the `trained_weights` variable which is then loaded and used for further training.  The new training process starts from where the other left off, directly affecting performance. Without this mechanism, each new training run would start from the same initial weights, effectively forgetting past learning experience.

In summary, LSTMs do not "remember" information directly across independent training iterations via a dedicated memory structure akin to the cell state within a sequence. Instead, the model's knowledge from previous training epochs is consolidated within the modified network weights.  When a saved model’s weights are loaded, it's akin to transferring the effects of past training into the model’s start point for current training.

For further exploration, I recommend studying literature on optimization algorithms used in neural networks, particularly variants of gradient descent. Detailed explanations of backpropagation through time (BPTT) for recurrent networks will solidify your understanding of how the gradients are calculated and how the weights are modified. Investigating practical examples in common libraries, examining saving and loading functionality, will help connect these theoretical concepts to real-world applications. The mechanisms of how optimization algorithms interact with the structure of an LSTM are crucial for a deep comprehension of the process.  Researching model checkpointing and how training is often interrupted and resumed will also bring clarity to how intermediate states are captured and used.
