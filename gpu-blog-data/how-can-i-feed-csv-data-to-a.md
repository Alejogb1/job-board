Feeding CSV data directly to a 1D convolutional layer requires careful preprocessing.  My experience working on time-series anomaly detection highlighted the crucial role of data transformation before convolutional processing.  Raw CSV data, lacking inherent spatial structure suitable for convolution, necessitates restructuring into a format that reflects the underlying temporal or sequential relationships.  This involves understanding the data's nature â€“ specifically, whether the CSV represents a single time series, multiple independent series, or a series with multiple channels (features).

**1. Data Preprocessing and Restructuring:**

The first step involves importing the CSV using a suitable library like Pandas.  Assume the CSV contains a single time series, where each row represents a time step and a single column represents the measured value.  Directly feeding this to a convolutional layer would be incorrect, as the convolutional kernel would operate on individual numbers without considering their temporal context.  Instead, the data needs to be reshaped into a three-dimensional tensor suitable for a 1D convolution.  This tensor will have dimensions (samples, time_steps, channels), where:

* **samples:** Represents the number of independent time series samples (or segments from a single long series).  If processing a single long series, we'll create multiple overlapping or non-overlapping segments to create multiple samples.
* **time_steps:**  The length of each time series segment.
* **channels:** The number of features at each time step (in this case, 1, as we have only one value per time step).

For multiple time series in the CSV, each column (excluding an identifier column if present) represents a separate series and would form a channel. For multiple features within a time step, each feature will be a channel.  This restructuring is crucial for effective convolutional processing.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Single Time Series, Multiple Segments**

This example demonstrates the process of creating multiple segments from a single long time series:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load data from CSV
data = pd.read_csv("timeseries.csv", header=None).values.flatten()

# Define segment length and step size
segment_length = 100
step_size = 50

# Create segments
segments = []
for i in range(0, len(data) - segment_length + 1, step_size):
    segment = data[i:i + segment_length]
    segments.append(segment)

# Reshape into 3D tensor
X = np.array(segments).reshape(-1, segment_length, 1)

# X now holds the data in the required format (samples, time_steps, channels)
print(X.shape)
```

This code reads data, creates overlapping segments of length `segment_length` with a step size of `step_size`, and reshapes them into a 3D tensor.  Adjusting `segment_length` and `step_size` controls the number of samples and the level of temporal context captured.  Note the use of `reshape(-1, segment_length, 1)` to automatically calculate the number of samples based on the available data.

**Example 2: Multiple Independent Time Series**

If the CSV has multiple independent time series in separate columns, the preprocessing is slightly different:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("multipleseries.csv", header=None).values

# Transpose to have time steps as rows and series as columns
data = data.T

# Reshape (assuming each series is of equal length)
X = data.reshape(-1, data.shape[1], 1)

#X now holds the data in the required format (samples, time_steps, channels).
print(X.shape)

```

This code transposes the data to align it correctly for reshaping, ensuring that each series becomes a channel in the final tensor.  The assumption here is that each time series within the CSV is of the same length.  Error handling for differing lengths would be necessary in a production environment.

**Example 3: Time Series with Multiple Features**

For time series with multiple features per time step, the CSV should have a column for each feature, and each row represents a single time step.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load data from CSV (assuming first column is timestamp)
data = pd.read_csv("multifeature.csv").iloc[:, 1:].values

# Reshape into 3D tensor (samples, time_steps, channels)
X = data.reshape(-1, data.shape[0], data.shape[1])

#X holds data in the required format (samples, time_steps, channels).
print(X.shape)
```

This example assumes the first column is a timestamp or identifier which we exclude.  The resulting tensor's channel dimension now reflects the number of features in the original CSV.


**3.  Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I suggest consulting textbooks on time-series analysis, deep learning, and signal processing.  Hands-on experience is crucial, so practicing with sample datasets and experimenting with different convolutional architectures is recommended.   Referencing documentation for libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Keras (or TensorFlow/PyTorch) is vital for code implementation and understanding data manipulation techniques.  Furthermore, understanding the mathematical foundations of convolution and its application to sequential data is key for proper implementation and interpretation of results.  This includes familiarizing yourself with concepts like padding, strides, and different kernel sizes.
