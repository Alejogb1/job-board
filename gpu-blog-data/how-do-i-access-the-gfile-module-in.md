The `gfile` module in TensorFlow, prior to TensorFlow 2.x, provided file I/O functionalities independent of the broader TensorFlow ecosystem.  Its direct access, circumventing `tensorflow.io`, relies on understanding its historical context and the changes introduced with the transition to a more modular architecture.  In my experience developing large-scale TensorFlow models for natural language processing, I encountered this issue repeatedly during the migration from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x. The core challenge stems from the reorganization of the library;  `gfile` was effectively deprecated, its functionality absorbed into, and largely superseded by, the `tensorflow.io` module.  Direct access without `tensorflow.io` now requires utilizing lower-level file handling mechanisms, which are less convenient but offer a way to maintain compatibility with older codebases.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `gfile` module's purpose was to provide a consistent file I/O interface across different operating systems and file systems.  This abstraction layer shielded developers from platform-specific details, ensuring portability. However, this abstraction introduced a dependency that later proved problematic with the library's evolution. TensorFlow 2.x emphasized modularity, separating functionalities into distinct packages.  The `gfile` module's functionality was deemed redundant due to the availability of Python's built-in file I/O and other more robust, platform-independent libraries.  Therefore, the recommended approach is to leverage the built-in Python methods or libraries designed for handling diverse file systems.  However, for backward compatibility with legacy code, understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial.  Direct access, in essence, requires mimicking the behavior of `gfile` using native Python functionality.

The key is to recognize that `gfile` primarily provided functionalities for opening files (reading and writing), listing directories, and checking file existence.  These operations can be replicated using the `os` and `io` modules in standard Python.  The only significant difference lies in the potential lack of specialized handling for certain file systems that `gfile` might have previously addressed.  For most common use cases, this difference is negligible.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  File Existence Check**

```python
import os

def gfile_exists(filepath):
    """Mimics gfile.exists functionality."""
    return os.path.exists(filepath)

# Example usage
filepath = "my_file.txt"
if gfile_exists(filepath):
    print(f"File '{filepath}' exists.")
else:
    print(f"File '{filepath}' does not exist.")
```

This code snippet demonstrates replacing `gfile.exists` with `os.path.exists`.  This straightforward substitution leverages the standard library's capability to check for the existence of a file at a specified path.  The functionality remains the same, ensuring seamless replacement.

**Example 2: Reading a Text File**

```python
import io

def gfile_read(filepath):
    """Mimics gfile.GFile.read functionality for text files."""
    try:
      with io.open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
          contents = f.read()
      return contents
    except FileNotFoundError:
      return None

# Example Usage
file_contents = gfile_read("my_file.txt")
if file_contents:
    print(file_contents)
else:
    print("File not found or inaccessible.")

```

This example mimics `gfile.GFile.read()` using Python's `io.open()`.  The `encoding='utf-8'` argument ensures proper handling of text files. The `try-except` block gracefully handles potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions, improving robustness compared to a direct `open()` call.  It's important to handle potential exceptions appropriately for production-ready code.

**Example 3: Writing to a Binary File**

```python
import io

def gfile_write_binary(filepath, data):
    """Mimics gfile.GFile.write functionality for binary files."""
    try:
      with io.open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
          f.write(data)
    except IOError as e:
      print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")

# Example usage:
binary_data = b"This is some binary data."
gfile_write_binary("my_binary_file.bin", binary_data)
```

This final example demonstrates writing to a binary file using `io.open()` with the 'wb' mode.  The `b` specifies binary mode, crucial for handling non-textual data correctly.  The inclusion of error handling using a `try-except` block ensures robust operation even in the event of file system errors.  This approach aligns with best practices for file handling, promoting safety and preventing unexpected program termination.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of Python's file I/O capabilities, consult the official Python documentation on the `os` and `io` modules.  Reviewing the TensorFlow 1.x documentation (if accessible) can provide further insights into the functionality of the deprecated `gfile` module and aid in understanding the differences.  A comprehensive guide to exception handling in Python will also prove invaluable when working with file I/O operations.  Finally, exploring resources on robust file handling techniques within Python programs is recommended for developing dependable and maintainable code.
