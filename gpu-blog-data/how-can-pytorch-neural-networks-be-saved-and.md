Saving and loading PyTorch models is crucial for efficient workflow management and reproducibility.  My experience developing large-scale image recognition systems highlighted the importance of robust checkpointing strategies, specifically to handle model sizes exceeding available RAM.  This necessitates a nuanced understanding of PyTorch's serialization mechanisms and their implications for different model architectures and training phases.  The primary methods involve using the `torch.save` function for saving and `torch.load` for loading, but their application depends on whether one is saving only the model's parameters or the entire model state.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch offers two principal approaches to model persistence: saving only the model's state dictionary (containing the learned parameters) and saving the entire model object.  Saving the state dictionary is generally preferred for its flexibility and reduced storage overhead, particularly beneficial when working with large models. The state dictionary is a Python dictionary object mapping each layer's parameters (weights and biases) to their corresponding tensor values.  Saving the entire model object, on the other hand, serializes the model's architecture along with its parameters.  This simplifies loading, but is less flexible if you later want to use a different architecture or load parameters into a pre-existing model instance.

The choice between these approaches depends on the specific application.  If one anticipates modifying the model's architecture or loading parameters into a separately defined model, saving the state dictionary is recommended. If the model's architecture remains fixed, saving the entire model offers a more straightforward loading process.  Both methods utilize the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions.  However, their usage differs slightly depending on the chosen approach.  Successful loading relies on ensuring compatibility between the saved model's architecture and the loaded model's architecture, particularly when loading only the state dictionary. Incompatibilities can manifest as mismatched tensor shapes and lead to runtime errors.  Careful version control and documentation are vital for preventing such issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Saving and Loading the Model State Dictionary:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Instantiate and train the model (simplified for brevity)
model = SimpleNet()
# ... training loop ...

# Save the state dictionary
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_state_dict.pth')

# Load the state dictionary
model_loaded = SimpleNet()
model_loaded.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_state_dict.pth'))

# Verify loading:  Check parameter values for equality.  Crucial for verification.
print(torch.equal(model.fc1.weight, model_loaded.fc1.weight)) # Should print True
```

This example demonstrates the preferred method: saving and loading only the model's parameters.  This allows flexibility in adapting the model's architecture later, while only requiring modification to the model instantiation section.  The `torch.equal` function provides crucial validation. In my experience, thorough verification prevented countless debugging hours.


**Example 2: Saving and Loading the Entire Model:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple neural network (same as Example 1)
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Instantiate and train the model (simplified for brevity)
model = SimpleNet()
# ... training loop ...

# Save the entire model
torch.save(model, 'model_entire.pth')

# Load the entire model
model_loaded = torch.load('model_entire.pth')

# Verify loading: Check parameter values for equality.
print(torch.equal(model.fc1.weight, model_loaded.fc1.weight)) # Should print True
```

This example showcases saving the entire model object.  While seemingly simpler, it offers less flexibility when changes to the model architecture are needed.  The direct loading eliminates the need to instantiate a new model, simplifying the code, but reduces flexibility.


**Example 3: Handling Models with Custom Objects:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a custom class (e.g., for preprocessing)
class CustomPreprocessor:
    def __init__(self, mean, std):
        self.mean = mean
        self.std = std

# Define a model using the custom class
class ModelWithCustomObject(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.preprocessor = CustomPreprocessor(mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.preprocessor
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x

model = ModelWithCustomObject()
# ... training loop ...

#Saving requires a custom function (lambda) for loading non-serializable objects.
torch.save({'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(), 'preprocessor': model.preprocessor}, 'model_custom.pth')

loaded_model_data = torch.load('model_custom.pth')
new_preprocessor = loaded_model_data['preprocessor']
model_loaded = ModelWithCustomObject()
model_loaded.load_state_dict(loaded_model_data['model_state_dict'])
model_loaded.preprocessor = new_preprocessor

# Verification
print(model.preprocessor.mean == model_loaded.preprocessor.mean)
```

This example demonstrates handling models that include custom classes.  Since these classes may not be directly serializable, a custom approach, such as storing them separately and then rebuilding them upon loading is necessary. My experience with this involved creating a custom function to reconstruct the custom class based on its saved attributes. This prevents errors related to object instantiation incompatibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive details on model serialization.  Explore the documentation's sections on `torch.save` and `torch.load` for a thorough understanding of their functionalities and parameters.  Furthermore, numerous tutorials and blog posts demonstrate practical applications of model saving and loading techniques, addressing various scenarios and complexities.  Reviewing code examples from reputable sources is highly valuable. Finally, consulting advanced PyTorch books can provide more profound insights into the inner workings of PyTorch's serialization mechanisms.  A strong grasp of object-oriented programming in Python is essential for effectively utilizing these techniques.
