The core issue with your PyTorch custom dataset not returning tabular data likely stems from a mismatch between how your data is structured and how your `__getitem__` method is designed to access and return it.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, particularly those involving large-scale financial time series analysis, has repeatedly highlighted this fundamental point.  The `__getitem__` method is the heart of your custom dataset, responsible for transforming raw data into tensors PyTorch can understand.  If the indexing and data extraction within `__getitem__` don't align with your data's organization, you'll encounter precisely this problem.

Let's clarify this with a step-by-step explanation.  A typical tabular dataset—whether a CSV, a Pandas DataFrame, or even a NumPy array—requires you to access rows or samples using an integer index. Your `__getitem__` method receives this index as input and needs to fetch the corresponding data row.  Crucially, it must then transform this row into a PyTorch tensor, ensuring its dimensions and data type are compatible with your model's input expectations.  Common errors include: incorrect indexing of the underlying data structure, failing to convert data types (e.g., strings to numerical representations), and neglecting proper tensor reshaping.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `__getitem__` method's contract is straightforward: given an integer index `idx`, it must return a tuple containing the input features (X) and the target variable (y). These should be PyTorch tensors.  Consider your underlying data.  If it's a Pandas DataFrame, you'll likely use `.iloc[idx]` for integer-based row selection. If it's a NumPy array, direct indexing `data[idx]` is sufficient.  However, if your data is stored in a more complex manner—say, a list of dictionaries, or even nested lists—you must implement custom logic within `__getitem__` to extract the correct features and labels for the given index. Failure to correctly handle this indexing step, coupled with neglecting data type conversion to appropriate PyTorch tensor types (e.g., `torch.float32` for numerical features), directly leads to the observed error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Pandas DataFrame as Data Source**

```python
import torch
import pandas as pd

class TabularDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, csv_file):
        self.data = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
        self.features = self.data.iloc[:, :-1].values  # All columns except the last one
        self.labels = self.data.iloc[:, -1].values     # Last column as labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        features = torch.tensor(self.features[idx], dtype=torch.float32)
        label = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx], dtype=torch.float32) # Assuming numeric labels
        return features, label

# Usage:
dataset = TabularDataset('data.csv')
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
# Iterate through dataloader
```
*Commentary:* This example directly leverages Pandas' `.iloc` for efficient row selection.  Crucially, it converts NumPy arrays obtained from Pandas into PyTorch tensors using `torch.tensor`, specifying the data type as `torch.float32`.  This ensures compatibility with most neural network models.  Failure to explicitly specify the data type can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Example 2:  NumPy Array as Data Source**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

class NumPyDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, features, labels):
        self.features = features
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.features)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        features = torch.tensor(self.features[idx], dtype=torch.float32)
        label = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx], dtype=torch.long) # Assuming integer labels
        return features, label

# Usage
features = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # 100 binary labels
dataset = NumPyDataset(features, labels)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates using a NumPy array directly.  Note the use of `torch.long` for integer labels.  The choice between `torch.float32` and `torch.long` depends on the nature of your target variable;  categorical labels frequently require `torch.long`.  Again, explicit type specification is critical.


**Example 3: List of Dictionaries**

```python
import torch

class DictDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        sample = self.data[idx]
        features = torch.tensor([sample['feature1'], sample['feature2']], dtype=torch.float32) #Example
        label = torch.tensor(sample['label'], dtype=torch.long)
        return features, label

# Sample data
data = [
    {'feature1': 1.0, 'feature2': 2.0, 'label': 0},
    {'feature1': 3.0, 'feature2': 4.0, 'label': 1},
    # ... more samples
]
dataset = DictDataset(data)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
```
*Commentary:* This example showcases handling a less structured data source—a list of dictionaries.  You must explicitly access the keys ('feature1', 'feature2', 'label') within each dictionary to extract the relevant information.  Error handling for missing keys or inconsistent data types within the dictionaries should be incorporated for robustness.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation on custom datasets provides comprehensive explanations and examples.  Thoroughly reviewing the official tutorials and examples focusing on dataset creation is essential.  Furthermore, studying advanced data loading techniques, such as using multiprocessing for faster data loading, is beneficial for larger datasets.  Finally, mastering the fundamentals of NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation will significantly improve your ability to create efficient and robust PyTorch datasets.
