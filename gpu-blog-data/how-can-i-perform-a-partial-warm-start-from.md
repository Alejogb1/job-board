In my experience developing large-scale recommendation systems, partial warm-starting from checkpoints in TensorFlow 2.x's eager mode has been critical for efficient experimentation and model evolution. A full reload of all weights often proves wasteful when only certain parts of a model change between runs. Therefore, the ability to selectively load weights offers substantial performance advantages.

**Partial Warm-Starting: Core Concept**

The fundamental principle behind partial warm-starting involves identifying and loading only the variables that match between the checkpoint and the current model's architecture. This approach circumvents the need to have perfect structural parity, enabling scenarios where, for example, a new embedding layer or a modified dense network are introduced without requiring retraining from scratch. It capitalizes on pre-existing learned weights wherever possible.

TensorFlow 2.x's checkpointing system, coupled with object-based saving, provides the necessary infrastructure to accomplish this selective loading. The `tf.train.Checkpoint` class stores object attributes including `tf.Variable` instances. When restoring a checkpoint, instead of loading all variables blindly, it's necessary to manually extract variables of interest from both the checkpoint and the current model. Subsequently, these matching variables are loaded selectively. This manual process allows us to effectively skip loading mismatched or extraneous parameters.

**Implementation Strategy**

The strategy I utilize consists of these key steps: 1) instantiate both a checkpoint manager pointing to the previously saved model checkpoint, and the current model to train; 2) traverse the variables stored within the loaded checkpoint and the current model; 3) identify and filter matching variable names; 4) perform a selective load, transferring the values from the checkpoint to the current model.

This procedure is not handled automatically, therefore, careful consideration is necessary. The structure of variables within the saved checkpoint corresponds directly to the hierarchy of objects being tracked by the `tf.train.Checkpoint`. This implies that layers, models, optimizers, and any trainable object saved with this tool become part of that hierarchy. Therefore, naming conventions of layers and variables become critical for partial warm-starting.

**Code Examples and Commentary**

Below are three distinct code examples detailing various aspects of partial warm-starting.

**Example 1: Loading Matching Variables from a Checkpoint**

This example demonstrates the core mechanism for selectively loading matching variables. It assumes a prior checkpoint with saved model weights, and a current model with some overlapping layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model_old and model_current are previously instantiated Keras models
# and a checkpoint has been previously saved

def load_matching_variables(model_current, checkpoint_path):
    """Loads only matching variables from a checkpoint."""
    ckpt = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model_current)
    manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(ckpt, checkpoint_path, max_to_keep=1)
    status = manager.restore_or_initialize()
    if status:
        print(f"Checkpoint successfully loaded from {manager.latest_checkpoint}")
        loaded_variable_names = [var.name for var in ckpt.model.trainable_variables]
        current_variable_names = [var.name for var in model_current.trainable_variables]
        
        to_load_names = set(loaded_variable_names) & set(current_variable_names)
        
        for var in ckpt.model.trainable_variables:
            if var.name in to_load_names:
                for current_var in model_current.trainable_variables:
                    if current_var.name == var.name:
                       current_var.assign(var.value())
                       print(f"Variable {var.name} loaded.")

    else:
       print(f"No checkpoint found at {checkpoint_path}. Training from scratch.")

#Example Usage:
# load_matching_variables(model_current, "/path/to/checkpoint_dir")
```
The `load_matching_variables` function first restores the checkpoint. It then obtains the variable names from both the checkpoint and the current model. The intersection of these names forms the set of variables to be loaded. A nested loop then iterates and assigns values from the checkpoint to the corresponding variables in the current model. Note the use of `var.assign(var.value())` which allows for eager-mode usage.

**Example 2: Selective Loading Based on Layer Names**

This example focuses on loading only specific layers based on their names. This is particularly useful when re-using learned embeddings or feature extractors across different model architectures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Assume model_old and model_current are previously instantiated Keras models
#and a checkpoint has been previously saved

def load_selective_layers(model_current, checkpoint_path, layers_to_load):
    """Loads variables from specified layers from checkpoint."""
    ckpt = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model_current)
    manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(ckpt, checkpoint_path, max_to_keep=1)
    status = manager.restore_or_initialize()

    if status:
        print(f"Checkpoint successfully loaded from {manager.latest_checkpoint}")
        for layer_name in layers_to_load:
             for var in ckpt.model.trainable_variables:
                 if layer_name in var.name:
                    for current_var in model_current.trainable_variables:
                        if current_var.name == var.name:
                           current_var.assign(var.value())
                           print(f"Variable {var.name} loaded from layer {layer_name}.")

    else:
        print(f"No checkpoint found at {checkpoint_path}. Training from scratch.")

#Example Usage:
# layer_names = ['embedding_layer', 'encoder_layer']
# load_selective_layers(model_current, "/path/to/checkpoint_dir", layer_names)

```
Here, `load_selective_layers` filters variables based on whether their names contain any string present in `layers_to_load`. This allows for a higher level of granularity in controlling the weights loading mechanism. For instance, only the encoder part of a transformer can be loaded while randomly initializing the decoder.

**Example 3: Handling Optimizer State**

This example details how to handle optimizer state when only partially loading model parameters. It is crucial to be aware that optimizer variables can also be checkpointed. When doing partial warm-starts, it is often desired not to load the optimizer parameters so to avoid potentially harmful influence from a different training situation.
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model_old, model_current, optimizer are previously instantiated 
# and a checkpoint has been previously saved.

def load_model_only(model_current, checkpoint_path):
    """Loads model parameters but not optimizer state."""
    
    ckpt = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model_current)
    manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(ckpt, checkpoint_path, max_to_keep=1)
    status = manager.restore_or_initialize()

    if status:
        print(f"Checkpoint successfully loaded from {manager.latest_checkpoint}")
        
        loaded_variable_names = [var.name for var in ckpt.model.trainable_variables]
        current_variable_names = [var.name for var in model_current.trainable_variables]
        
        to_load_names = set(loaded_variable_names) & set(current_variable_names)
        
        for var in ckpt.model.trainable_variables:
            if var.name in to_load_names:
                for current_var in model_current.trainable_variables:
                    if current_var.name == var.name:
                       current_var.assign(var.value())
                       print(f"Variable {var.name} loaded.")

    else:
      print(f"No checkpoint found at {checkpoint_path}. Training from scratch.")
       
# Example usage:
# load_model_only(model_current,"/path/to/checkpoint_dir")
```
Here, the `tf.train.Checkpoint` is instantiated solely with the model. This way, any optimizer state tracked alongside the original model in the checkpoint is deliberately ignored. It allows the optimizer to restart as it would in a fresh training run, but with loaded model weights.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I would suggest consulting the TensorFlow documentation related to the `tf.train.Checkpoint` class and `tf.train.CheckpointManager`. Specifically, pay attention to the saving and restoring mechanisms when using eager mode. Additionally, examination of the Keras API documentation relating to the structure of models and the extraction of trainable variables can be beneficial. A deep understanding of TensorFlow's variable management is also essential for writing robust partial warm-start solutions. Finally, explore examples of model checkpointing from the TensorFlow official tutorials. These resources, while not specific links, contain the core material necessary for an effective implementation of partial warm-starting.
