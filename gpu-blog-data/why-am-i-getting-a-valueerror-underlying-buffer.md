The `ValueError: underlying buffer has been detached` in TensorFlow 1.15, specifically when utilizing GPU acceleration, almost invariably stems from attempting to access a tensor after its underlying memory has been released.  This typically occurs due to improper memory management, often involving operations that implicitly or explicitly deallocate GPU memory before the tensor is fully utilized. My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale deep learning projects has highlighted several common culprits.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.15, unlike its later counterparts, employs a more manual memory management scheme. While it leverages the GPU for computation, the lifespan of allocated GPU memory is not implicitly tied to the Python variable referencing the tensor.  Several operations can trigger the release of this memory, leading to the error.  These include:

* **`del` operator:** Explicitly deleting a tensor using `del my_tensor` immediately releases the associated GPU memory.  Any subsequent attempts to access this tensor will result in the "underlying buffer has been detached" error.

* **Session closure:** Closing the TensorFlow session (`sess.close()`) deallocates all resources associated with that session, including GPU memory occupied by tensors. If you try accessing a tensor after closing the session, this error will occur.

* **Automatic garbage collection:**  While less predictable, Python's garbage collector might reclaim memory holding tensors, particularly if there are no more references to them. This is often subtle and harder to debug but can still manifest as the same error.

* **Operations modifying tensor shape or data in-place:** Certain operations, especially those that reshape or modify tensors in-place, can trigger memory reallocation, potentially leading to the detachment of the original buffer.

* **Asynchronous operations:** If you're running computations asynchronously and trying to access a tensor before its computation completes, the buffer might have been detached prematurely.

Addressing this error necessitates a careful review of tensor lifecycles within your code.  Ensure that tensors are accessed only within the scope of their valid memory allocation.  This usually involves proper session management and avoiding premature deallocation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Tensor Deletion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    b = tf.add(a, a)
    result = sess.run(b)
    print(result)  # Output: [2. 4. 6.]

    del a  # Incorrect: Deleting 'a' might release memory prematurely.
    try:
        print(sess.run(b))  # Potential ValueError: underlying buffer has been detached
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught error: {e}")

    sess.close()
```

This example demonstrates the risk of deleting `a` before the session is closed. Though `b` is seemingly independent, the underlying computation might still rely on the memory associated with `a`, leading to the error.

**Example 2: Session Closure Before Access**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    b = tf.add(a, a)
    result = sess.run(b)
    print(result)

sess.close() # Session closed before accessing result from a different operation
try:
    print(sess.run(b)) # Throws error because the session is closed.
except tf.errors.OpError as e:
    print(f"Caught error: {e}")
```

This showcases the critical role of session management.  Closing the session before accessing any computed tensors will consistently result in the error.


**Example 3:  Asynchronous Operation and Early Access**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    b = tf.add(a, a)
    #Simulating an asynchronous operation
    queue = tf.queue.FIFOQueue(1, dtypes=[tf.float32], shapes=[(3,)])
    enqueue_op = queue.enqueue(b)
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)

    #Early access attempt
    try:
      result = sess.run(queue.dequeue())
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError as e:
      print(f"Caught error: {e}")
    finally:
      coord.request_stop()
      coord.join(threads)
    #Correct access after queue operation.
    sess.run(enqueue_op)
    result = sess.run(queue.dequeue())
    print(result)

    sess.close()
```

In this example,  the result might not be available immediately after the `enqueue_op` is launched. If we try to access it before the enqueue operation is completed, an error may occur.  Proper synchronization mechanisms are vital when dealing with asynchronous operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's memory management, I strongly advise consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for your specific version (1.15 in this case). Pay close attention to the sections on session management, resource allocation, and garbage collection.  Reviewing examples of well-structured TensorFlow programs is crucial; studying established projects and libraries that effectively handle large-scale computations will be invaluable.  Finally, mastering debugging techniques specific to TensorFlow, including utilizing the TensorFlow debugger (tfdbg), is essential for resolving such intricate memory-related issues.  Thorough familiarity with Python's memory management principles will also be beneficial.
