The apparent lack of automatic optimization for `BETWEEN` queries in MySQL stems primarily from its inherent generality and potential for ambiguity, making assumptions for optimization dangerous without explicit knowledge of the underlying data distribution and indexing strategies. As I've frequently observed in database performance tuning over the past decade, relying solely on implicit optimizations can lead to surprising bottlenecks.

`BETWEEN` is essentially syntactic sugar for a combination of `>=` and `<=` operators. While logically equivalent, this syntactic simplicity belies the complex optimization challenges. Unlike using specific equality (`=`) comparisons against indexed columns, which MySQL can readily leverage for efficient lookups via B-tree indexes, ranges require more nuanced handling. The database engine needs to consider the *cardinality* within the specified range, the *selectivity* of the predicates, and the *indexing strategy* applied to the relevant column(s). Without explicit analysis, an automatic optimization might prematurely opt for an index scan, which may be less efficient than a full table scan in certain scenarios.

The core issue revolves around the optimizer's difficulty in predicting the number of rows that will fall within a `BETWEEN` range. If the range is small and densely populated, an index scan is highly advantageous. However, if the range is extremely broad, or the data is unevenly distributed, a full table scan might be faster. An overly aggressive automatic optimization, consistently choosing index scans, would be catastrophic in the latter case. Moreover, the `BETWEEN` operator is often used on columns where precise indexing is not straightforward, such as date/time columns with irregular temporal gaps or strings with varied prefixes and lengths. In such cases, relying on index scans without meticulous analysis can actually slow down query execution.

MySQL's optimizer, therefore, favors a more conservative approach. It generates a range-based execution plan using a `WHERE` clause combining the `>=` and `<=` operators, and then evaluates it against available indexes. The optimizer will *consider* an index scan for a range if available, but its decision is based on calculated costs derived from statistics about table and index usage, and not by pre-supposing it’s the best approach. This conservative approach means that a plan that is logically correct is implemented but, depending on the circumstances, may not be the most optimized.

I have repeatedly encountered situations where a query using `BETWEEN` was considerably slower than its equivalent formulated with explicit `>=` and `<=` operators, with the critical difference lying in the creation of *covering indexes* and explicitly *analyzing table statistics*. By manually optimizing the query and informing the optimizer more explicitly of data characteristics, improved performance can be achieved.

Below are three examples demonstrating how `BETWEEN` behaves under different contexts and how to guide MySQL towards optimized query execution:

**Example 1: The Non-Optimal Default (no covering index)**

```sql
-- Table 'products' with columns 'product_id' (INT, PRIMARY KEY), 'price' (DECIMAL), 'created_at' (TIMESTAMP).
-- A query using BETWEEN on a non-indexed column (price).

-- Assume products exist with prices ranging from 1 to 1000.

SELECT product_id
FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 75;
```

**Commentary:**

In this scenario, the `price` column is not indexed. MySQL will perform a full table scan. Even if there are other available indexes on the `products` table, they are unlikely to be utilized effectively for the `BETWEEN` predicate on `price`. The query's performance will degrade rapidly as the table size grows, as each row will require an examination of the `price` value.

**Example 2: Utilizing an Index (index on ranged column)**

```sql
-- Table 'orders' with columns 'order_id' (INT, PRIMARY KEY), 'order_date' (DATE, INDEX), 'customer_id' (INT)
-- Using an index but still possible to not utilize the index fully.

SELECT order_id
FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';

-- MySQL may choose a full table scan for large ranges or a high proportion of matches.
```
**Commentary:**

Here, `order_date` is indexed. When the `BETWEEN` clause is executed, the MySQL optimizer will *consider* using the index on `order_date`. If the specified date range is relatively small or the query's selectivity is high (i.e., the range returns only a few rows), the index will probably be used efficiently. However, if the date range is very wide or encompasses a significant portion of the `orders` table, the optimizer may decide that a full table scan is less costly than using the index due to the increased cost of repeatedly accessing the index, then the actual rows. This can be more pronounced as the rows retrieved from the index increase in number, requiring more read operations on the base data.
This illustrates how a poorly chosen range can negate the benefit of indexing.

**Example 3: Covering Index for Optimization**

```sql
-- Table 'transactions' with columns 'transaction_id' (INT, PRIMARY KEY), 'amount' (DECIMAL), 'transaction_date' (DATE)
-- Creating a covering index on date and id column
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_date_id ON transactions (transaction_date, transaction_id);

SELECT transaction_id
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2023-02-01' AND '2023-02-28';

-- The optimizer is now much more likely to choose an index scan, since all data can be found in the index.
```

**Commentary:**

By creating a covering index, `idx_transaction_date_id`, which includes the `transaction_date` column (used in `BETWEEN`) and the `transaction_id` column (selected), MySQL can satisfy this query directly from the index without needing to access the table's underlying data. This approach enhances performance, reducing I/O operations. This example illustrates an optimized index setup. Specifically, the inclusion of `transaction_id` in the index allows MySQL to retrieve all the needed columns from the index itself (the `covering index`) resulting in a significantly reduced query time.

In summary, while `BETWEEN` appears straightforward, it's not inherently optimized due to its flexibility and the inherent challenges in automatically determining optimal execution plans without detailed knowledge of the underlying data distribution and the specific indexing strategy. To ensure optimum query performance, I recommend a measured, analytical approach, including:

1.  **Analyzing Table Statistics:** Keep statistics up to date; `ANALYZE TABLE` should be part of your maintenance routine. Accurate statistics enable better cost estimations by the optimizer.

2.  **Targeted Indexing:** Don’t blindly create indexes, strategically construct indexes that match your most commonly used query patterns, and ensure they are covering indexes where possible.

3.  **Experimentation:** Test different query formulations (e.g., comparing `BETWEEN` with explicit `>=` and `<=`) and indexes in a development or staging environment to observe real performance impacts. Use `EXPLAIN` statements to dissect query execution plans and identify potential bottlenecks.

4. **Consult Documentation:** The official MySQL documentation provides comprehensive details about index usage, query optimization, and the cost model of the optimizer itself. Read this to further your understanding.
5.  **Online Communities:** Actively participate in forums and communities discussing MySQL optimization. Real-world use cases and other’s experiences can reveal valuable insights.

By adhering to these practices and understanding the limitations of automatic optimization, performance with `BETWEEN` and similar range-based queries can be dramatically improved. Relying on a ‘hands-on’ approach to optimization will, in the long run, yield more performant and stable database applications.
