MobileNetV2's inherent efficiency stems from its depthwise separable convolutions.  However, directly adding layers, particularly standard convolutional layers, often negates this efficiency gain and may even degrade performance.  My experience optimizing MobileNetV2 for resource-constrained embedded systems has shown that effective enhancements require a nuanced understanding of the model's architecture and the careful selection of added layers.  Simply appending layers is rarely the optimal solution.

**1.  Understanding the Bottleneck Structure:**

MobileNetV2 employs a bottleneck structure within its inverted residual blocks. These blocks consist of a 1x1 expansion layer, a depthwise convolution, a 1x1 projection layer, and a residual connection.  Adding layers indiscriminately disrupts this carefully balanced structure.  The efficiency of MobileNetV2 arises from the reduced computational cost of the depthwise convolution relative to standard convolutions.  Adding standard convolutional layers bypasses this advantage, leading to increased computational complexity and memory usage without a commensurate improvement in accuracy.

**2.  Strategic Layer Addition Techniques:**

Effective enhancement requires targeted additions that leverage the existing architecture. Three key approaches I've found effective are:

* **Inserting bottleneck blocks:**  Rather than appending new layers, consider inserting additional bottleneck blocks within the existing MobileNetV2 structure.  This maintains the architectural integrity and allows for increased model capacity without drastically increasing computational overhead. The placement of these blocks should be determined empirically, focusing on layers where feature maps are rich in informative features, often identified through feature visualization techniques.

* **Introducing attention mechanisms:**  Adding attention mechanisms, such as Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, can improve the model's ability to focus on relevant features.  These blocks can be integrated into the existing bottleneck blocks, adding minimal computational overhead while potentially significantly improving performance, particularly in situations with complex backgrounds or occlusions.  The computational cost of the SE block needs to be carefully considered; it is not a universally beneficial addition and may be counterproductive in already resource-constrained environments.

* **Employing lightweight convolutional blocks:**  If additional layers are deemed necessary, employing lightweight convolutional blocks, such as those using fewer filters or smaller kernels, can mitigate the performance penalty.  Experimentation with different kernel sizes and filter counts is critical to finding the right balance between accuracy gains and computational efficiency.  This approach demands a more granular understanding of the input data's characteristics and how they translate into feature map information throughout the model.

**3.  Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the three techniques described above using TensorFlow/Keras. Note that these are simplified examples and may require adjustments depending on the specific MobileNetV2 implementation and dataset.

**Example 1: Inserting Bottleneck Blocks:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Activation, Add, DepthwiseConv2D

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 (or create a custom one)
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Define a custom bottleneck block
def bottleneck_block(x, filters, expansion_factor):
    x = Conv2D(filters * expansion_factor, 1, padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)
    x = DepthwiseConv2D(3, padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation('relu')(x)
    x = Conv2D(filters, 1, padding='same')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    return Add()([x, tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=x.shape[1:])]) # Residual connection

# Insert a new bottleneck block after a specific layer (e.g., layer 50)
inserted_block = bottleneck_block(base_model.layers[50].output, 64, 6)
x = base_model.layers[51](inserted_block)  # Continue with the rest of the model

# Add your classification layers
# ...
```

This code snippet demonstrates the insertion of a custom bottleneck block. The placement (layer 50) is arbitrary and needs to be determined experimentally.  The `bottleneck_block` function defines a new bottleneck block, mimicking MobileNetV2's internal structure. The residual connection ensures gradient flow and stability.

**Example 2: Incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense, Reshape, Multiply

# Define a Squeeze-and-Excitation block
def se_block(x, reduction_ratio):
    num_channels = x.shape[-1]
    se = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    se = Dense(num_channels // reduction_ratio, activation='relu')(se)
    se = Dense(num_channels, activation='sigmoid')(se)
    se = Reshape((1, 1, num_channels))(se)
    x = Multiply()([x, se])
    return x

# Insert the SE block after a depthwise convolution within an existing bottleneck block
for layer in base_model.layers:
    if isinstance(layer, DepthwiseConv2D):
        output = se_block(layer.output, 16)
        layer.output = output

# ... rest of the model
```

This example integrates an SE block after a depthwise convolution. The `reduction_ratio` parameter controls the computational cost of the SE block.  Carefully choose this parameter to balance accuracy and efficiency.

**Example 3: Utilizing Lightweight Convolutional Blocks:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D

# Replace a standard convolution with a lightweight one
for layer in base_model.layers:
    if isinstance(layer, Conv2D) and layer.kernel_size == (3, 3): # Example: target 3x3 convolutions
      layer.kernel_size = (1,1) #reduce to 1x1 for testing. Adapt kernel size and filters as needed
      layer.filters = int(layer.filters/2) #reduce filter number for testing.

# ... rest of the model
```

This example replaces standard convolutions with smaller kernel size convolutions, thereby reducing computational cost. It's crucial to systematically explore various options of kernel sizes and filter counts to optimize for the desired tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.


**4.  Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of MobileNetV2, I recommend consulting the original research paper.  Further, exploring advanced convolutional architectures like EfficientNet and ShuffleNet can provide insights into optimizing model efficiency.  Finally, studying techniques in model compression, like pruning and quantization, can aid in deploying enhanced MobileNetV2 models on resource-constrained platforms.  Thorough experimentation and evaluation using appropriate metrics are paramount.  Remember to always validate performance on a held-out test set to avoid overfitting.
