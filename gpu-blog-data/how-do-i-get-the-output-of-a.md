Accessing intermediate layer outputs in a Keras sequential model requires understanding the model's execution flow and leveraging Keras's functional API capabilities.  My experience debugging complex deep learning pipelines has shown that directly accessing these outputs is rarely a simple matter of indexing.  Instead, it involves strategically reconstructing parts of the model or employing Keras's `Model` class for custom model definition.  This approach is significantly more robust than attempting to intercept activations during the `fit()` or `predict()` methods.

The core issue is that a Keras `Sequential` model, by its nature, chains layers in a linear fashion.  Direct access to intermediate layers' activations is not explicitly provided by its built-in methods. The `Sequential` model's `predict()` method only provides the final output.  However, the functionality is easily achievable by adopting the Keras functional API.  This offers a declarative way to define models, allowing greater control over the data flow and enabling the extraction of intermediate layer outputs.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution involves creating a new Keras `Model` object, defining its input as the original sequential model's input, and specifying its output as the output of the target intermediate layer.  This new model essentially acts as a sub-model, specifically designed to output the desired activations.  We leverage the `Sequential` model's underlying layers, which are accessible via the `layers` attribute.  This attribute contains a list of the layers in the order they appear in the `Sequential` model. Note that this approach requires knowing the index or name of the target layer within the sequential model.

After constructing the new `Model` object, standard `predict()` functionality can be used to obtain the activations from the specified layer.  Error handling, such as checking for layer existence and validity of the layer index, is crucial for a robust solution. This ensures graceful failure if the specified layer does not exist or if an incorrect index is provided.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accessing Output using Layer Index:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a sample sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Specify the index of the intermediate layer (here, the second layer)
intermediate_layer_index = 1

# Check if the index is valid
if intermediate_layer_index < 0 or intermediate_layer_index >= len(model.layers):
    raise ValueError("Invalid intermediate layer index.")

# Create a new model to extract the intermediate layer's output
intermediate_output_model = keras.Model(
    inputs=model.input,
    outputs=model.layers[intermediate_layer_index].output
)

# Generate sample input data
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 784))

# Get the intermediate layer's output
intermediate_output = intermediate_output_model.predict(input_data)
print(f"Shape of intermediate layer output: {intermediate_output.shape}")

```

This example shows a clear, concise way to extract the output of a layer specified by its index.  The error handling prevents runtime crashes caused by improper input. The example uses a simple Dense network, readily adaptable to different architectures.


**Example 2: Accessing Output using Layer Name:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a sample sequential model with named layers
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,), name='dense_1'),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name='dense_2'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_3')
])

# Specify the name of the intermediate layer
intermediate_layer_name = 'dense_2'

# Find the layer by name; Handle case where layer is not found
intermediate_layer = next((layer for layer in model.layers if layer.name == intermediate_layer_name), None)
if intermediate_layer is None:
    raise ValueError(f"Layer with name '{intermediate_layer_name}' not found.")


# Create a new model to extract the intermediate layer's output
intermediate_output_model = keras.Model(
    inputs=model.input,
    outputs=intermediate_layer.output
)

# ... (rest of the code remains the same as Example 1)

```

This example demonstrates accessing the intermediate layer using its name instead of its index.  This approach is more readable and less prone to errors if the model's structure changes.  The use of `next` with a generator expression provides a concise way to find the layer while handling the case where the layer does not exist.

**Example 3: Handling Custom Layers:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs)

# Define a sequential model with a custom layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,), name='dense_1'),
    MyCustomLayer(name='custom_layer'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_3')
])

# ... (The rest of the code is identical to Example 2,
#       replacing 'dense_2' with 'custom_layer')
```

This example shows how the same technique applies to models containing custom layers. This ensures that the method is not limited to standard Keras layers. The custom layer, `MyCustomLayer`, demonstrates this flexibility.  The extraction process remains consistent, highlighting the generality of the functional API approach.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a focus on TensorFlow/Keras. A practical guide focusing on building and debugging deep learning models.  These resources provide broader context and deeper understanding, covering advanced topics beyond the scope of this immediate problem.  Thorough familiarity with the functional API in Keras is essential for advanced model manipulation.
