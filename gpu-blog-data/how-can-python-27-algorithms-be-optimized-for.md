Python 2.7's performance limitations, particularly concerning computationally intensive algorithms, are well-documented.  My experience optimizing legacy codebases written in this version centers primarily on identifying and addressing bottlenecks arising from inefficient data structures, interpreter overhead, and suboptimal algorithmic choices.  Focusing on these three areas consistently yielded significant performance gains.

**1. Data Structure Selection:**  Python 2.7's built-in lists, while convenient, exhibit O(n) complexity for certain operations like insertion and deletion in the middle of the sequence.  For algorithms sensitive to these operations, replacing lists with more appropriate structures significantly improves performance.  Specifically, using `collections.deque` for queue-like operations and `array.array` for numerical data with homogenous types drastically reduced runtime in several projects I've worked on.  `array.array` in particular offers significant memory savings compared to standard lists, especially when dealing with large datasets of numerical values.  Furthermore, carefully considered use of NumPy arrays for numerical computations is crucial; its vectorized operations bypass the interpreter's overhead, resulting in substantial speedups.  Failing to leverage optimized numerical libraries is a prevalent source of performance issues in Python 2.7 numerical applications.

**2. Algorithmic Efficiency:**  The choice of algorithm fundamentally dictates an application's performance characteristics.  While optimizing data structures can alleviate performance bottlenecks, transitioning to a more efficient algorithm often yields the most dramatic improvements.  This often requires a deep understanding of the algorithm's time and space complexity.  For example, a naive O(nÂ²) algorithm for sorting, like bubble sort, should be replaced with O(n log n) algorithms such as merge sort or quicksort (the latter requiring careful consideration of pivot selection to avoid worst-case scenarios).  Similarly, searching algorithms should be chosen based on the data structure and search requirements.  Linear search, while simple, is inefficient for large datasets.  Binary search, applicable to sorted data, offers logarithmic complexity, significantly reducing search time.  Identifying these algorithmic inefficiencies early in the development process, or during profiling of an existing application, is key to effective optimization.

**3. Interpreter Overhead Mitigation:**  Python's interpreted nature introduces overhead compared to compiled languages.  Minimizing interactions with the interpreter is therefore paramount.  One effective strategy involves leveraging Cython to compile performance-critical sections of the code to C. This allows for direct interaction with underlying hardware, bypassing much of the Python interpreter's overhead.  Another crucial approach is to utilize built-in functions and library routines whenever possible.  These functions are usually implemented in highly optimized C code, providing significantly faster execution than equivalent Python implementations. For instance, using the `sum()` function for aggregating numbers is far more efficient than writing a manual loop. Avoiding unnecessary function calls, especially within inner loops, further contributes to performance improvement.  This optimization strategy directly minimizes the interpreter's workload, resulting in speed enhancements.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Data Structure Optimization (List vs. deque)**

```python
import time
from collections import deque

# List-based approach
start_time = time.time()
my_list = list(range(1000000))
for i in range(10000):
    my_list.insert(0, i)
end_time = time.time()
print("List time:", end_time - start_time)


# deque-based approach
start_time = time.time()
my_deque = deque(range(1000000))
for i in range(10000):
    my_deque.appendleft(i)
end_time = time.time()
print("Deque time:", end_time - start_time)
```

This example demonstrates the performance difference between using a standard list and `collections.deque` for repeated insertions at the beginning of a sequence. `deque` is designed for efficient insertions and deletions at both ends, resulting in a much faster execution time.


**Example 2: Algorithmic Optimization (Linear Search vs. Binary Search)**

```python
import time
import bisect

# Linear search
def linear_search(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1

# Binary search
def binary_search(arr, x):
    return bisect.bisect_left(arr, x)

sorted_array = sorted(range(1000000))
target_value = 500000

start_time = time.time()
linear_search(sorted_array, target_value)
end_time = time.time()
print("Linear search time:", end_time - start_time)

start_time = time.time()
binary_search(sorted_array, target_value)
end_time = time.time()
print("Binary search time:", end_time - start_time)

```

This example highlights the performance advantage of binary search over linear search for finding elements in a sorted array. Binary search's logarithmic complexity provides a significantly faster search time for large datasets.  Note the use of `bisect.bisect_left`, a highly optimized binary search implementation within the Python standard library.


**Example 3:  Interpreter Overhead Reduction (Using NumPy)**

```python
import time
import numpy as np

# Python list approach
start_time = time.time()
my_list = list(range(1000000))
result = [x * 2 for x in my_list]
end_time = time.time()
print("List time:", end_time - start_time)

# NumPy array approach
start_time = time.time()
my_array = np.arange(1000000)
result = my_array * 2
end_time = time.time()
print("NumPy time:", end_time - start_time)
```

This comparison demonstrates NumPy's superior performance in numerical computations. NumPy's vectorized operations avoid the interpreter's loop overhead, leading to a substantial speed increase when dealing with large numerical arrays.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   **"Python Cookbook"**:  Contains numerous recipes for optimizing Python code, addressing various performance issues.
*   **"High Performance Python"**:  A comprehensive guide to writing efficient Python code, covering advanced topics such as multiprocessing and memory management.
*   **NumPy and SciPy documentation**:  Essential resources for understanding and effectively utilizing these libraries for numerical computations.  Thorough familiarity is vital for optimizing numerical algorithms in Python 2.7.


Effective optimization of Python 2.7 algorithms requires a multi-pronged approach focusing on data structure selection, algorithmic efficiency, and minimizing interpreter overhead.  By carefully considering these aspects during algorithm design and implementation, substantial performance improvements can be achieved, even within the constraints of this older Python version.
