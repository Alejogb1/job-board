The core issue of PyTorch tensors residing on different devices during an `addmm` operation stems from a fundamental principle of deep learning frameworks: data locality and efficiency.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has repeatedly highlighted the critical role of device placement in performance.  Failing to manage this properly leads to significant slowdowns due to the overhead of data transfers between CPU and GPU memory.  In the context of `addmm`, which performs a matrix-matrix multiplication followed by an addition, this transfer becomes a major bottleneck if the inputs aren't strategically placed.

The `addmm` operation, at its heart, requires three tensor arguments: two matrices for the multiplication and a tensor to add to the result. If these tensors reside on different devices – for example, one matrix on the GPU and another on the CPU, or the accumulator tensor located on the CPU – PyTorch's runtime environment must orchestrate data movement between the CPU and GPU.  This data transfer is a time-consuming process, drastically impacting the overall speed of the computation. The time penalty is often greater than the time saved by using the GPU for the computation itself.

**Explanation:**

PyTorch, by design, strives for flexibility.  This means it allows users to place tensors on any available device. While convenient, it puts the onus on the user to ensure correct tensor placement for optimal performance.  Implicitly assuming tensors will magically reside on the optimal device will almost always result in suboptimal performance. When `addmm` encounters tensors on different devices, it typically exhibits the following behavior:

1. **Automatic Transfer (Implicit):** PyTorch might automatically transfer the tensors to the device of the first argument, incurring a significant performance penalty. This behavior is generally less efficient than explicit device management. The time cost of this implicit transfer is proportional to the size of the tensors.  Larger tensors lead to proportionally longer transfer times, and in scenarios involving streaming data, the impact can be devastating.

2. **Error Handling:** In some cases, depending on the PyTorch version and the specific configuration, the operation might raise an error, indicating that the tensors are on incompatible devices. This is generally preferred to silent performance degradation.

3. **Manual Transfer (Explicit):** The most efficient approach is to explicitly manage device placement before the operation.  This involves transferring the relevant tensors to the same device using the `.to()` method.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Operation – Implicit Transfer:**

```python
import torch

# Define tensors on different devices
mat1 = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cpu() # Matrix 1 on CPU
mat2 = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda() # Matrix 2 on GPU
accumulator = torch.zeros(1000, 1000).cpu() # Accumulator on CPU

# addmm operation – Implicit transfer will likely occur
result = torch.addmm(accumulator, mat1, mat2)
print(result.device) # Output likely shows 'cuda:0' or similar, indicating implicit transfer
```

In this example, the lack of explicit device management leads to either an error or an implicit transfer of either `mat1` to the GPU or `mat2` and `accumulator` to the CPU before the operation can be performed. Both cases result in increased execution time.

**Example 2: Efficient Operation – Explicit Transfer:**

```python
import torch

# Define tensors on different devices
mat1 = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cpu()
mat2 = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()
accumulator = torch.zeros(1000, 1000).cpu()

# Explicitly move tensors to GPU before the operation
mat1 = mat1.to("cuda")
accumulator = accumulator.to("cuda")

# addmm operation
result = torch.addmm(accumulator, mat1, mat2)
print(result.device)  # Output will show 'cuda:0', indicating the computation occurred on the GPU
```

This improved code explicitly transfers `mat1` and `accumulator` to the GPU before the `addmm` operation.  This maximizes computational efficiency by avoiding costly data transfers.  Choosing the GPU as the target device is done assuming a GPU is available and is a more performance-oriented choice in most instances.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple GPUs:**

```python
import torch

# Define tensors on different devices (Illustrative for multiple GPUs)
mat1 = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to("cuda:0")
mat2 = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to("cuda:1")
accumulator = torch.zeros(1000, 1000).to("cuda:0")

# Explicit transfer – choosing a device.  Here, we choose the device of the accumulator
mat2 = mat2.to("cuda:0")

# addmm operation
result = torch.addmm(accumulator, mat1, mat2)
print(result.device) # Output will be 'cuda:0'
```

This example demonstrates explicit device handling when working with multiple GPUs.  The choice of `cuda:0` as the target device here is arbitrary and should be based on optimization strategies specific to the multi-GPU setup.  In complex multi-GPU scenarios, more advanced techniques like data parallelism might be required, but the underlying principle of explicit device management remains crucial.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation and device management.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing data transfer operations and best practices for multi-GPU programming.  Additionally, exploring advanced topics like CUDA programming and understanding the nuances of GPU memory management will significantly aid in performance optimization.  Finally, profiling your code with tools specifically designed for deep learning frameworks is invaluable for identifying performance bottlenecks and refining your tensor placement strategies.
