The core challenge in printing Keras tensor values stems from the fact that these tensors are not NumPy arrays; they represent symbolic operations within a computational graph, holding placeholders rather than concrete values until evaluated within a TensorFlow session (or equivalent).  Directly printing a Keras tensor will yield a representation of the tensor object itself, not its numerical contents.  My experience debugging complex deep learning models has highlighted this repeatedly, requiring careful manipulation to extract and display the underlying data.  This requires explicit execution within a suitable computational environment.

**1. Explanation:**

Keras, a high-level API for building neural networks, relies on TensorFlow or other backend engines to perform the actual computations.  A Keras tensor is a symbolic representation of a multi-dimensional array.  Its value isn't defined until the model is executed and the tensor is evaluated within the context of a session.  Attempting to print it directly will only show information about the tensor's shape, data type, and name, not the actual numeric values it holds.  This contrasts with NumPy arrays which hold the data directly in memory. To visualize the tensor's contents, one must explicitly obtain the evaluated values.  This usually involves using a session (in TensorFlow 1.x) or eagerly executing the tensor (in TensorFlow 2.x and later, which is the recommended approach).  Furthermore, the strategy for accessing values differs depending on whether you're dealing with a tensor within a model during training or an output tensor after prediction.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accessing tensor values after model prediction using `tf.function` (TensorFlow 2.x and later):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Sample input data
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 5)

@tf.function
def predict_and_print(input_data):
    predictions = model(input_data)
    print(f"Predictions: {predictions.numpy()}")

predict_and_print(input_data)
```

*Commentary:* This example leverages TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution. The `@tf.function` decorator compiles the prediction function, enhancing performance while still allowing us to access and print the tensor using `.numpy()` which converts the tensor to a NumPy array for convenient printing.  This is generally the preferred approach for clarity and ease of debugging in modern TensorFlow workflows. My experience shows that using `tf.function` often improves performance for repeated calls to the prediction function.

**Example 2: Accessing intermediate layer outputs during model training (TensorFlow 2.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), activation='relu', name='layer1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, name='layer2')
])

# Accessing intermediate layer output during training
layer_output = model.layers[0].output #Access the output of layer1

intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer_output)

input_data = np.random.rand(1,5)
layer1_output = intermediate_model(input_data)
print(f"Layer 1 Output: {layer1_output.numpy()}")

```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how to access the output of an intermediate layer. Creating a new model (`intermediate_model`) with the input and desired layer's output as input and output respectively, allows the retrieval and printing of the intermediate tensor. Using the layer name (`name='layer1'`) improves code readability and maintainability. In my experience, carefully naming layers is crucial for debugging large, complex networks.


**Example 3: Using a custom callback for tensor value inspection during training (TensorFlow 2.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

class PrintLayerOutput(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, layer_index):
        self.layer_index = layer_index
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
      intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=self.model.input, outputs=self.model.layers[self.layer_index].output)
      intermediate_output = intermediate_model(self.model.input)
      print(f"Layer {self.layer_index} output at epoch {epoch+1}: {intermediate_output.numpy()}")


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.rand(100, 1), epochs=2, callbacks=[PrintLayerOutput(0)]) #prints output of the first layer.

```

*Commentary:* This example introduces a custom Keras callback to print layer outputs at the end of each training epoch.  This allows inspection of tensor values throughout the training process without halting execution.  Creating callbacks, as Iâ€™ve found through many projects, offers great flexibility for monitoring model behavior during training.  The callback selectively targets a specific layer using its index for detailed observation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning frameworks and practices.  Books focusing on practical aspects of TensorFlow and Keras.  Online tutorials and blog posts specifically addressing debugging and visualization techniques in Keras models.

In conclusion, accessing and printing Keras tensor values necessitates understanding the distinction between symbolic representations and concrete numerical data.  Employing eager execution (TensorFlow 2.x and later) simplifies this process significantly, while custom callbacks offer powerful tools for monitoring internal states during model training. Using appropriate techniques tailored to the specific context, as demonstrated in the provided examples, is crucial for effective debugging and analysis of deep learning models.
