The softmax activation function, by its intrinsic design, operates on all neurons within a layer, typically the output layer, rendering direct targeting of individual neurons for its application impossible within standard implementations. This stems from the need to calculate a probability distribution across all output units, ensuring the outputs sum to one, a core characteristic of softmax. My experience developing custom neural network architectures for a simulated robotic arm demonstrated the limitations and necessary workarounds when faced with this constraint. During the development process, it became apparent that achieving neuron-specific softmax application requires careful manipulation of network architecture or output interpretation, deviating from direct application.

Fundamentally, softmax converts a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution by exponentiating each element and then normalizing these exponentials by the sum of all exponentials. The mathematical expression is:

```
softmax(z_i) = exp(z_i) / sum(exp(z_j)) for all j in the output vector
```

Where *z* represents the pre-activation values of the neurons in the output layer. The sum in the denominator ensures that the output values will sum to 1, providing a well-defined probability distribution. Because this calculation involves every element in the output vector, selectively applying it to only some neurons would disrupt this probability normalization process.

Therefore, when we aim for "targeted softmax," it is crucial to understand that we aren't *applying* softmax selectively to individual neurons *within a single layer*. Instead, we are manipulating the output layer to produce a series of outputs, some of which are passed through softmax, and others are not, effectively creating different pathways in the output. The trick lies in how the network is constructed and how the outputs are subsequently interpreted.

Here's a breakdown of approaches and how they've been useful in my prior projects:

**1. Output Layer Partitioning and Individual Softmax Applications**

The most direct strategy involves splitting the output layer into distinct segments, where each segment is associated with a specific task or output type. For segments requiring probabilistic interpretation, a softmax activation is applied. For segments requiring non-probabilistic outputs, such as regression, no softmax is used.

Consider a scenario where, for the robotic arm, the network should simultaneously predict: (1) a discrete action for a joint from a predefined set, requiring a probability distribution, and (2) a continuous value representing the force to apply. The output layer is divided into two parts. One part, corresponding to the discrete actions, is passed through the softmax. The other part, representing the continuous force, remains untouched by softmax.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PartitionedOutputNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_actions, num_force_outputs):
        super(PartitionedOutputNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        # Output layer split: one for softmax actions, one for force
        self.action_output = nn.Linear(64, num_actions)
        self.force_output = nn.Linear(64, num_force_outputs)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))

        # Action outputs, softmax is applied
        action_probs = F.softmax(self.action_output(x), dim=1)
        # Force output, no softmax
        force_values = self.force_output(x)
        return action_probs, force_values

# Example Usage:
input_size = 10
num_actions = 4
num_force_outputs = 1
model = PartitionedOutputNetwork(input_size, num_actions, num_force_outputs)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size)
action_output, force_output = model(dummy_input)
print("Action probabilities:", action_output)
print("Force values:", force_output)

```

In this example, `action_output` will have probabilities summing to 1 across the `num_actions` dimension, while `force_output` will not be subjected to normalization. This represents a practical method for selective application.

**2. Using Masks and Selective Softmax Application on Intermediate Tensors**

Another method involves applying the softmax on an intermediate tensor and creating a mask to zero out outputs where softmax application is not desired. This is less common, as it essentially pre-computes the softmax outputs and then selectively eliminates their contribution. This strategy became useful during a reinforcement learning project where I needed to apply softmax only on some action choices. The softmax is applied on a larger set first, and then outputs for specific non-softmax choices are masked to zero, using a different output branch. This avoids altering the main softmax computations, maintaining probability distribution properties.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class MaskedSoftmaxNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, softmax_mask):
        super(MaskedSoftmaxNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, output_size)
        self.mask = torch.tensor(softmax_mask, dtype=torch.float)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        pre_softmax = self.fc2(x)
        softmax_output = F.softmax(pre_softmax, dim=1)
        masked_output = softmax_output * self.mask
        return masked_output

# Example Usage:
input_size = 10
output_size = 6
# Mask: apply softmax to indices 0 and 2, no softmax on others
softmax_mask = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

model = MaskedSoftmaxNetwork(input_size, output_size, softmax_mask)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output = model(dummy_input)

print("Output:", output)

```

Here, while softmax is calculated over all outputs, the mask ensures only the outputs where softmax should apply remain non-zero after multiplication. This approach manipulates the output after softmax, not the softmax application itself. The `softmax_mask` is constructed such that 1 indicates a position that should be influenced by the output of softmax, and 0 indicates a location which should be zeroed after the softmax operation.

**3. Hierarchical Output Layers and Selective Activation**

In more complex cases, especially those involving a series of decisions or categorizations, one might employ a hierarchical structure in the output layer. I encountered this during a multi-stage image classification project where there were multiple levels of classification. The initial output layer might use softmax to classify at a coarse level. Then, based on the prediction of the first output, the model could proceed to additional sub-networks, each potentially having their own softmax for finer-grained classification. While this doesn't target individual neurons within a *single* softmax, it does provide control over which parts of the overall output are subjected to a probabilistic interpretation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class HierarchicalOutputNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_coarse_categories, num_fine_categories_per_coarse):
        super(HierarchicalOutputNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.coarse_output = nn.Linear(64, num_coarse_categories)
        self.fine_outputs = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(64, num_fine_categories) for num_fine_categories in num_fine_categories_per_coarse])


    def forward(self, x):
         x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
         x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
         coarse_probs = F.softmax(self.coarse_output(x), dim=1)
         fine_probs_list = []
         for i, fine_output in enumerate(self.fine_outputs):
            fine_probs = F.softmax(fine_output(x), dim=1)
            fine_probs_list.append(fine_probs)
         return coarse_probs, fine_probs_list



# Example Usage:
input_size = 10
num_coarse_categories = 3
num_fine_categories_per_coarse = [2,4,3]

model = HierarchicalOutputNetwork(input_size, num_coarse_categories, num_fine_categories_per_coarse)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size)
coarse_output, fine_outputs = model(dummy_input)

print("Coarse probabilities:", coarse_output)
for i, fine_output in enumerate(fine_outputs):
    print(f"Fine probabilities for coarse {i}:", fine_output)
```

The hierarchical structure enables softmax operations on parts of the output at each level, allowing for more nuanced control over the activation.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of neural network architectures and activation functions, I recommend exploring academic papers on deep learning which cover the mathematical underpinnings of these functions. Textbooks focusing on neural networks and deep learning methodologies will elaborate further on techniques for architectural control of activation functions. Additionally, documentation and tutorials from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow offer practical insight into the implementation details of layer construction and activation application. These frameworks also feature specialized layer types that encapsulate many of the techniques described above.
