The necessity for precise CUDA and CUDART version matching isn't absolute, but deviating introduces significant risk, particularly concerning compatibility and performance.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications, specifically in the realm of computational fluid dynamics simulations, has highlighted the subtle yet crucial interplay between these two components.  While backward compatibility is often touted, relying on it without rigorous testing is unwise.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model.  It provides a framework for writing programs that execute on NVIDIA GPUs.  CUDART (CUDA Runtime Library) is a crucial component of the CUDA toolkit. It provides the essential runtime functions and libraries that CUDA applications utilize to interact with the GPU, including memory management, kernel launching, and synchronization primitives.

The CUDA toolkit version number encompasses the entire package, including the compiler (nvcc), libraries (like CUDART), and other tools.  The CUDART version number, however, specifically designates the version of the runtime library.  While ideally, both should be congruent, perfect alignment isn't always mandated, depending on the specific CUDA features utilized within the application.

The key lies in the interplay between the CUDA driver version, the CUDA toolkit version, and the CUDART version. The driver acts as the interface between the operating system and the GPU hardware.  The toolkit version dictates the compiler capabilities and the features available in the libraries.  CUDART, as a core library within the toolkit, must be compatible with both the driver and the broader toolkit to ensure seamless functionality.

Using a newer CUDART with an older CUDA toolkit is generally the more problematic scenario.  The newer CUDART might contain functionalities or data structures that the older toolkit's compiler and other libraries aren't designed to handle. This can manifest in unexpected crashes, segmentation faults, or incorrect computations.  Conversely, using a newer toolkit with an older CUDART is less likely to cause immediate, catastrophic failures.  However, it can lead to performance degradation or the inability to leverage newer features introduced in the updated CUDART.  Therefore, aligning the versions is the best practice to eliminate uncertainty.

In my experience, attempting to circumvent this alignment led to unpredictable behavior during simulations involving large datasets.  Initially, I tried to deploy a newer CUDART to exploit minor performance improvements, while maintaining an older, well-tested CUDA toolkit to avoid potential recompilation issues.  This resulted in intermittent runtime errors that were incredibly difficult to debug.  Only by reverting to matching versions did I regain stability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the importance of version consistency.  Note that these are simplified for demonstration and do not represent complex CFD simulations.  They highlight the potential points of failure.

**Example 1:  Successful Matching Versions**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (Memory allocation and data transfer omitted for brevity) ...

    int n = 1024;
    int *a, *b, *c;
    int *dev_a, *dev_b, *dev_c;

    // ... (CUDA memory allocation and data transfer omitted for brevity) ...

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(dev_a, dev_b, dev_c, n);

    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // ... (Data transfer back to host and error checking omitted for brevity) ...

    return 0;
}
```

This code functions correctly when compiled with a matching CUDA toolkit and CUDART. The compiler and runtime library understand each other perfectly.


**Example 2: Mismatched Versions – Potential for Error**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h> // Newer CUDART
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void advancedKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n, float alpha) { // Using a new feature
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = (int)(alpha * (a[i] + b[i])); //Potential issues with type handling
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (Memory allocation, data transfer omitted) ...

    // ... (Kernel launch omitted) ...
    return 0;
}
```

This uses a hypothetical new feature (e.g., improved floating point handling) in a newer CUDART, compiled with an older CUDA toolkit. The compiler might not correctly handle the floating point arithmetic or the potential data structures introduced within the newer CUDART, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected results.


**Example 3:  Partial Compatibility – Performance Issues**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h> // Older CUDART
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void simpleKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data transfer omitted) ...

  // ... (Kernel launch omitted) ...
  return 0;
}

```

This example, compiled with a newer toolkit but an older CUDART, might not immediately crash. However, it could suffer from performance bottlenecks because the newer toolkit might optimize aspects not fully supported by the older CUDART.  This can result in underutilization of the GPU's capabilities.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.  Consult the release notes for each CUDA toolkit version to understand the compatibility requirements and the features introduced in each CUDART release.  The CUDA Programming Guide is also invaluable.  Furthermore, thoroughly examine the error messages generated during compilation and runtime, as these often provide crucial clues about version mismatches or incompatibilities.  Finally, maintain a clear record of the versions you use for each project to facilitate troubleshooting.
