TensorBoard's built-in functionality doesn't directly support merging pre-existing log directories.  This limitation stems from its design prioritizing individual experiment tracking, rather than post-hoc aggregation.  My experience working on large-scale model training pipelines at a previous employer highlighted this constraint frequently.  We often needed to consolidate results from different training runs or hyperparameter sweeps into a single visualization for comparative analysis.  Overcoming this requires a more nuanced approach leveraging the underlying data structure and file system manipulation.

The core solution involves programmatically combining the event files residing within each TensorBoard log directory. These event files, typically stored as Protocol Buffer (.tfevents) files, contain the scalar summaries, histograms, images, and other data visualized in TensorBoard.  Simple concatenation of the directories is insufficient as TensorBoard relies on the internal timestamps and metadata within each event file to correctly order and display the data.  Thus, a more sophisticated method is necessary.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The strategy involves creating a new, unified log directory and copying the contents of the individual log directories into it.  However, straightforward copying alone is insufficient.  Due to potential timestamp conflicts between different logs, a renaming scheme that incorporates run-specific identifiers is crucial to avoid data overwriting and maintain data integrity. This ensures that TensorBoard correctly interprets each run's data.

The process typically involves these steps:

* **Identify Source Directories:** Locate the paths to the individual TensorBoard log directories containing the .tfevents files you wish to combine.
* **Create Destination Directory:** Create a new empty directory to serve as the consolidated log directory.  A descriptive name reflecting the merged nature of the data is recommended.
* **Copy and Rename:** Iteratively copy the .tfevents files from each source directory to the destination directory.  Prepend a unique identifier to each filename, reflecting the original directory's source or run ID. This identifier will be used to distinguish data in the resulting TensorBoard visualization.
* **Launch TensorBoard:** Finally, launch TensorBoard pointing to the newly created unified log directory. The plots from the individual runs should now appear together, differentiated by their unique identifiers within the legends.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following code examples illustrate the process using Python's `shutil`, `os`, and `glob` modules.  These are common choices for file manipulation tasks.  Error handling and more robust file path checks are recommended in production environments.

**Example 1:  Simple Merging with Numerical Run Identifiers**

```python
import shutil
import os
import glob

source_dirs = ["run1", "run2", "run3"]  # Replace with actual paths
destination_dir = "merged_runs"

if not os.path.exists(destination_dir):
    os.makedirs(destination_dir)

for i, source_dir in enumerate(source_dirs):
    for file in glob.glob(os.path.join(source_dir, "*.tfevents*")):
        new_filename = f"run_{i+1}_{os.path.basename(file)}"
        shutil.copy2(file, os.path.join(destination_dir, new_filename)) # copy2 preserves metadata

print(f"Files merged into {destination_dir}")
```

This example uses numerical identifiers ("run_1", "run_2", etc.) to distinguish the different runs.  It's straightforward but may not be suitable for more complex scenarios.

**Example 2: Merging with Descriptive Run Identifiers from Subdirectories**

```python
import shutil
import os
import glob

source_dir = "experiments" #Contains subdirectories for individual runs
destination_dir = "merged_experiments"

if not os.path.exists(destination_dir):
    os.makedirs(destination_dir)

for subdir in os.listdir(source_dir):
    subdir_path = os.path.join(source_dir, subdir)
    if os.path.isdir(subdir_path):
        for file in glob.glob(os.path.join(subdir_path, "*.tfevents*")):
            new_filename = f"{subdir}_{os.path.basename(file)}"
            shutil.copy2(file, os.path.join(destination_dir, new_filename))

print(f"Files merged into {destination_dir}")
```

This example assumes a more organized structure where individual runs are in subdirectories within a main "experiments" directory. This allows for more descriptive labels in the final TensorBoard visualization.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple Event Files per Run (More Robust)**


```python
import shutil
import os
import glob
import re

source_dir = "experiments"
destination_dir = "merged_experiments_robust"
timestamp_pattern = r"(\d+)" # Pattern to extract timestamp for sorting

if not os.path.exists(destination_dir):
    os.makedirs(destination_dir)

for subdir in os.listdir(source_dir):
    subdir_path = os.path.join(source_dir, subdir)
    if os.path.isdir(subdir_path):
        files = glob.glob(os.path.join(subdir_path, "*.tfevents*"))
        files.sort(key=lambda x: int(re.search(timestamp_pattern, x).group(1)) ) #Sort by timestamp if available

        for i, file in enumerate(files):
            new_filename = f"{subdir}_{i:02d}_{os.path.basename(file)}" #Adding index for multiple files
            shutil.copy2(file, os.path.join(destination_dir, new_filename))

print(f"Files merged into {destination_dir}")

```
This example improves on the previous one by adding more robust timestamp based sorting of the files to maintain the correct order of events if multiple event files exist per run (e.g. for extremely long runs that TensorBoard breaks into multiple files).  Regular expressions are used for timestamp extraction.  Note: This assumes that the timestamp is present in a consistent format within the file name.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on TensorBoard usage and the structure of the event files, provides essential background information.  A thorough understanding of Python's file manipulation libraries (`shutil`, `os`, `glob`, and potentially `pathlib`) is crucial for implementing these solutions effectively.  Familiarity with regular expressions is beneficial for more sophisticated file name parsing and manipulation, as demonstrated in Example 3.  Consult the Python documentation for detailed information on these libraries.  For advanced scenarios, exploring libraries designed for data manipulation and analysis might provide additional options but are unnecessary for the basic merging process detailed above.
