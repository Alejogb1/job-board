Improving the accuracy of Naive Bayes classification on survey data using NLTK often hinges on effective feature selection, particularly the removal of irrelevant words.  My experience working on sentiment analysis projects within large-scale customer surveys highlighted the crucial role of preprocessing in mitigating the impact of noise.  Ignoring this step frequently leads to diluted probabilities and consequently, poor classification performance.  The key lies in identifying and eliminating words that don't contribute meaningfully to distinguishing between classes.

This process begins with careful consideration of the data itself.  Understanding the survey's context and the specific variables being classified is paramount.  For example, if classifying survey responses into "satisfied" and "dissatisfied" categories, words like "the," "a," and "is" offer minimal discriminatory power.  Instead, we should focus on terms expressing positive or negative sentiment.  This understanding directly informs the feature selection techniques employed.

The most straightforward approach involves stop word removal. Stop words are common words (like articles, prepositions, and conjunctions) that often clutter the data without adding significant semantic information.  NLTK provides a readily available list of English stop words, but customization is crucial for optimal results.  Survey-specific jargon or contextually important words might be mistakenly classified as stop words, leading to information loss.  Therefore, a nuanced review and potential modification of the default stop word list is necessary.

Beyond stop word removal, stemming and lemmatization play important roles. Stemming reduces words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"), while lemmatization reduces words to their dictionary form (e.g., "better" becomes "good").  Both techniques help consolidate variations of the same word, reducing the feature space and improving model efficiency.  However, aggressive stemming can sometimes result in loss of semantic meaning, so careful consideration of the chosen algorithm is vital.  Porter Stemmer and WordNet Lemmatizer are frequently used options within NLTK.

Finally, feature selection techniques, such as chi-squared testing or mutual information calculation, can systematically identify words strongly correlated with the class labels.  These methods quantify the relevance of each word and allow for the removal of those with low scores.  This approach offers a data-driven way to refine the feature set, reducing dimensionality and potentially improving classification accuracy.  These techniques are computationally more expensive than stop word removal but offer a much more precise way of reducing noise.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Stop Word Removal and Basic Classification**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
from nltk.probability import FreqDist

# Download necessary NLTK data (only needs to be run once)
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Sample survey data (replace with your actual data)
survey_data = [
    ("This product is amazing!", "satisfied"),
    ("I am very unhappy with the service.", "dissatisfied"),
    ("The product is okay, but could be better.", "dissatisfied"),
    ("I love this product!", "satisfied"),
    ("Absolutely terrible experience.", "dissatisfied")
]

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

def preprocess(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    filtered_tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w in stop_words and w.isalnum()] # Remove stop words and non-alphanumeric characters
    return dict([(word, True) for word in filtered_tokens])

processed_data = [(preprocess(text), label) for text, label in survey_data]

train_data = processed_data
classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_data)

test_data = [("This is a great product!", "satisfied"), ("I hate this service", "dissatisfied")]
test_processed = [(preprocess(text), label) for text, label in test_data]
accuracy = nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_processed)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

print(classifier.show_most_informative_features(5))

```

This example demonstrates a basic implementation, focusing on stop word removal and a simple Naive Bayes classifier. The `preprocess` function tokenizes, lowercases, and filters stop words before creating a feature dictionary for the classifier.  The accuracy score and the most informative features provide insight into classifier performance.  Note this example uses a very small dataset for illustration.  In a real world application, significantly more data would be required.


**Example 2:  Lemmatization and Feature Selection using Chi-Squared**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
from nltk.probability import FreqDist
from nltk.classify.util import apply_features
from nltk.metrics import scores
from nltk.collocations import BigramCollocationFinder
from nltk.metrics import BigramAssocMeasures

# ... (NLTK data download as in Example 1) ...

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

def preprocess_lemmatize(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    filtered_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in tokens if not w in stop_words and w.isalnum()]
    return dict([(word, True) for word in filtered_tokens])

processed_data = [(preprocess_lemmatize(text), label) for text, label in survey_data]

# Feature Selection using Chi-squared
all_words = FreqDist(w for text, label in processed_data for w in text)
word_features = [w for w, c in all_words.most_common(3000)] # Select top 3000 features

def extract_features(document):
    document_words = set(document)
    features = {}
    for word in word_features:
        features['contains({})'.format(word)] = (word in document_words)
    return features


train_set = apply_features(extract_features, processed_data)

classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)

# ... (Testing as in Example 1) ...

```

This example incorporates lemmatization and demonstrates a basic feature selection method by limiting the features to the 3000 most frequent words.  This reduces the dimensionality of the feature space, potentially leading to improved performance and reduced computational cost.


**Example 3:  N-gram Consideration and Custom Stop Word List**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
from nltk.collocations import BigramCollocationFinder
from nltk.metrics import BigramAssocMeasures

# ... (NLTK data download as in Example 1) ...

# Custom stop word list
custom_stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english')) | {"product", "service"} #Example custom words

def preprocess_ngrams(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    filtered_tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w in custom_stopwords and w.isalnum()]
    bigram_finder = BigramCollocationFinder.from_words(filtered_tokens)
    scored = bigram_finder.score_ngrams(BigramAssocMeasures.chi_sq)
    top_bigrams = [bigram for bigram, score in scored[:10]] #Selecting top 10 bigrams
    features = dict([(word, True) for word in filtered_tokens] + [(bigram, True) for bigram in top_bigrams])
    return features

processed_data = [(preprocess_ngrams(text), label) for text, label in survey_data]

classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(processed_data)

# ... (Testing as in Example 1) ...

```

This example introduces N-grams (here, bigrams) and demonstrates the use of a custom stop word list.  This approach captures word combinations that might carry more meaning than individual words.  The inclusion of bigrams improves the capability to capture contextual information and identify phrases signifying sentiment. The chi-squared measure selects the most significant bigrams.

Remember, the optimal approach depends heavily on the specific characteristics of your survey data.  Experimentation with different preprocessing steps, feature selection techniques, and parameter tuning is crucial for achieving the best results.  Iterative refinement based on model performance evaluation is key to success.
