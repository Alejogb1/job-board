Direct manipulation of image tensor dimensions in PyTorch, particularly when aiming to combine them without distortion, requires careful consideration of the underlying data representation. I've encountered numerous cases, during my time developing vision models, where a misunderstanding of these operations led to unusable data, necessitating a thorough understanding of `torch.cat`, `torch.stack`, and `torch.reshape`. Distortion in this context generally arises from altering the spatial arrangement of pixel information unintentionally, not from numerical inaccuracies.

First, let’s define what we mean by "combining dimensions." We could be aiming to concatenate images side-by-side, stack them into a mini-batch, or rearrange channel information. Each operation requires a distinct approach. The key is preserving the interpretation of spatial dimensions (height, width) during these transformations. We must also avoid introducing new, unwanted dimensions or collapsing crucial ones that would lead to data loss.

`torch.cat` is fundamental for combining tensors along an existing dimension. When dealing with image tensors, one would typically utilize `torch.cat` to combine multiple image tensors either horizontally or vertically. Presuming images are represented as tensors of the format (C, H, W), where C is the number of channels, H is height, and W is width, concatenating two images of the same size vertically requires applying the operation across the height dimension. The channel and width dimensions are unchanged in this case. If images have a (B, C, H, W) format, where B is the batch dimension, the batch dimension would have to be the same, otherwise, concatenation is not defined.

```python
import torch

# Example: Concatenating two RGB images vertically

image1 = torch.randn(3, 100, 200)  # 3 channels, 100 height, 200 width
image2 = torch.randn(3, 150, 200) # 3 channels, 150 height, 200 width
#Note they have the same channels and width, allowing them to be concatenated across their height.

concatenated_image = torch.cat((image1, image2), dim=1)

print(f"Shape of image 1: {image1.shape}")
print(f"Shape of image 2: {image2.shape}")
print(f"Shape of concatenated image: {concatenated_image.shape}")
# Output: torch.Size([3, 250, 200])

```
In this example, I used `dim=1`, which corresponds to the height dimension. The channel and width dimensions remained unchanged, and we successfully combined the heights of the two images. If the shapes are incompatible across any dimension aside from the target concatenation axis, a runtime error will occur. Also, it is crucial to note that `torch.cat` does not create a new dimension; it operates within the existing structure.

`torch.stack`, on the other hand, adds a new dimension to the tensors during combination. This is vital when creating mini-batches of images for training. For example, several images of the same size can be stacked into a batch, which would then be used in model training. Instead of concatenating along an existing axis, it creates a new axis. This can be useful when combining images, especially for batch processing. If your intention is to combine images such that each occupies its own mini-batch slot, this is the operation you require.

```python
import torch

# Example: Stacking two RGB images into a batch

image1 = torch.randn(3, 100, 200)
image2 = torch.randn(3, 100, 200)
#The image dimensions must be exactly the same to be stacked together.

stacked_images = torch.stack((image1, image2), dim=0)

print(f"Shape of image 1: {image1.shape}")
print(f"Shape of image 2: {image2.shape}")
print(f"Shape of stacked images: {stacked_images.shape}")
# Output: torch.Size([2, 3, 100, 200])

```
Here, `dim=0` specifies that the new dimension should be inserted at the beginning, resulting in a shape of (2, 3, 100, 200). This signifies two images, with three channels, 100 height, and 200 width, forming a mini-batch. Stacking does not modify the underlying dimensions of the original images but instead combines them into a structure appropriate for model consumption.

`torch.reshape` is another powerful tool for manipulating tensor dimensions, but it should be used carefully with image data. This operation can arbitrarily change the shape of a tensor, and it is possible to introduce distortion if one isn’t careful to preserve the relationship of spatial information. For instance, if the objective is to take all the channels and place them as one long vector, this is achieved via reshaping. It’s not technically combining, but it can be helpful to know this operation in the context of manipulating tensor dimensions.

```python
import torch

# Example: Reshaping an image tensor

image = torch.randn(3, 100, 200)

reshaped_image = torch.reshape(image, (3, 20000))

print(f"Shape of image: {image.shape}")
print(f"Shape of reshaped image: {reshaped_image.shape}")
# Output: torch.Size([3, 20000])
reshaped_back_image = torch.reshape(reshaped_image,(3,100,200))
print(f"Shape of reshaped_back image: {reshaped_back_image.shape}")

```
In this example, I reshaped a (3, 100, 200) image tensor into (3, 20000). The result is still a tensor, but the spatial meaning has been lost because we have flattened the height and width dimensions into one singular axis with a length equal to their product, in this case 20000. One can also reshape it back, however one must know the correct dimensions they intend to reshape it to. Reshaping can be helpful if there's a need to transform pixel information into vector format, but careful attention must be given to avoid losing important spatial correlations or introduce undesirable pixel relationships.

When combining or reshaping image data, one must be cognizant of the desired application. If one is training a model in a standard batch training setting, `torch.stack` is likely necessary. If one needs to visualize or analyze multiple images side-by-side, then `torch.cat` might be necessary. Finally, one may sometimes require `torch.reshape` if a custom operation requires some type of image information flattened out into vector format. Improper use of these operations will result in unusable data.

In practical scenarios, I often use a combination of these operations. For instance, after loading several images, I might first use `torch.cat` to combine smaller images into larger mosaics for pre-processing. Subsequently, I use `torch.stack` to group these mosaic images into mini-batches to be fed to a convolutional neural network. These operations must always be planned in a way that preserves the underlying image structure for each application.

For further understanding, I'd recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation. Additionally, consulting textbooks specializing in deep learning with computer vision often provides a more robust conceptual framework for these operations, especially for vision tasks. Reading the source code for popular vision model implementations can also offer practical insights into how these operations are typically applied in real-world settings. A sound understanding of the underlying data representation of image tensors, as well as how different tensor operations affect those representations is paramount to successfully performing data manipulation when dealing with images in PyTorch.
