The core mechanism enabling a TensorFlow hidden layer to compute the derivative of previous layers' outputs with respect to its inputs is the application of the chain rule of calculus during backpropagation.  This isn't a magical process; it's a systematic application of established mathematical principles, specifically leveraging the computational graph built implicitly by TensorFlow.  My experience developing and debugging large-scale neural networks in TensorFlow, including recurrent models for natural language processing and convolutional networks for image recognition, has highlighted the crucial role of automatic differentiation in this process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, like other automatic differentiation frameworks, employs a computational graph to represent the network's architecture. Each node in this graph represents an operation, and the edges represent the data flow.  During the forward pass, the input data traverses the graph, resulting in the computation of activations at each layer.  The key lies in the backward pass – backpropagation.  This isn't a separate algorithm but rather the application of the chain rule to efficiently compute the gradients.

Let's consider a simple scenario with three layers: an input layer (X), a hidden layer (H), and an output layer (Y).  The hidden layer performs a transformation on the input: H = f(Wx + b), where W is the weight matrix, b is the bias vector, and f is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid). The output layer, in turn, computes Y = g(VH + c), where V is the weight matrix, c is the bias vector, and g is the activation function.  Our objective is to calculate ∂Y/∂X, the gradient of the output with respect to the input.

The chain rule allows us to decompose this into smaller, manageable gradients:

∂Y/∂X = (∂Y/∂H) * (∂H/∂X)

TensorFlow automatically computes these partial derivatives.  `∂Y/∂H` is the gradient of the output layer's activation with respect to the hidden layer's output.  This involves calculating the gradient of the activation function `g` and the weight matrix `V`.  `∂H/∂X` is the gradient of the hidden layer's activation with respect to the input.  This similarly involves the gradient of the activation function `f` and the weight matrix `W`.

The crucial point is that TensorFlow doesn't explicitly compute these derivatives symbolically. Instead, it leverages computational graph traversal and pre-defined gradients for standard operations (like matrix multiplication, addition, and common activation functions). During the backward pass, it traverses the graph in reverse order, applying the chain rule at each node to accumulate the gradients efficiently. This process exploits the fact that most operations have readily available derivative functions.  Any custom operation needs to provide its own gradient function for this to work seamlessly. This automatic computation of gradients is a significant advantage of using frameworks like TensorFlow, freeing developers from the complexities of manual differentiation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Dense Layer with ReLU Activation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), # Hidden layer
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Output layer
])

# Compile the model (specifying the optimizer implicitly handles backpropagation)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Example input data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Train the model (backpropagation occurs during training)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Access layer weights and biases (for demonstration)
hidden_layer_weights = model.layers[0].get_weights()[0]
hidden_layer_bias = model.layers[0].get_weights()[1]

print("Hidden Layer Weights Shape:", hidden_layer_weights.shape)
print("Hidden Layer Bias Shape:", hidden_layer_bias.shape)
```

This example shows a basic setup.  The `model.compile` and `model.fit` steps implicitly perform backpropagation, calculating gradients using automatic differentiation.  The optimizer (`adam` in this case) utilizes these gradients to update weights and biases.  The code also demonstrates how to access the weights and biases learned through this process.

**Example 2: Custom Layer with Gradient Definition:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, 64), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)

  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.math.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w))

  def get_config(self):
    config = super().get_config().copy()
    return config


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
#...rest of training as above...
```

Here, we define a custom layer. Because it utilizes standard TensorFlow operations (matrix multiplication and `tanh`), no explicit gradient definition is needed; TensorFlow automatically handles it.  If using more complex or non-standard operations within the `call` method, a `get_gradients` function would need to be implemented.

**Example 3:  Accessing Gradients Directly:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#...model definition as in Example 1...

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(x_train)
  loss = tf.keras.losses.mse(y_train, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

# gradients will contain the gradients for each trainable variable (weights and biases) in the model.
# Iterating over these gradients can help you understand the gradient flow through the network.

for i, gradient in enumerate(gradients):
    print(f"Gradient shape for variable {i}: {gradient.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates how to use `tf.GradientTape` to explicitly access the gradients computed during backpropagation. This provides a more fine-grained view of the gradient flow, which is helpful for debugging or advanced optimization techniques.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow documentation:  Thoroughly covers the framework's functionalities, including automatic differentiation.  Focus on sections detailing `tf.GradientTape` and the inner workings of the Keras API.
*   A textbook on deep learning:  Deep learning texts offer a solid foundation in the underlying mathematical principles and algorithms.  Pay close attention to chapters on backpropagation and optimization.
*   Advanced TensorFlow tutorials:  Search for tutorials focusing on custom layers and gradient manipulation for a deeper understanding of the process.


By combining a strong understanding of the chain rule with the capabilities of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation, the computation of gradients across multiple layers is elegantly and efficiently handled, forming the bedrock of modern neural network training.  The provided examples showcase different approaches to accessing and utilizing these computed gradients.  Careful study of the recommended resources will further solidify one's grasp of this crucial aspect of deep learning.
