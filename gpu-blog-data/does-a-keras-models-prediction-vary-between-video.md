The core issue lies in the inherent difference between treating video frames as independent data points versus understanding them as a temporal sequence.  My experience optimizing video classification models for anomaly detection in manufacturing processes has shown conclusively that predicting on individual frames versus sequences yields significantly different, and often, less accurate results. A Keras model, regardless of architecture, will process each input independently unless explicitly designed for sequential data processing.  This distinction fundamentally alters the model's ability to capture crucial contextual information.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

A single video frame, extracted from a video stream, represents a snapshot in time.  A Keras model trained on individual frames learns to classify based solely on the visual content of that single image.  Features like motion, temporal evolution of objects, and changes in context are completely ignored.  In contrast, when a model processes a sequence of frames (a video clip), it can leverage recurrent or convolutional layers designed to capture temporal dependencies.  These layers incorporate information from previous frames, enriching the context available for prediction.  Consequently, a model trained on video clips (sequences) will often generate more accurate and robust predictions than a model trained on and predicting from individual frames. This is due to the inclusion of temporal dynamics â€“ crucial information that static image-based predictions inherently miss.  The accuracy difference stems directly from the information loss when ignoring temporal correlations.  Moreover, the type of task itself significantly affects the outcome.  If the task is action recognition, which is inherently temporal, then frame-by-frame classification will fail to capture the essence of the action.  Alternatively, if the task is object detection in a relatively static scene, frame-by-frame prediction might yield acceptable results, though it might still be less robust to variations compared to a model that uses short temporal sequences.  The model's architecture also plays a role. For example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) can effectively process individual frames; however, the same CNN architecture applied to a sequence of frames might underperform unless augmented by recurrent layers (like LSTMs or GRUs) to handle the sequential aspect of the data.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Frame-by-Frame Prediction using a CNN**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Assume 'frames' is a NumPy array of shape (N, H, W, C), where N is the number of frames,
# H and W are height and width, and C is the number of channels.

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Assuming 10 classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Predict on individual frames
predictions = model.predict(frames) #  Predictions will be of shape (N, 10)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward CNN predicting on individual frames. Each frame is processed independently.  The resulting `predictions` array provides the class probabilities for each frame. The model's architecture doesn't inherently capture temporal relationships.

**Example 2: Sequence Prediction using a CNN-LSTM hybrid**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, TimeDistributed, LSTM, Dense

# Assume 'video_clips' is a NumPy array of shape (N, T, H, W, C), where N is the number of clips,
# T is the number of frames per clip, H and W are height and width, and C is the number of channels.

model = keras.Sequential([
    TimeDistributed(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'), input_shape=(10, 64, 64, 3)), # 10 frames per clip
    TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))),
    TimeDistributed(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')),
    TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))),
    TimeDistributed(Flatten()),
    LSTM(128),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Predict on sequences of frames
predictions = model.predict(video_clips) # Predictions will be of shape (N, 10)
```

This example leverages a CNN-LSTM architecture.  `TimeDistributed` wraps the convolutional layers, applying them to each frame within a clip. The LSTM layer processes the sequence of feature vectors extracted by the CNN, capturing temporal dependencies.  The final prediction represents the classification of the entire video clip.

**Example 3: 3D Convolutional Approach**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv3D, MaxPooling3D, Flatten, Dense

# Assume 'video_clips' is a NumPy array of shape (N, T, H, W, C) as in Example 2.

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling3D((2, 2, 2)),
    Conv3D(64, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling3D((2, 2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Predict on sequences of frames.  The 3D convolutions inherently consider temporal context.
predictions = model.predict(video_clips) # Predictions will be of shape (N, 10)
```

Here, a 3D convolutional network directly processes spatiotemporal data.  The three spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension are handled concurrently, offering an alternative way to capture temporal relationships without explicit recurrent layers. This approach is computationally expensive but can be very effective.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of temporal modeling in Keras, I suggest consulting the Keras documentation and exploring resources on recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs and GRUs.  Furthermore,  research papers on video classification and action recognition offer valuable insights into the various architectural choices and data preprocessing techniques.  Textbooks on deep learning provide a foundational understanding of convolutional neural networks and their applications to image and video data.  Finally, I highly recommend exploring existing video classification datasets and pre-trained models to learn from established practices and benchmark your own models.  These resources, when used systematically, will build a robust understanding of the complexities involved in video data processing.
