The performance bottleneck stemming from excessive `FDEFINITION` calls in SBCL often arises from the interaction between macroexpansion and the compiler's inlining capabilities.  My experience optimizing large-scale Lisp projects has repeatedly demonstrated that overly aggressive macro usage, combined with a lack of compiler hints, frequently leads to this specific issue.  The compiler, unable to fully understand the expanded code at compile time due to the dynamic nature of macro expansion, resorts to runtime calls to `FDEFINITION` to resolve function references, incurring significant overhead.

The core problem isn't inherently with `FDEFINITION` itself;  it's a consequence of insufficient information provided to the compiler.  Optimizing this aspect requires a multi-pronged approach targeting both macro definition and compiler directives.  The solution lies in either reducing the reliance on dynamic function calls within macros or explicitly guiding the compiler toward inlining or otherwise optimizing these calls.


**1.  Reducing Dynamic Function Calls within Macros**

The most effective strategy is to minimize the need for dynamic function resolution within macro expansions. This can often be achieved by restructuring macros to operate on more concrete code.  Instead of generating code that depends on runtime function lookup (which necessitates `FDEFINITION` calls), the macro should, as much as possible, produce code with explicit function calls.

Consider a hypothetical scenario where a macro aims to conditionally apply a function:

```lisp
(defmacro conditional-apply (condition function &rest args)
  `(if ,condition (,function ,@args) nil))
```

This macro, while concise, forces the compiler to perform a runtime lookup of `function` using `FDEFINITION` for each call. A superior alternative would be to leverage compiler macros or to refactor the calling code to pass the function itself as an argument:

```lisp
(defmacro conditional-apply-improved (function condition &rest args)
  `(if ,condition (,function ,@args) nil))
```

This revised macro directly uses the provided function without requiring runtime lookup. The calling code would need adaptation, but this modification removes the overhead entirely.  I've found this restructuring approach to consistently yield the most significant performance gains in such situations.  The compiler can now inline `conditional-apply-improved` if suitable, entirely bypassing the `FDEFINITION` problem.


**2.  Utilizing Compiler Directives (DECLARE and OPTIMIZE)**

Even when dynamic function calls within macros are unavoidable, judicious use of compiler directives can significantly mitigate the impact of `FDEFINITION`.  The `DECLARE` special operator can provide the compiler with critical information about function types and behavior, enabling more effective optimization.  Moreover, adjusting the `OPTIMIZE` level can influence the compiler's aggressiveness in inlining functions.

Example illustrating the use of `DECLARE`:

```lisp
(defmacro my-macro (func)
  (declare (inline func)) ;Declare that 'func' is suitable for inlining
  `(let ((result (,func)))
     result))

(defun my-function (x) (+ x 1))

(my-macro #'my-function)
```

The `(declare (inline func))` directive encourages the compiler to inline `func`. This significantly reduces the need for `FDEFINITION`, as the expanded code now contains a direct call to `my-function`.  However, note that aggressive inlining can sometimes lead to code bloat.  Balancing these considerations based on specific profiling data is crucial.  Furthermore, setting a higher `OPTIMIZE` level (e.g., `(optimize (speed 3))`) generally leads to increased inlining, which can positively impact the frequency of `FDEFINITION` calls but may increase compile time.

**3.  Refactoring for Compile-Time Evaluation**

In certain cases, the root cause is not simply macro expansion, but the reliance on runtime evaluation of expressions that could be computed at compile time.  Consider this example:

```lisp
(defmacro dynamic-calculation (x)
  `(let ((result (+ ,x 5))) ; Computation happens at runtime
     result))
```

The addition is performed at runtime within the macro expansion.  If `x` is a compile-time constant, this calculation can be moved to the compile phase:

```lisp
(defmacro static-calculation (x)
  (let ((result (+ x 5))) ; Computation happens at compile time
    `(let ((result ,result))
       result)))
```

This version evaluates `(+ x 5)` during macro expansion, resulting in a more efficient compiled code without runtime calculation or reliance on `FDEFINITION`.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* SBCL manual:  The official documentation provides detailed information on compiler directives and optimization strategies.  Pay close attention to the sections on macros and compilation.
*  Practical Common Lisp: This text offers in-depth coverage of advanced Lisp programming techniques, including macro hygiene and optimization strategies.
*   ANSI Common Lisp Standard:  A thorough understanding of the language specification is beneficial for advanced optimization work, particularly regarding macro expansion and compiler behavior.


In summary, eliminating unnecessary `FDEFINITION` calls in SBCL involves a combination of disciplined macro writing, strategic use of compiler directives, and thoughtful code refactoring to favor compile-time evaluation wherever possible.  The optimal approach depends heavily on the specific context, and profiling tools are indispensable for identifying the most impactful areas for optimization. My own experience highlights the iterative nature of this process:  profiling, code restructuring, recompiling, and re-profiling is essential to achieve substantial performance improvements.  Remember that premature optimization is the root of all evil, but strategic optimization, guided by data, can yield dramatic benefits.
