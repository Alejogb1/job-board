The AlexNet architecture, despite its age, remains a foundational example of deep convolutional neural networks and serves as an excellent starting point for transfer learning. Working with it in TensorFlow involves several steps, primarily loading the pretrained weights, potentially modifying its architecture for a specific task, and then fine-tuning or utilizing it for feature extraction. My experiences, specifically in a computer vision project involving plant disease classification where computational resources were limited, reinforced the importance of leveraging such pre-trained models.

First, understanding that AlexNet was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset, a massive collection of labeled images spanning various object categories, is crucial. This training provides the model with robust feature extraction capabilities for general image understanding. However, the original AlexNet was designed for a 1000-class classification task. Therefore, if your specific task is not a 1000-class classification, adjustments to the final layers are necessary.

Loading the pretrained AlexNet in TensorFlow is achieved using the `tf.keras.applications` module. This module offers various pre-built models with weights preloaded. The process begins by importing the necessary libraries and selecting the desired model. One critical point here is the 'include_top' parameter. When set to True (the default), the entire network, including the classification layer, is loaded. Setting it to False discards this layer, allowing customization of the final output stage. Often, for transfer learning, we disable the top layers and use AlexNet as a feature extraction component. This requires understanding the internal structure of AlexNet, which comprises convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Below is an example illustrating how to load AlexNet without the top layer and append a custom classification head:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import AlexNet
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load AlexNet without the top layer
base_model = AlexNet(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(227, 227, 3))

# Freeze the weights of the base model during initial training.
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Add a custom classification layer on top of the AlexNet base
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x) # Reduces the spatial dimensions to a single vector.
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x) # Added fully connected layer to refine the extracted feature representation.
predictions = Dense(5, activation='softmax')(x) # Final classification layer, 5 classes in this example.

# Create the full model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Display the structure of the model.
model.summary()

# Example compilation for demonstration, consider appropriate parameters for your task
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In this code, I utilized `GlobalAveragePooling2D` to reduce the spatial dimensionality of the feature maps output by the base AlexNet. This technique often improves generalization and reduces overfitting. Also, I've added a dense layer of 1024 units to further refine features. Finally, the output layer `predictions` is constructed to have 5 output nodes, appropriate for a task with 5 classes. The weights in the base AlexNet model have been frozen, meaning they are not changed during the initial training. This step helps prevent the pre-trained weights from being dramatically altered during the training on new data; This can prove particularly beneficial when the dataset for the target task is smaller than the ImageNet dataset. The `model.summary()` output proves valuable in inspecting the final network structure, including the number of parameters and shape of each layer's output.

Another key aspect is image preprocessing. AlexNet was originally trained on images resized to 227x227 pixels. Consequently, before passing images to the network, one must resize them to this input size. Additionally, images used for training AlexNet were also normalized, which means a preprocessing step that normalizes pixels to be within a specific range (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]) is usually required. The TensorFlow `tf.keras.preprocessing.image` module provides utilities for image manipulation.

Here's an example of preprocessing and making a prediction using the prepared model. It also demonstrates how to use the loaded model after making changes:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image

# Load and preprocess an image
img_path = 'your_image.jpg' # Replace with your image path
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(227, 227)) # resize the image to the expected input size
img_array = image.img_to_array(img) # convert to numpy array
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0) # add a dimension for batch
img_array = img_array / 255.  # Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]

# Perform prediction using the loaded model
predictions = model.predict(img_array)

# Print the predicted probabilities for each class
print(predictions)
```

In this snippet, I've loaded an example image, resized it to 227x227, converted it into a NumPy array, added a batch dimension, and normalized the pixel values. The normalized image is then fed into the loaded and modified model, and the raw output of prediction can be seen. Interpretation of these probabilities (e.g., using `np.argmax` to retrieve the class with the highest probability) is then required according to the specific task.

Fine-tuning, as opposed to just feature extraction, involves also updating the weights in some of the layers from the pre-trained AlexNet. While it can lead to improved performance, it requires careful consideration of the training parameters and regularization to avoid overfitting, especially when the target dataset is relatively small. It also generally requires more computational resources.

Here's an example showing how to unfreeze some of the base model's layers and continue training with a new dataset. It's essential to recompile the model after unfreezing layers for the changes to take effect:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import AlexNet
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Same base model setup, except do not freeze layers immediately
base_model = AlexNet(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(227, 227, 3))

# Add a custom classification layer on top of the AlexNet base
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(5, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)


#Unfreeze some of the layers in base model. For demonstration, let's use last 3 layers of the base
for layer in base_model.layers[-3:]:
    layer.trainable = True

#Recompile the model with lower learning rate for fine tuning
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.00001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


# Assuming you have a pre-loaded or generator based training dataset called "train_data"
# Assuming you have a validation dataset called "val_data"
# Replace this placeholder with your code
# train_data = ...
# val_data = ...

# Fine-tune the model on the new data
model.fit(train_data,
            epochs=10, # Adjust epochs based on performance.
            validation_data=val_data)
```

In this example, I am only unfreezing the last three layers of AlexNet and using a very low learning rate during training. When doing this on practical tasks, you need to tune these parameter appropriately. The choice of layers to unfreeze should be carefully considered based on the complexity of the target task and the size of the available training data. Smaller datasets typically benefit from freezing more layers, while larger datasets allow for fine-tuning of more layers.

For further understanding of transfer learning and working with pretrained models, I recommend researching resources on the TensorFlow documentation website and related books and articles on deep learning. Exploring advanced training techniques like learning rate decay and data augmentation will also prove beneficial in applying this knowledge to practical problems. Remember, experimentation and careful observation are key when developing solutions using these methods.
