TensorFlow's dynamic graph construction, fundamental to its operation, necessitates careful consideration when modifying TensorFlow code in one Python file and attempting to utilize those changes when importing that file into another. The core challenge arises from the fact that TensorFlow operations, once defined, are inherently tied to the graph they were created within, and these graph connections aren't automatically updated across different Python module scopes. The solution primarily involves structuring your code such that modifications occur *before* TensorFlow operations are consumed by the importing file or employing mechanisms that facilitate shared graph access or redefinition.

The issue I've frequently encountered revolves around incorrectly attempting to modify a TensorFlow model or operation after its initial definition. Consider a scenario where 'model.py' defines a basic neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API. The initial instantiation of the model creates specific tensors and operations within the graph. If 'main.py' imports 'model.py', it gets a reference to that already-constructed model. Attempting to change the model's architecture, weights, or activation functions within 'main.py' will likely have no effect on the object inherited from 'model.py', as the underlying TensorFlow graph is already finalized at that point of the import. Modifications won't propagate.

Therefore, the primary strategy is to structure the code in 'model.py' such that the TensorFlow operations are *not* constructed until the point where all desired modifications are in place. This often means creating functions or classes that encapsulate model definition, allowing flexibility before the graph's creation. Additionally, a few approaches allow for delayed graph construction or graph sharing, though these have caveats that require careful handling to prevent unintended conflicts or performance issues.

The most effective way I've found is to abstract the model construction into a function, passing in the parameters controlling the structure. Consider this initial, problematic version of 'model.py':

```python
# model.py
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

And an attempt to modify it in `main.py` without a function-based structure.

```python
# main.py
import tensorflow as tf
from model import model

#Attempting to modify after import
model.layers[0] = tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,))

#This change won't affect the model object used in other parts of main.py
print(model.layers[0].units) #Will print 128, not 256.
```

This structure is inherently flawed; after the model is created in 'model.py', its graph is instantiated, and direct modification as shown has no effect because a new layer is created that’s not tied to the object’s graph structure. The key is to defer graph construction.

The revised 'model.py' uses a function to construct the model:

```python
# model.py
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hidden_units=128):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_units, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model
```

Now in `main.py`, the model is built after all desired modifications are established.

```python
# main.py
import tensorflow as tf
from model import build_model

modified_model = build_model(hidden_units=256)

print(modified_model.layers[0].units) #will print 256.

# You can now use modified_model as desired.
```
This approach allows the `main.py` module to control the model's architecture, a significant improvement. The key is that graph construction is done at a time when changes are desired.

Another approach is utilizing a class structure, which can provide even greater control over modification and reusability. Here is the revised `model.py` using classes:
```python
# model.py
import tensorflow as tf

class ModelBuilder:
  def __init__(self, hidden_units=128):
    self.hidden_units = hidden_units
  
  def build(self):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.hidden_units, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model
```

And the corresponding `main.py` that allows for the change:

```python
# main.py
from model import ModelBuilder

#modify the class itself.
model_builder = ModelBuilder(hidden_units = 256)
modified_model = model_builder.build()
print(modified_model.layers[0].units) #will print 256.

# You can now use modified_model as desired.
```

This object-oriented approach offers an organized way to store and alter parameters prior to generating the computational graph. Further, it allows multiple model variations to be built on the same imported class. This encapsulates the changeable aspects of the model making modification cleaner, scalable, and easier to test.

Finally, in specific scenarios, particularly those involving complex shared-resource situations, one might consider using `tf.get_default_graph()` to share the same graph context across files. However, this method must be used with extreme caution as improper shared graph modifications may cause unpredictable behaviors and race conditions during training or inference. Sharing graphs should be implemented with clear understanding of the implications.

```python
# model.py
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hidden_units=128, graph = None):
    if graph == None:
        graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    
    with graph.as_default():
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_units, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        ])
    return model
```

And `main.py`, using a specific graph to modify operations:

```python
# main.py
import tensorflow as tf
from model import build_model

shared_graph = tf.Graph()
modified_model = build_model(hidden_units = 256, graph = shared_graph)
with shared_graph.as_default():
    print(modified_model.layers[0].units) #will print 256
# The same graph can be further modified, used in another file etc.
```

While shared graphs allow for changes after initial definition, it quickly becomes cumbersome with larger projects with potential for naming conflicts and hard to debug issues. It is rarely the correct answer for general model modification.

In summary, effective modification of TensorFlow operations across different Python files requires a paradigm shift away from modifying pre-existing TensorFlow graph structures. Employing functions or classes to abstract the model building process, thereby deferring graph creation until all necessary parameters are specified, is the preferred method. Sharing graphs should be employed carefully, with the full awareness of the potential pitfalls.

For continued learning on this topic, I would recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation on graph management, specifically around the usage of `tf.Graph` and graph scopes. Further, resources covering the best practices for defining and using Keras models will be of benefit. Investigating design patterns, such as the factory pattern, is also useful when thinking of flexible model building. Finally, seeking training materials that cover both eager execution and graph modes of TensorFlow operation will aid in building a deep understanding of these issues.
