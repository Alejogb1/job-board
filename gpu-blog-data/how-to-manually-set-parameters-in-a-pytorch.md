Directly manipulating model parameters in PyTorch requires a nuanced understanding of how the framework handles tensors and automatic differentiation.  My experience optimizing large-scale language models for low-resource deployments has highlighted the importance of precise parameter control, particularly when fine-tuning pre-trained weights or implementing custom training strategies.  This isn't simply about assigning values; it's about managing gradients and ensuring compatibility with the model's architecture and training loop.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch models store their parameters as tensors within their state dictionaries.  These state dictionaries are Python dictionaries where keys represent parameter names (e.g., 'layer1.weight', 'layer2.bias') and values are the corresponding parameter tensors.  Manually setting parameters involves accessing these tensors via the state dictionary, modifying their values, and potentially updating the model's internal state.  Crucially, the method of modification depends on whether you intend to affect the gradient calculation.  If you directly assign new values, PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanisms may not be properly informed, potentially leading to incorrect gradient updates.  Therefore, the preferred approach involves using the `data` attribute of the tensor to change the underlying values without disrupting the gradient tracking.  In cases where you need to completely decouple from gradient computations (e.g., loading pre-trained weights which shouldn't be updated during training),  `requires_grad=False` should be applied.  Furthermore,  ensure your input data is compatible with the parameter's shape and data type; otherwise, you'll encounter runtime errors.  Finally, remember that modifications made directly to the model's state dictionary might not be immediately reflected in the model's forward pass unless the model is explicitly told to recompute its internal buffers or layers are recreated.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Modifying a single parameter's value.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)

# Access the weight parameter and modify its data directly
with torch.no_grad(): # Prevents gradient tracking for this operation
    model.weight.data[:] = torch.rand_like(model.weight)

# Verify the change
print("Modified weight:\n", model.weight)
```

This example demonstrates how to directly change the weight tensor of a linear layer.  The `with torch.no_grad():` context manager is crucial here; it ensures the operation doesn't affect gradient calculations.  `torch.rand_like(model.weight)` creates a tensor of the same size and type as the original weight tensor, filled with random values.  Using slicing (`[:]`) ensures all elements of the tensor are replaced.


**Example 2:  Setting parameters from a pre-trained model.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume 'pretrained_model' is a loaded model with parameters you want to use
pretrained_model = nn.Linear(10, 2) # Replace with your loaded model
# Define the target model - it should have the same architecture
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)

# Copy weights
with torch.no_grad():
    model.weight.copy_(pretrained_model.weight)
    model.bias.copy_(pretrained_model.bias)

# Verify that only weight and bias were updated.
# For more complex models, you'd loop through the state_dict.
print("Target Model weights:\n", model.weight)
print("Target Model bias:\n", model.bias)
```

Here, we leverage `copy_()` to efficiently transfer parameters from a pre-trained model (`pretrained_model`) to a new model (`model`). The `copy_()` method performs in-place copying, which is more memory-efficient than creating a new tensor. This approach is particularly useful when fine-tuning pre-trained models or transferring knowledge between different architectures.  It is imperative that the target model's architecture aligns with the source model for compatible parameter shapes.


**Example 3:  Setting specific elements of a parameter tensor.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a convolutional layer
model = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)

# Access and modify specific elements of the weight tensor
with torch.no_grad():
    model.weight.data[0, 0, 0, 0] = 1.0  # Set a single element
    model.weight.data[:, :, 1:2, 1:2] = 0.5 # Set a slice of the tensor

#Verify the changes - Note that indexing depends on the tensor dimensions
print("Modified weight:\n", model.weight)
```

This example shows how you can modify individual elements or slices within a parameter tensor.  Understanding the tensor's dimensions is crucial for correct indexing. In this case, we're working with a convolutional layer's weight tensor, which has four dimensions (output channels, input channels, kernel height, kernel width).  Precise indexing allows for granular control over specific parts of the model's parameters, useful for targeted experimentation or debugging.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  Advanced PyTorch tutorials focusing on model customization and optimization techniques.  Research papers on transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies in deep learning.  A good linear algebra textbook focusing on tensor operations and matrix calculus.


My experience building and optimizing numerous neural networks, including those for natural language processing and computer vision, has taught me the importance of this level of control.  Misunderstanding these nuances can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect training results, and difficult-to-debug errors.  Always ensure your modifications align with the model architecture and gradient tracking mechanisms.  The examples provided showcase common scenarios; adapt these strategies for your specific use case, paying attention to the shape and type constraints imposed by your model.
