TensorFlow's ability to detect a GPU while Keras, its high-level API, fails to do so stems from a mismatch in the underlying configurations or environment variables.  In my experience troubleshooting numerous deep learning deployments across varied hardware setups, this issue frequently arises from inconsistencies in how the TensorFlow runtime interacts with the CUDA toolkit and the associated NVIDIA driver.  The problem often isn't a true lack of GPU detection, but rather a failure to properly utilize it within the Keras workflow.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the layered architecture of TensorFlow and Keras. TensorFlow provides the low-level operations, including GPU support through CUDA. Keras, a more user-friendly API built atop TensorFlow, relies on TensorFlow's backend to access hardware acceleration.  If TensorFlow successfully detects the GPU, it means the CUDA drivers and the necessary libraries (cuDNN, for example) are installed and correctly configured at the TensorFlow level. However, if Keras fails to utilize the GPU, the problem lies in how Keras is configured to interact with this TensorFlow backend. This disconnect frequently manifests as Keras defaulting to CPU computation even when a suitable GPU is available.

Several factors can contribute to this disconnect:

* **Incorrect TensorFlow installation:** An incomplete or corrupted installation of TensorFlow might fail to properly register the GPU within its backend. This can arise from using incompatible versions of CUDA, cuDNN, or the NVIDIA driver. The version compatibility must be meticulously checked;  in one project, an outdated cuDNN library caused exactly this issue.

* **Missing or misconfigured environment variables:**  Variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` dictate which GPUs TensorFlow utilizes. If these are improperly set or missing, TensorFlow might detect the GPU but Keras won't inherit the appropriate configuration.

* **Inconsistent Python environments:** Using different Python environments for TensorFlow and Keras can lead to conflicts. The libraries and configurations within each environment must be consistent to ensure seamless communication.  I once encountered this when developing a project using virtual environments; a careless mistake in environment activation led to this precise problem.

* **Conflicting Keras backends:** While TensorFlow is a common backend for Keras, others exist. Ensure that the TensorFlow backend is explicitly specified in Keras, eliminating ambiguity.  A simple mistake in specifying a different backend can lead to the confusion observed.

* **Outdated Keras version:**  Older Keras versions might lack the necessary support for the current TensorFlow version and its GPU capabilities.  Keeping all components updated is crucial for avoiding such conflicts.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying TensorFlow GPU Detection:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    print("TensorFlow detected GPUs.")
    for gpu in tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
        print(f"GPU Name: {gpu.name}")
else:
    print("TensorFlow did not detect any GPUs.")
```

This code snippet directly interrogates TensorFlow to list available GPUs. Its output clearly indicates whether TensorFlow is aware of the GPU hardware. A successful detection at this stage isolates the problem to the Keras configuration.


**Example 2: Explicitly Setting the Keras Backend:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Explicitly sets TensorFlow as the backend, avoiding ambiguity
keras.backend.set_image_data_format('channels_last')  # Preferred format for image processing
print(f"Keras backend: {keras.backend.backend()}")

# Verify GPU usage during model compilation
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
print(f"Model uses GPU: {tf.test.is_built_with_cuda()}")
```

This example demonstrates setting the backend explicitly to TensorFlow and verifying whether Keras is using a CUDA-enabled backend after model compilation. The explicit declaration helps avoid inconsistencies.


**Example 3: Using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`:**

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Set environment variable to specify which GPU to use (if multiple are present)
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'  # Use GPU 0; adjust index if needed

# Construct and compile the model
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Check the device assigned to the model (optional)
print("Devices used by the model:")
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Access GPU0 explicitly. Adjust index if necessary.
    x = tf.constant([[1.0]])
    y = tf.constant([[2.0]])
    print(tf.config.experimental_list_physical_devices('GPU'))
```

This code snippet addresses potential issues with multiple GPUs by explicitly selecting a specific GPU using the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. It also attempts to access the device assigned to the model. This is crucial for multi-GPU systems to prevent conflicts.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation for detailed information on GPU support and CUDA configuration. Refer to the Keras documentation for best practices on backend management and model compilation. Investigate the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit documentation for installing and verifying correct CUDA driver versions.  Review the cuDNN library documentation for compatibility with your TensorFlow and CUDA versions.  Finally, examining the official Python documentation regarding environment variable management can prove beneficial.  Thorough examination of these resources will resolve most conflicts involving GPU utilization in TensorFlow and Keras.
