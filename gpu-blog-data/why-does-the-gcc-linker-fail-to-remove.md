The GCC linker's inability to remove unused functions, even without template instantiation, stems primarily from its reliance on a combination of weak symbols and the complexities of function inlining and interprocedural optimization (IPO).  My experience debugging embedded systems, particularly those written in C with large, modular codebases, has consistently highlighted this limitation. The linker's decision-making process is not solely determined by whether a function's address is referenced within the final executable; rather, it involves a more nuanced evaluation of symbol visibility and potential runtime dependencies.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Unlike many modern linkers that employ aggressive dead code elimination techniques based solely on control-flow analysis, GCC's approach is more conservative, particularly in scenarios involving function pointers, callbacks, and dynamic linking.  While GCC's linker performs symbol resolution and removes truly unused symbols,  it often hesitates to remove functions that might be indirectly called via mechanisms not immediately apparent during the linking stage.  This conservative behavior is partially a result of its design philosophy prioritizing correctness over aggressive optimization in the face of ambiguity.  A seemingly unused function might still be needed if it's called indirectly through a function pointer, a dynamic library loading, or even if the compiler's inlining optimization fails to fully propagate the unused status throughout the code.  In essence, the linker operates within the limitations of the information provided by the compiler's intermediate representation and may err on the side of inclusion to avoid potential runtime failures.

Furthermore, the weak symbol mechanism itself introduces a layer of complexity.  Weak symbols allow multiple definitions of the same function to coexist, with the linker resolving the conflict by selecting one preferentially. Even if the primary definition remains unused, the linker might refrain from removing the weakly defined alternatives due to the uncertainty surrounding potential alternative linkage paths at runtime.  Without detailed knowledge of the runtime environment, the linker's cautious approach prevents accidental removal of necessary functions.

This behavior contrasts sharply with linkers that perform more advanced interprocedural optimization (IPO).  IPO techniques allow the linker to analyze the entire program's control flow, identifying and removing unused functions regardless of the complexities involved in indirect function calls. However, GCC's IPO capability, while powerful, is not fully effective in all scenarios and still relies on limitations in determining true function usage.   Moreover, enabling IPO is often an explicit step that users must take in compilation, and its activation does not guarantee complete dead code elimination.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Function Pointer Ambiguity**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef void (*func_ptr)(void);

void unused_function(void) {
    printf("This function is potentially unused.\n");
}

void main_function(func_ptr fp) {
    // This function pointer could potentially be assigned unused_function.
    if(fp != NULL) fp(); 
}

int main() {
    main_function(NULL); // No call to unused_function, but linker hesitates to remove it.
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `unused_function` appears unused, but the linker remains cautious due to the presence of `func_ptr`.  The linker cannot definitively determine if `unused_function`'s address will be assigned to `fp` at runtime, thus preventing its removal.

**Example 2: Weak Symbols and Conditional Compilation**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DEBUG
__attribute__((weak)) void debug_function(void) {
    printf("Debug function called.\n");
}
#endif

void main_function(void) {
    // No direct call to debug_function
}

int main() {
    main_function();
    return 0;
}
```

Compiling this code with `-DDEBUG` will create a weakly defined `debug_function`. Even if it isn't directly called, the linker may retain it because of the weak symbol attribute.  It might be used by another part of the system not included in this snippet, or it might be called from a dynamically linked library.  Removing it would be potentially dangerous.

**Example 3:  Inlining Failure and Optimization Levels**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void inline_candidate(int a) {
    if (a > 10)
        printf("Value exceeds 10\n");
}

int main() {
    inline_candidate(5); // The compiler might fail to inline this function
    return 0;
}
```

While `inline_candidate` might seem unused, if the compiler's inlining optimization fails (e.g., due to function complexity or compiler limitations), the linker will retain it because it is still potentially executable. The effectiveness of inlining itself depends heavily on the compiler's optimization level (-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3). Lower optimization levels are less likely to inline functions, leading to the linker retaining seemingly unused functions.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the GCC manual, particularly the sections dealing with linker options, symbol visibility, and interprocedural optimization.  Furthermore, studying materials on compiler design and optimization techniques will offer a deeper understanding of the underlying processes involved in code generation and linking.  A thorough exploration of the standard documentation for your specific target architecture's Application Binary Interface (ABI) will shed light on how linking and symbol resolution operate within that environment. Finally, examining the output of the linker itself, using appropriate debugging flags, can provide invaluable insight into the specifics of the linker's decisions.
