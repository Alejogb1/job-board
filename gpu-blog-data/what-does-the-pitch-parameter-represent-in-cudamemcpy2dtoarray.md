The `pitch` parameter in CUDA's `cudaMemcpy2DToArray` and `cudaMemcpy2DFromArray` functions defines the byte width of each row in the source or destination memory region, respectively, regardless of the actual data elements per row. This seemingly straightforward concept often trips up developers new to CUDA, leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior, specifically when dealing with subregions of larger 2D arrays in device or host memory.

Having spent several years developing high-performance computing applications using CUDA, I've repeatedly encountered scenarios where a misunderstanding of `pitch` resulted in subtle, hard-to-debug errors. These functions facilitate efficient copying of 2D data blocks between host and device memory and vice versa. Unlike a standard C-style array representation, where elements are packed contiguously, CUDA memory often features padding between rows. The `pitch` explicitly dictates this row stride.

Let's delve into a more detailed explanation. When working with 2D arrays on the GPU, memory allocation is often aligned to optimize memory access patterns for the architecture. This alignment results in rows not necessarily being packed together in consecutive memory locations, particularly with textures and surf arrays. The distance, measured in bytes, between the starting address of one row and the starting address of the following row is the `pitch`. Think of `pitch` as the actual allocated memory for each row, which may or may not align exactly with the width of the data being copied. The width parameter in these functions, by contrast, specifies the number of bytes per row to copy.

Therefore, failing to account for the `pitch` will result in incorrect memory reads or writes. If you specify the data width of the source data as the `pitch`, and the actual memory allocation has added padding for alignment, the copied data will not be a proper representation of your source. You may end up copying partial rows or, worse, reading data from beyond the allocated buffer.

Consider the use case of transferring a subregion of a larger 2D matrix stored in host memory to a CUDA array. Imagine your matrix is a 100x100 array of single-precision floating point numbers, but you only need to transfer a 50x50 block into a CUDA texture. The memory layout of the 100x100 host array is likely contiguous, so each row is 100 * sizeof(float) (400 bytes). However, the CUDA texture, when allocated, might have a different pitch, perhaps due to hardware alignment constraints. Even though we're copying only 50 elements per row, we need to use the correct `pitch` corresponding to that 100-element width from the host's source array. Failure to do so will result in incorrect row selection in the host memory leading to corrupted copied data in the CUDA texture.

The core function signatures are as follows:

```c++
cudaError_t cudaMemcpy2DToArray(cudaArray_t dst, size_t wOffset, size_t hOffset, const void* src, size_t spitch, size_t width, size_t height, cudaMemcpyKind kind);
cudaError_t cudaMemcpy2DFromArray(void* dst, size_t dpitch, cudaArray_const_t src, size_t wOffset, size_t hOffset, size_t width, size_t height, cudaMemcpyKind kind);
```

In `cudaMemcpy2DToArray`, `spitch` is the pitch (in bytes) of the source data (`src`). In `cudaMemcpy2DFromArray`, `dpitch` is the pitch (in bytes) of the destination data (`dst`). In both functions, `width` is the width of the data region being copied (again, in bytes), and `height` specifies the number of rows to copy.

Here are three practical code examples that illustrate usage and potential pitfalls, each accompanied by commentary:

**Example 1: Host-to-Device Copy with Matching Pitch**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    const int width = 100;
    const int height = 100;
    const size_t pitch = width * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate host memory
    std::vector<float> host_data(width * height);
    for (int i = 0; i < width * height; ++i) {
        host_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    }

    // Allocate a CUDA array
    cudaArray* device_array;
    cudaChannelFormatDesc channelDesc = cudaCreateChannelDesc(32, 0, 0, 0, cudaChannelFormatKindFloat);
    cudaExtent extent = make_cudaExtent(width, height, 0);
    cudaMallocArray(&device_array, &channelDesc, extent);

    // Copy from host to device, correctly specifying pitch
    cudaMemcpy2DToArray(device_array, 0, 0, host_data.data(), pitch, width * sizeof(float), height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    //Cleanup
    cudaFreeArray(device_array);

    return 0;
}
```
*Commentary*: This example demonstrates a simple host-to-device transfer where the host array's row size matches the width of the data to be copied. The `pitch` used in `cudaMemcpy2DToArray` directly reflects the total size in bytes of a row in the host data and is also the width in bytes of the copy data. This highlights that matching `pitch` and copy width can work, but that is not the general case.

**Example 2: Host-to-Device Copy with Misaligned Pitch (Error)**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    const int width = 100;
    const int height = 100;

    // Allocate host memory
    std::vector<float> host_data(width * height);
    for (int i = 0; i < width * height; ++i) {
        host_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    }
    const size_t incorrect_pitch = (width - 20) * sizeof(float); // Intentional pitch error

     // Allocate a CUDA array
    cudaArray* device_array;
    cudaChannelFormatDesc channelDesc = cudaCreateChannelDesc(32, 0, 0, 0, cudaChannelFormatKindFloat);
    cudaExtent extent = make_cudaExtent(width, height, 0);
    cudaMallocArray(&device_array, &channelDesc, extent);

    // Copy from host to device, incorrectly specifying pitch
    cudaMemcpy2DToArray(device_array, 0, 0, host_data.data(), incorrect_pitch, width * sizeof(float), height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    //Cleanup
    cudaFreeArray(device_array);

    return 0;
}
```
*Commentary*: Here, the `incorrect_pitch` variable is deliberately set to a smaller value than the actual row size in the host data, creating an out-of-bounds access. This will lead to an error where `cudaMemcpy2DToArray` copies data incorrectly across rows. The debugger will not always catch this issue but the result will not be what is expected. This example demonstrates the catastrophic effect that improper usage of `pitch` will have. The copy is not only wrong but undefined in its result.

**Example 3: Device-to-Host Copy with Different Host Pitch**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    const int width = 100;
    const int height = 100;

    // Allocate a CUDA array
    cudaArray* device_array;
    cudaChannelFormatDesc channelDesc = cudaCreateChannelDesc(32, 0, 0, 0, cudaChannelFormatKindFloat);
    cudaExtent extent = make_cudaExtent(width, height, 0);
    cudaMallocArray(&device_array, &channelDesc, extent);

    // Simulate filling the array on the device 
    std::vector<float> temp_device_data(width*height);
    for (int i = 0; i < width * height; ++i) {
        temp_device_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    }
    cudaMemcpy2DToArray(device_array, 0, 0, temp_device_data.data(), width * sizeof(float), width * sizeof(float), height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

     // Allocate host memory with different pitch
    const int host_width = 120; 
    const size_t host_pitch = host_width * sizeof(float); 
    std::vector<float> host_data(host_width * height);

    // Copy from device to host, specifying correct *destination* pitch
    cudaMemcpy2DFromArray(host_data.data(), host_pitch, device_array, 0, 0, width * sizeof(float), height, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    //Cleanup
    cudaFreeArray(device_array);

    return 0;
}
```
*Commentary*: In this example, the device array has dimensions of `width` x `height`. We copy data into a host array that has a larger width and thus a different `host_pitch`. The critical part here is that the `dpitch` parameter of `cudaMemcpy2DFromArray` correctly matches the layout of the destination host array. If `host_pitch` is specified incorrectly, data copied into the host buffer would be incorrect because each row would be displaced in memory by some factor other than the correct one.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I recommend the CUDA C Programming Guide, which details all functions, and specifically sections on 2D memory copies. The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation also offers excellent function reference material. Also consider reviewing examples of image processing using CUDA since image data is frequently formatted using a pitch. These resources provide comprehensive information about CUDA APIs and their parameters, including the nuances of memory allocation and transfer operations. Studying these resources alongside practical exercises is the most effective way to fully grasp the critical role of the `pitch` parameter in CUDA.
