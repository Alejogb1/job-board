Accessing optimizer parameters within a custom PyTorch optimizer requires a deep understanding of the framework's internal structure, specifically how parameter groups are managed and updated during the optimization process. Unlike a simple linear regression where parameters can be globally accessed, PyTorch leverages a more nuanced approach, organizing parameters into groups that can have distinct learning rates or other optimization attributes. My experience building specialized optimization algorithms, particularly those involving dynamic weight decay, has underscored the criticality of correctly extracting and manipulating these parameters.

The core mechanism for accessing and modifying parameters resides within the `optimizer.param_groups` attribute. This is a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a group of parameters. Within each group dictionary, the `'params'` key maps to a list containing the actual parameter tensors that are being optimized. I've found it helpful to think of this structure as a tree, where the `optimizer` is the root, `param_groups` is a list of branches, and each `'params'` list holds the leaves – the actual tensors we modify.

When creating a custom optimizer, the parameters must be properly registered and grouped. Failing to do this correctly can lead to unexpected behavior, such as parameters not being updated, or applying optimization steps to the wrong tensors. This means understanding the initialization of the base optimizer class (`torch.optim.Optimizer`) in your custom optimizer. Here's the general skeleton:

```python
import torch
from torch.optim import Optimizer

class CustomOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, other_param=0.5):
        defaults = dict(lr=lr, other_param=other_param)
        super().__init__(params, defaults)

    def step(self, closure=None):
        loss = None
        if closure is not None:
            with torch.enable_grad():
                loss = closure()

        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                if p.grad is None:
                    continue
                d_p = p.grad
                p.data.add_(d_p, alpha=-group['lr']) # Simple gradient descent update here

        return loss
```

This example illustrates the minimal requirements for a custom optimizer. It inherits from `torch.optim.Optimizer`, passes parameter groups and defaults to the base class, and then iterates through the `param_groups` during the `step()` method to apply updates. Crucially, the learning rate is retrieved from each `group` dictionary, allowing different parameter groups to potentially use unique learning rates during optimization.

However, more complex scenarios often arise. For example, if you'd like to implement per-parameter momentum, you'll need to store these per-parameter states within the optimizer's state dictionary and then access them through the param_groups. Consider this code excerpt, enhancing our example with momentum functionality:

```python
class MomentumOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9):
        defaults = dict(lr=lr, momentum=momentum)
        super().__init__(params, defaults)

    def step(self, closure=None):
        loss = None
        if closure is not None:
            with torch.enable_grad():
                loss = closure()

        for group in self.param_groups:
           for p in group['params']:
                if p.grad is None:
                   continue
                grad = p.grad
                state = self.state[p] # Accessing per-parameter state
                if 'momentum_buffer' not in state:
                    momentum_buffer = torch.zeros_like(p.data)
                    state['momentum_buffer'] = momentum_buffer
                else:
                    momentum_buffer = state['momentum_buffer']

                momentum_buffer.mul_(group['momentum']).add_(grad)
                p.data.add_(momentum_buffer, alpha=-group['lr'])

        return loss
```

Here, `self.state[p]` is used to retrieve (or initialize) a per-parameter dictionary that stores the momentum buffer. The `self.state` attribute is a dictionary maintained by the base `Optimizer` class to retain any necessary information from one optimization step to the next. If the parameter's entry is missing, it will be initialized when it's first accessed. This mechanism avoids modifying parameters directly while still providing access to per-parameter state. I've used this approach extensively when implementing algorithms that required adaptive gradient computation or parameter normalization, finding it crucial for the proper execution.

Now, let's consider accessing parameters *outside* the step method. Suppose we want to apply weight decay not directly on the gradient, but on the actual parameter value. We cannot do this directly within the `step()` method, as gradients have already been calculated. This must be done after the gradient computation, but before the step itself. Let’s add this to our simple optimizer example. Note, we don’t make this part of the `step` function.

```python
class L2DecayOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-5):
        defaults = dict(lr=lr, weight_decay=weight_decay)
        super().__init__(params, defaults)

    def apply_weight_decay(self):
        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                 if p.grad is None:
                    continue # Skip if no gradients
                 p.data.mul_(1 - group['lr'] * group['weight_decay'])


    def step(self, closure=None):
        loss = None
        if closure is not None:
            with torch.enable_grad():
                loss = closure()

        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                if p.grad is None:
                   continue
                d_p = p.grad
                p.data.add_(d_p, alpha=-group['lr'])

        return loss

```

Here, `apply_weight_decay` illustrates how parameters are accessed and modified after gradients have been computed but before the update has been applied. This function would be called before `step`. This is important because, as in this example, we are modifying `p.data` directly based on the *value* of `p.data` as opposed to the gradient. You should not modify parameters outside the `step` method or similar functions unless you have a clear purpose for doing so, because it may interfere with gradient calculations. I’ve found that functions like `apply_weight_decay` or those performing periodic parameter normalization, when applied correctly, can be invaluable for improving the stability and performance of trained models.

For a deeper understanding, consult the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.optim`, paying particular attention to the description of `Optimizer` class and its `param_groups` attribute. Exploring the source code of existing optimizers, such as `torch.optim.SGD` or `torch.optim.Adam`, will reveal even more advanced techniques for managing optimizer states and parameter groups. Additionally, the "Deep Learning with PyTorch" book published by Manning can provide a valuable structured approach to understanding the intricacies of the framework. I’ve frequently referred to these resources to reinforce and extend my understanding of PyTorch’s internals, and suggest the same approach.
