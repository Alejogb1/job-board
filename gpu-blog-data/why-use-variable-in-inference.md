The core reason for utilizing `Variable()` during inference, particularly within deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, stems from the necessity of maintaining a consistent computational graph, even when we are not actively training. My experience building image recognition models exposed how crucial this aspect is for accurate, reproducible predictions. While seemingly straightforward, omitting it can lead to subtle but critical inconsistencies in model behavior during deployment.

In the context of deep learning, models are represented internally as directed acyclic graphs, often called computational graphs. These graphs detail the sequence of operations performed on input data to arrive at an output. During training, backpropagation relies on tracing this graph to calculate gradients – derivatives that inform how model weights should be updated. PyTorch, for instance, automatically constructs this graph during forward passes when tensors are wrapped in `Variable()` (or, more accurately, when `requires_grad` is set to true). This enables efficient backpropagation by maintaining a record of each operation.

However, the crucial point is that this computational graph is not just for training. During inference, or making predictions with a trained model, we still need this graph, even though we don't need gradients. This might seem counterintuitive. Why keep this graph when we are not updating weights? The answer lies in the operations themselves within the model. Operations like batch normalization, dropout, and specific activation functions can behave differently during training than during inference. These layers have learned parameters (or lack thereof) during training.

For example, batch normalization calculates mean and variance within a training batch and normalizes based on that information. During inference, however, it often needs to apply the running statistics (moving average of mean and variance) computed during training to ensure consistency. Similarly, dropout layers randomly “drop” neurons during training to reduce overfitting. These need to be completely disabled during inference. These modes of operation are typically stored within the network state, and their activation relies on `train` mode or `eval` mode.

When using `Variable()` (or setting `requires_grad=True`), the framework’s internal mechanics keep the computational graph intact during forward passes, implicitly invoking `train` or `eval` modes. When `requires_grad=False` (which effectively emulates the behavior of explicitly calling `.detach()` on a tensor during inference), you signal to the framework to disable graph tracking and gradient calculation, but you are also now solely responsible to explicitly use `model.eval()` to switch batch normalization or dropout layers to inference mode. Omitting the `Variable()` functionality when it is meant for `requires_grad` can result in incorrectly used statistics.

Here are three examples illustrating how this impacts the code:

**Example 1: Basic Inference Without `Variable()`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model with batch normalization
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
model.eval() # Setting for inference mode, without graph tracking
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Incorrect inference (batchnorm uses batch statistics instead of moving average, since there is no 'requires_grad')
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print("Output with inference mode:", output_tensor)


model.train()
output_tensor_train = model(input_tensor)
print("Output with train mode:", output_tensor_train)

```

Here, we've created a simple model with a batch normalization layer, we explicitly use `model.eval()` before the inference step. Since the input tensor was created without requires\_grad set to true, no computational graph is constructed, and the `eval` call to the model directly switches batchnorm to inference mode and dropout layers off if they exist in the model. Note how the `output_tensor` and `output_tensor_train` have different outputs because `model.train()` has been set. This example demonstrates how, if you do not require gradients, `model.eval()` is required.

**Example 2: Explicitly Using .detach() Emulating `requires_grad = False` and `model.eval()`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model with batch normalization
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
model.eval() # Setting for inference mode

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Correct inference (batchnorm uses moving average as required) using detach to prevent graph build-up
output_tensor_detach = model(input_tensor.detach())
print("Output with detached tensor and evaluation:", output_tensor_detach)

model.train()
output_tensor_train = model(input_tensor)
print("Output with train mode:", output_tensor_train)


```

In this example, we specifically call `.detach()` on our tensor before using it as input to the model. Again, this does not construct a computational graph and, in combination with the `model.eval()` call, ensures that batch normalization uses moving averages. Observe that `output_tensor_detach` has the same output behavior when input tensors are created with requires\_grad as false, and `model.eval` is called before any operation. This emulates the expected behavior when `requires_grad=False` or `.detach()` are used.

**Example 3: Incorrectly Using Requires_grad=True Without setting eval() and its resulting output**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model with batch normalization
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10, requires_grad=True)

# INCORRECT inference (batchnorm uses batch statistics instead of moving average)
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print("Output with requires_grad, no eval() call:", output_tensor)


model.eval() # Setting for inference mode
output_tensor_eval = model(input_tensor)
print("Output with requires_grad, after eval() call:", output_tensor_eval)


```

This example shows what happens if you create your input tensors with `requires_grad=True` (as with older versions of PyTorch when `Variable()` was used). If you intend for inference, you *must* call `model.eval()` before your inference, or you will get erroneous output. In this example, the first output of the model uses batch statistics, and the second, after `model.eval()`, uses the saved moving averages. This shows that `requires_grad=True` requires `model.eval()` for a proper inference pass.

In summary, while older versions of PyTorch relied on `Variable()` to encapsulate input tensors and enforce `requires_grad` for graph creation and, as an unintended side effect, ensuring correct inference operations, newer versions of PyTorch enable graph construction with a simple `requires_grad=True` parameter when creating the tensor, or `.detach()` on the tensor before forward passes if one does not need gradients. The need to explicitly invoke `model.eval()` during inference is a design choice to enforce a clear separation of training and inference modes. Doing so ensures consistent and predictable model behavior in deployed environments, even if you intend not to use backpropagation at all. This is essential for building robust applications that leverage the power of deep learning.

For further exploration, I would recommend looking at the official documentation of your preferred deep learning framework, specifically the sections on tensor creation, `requires_grad`, automatic differentiation, and evaluation mode. Several comprehensive deep learning books also delve into these concepts with practical examples. Online courses focused on specific frameworks also provide valuable hands-on experience and a deeper theoretical understanding. Exploring repositories that contain trained models (specifically how they handle inference) is another way to better understand this essential concept.
