The core challenge in obtaining the gradient of Keras outputs with respect to inputs lies in leveraging TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities within the Keras functional API or subclassing paradigm.  Directly accessing gradients isn't inherently built into Keras' higher-level abstractions;  it requires a deeper dive into the underlying TensorFlow graph.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects necessitates this understanding, particularly when implementing custom loss functions or performing sensitivity analysis.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Keras, built upon TensorFlow (or other backends), doesn't directly expose gradients in a readily accessible manner for arbitrary model outputs. We circumvent this by utilizing TensorFlow's `GradientTape` context manager.  This context manager records operations performed within its scope, enabling subsequent gradient computation with respect to specified tensors. The process involves:

* **Defining the input tensor:** This represents the input data to your Keras model.
* **Creating a `tf.GradientTape` instance:**  This initiates the recording process.
* **Forward pass through the Keras model:**  The model executes, and the tape records all operations.
* **Specifying the output tensor(s) and input tensor(s):**  This dictates which gradients we are computing.
* **Computing gradients using `gradient_tape.gradient()`:** This method calculates the gradients of the output tensor(s) with respect to the input tensor(s).
* **Handling potential `None` gradients:** In some scenarios, particularly with discontinuous functions or disconnected computations, gradients might be `None`. Robust code anticipates this.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Dense Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.layers as kl

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([kl.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(10,))])

# Define input tensor
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

# Record operations
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x) # crucial for tracking gradients with respect to x
    y = model(x)

# Compute gradients
grads = tape.gradient(y, x)

print(f"Gradients: {grads}")
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental process. We explicitly watch the input `x` using `tape.watch()`, essential for calculating gradients with respect to this tensor. The `tape.gradient()` call efficiently computes the gradients of the output `y` concerning the input `x`. The result `grads` will be a tensor representing the gradient.

**Example 2: Multi-Output Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.layers as kl
import numpy as np

# Multi-output model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = kl.Dense(5)(inputs)
output1 = kl.Dense(2)(dense1)
output2 = kl.Dense(3)(dense1)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[output1, output2])

# Inputs
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)
    y1, y2 = model(x)

# Gradients for both outputs (Jacobian)
grads = tape.gradient([y1, y2], x)

print(f"Gradients for output 1 and 2: {grads}")
```

Here, we deal with a more complex scenario: a model with multiple outputs.  The `tape.gradient()` method is extended to accept multiple output tensors, effectively computing the Jacobian matrix (gradients of all outputs with respect to all inputs). The result is a list or tuple of gradients corresponding to the order of the output tensors provided. The usage of numpy arrays could influence gradient calculations, requiring specific attention in certain scenarios (e.g., gradient calculations for categorical cross-entropy).


**Example 3:  Custom Loss Function and Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.layers as kl

# Custom loss function (example)
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Model
model = keras.Sequential([kl.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)

# Input data and true values
x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
y_true = tf.random.normal((1, 1))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(model.trainable_variables)
    tape.watch(x)
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = custom_loss(y_true, y_pred)

# Compute gradients with gradient clipping
grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables + [x])
clipped_grads = [tf.clip_by_norm(grad, 1.0) for grad in grads] # Example clipping

print(f"Clipped Gradients for model variables and input: {clipped_grads}")

# Apply gradients (for optimization) - Demonstrational Purpose
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_grads, model.trainable_variables + [x])) # This needs careful consideration.
```

This illustrates the use of a custom loss function, often crucial for specialized tasks. The gradient clipping step, using `tf.clip_by_norm`, prevents exploding gradients, a common issue during training.  Note the careful handling of both model weights (`model.trainable_variables`) and input gradients.  The inclusion of the optimizer step is for demonstration; it's important to appropriately incorporate gradient application within an optimization loop.  Directly applying gradients to input tensors should be done cautiously; its applicability depends highly on the task.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections detailing `tf.GradientTape`, is paramount.  Thorough understanding of the TensorFlow graph execution model will prove beneficial.  Further, I recommend studying the source code of well-established deep learning libraries for insights into efficient gradient calculation strategies.  Finally, books dedicated to advanced topics in deep learning, focusing on the mathematical underpinnings of automatic differentiation, are invaluable.
