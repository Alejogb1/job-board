The core issue in PyTorch-to-ONNX-to-TensorFlow conversion lies not simply in format discrepancies, but in the inherent differences in how these frameworks represent and handle operations, especially concerning dynamic shapes and custom operators.  My experience porting large-scale NLP models highlights this frequently.  While ONNX acts as an intermediary, attempting to bridge these disparate ecosystems, its expressiveness can fall short, leading to incomplete or inaccurate translations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three distinct representation stages: PyTorch's internal representation, the ONNX intermediate representation, and TensorFlow's graph representation.  PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph, meaning the graph structure is defined during runtime based on input data shapes. ONNX aims to represent this in a static graph, which TensorFlow then interprets.  This translation process can encounter several problems:

* **Unsupported Operators:** PyTorch might utilize operators or functionalities not directly supported by ONNX's operator set.  In such cases, ONNX either approximates the functionality using a combination of supported operators (often leading to performance degradation), or fails outright, resulting in an incomplete ONNX model.  I've observed this particularly with custom layers containing intricate logic or relying on PyTorch's advanced autograd capabilities.

* **Shape Inference Issues:** ONNX's shape inference mechanism, responsible for determining tensor shapes at different points in the graph, may struggle with dynamic shapes prevalent in PyTorch models.  PyTorch often infers shapes during execution, making it difficult for ONNX to provide complete shape information in the static graph. This leads to errors during TensorFlow import, typically manifesting as shape mismatches during execution.

* **Data Type Discrepancies:** Although less common, subtle differences in data type handling can exist.  While both frameworks support common types like float32 and int64, nuanced variations in precision or internal representation might result in numerical inconsistencies after conversion.

* **Control Flow:**  Complex control flow within the PyTorch model, utilizing loops or conditional statements, can be challenging to map accurately to ONNX and then to TensorFlow. The translation might not perfectly mirror the original logic, potentially causing different outputs.

* **Quantization Differences:**  If the PyTorch model uses quantization for optimized inference, the conversion process may not perfectly preserve the quantization parameters, leading to accuracy losses.  TensorFlow's quantization approach might differ from PyTorch's, exacerbating the issue.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unsupported Operator**

```python
# PyTorch code using a custom operator (simplified example)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # Hypothetical custom operation not directly in ONNX
        return torch.special.entr(x)  

model = nn.Sequential(CustomLayer())
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx") # Export to ONNX
```

Attempting to convert this `torch.special.entr` (hypothetical, representing a complex operation) to ONNX might lead to an error or an approximation using elementary functions, significantly altering the outcome in TensorFlow.

**Example 2: Shape Inference Failure**

```python
# PyTorch code with dynamic input shape
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx

class DynamicShapeModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.mean(x, dim=1)

model = DynamicShapeModel()
dynamic_input = torch.randn(10, 20) # Shape not explicitly defined during export
torch.onnx.export(model, dynamic_input, "dynamic_model.onnx",
                  dynamic_axes={'input': {0: 'batch_size'}}) # Attempt to specify dynamic axis.

#Import into tensorflow
import onnx
import onnxruntime as rt
onnx_model = onnx.load("dynamic_model.onnx")
ort_session = rt.InferenceSession(onnx_model.SerializeToString())

#Failure likely if this shape is different from training data.
new_input = torch.randn(5,20)
ort_session.run(None,{ort_session.get_inputs()[0].name: new_input.numpy()})

```

Here, defining dynamic axes during export helps, but might still fail if TensorFlow cannot properly infer shapes during graph construction based on provided dynamic axis information. A mismatch between shapes during execution will likely result in an error.


**Example 3: Control Flow Complications**

```python
# PyTorch with conditional logic (simplified)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConditionalModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        if x.mean() > 0:
            return x * 2
        else:
            return x + 1

model = ConditionalModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(10)
torch.onnx.export(model, input_tensor, "conditional_model.onnx")
```

ONNX might represent this conditional logic using `If` nodes, but subtle differences in how TensorFlow handles these nodes compared to PyTorch's dynamic graph execution could lead to different results.   Thorough testing with diverse inputs is critical here.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The ONNX documentation,  the official PyTorch and TensorFlow documentation pertaining to model export and import, and relevant research papers on neural network model conversion are vital resources.  Consult any available tutorials on using the ONNX Runtime for model execution, paying close attention to best practices and troubleshooting techniques.  Understanding the limitations of ONNX as an intermediary format is particularly important.  Furthermore,  familiarity with debugging tools specific to both PyTorch and TensorFlow will prove invaluable for identifying issues during conversion and subsequent execution.  Finally,  a solid understanding of the underlying graph structures of neural networks is crucial for comprehension of the conversion process.
