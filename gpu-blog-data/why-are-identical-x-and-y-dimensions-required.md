The constraint of identical x and y dimensions in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for time series prediction isn't strictly a universal requirement, but rather a consequence of common architectural choices and data preprocessing techniques.  My experience working on high-frequency financial data forecasting highlighted this nuance.  While theoretically, CNNs can handle variable-length input sequences, practical implementations often necessitate this dimensional equality, primarily driven by the use of standard convolutional layers and pooling operations.  Let's examine this assertion in detail.

**1. Explanation: The Role of Convolutional Layers and Pooling**

Standard convolutional layers operate on a fixed-size input window. The kernel slides across the input, performing a convolution at each position.  This process inherently requires consistent input dimensions across all samples.  If the input time series have varying lengths, several complications arise.  Firstly, the convolutional operation itself becomes undefined for shorter sequences; the kernel simply wouldn't fit. Secondly, even with padding techniques, the output dimensions would vary across samples, hindering efficient batch processing and the use of subsequent layers.  Max pooling, commonly used in CNN architectures for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, further reinforces this constraint.  Pooling layers operate on fixed-size input regions, and their outputs also necessitate uniformity in input dimensions.

My past work involved predicting stock prices using intraday data.  We initially attempted to feed the data directly, which had variable lengths due to irregular trading hours and occasional data gaps.  This led to significant complications in implementing the CNN architecture and resulted in unstable training.  The solution we adopted involved a two-step process: data padding and resampling.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to handling variable-length time series data for CNN-based prediction.  These examples are simplified for clarity, and real-world applications would involve more sophisticated architectures and hyperparameter tuning.  Assume 'data' is a NumPy array where each row represents a time series.

**Example 1: Padding and Fixed-Length Input**

This approach pads shorter time series with zeros to match the length of the longest sequence.  It's a straightforward method but can introduce bias if the padding is not carefully considered.

```python
import numpy as np

def pad_sequences(data, max_len):
    padded_data = np.zeros((len(data), max_len))
    for i, seq in enumerate(data):
        padded_data[i, :len(seq)] = seq
    return padded_data

# Example usage:
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])
max_len = 4
padded_data = pad_sequences(data, max_len)
print(padded_data)
```

This function pads the input sequences with zeros to a consistent length. The output `padded_data` will have dimensions (number of sequences, max_length). The subsequent CNN layer must be designed to handle the max_length. This method is simple but can negatively impact model performance if the padding introduces significant noise.


**Example 2: Resampling and Fixed-Length Input**

This technique involves resampling the time series to a uniform length.  This could involve downsampling (reducing the sampling rate) or upsampling (increasing the sampling rate).  The choice depends on the nature of the data and the desired level of detail preservation.  For example, averaging values over intervals for downsampling or interpolation for upsampling.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

def resample_sequences(data, target_len):
    resampled_data = np.zeros((len(data), target_len))
    for i, seq in enumerate(data):
        x = np.arange(len(seq))
        y = seq
        f = interp1d(x, y, kind='linear')
        xnew = np.linspace(0, len(seq)-1, target_len)
        resampled_data[i, :] = f(xnew)
    return resampled_data


# Example usage
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])
target_len = 4
resampled_data = resample_sequences(data, target_len)
print(resampled_data)
```

This example utilizes linear interpolation for upsampling.  Other methods exist, and the optimal technique must be determined empirically. The choice of interpolation method is crucial; linear interpolation is simple but may not be suitable for all data.


**Example 3: 1D CNN with Variable Input Length (Advanced)**

More advanced techniques involve utilizing 1D CNNs designed to handle variable-length inputs. This generally involves techniques like dilated convolutions or employing recurrent components alongside the CNN architecture.  These methods are more complex to implement and may require a deeper understanding of CNN architecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a 1D CNN model with variable-length input using TensorFlow/Keras
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(None, 1)), # None handles variable length
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1) # Output layer for regression
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
# ... Training and prediction
```

This example demonstrates a simpler Keras model.  More sophisticated architectures incorporating techniques to better handle variable length input could involve the use of recurrent layers or attention mechanisms.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of time series analysis and CNN architectures, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on machine learning and deep learning.  Focus on sections covering convolutional neural networks, time series forecasting, and data preprocessing techniques.  Furthermore, review publications focusing on the application of CNNs to time series problems and explore different CNN architectures used in these contexts.  The documentation for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provides comprehensive resources on implementing and training these models.  Finally, understanding signal processing principles is beneficial for appropriate data preparation.
