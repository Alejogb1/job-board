GPUs, specifically their specialized computational power, are a cornerstone of many high-performance computing tasks. When a GPU unexpectedly becomes unavailable, whether due to driver issues, hardware failures, or resource contention in a multi-user environment, it initiates a cascade of problems, particularly in applications designed to leverage their parallel processing capabilities. This issue necessitates having a robust contingency plan, one which emphasizes graceful degradation and alternative execution paths.

The immediate reaction when encountering an unavailable GPU is to avoid a program crash. Applications, especially those involved in critical analysis or real-time processing, should not simply fail with an unhandled exception. The first step involves error handling, catching any exceptions raised during initialization of the GPU interaction. This means wrapping the calls to CUDA, OpenCL, or similar APIs within try-except blocks (or their equivalent in other languages). A well-implemented handler will log the error, providing crucial debugging information later, and also signal to other parts of the application that GPU-accelerated paths are not currently available.

The next crucial phase is to implement a CPU-based fallback. Many algorithms that run efficiently on GPUs can be adapted to execute on the CPU, although often with performance penalties. The logic of the program should therefore be structured such that it can selectively execute either the GPU implementation or the CPU implementation, depending on the state.  This often requires careful code design, where computational kernels are abstracted into functions or classes and a higher-level selector chooses the correct path based on the availability of the GPU.

The first implementation stage I encountered was during a project involving real-time video processing where I was performing object detection using a deep learning model. Initial GPU-based inference was failing sporadically due to driver issues on some machines. I employed a dual path, using OpenCVâ€™s deep learning module (dnn) with CUDA as the primary path, and a fall back to OpenCV with a plain CPU path when the CUDA initialization threw an error.

```python
import cv2
import time
import logging

def initialize_dnn_with_gpu(model_path, config_path, backend, target):
    try:
        net = cv2.dnn.readNet(model_path, config_path)
        net.setPreferableBackend(backend)
        net.setPreferableTarget(target)
        logging.info("DNN initialized with GPU.")
        return net
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"GPU initialization failed: {e}")
        return None

def initialize_dnn_with_cpu(model_path, config_path):
    net = cv2.dnn.readNet(model_path, config_path)
    logging.info("DNN initialized with CPU.")
    return net


def run_inference(frame, net):
    if net is None:
        logging.warning("DNN model is not initialized, skipping inference.")
        return None
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1 / 255.0, (416, 416), swapRB=True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    outputs = net.forward(net.getUnconnectedOutLayersNames())
    return outputs

#Example Usage
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
model_path = "yolov3.weights"
config_path = "yolov3.cfg"


gpu_net = initialize_dnn_with_gpu(model_path, config_path, cv2.dnn.DNN_BACKEND_CUDA, cv2.dnn.DNN_TARGET_CUDA)

if gpu_net is None:
  cpu_net = initialize_dnn_with_cpu(model_path, config_path)
else:
    cpu_net = None

#Inference loop
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
if not cap.isOpened():
    logging.error("Could not open camera.")
    exit()


while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    start_time = time.time()
    if gpu_net is not None:
        outputs = run_inference(frame, gpu_net)
    elif cpu_net is not None:
        outputs = run_inference(frame, cpu_net)
    else:
       logging.error("No inference net available")
       continue

    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    logging.info(f"Inference time: {elapsed_time:.4f} seconds.")

    # process the 'outputs' here

    cv2.imshow("Video", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break


cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this example, `initialize_dnn_with_gpu` attempts to initialize the deep learning network with CUDA. If an exception occurs, it logs the error and returns `None`. Then the execution flow checks to see if a GPU based net was initialised. If it wasn't then the CPU net is initialized instead. The `run_inference` function checks whether any of the nets have been successfully initialized and then skips if neither has. This ensures the program continues to function even without a GPU.

Furthermore, consider the case where the algorithm is inherently GPU-centric, such as large-scale scientific simulations using finite element analysis. Rewriting such code for the CPU may be impractical or lead to unacceptable performance degradation. Here a different approach is needed. Instead of immediately attempting an alternative calculation, the software can instead enter a 'reduced fidelity' mode. This may mean simulating a smaller subset of the problem, using a lower-resolution grid, or using a simplified mathematical model. The key here is to provide a functional (albeit potentially less precise) output rather than no output at all. In my work, dealing with fluid simulation, I implemented an automatic reduction of grid resolution, which kept the simulation running on the CPU in a manageable timeframe when the GPU was inaccessible.

```python
import numpy as np
import time
import logging

class FluidSimulator:

    def __init__(self, initial_density, grid_size, use_gpu=True):
        self.density = initial_density
        self.grid_size = grid_size
        self.use_gpu = use_gpu
        self.initialized = False
        self.allocate_grid()


    def allocate_grid(self):
      if self.use_gpu:
        try:
            import cupy as cp
            self.grid = cp.zeros(self.grid_size, dtype=np.float32)
            self.initialized = True
            logging.info("Grid allocated on GPU.")
        except Exception as e:
            self.use_gpu = False
            logging.error(f"GPU allocation failed: {e}, switching to CPU.")
            self.grid = np.zeros(self.grid_size, dtype=np.float32)
            self.initialized=True
            logging.info("Grid allocated on CPU.")
      else:
          self.grid = np.zeros(self.grid_size, dtype=np.float32)
          self.initialized=True
          logging.info("Grid allocated on CPU.")


    def simulate_step(self, time_step):

        if not self.initialized:
             logging.error("Simulation grid not initialized, can't continue")
             return

        if self.use_gpu:
           import cupy as cp
           self.grid += cp.random.rand(*self.grid_size, dtype=np.float32)*time_step
           cp.cuda.runtime.deviceSynchronize()
        else:
           self.grid += np.random.rand(*self.grid_size).astype(np.float32) * time_step


    def get_density_sum(self):
        if self.use_gpu:
            import cupy as cp
            return cp.sum(self.grid).get()

        return np.sum(self.grid)

# Example usage
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

initial_density = 1.0
grid_size = (512, 512, 100)

simulator_gpu = FluidSimulator(initial_density, grid_size, use_gpu = True)

for step in range(10):
  start_time = time.time()
  simulator_gpu.simulate_step(0.01)
  end_time = time.time()
  summed_density = simulator_gpu.get_density_sum()
  logging.info(f"Simulation step {step} time: {end_time - start_time:.4f}  Density sum:{summed_density}")

simulator_cpu = FluidSimulator(initial_density, (256, 256, 50), use_gpu=False)

for step in range(10):
  start_time = time.time()
  simulator_cpu.simulate_step(0.01)
  end_time = time.time()
  summed_density = simulator_cpu.get_density_sum()
  logging.info(f"Simulation step {step} time: {end_time - start_time:.4f}  Density sum:{summed_density}")
```

Here, the `FluidSimulator` class attempts to initialize the grid on the GPU using the `cupy` library. If the GPU initialization fails, it logs an error, switches to CPU processing, and initializes the grid using Numpy. The `simulate_step` function and `get_density_sum` methods both use conditional execution, utilizing `cupy` when running on the GPU, and `numpy` when the grid resides in CPU memory. Additionally, it is shown how a simulation can be run with reduced fidelity on the CPU.

Finally, a more complex issue arises with services which are heavily dependent on GPU accelerated processing, such as cloud-based machine learning APIs. Here, a server farm environment could be designed such that GPUs can be scheduled dynamically between tasks. Therefore a process could either be stalled or sent to a different machine where resources are available. This involves more sophisticated resource management, and the error handling must move to a higher level, such as a job scheduling system. This type of issue arose when I was using a large-scale training service where some GPUs were intermittently going offline. In this case, the training jobs could be transparently rescheduled onto available GPU nodes via the job manager when such errors were detected.

```python
import time
import logging
import random

class GpuNode:
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.available = True

    def allocate_gpu(self):
        if self.available:
            logging.info(f"GPU node {self.node_id}: allocated")
            self.available = False
            return True
        else:
            logging.info(f"GPU node {self.node_id}: unavailable")
            return False

    def deallocate_gpu(self):
        logging.info(f"GPU node {self.node_id}: deallocated")
        self.available = True


class JobManager:
    def __init__(self, gpu_nodes):
        self.gpu_nodes = gpu_nodes
        self.job_queue = []
        self.jobs_in_progress = {}
        self.running = True

    def submit_job(self, job_id):
        self.job_queue.append(job_id)
        logging.info(f"Job {job_id}: submitted")

    def process_jobs(self):
        while self.running:
            if not self.job_queue and not self.jobs_in_progress:
                time.sleep(1)
                continue
            #Check if a current job is finished (example only)
            jobs_to_remove = []
            for job_id, node_id in self.jobs_in_progress.items():
                if random.random() > 0.9:
                    logging.info(f"Job {job_id} Finished.")
                    self.gpu_nodes[node_id].deallocate_gpu()
                    jobs_to_remove.append(job_id)
            for job_id in jobs_to_remove:
              del self.jobs_in_progress[job_id]
            # try and start new jobs
            if self.job_queue:
              job_id = self.job_queue.pop(0)
              for i, node in enumerate(self.gpu_nodes):
                 if node.allocate_gpu():
                   logging.info(f"Job {job_id}: started on GPU node {node.node_id}")
                   self.jobs_in_progress[job_id] = i
                   break
              else:
                   self.job_queue.append(job_id)
                   logging.info(f"Job {job_id}: waiting for available GPU node")
            time.sleep(0.1)



    def stop(self):
       self.running = False

#Example usage
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
gpu_nodes = [GpuNode(1), GpuNode(2), GpuNode(3)]
job_manager = JobManager(gpu_nodes)

job_manager.submit_job("Job A")
job_manager.submit_job("Job B")
job_manager.submit_job("Job C")
job_manager.submit_job("Job D")

job_manager.process_jobs()
time.sleep(5) # Run for a few seconds
job_manager.stop()

```

In this example, the `GpuNode` class represents individual GPU resources, which can be allocated or deallocated. The `JobManager` is responsible for scheduling jobs onto the available nodes. If a GPU is unavailable, the job is requeued and waits for an available node. The main process submits multiple jobs, and the job manager processes the queue, allocating jobs to available GPU nodes. The manager also simulates job completion and frees GPU resources.

In summary, dealing with GPU unavailability requires a multi-pronged approach. Prioritize robust error handling, implement CPU fallback logic, and consider reduced-fidelity modes where necessary. In a server environment a central job manager can allow task to dynamically adapt to GPU availability.

For further exploration, I recommend studying the design patterns associated with resource management and error handling, particularly those concerning concurrent programming. Review literature on algorithm optimization for both CPU and GPU architectures to better understand the trade-offs involved in selecting different processing paths. Examining documentation from GPU API providers, such as NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA toolkit or AMDâ€™s ROCm platform, can assist in understanding their specific error handling mechanisms. Examining existing implementations of large scale GPU scheduling systems can help understand practical solutions.
