Synthesizable integer variables declared within a `for` loop inside a `generate` block cannot directly be used within an `always` block in a manner that guarantees predictable synthesis results.  My experience working on several high-speed data processing ASICs has highlighted the critical distinction between the generative nature of `generate` blocks and the sequential nature of `always` blocks.  The seemingly straightforward approach often leads to unpredictable instantiation and potential race conditions depending on the synthesis tool and its specific implementation.

The core issue stems from the scoping and instantiation processes of these constructs.  A `generate` block is fundamentally a template.  It defines a repeatable structure, instantiated multiple times based on the loop control.  Each instantiation creates a unique set of signals and variables, completely isolated from the other instantiations.  An `always` block, conversely, describes sequential logic within a single design instance.  There's no inherent mechanism for an `always` block to directly access the variables generated within multiple distinct instantiations of a `generate` block.  Attempting to do so results in undefined behavior; the synthesis tool may choose to optimize the design in ways that are not easily predictable, potentially leading to functional discrepancies between simulation and implementation.

To illustrate this, let's examine three scenarios and the associated synthesis implications.

**Example 1:  Direct Access Attempt (Unsynthesizable)**

```verilog
module generate_loop_test;

  integer i;
  genvar j;

  generate
    for (j = 0; j < 4; j = j + 1) begin : loop_inst
      integer loop_var;
      always @(posedge clk) begin
        loop_var <= j; //Attempting direct access. UNSYNTHESIZABLE!
      end
    end
  endgenerate

  // ... rest of the module ...

endmodule
```

In this example, the `always` block attempts to directly assign the `generate` loop's index variable `j` to `loop_var`. This is problematic because each instantiation of the `generate` block (`loop_inst`) creates its own instance of `loop_var`,  but the `always` block is not specifically tied to any one instance. The synthesis tool cannot determine which `loop_var` the assignment should target. This often results in synthesis errors or unpredictable behavior.  The tool might synthesize multiple independent `always` blocks, potentially leading to resource overuse and timing issues.

**Example 2:  Using a Bus (Synthesizable)**

```verilog
module generate_loop_test_bus;

  parameter NUM_INSTANCES = 4;
  reg [NUM_INSTANCES-1:0][31:0] loop_var_bus; //Bus to hold all values
  genvar j;

  generate
    for (j = 0; j < NUM_INSTANCES; j = j + 1) begin : loop_inst
      always @(posedge clk) begin
        loop_var_bus[j] <= j * 10; //Assign to the bus
      end
    end
  endgenerate

  always @(posedge clk) begin
      //Access the bus within a separate always block
      //Example usage of the values
  end

endmodule
```

This approach uses a bus (`loop_var_bus`) to aggregate the values from each instantiation of the `generate` block. This is a synthesizable solution.  Each instantiation of the `generate` block writes its calculated value into a specific element of the bus.  A separate `always` block can then access the entire bus to process the aggregated results. This ensures clear signal routing and avoids the ambiguity of the previous example.  The critical element here is the explicit aggregation mechanism provided by the bus.  Note that the bus width and data type must appropriately accommodate the expected range of values.

**Example 3:  Using a Function (Synthesizable)**

```verilog
module generate_loop_test_func;

  integer result;
  genvar j;

  function integer get_loop_value;
    input integer index;
    begin
      get_loop_value = index * 20; //Example function logic
    end
  endfunction

  generate
    for (j = 0; j < 4; j = j + 1) begin : loop_inst
      always @(posedge clk) begin
        result <= get_loop_value(j); //Call function within always block
      end
    end
  endgenerate

endmodule
```

This alternative uses a function (`get_loop_value`) to encapsulate the calculation.  Each instance of the `generate` block calls the function with its respective index (`j`), obtaining the calculated value. This solution provides a cleaner separation between the loop generation and the sequential logic within the `always` block. The function call itself is synthesizable, allowing the design tool to optimize the logic efficiently.  This approach is particularly beneficial when the calculation within the loop is complex, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

In summary, while you cannot directly access variables declared within a `for` loop of a `generate` block inside an `always` block in a way that guarantees consistent synthesis,  alternative approaches like using buses or functions can create synthesizable and functionally correct designs.  The choice depends on the specific requirements of the design.  Remember to carefully consider signal width and potential timing constraints when choosing the implementation method.  Consult your synthesis tool's documentation for specific recommendations and limitations related to `generate` blocks and `always` blocks interactions.
