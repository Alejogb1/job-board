The practical limits on GPU thread concurrency and memory usage are not solely defined by hardware specifications but are significantly impacted by the interaction between the hardware architecture, the specific API being utilized (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan), and the application’s design. Theoretical limits provided by manufacturers are often a best-case scenario, rarely achievable in real-world applications due to overhead and resource contention.

From my experience working on computationally intensive simulations, I've learned that the advertised number of CUDA cores or streaming multiprocessors (SMs) on an NVIDIA GPU, for instance, translates to a potential maximum number of concurrent threads. However, this number isn't a free pass to launch that many threads without regard for organization or resource management. Each SM can handle a limited number of active warps – groups of 32 threads executing in lockstep in the case of NVIDIA GPUs. Therefore, while you might see figures like "10,000+ CUDA cores" on a spec sheet, the true achievable concurrency is often much less, due to the hardware constraints on active warps and the need to avoid thread divergence. Thread divergence occurs when threads within a warp take different execution paths due to conditional statements, diminishing performance because the whole warp must serially complete all paths.

Furthermore, the global memory on a GPU, typically the DRAM connected via a wide memory bus, is a finite and highly contested resource. While the card's memory specification indicates its theoretical capacity, effective utilization is constrained by how effectively the application manages memory transfers between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU) and avoids memory access bottlenecks. Over-allocating memory can lead to driver-imposed limitations or thrashing as the operating system pages memory between the main system RAM and the GPU, significantly hampering performance. The GPU's high bandwidth memory is usually a valuable asset, yet is generally small and must be managed efficiently.

A critical consideration that often affects the practical limits is shared memory, also known as scratchpad or local memory. It is a significantly smaller and much faster memory region located on each SM. Proper use of shared memory is often crucial to achieving high performance, especially with operations that require data reuse within a thread block. Incorrect utilization, such as misusing it as an oversized cache, will easily overflow this region, leading to unpredictable program behavior or reduced performance.

Let’s consider three examples.

**Example 1: Trivial Vector Addition (CUDA)**

```cuda
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024 * 1024;
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);

    float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_a, size);
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_b, size);
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_c, size);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        h_a[i] = (float)i;
        h_b[i] = (float)(n - i);
    }

    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size);

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    //Verification
     for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        printf("c[%d]: %f\n", i, h_c[i]);
    }

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    cudaFreeHost(h_a);
    cudaFreeHost(h_b);
    cudaFreeHost(h_c);
    return 0;
}
```

This CUDA example demonstrates a simple vector addition kernel. The critical observation here is how the number of threads is decided: `threadsPerBlock` and `blocksPerGrid`. You must consider the physical hardware limitations which dictate the max number of threads per block, typically 1024 for recent NVIDIA GPUs. The number of blocks you choose significantly influences the achieved concurrency. Choosing small block sizes results in fewer active warps on the SMs, wasting computation capacity. Choosing very large block sizes, while potentially increasing occupancy, risks exceeding the shared memory capacity and thread register count per SM. It’s a balance.

**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication Using Shared Memory (CUDA)**

```cuda
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define TILE_WIDTH 16

__global__ void matrixMul(float* A, float* B, float* C, int width) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < width && col < width) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        __shared__ float As[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];
        __shared__ float Bs[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];
        int numTiles = (width + TILE_WIDTH - 1) / TILE_WIDTH;
        for (int t = 0; t < numTiles; ++t) {
            int rowTile = row / TILE_WIDTH * TILE_WIDTH;
            int colTile = col / TILE_WIDTH * TILE_WIDTH;

            int a_row = row;
            int a_col = t * TILE_WIDTH + threadIdx.x;
            int b_row = t * TILE_WIDTH + threadIdx.y;
            int b_col = col;

            if (a_row < width && a_col < width)
               As[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[a_row * width + a_col];
             else
               As[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f;
            if(b_row < width && b_col < width)
                Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[b_row * width + b_col];
            else
               Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f;
            __syncthreads();

             for (int k=0; k < TILE_WIDTH; ++k) {
                 sum += As[threadIdx.y][k] * Bs[k][threadIdx.x];
            }
            __syncthreads();
       }

      C[row * width + col] = sum;

    }
}


int main() {
    int width = 1024;
    size_t size = width * width * sizeof(float);

    float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_A, size);
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_B, size);
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_C, size);

    for (int i = 0; i < width; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < width; ++j){
            h_A[i * width + j] = (float)(i+j);
            h_B[i * width + j] = (float)(i-j);
        }
    }

    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size);

    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlockWidth = TILE_WIDTH;
    int blocksPerGridWidth = (width + threadsPerBlockWidth - 1) / threadsPerBlockWidth;

    dim3 threadsPerBlock(threadsPerBlockWidth,threadsPerBlockWidth);
    dim3 blocksPerGrid(blocksPerGridWidth, blocksPerGridWidth);

    matrixMul<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, width);

    cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    //Verification
     for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        printf("C[%d]: %f\n", i, h_C[i]);
    }
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);
    cudaFreeHost(h_A);
    cudaFreeHost(h_B);
    cudaFreeHost(h_C);

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the matrix multiplication uses shared memory (As and Bs). The `TILE_WIDTH` constant defines the size of the tiles stored in shared memory. Exceeding the shared memory size (determined by the device's specifications) will result in a compilation error or incorrect results. Moreover, excessive `TILE_WIDTH` may limit the number of active warps per SM, reducing overall concurrency. The `__syncthreads()` calls ensure that all threads within the block have completed their shared memory writes before data is consumed from it. In addition, there's an important memory access pattern. Global memory accesses are coalesced for performance gains. Coalesced memory reads occur when threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.

**Example 3: Simple Memory Allocation Test (CUDA)**

```cuda
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  size_t memoryToAllocate = (size_t)1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB
  float* devicePtr;
  cudaError_t error;

  for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++){
    memoryToAllocate = memoryToAllocate * 2;
    error = cudaMalloc((void**)&devicePtr, memoryToAllocate);

    if(error != cudaSuccess){
     printf("GPU memory allocation failed. Size attempted %zu : %s\n", memoryToAllocate, cudaGetErrorString(error));
     break;
    } else {
      printf("Successfully allocated %zu bytes\n", memoryToAllocate);
    }

      cudaFree(devicePtr);
  }
    return 0;
}

```
This example attempts to allocate increasing amounts of GPU memory and will demonstrate at what point an error occurs due to insufficient GPU memory. This reveals that even when the theoretical maximum memory is specified on the device, real usage is often less due to system overheads and other limitations. Allocating too much memory will likely cause an out of memory error.

In conclusion, understanding the GPU's architecture and constraints is essential for achieving optimal performance and avoiding failures related to memory and thread exhaustion. Hardware specifications should be interpreted not as fixed ceilings, but as potential upper bounds. Effective application design relies on careful management of thread organization, efficient usage of memory hierarchies, and judicious use of synchronizations.

For learning more about GPU programming, I would recommend exploring books such as "CUDA by Example: An Introduction to General-Purpose GPU Programming" for a hands-on CUDA approach. There are also resources from NVIDIA’s developer zone that provide detailed documentation and tutorials on their architectures and programming models. Additionally, understanding parallel computing concepts and memory management is critical, and books that delve into these areas are very useful.
