The shift from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x introduced significant changes in how operations are defined, particularly impacting code relying heavily on the `tensorflow.python.framework.ops` module. Specifically, issues often arise due to the deprecation of manual graph construction and the increased emphasis on eager execution and the `tf.function` decorator. Having migrated several large legacy models, Iâ€™ve encountered and resolved numerous challenges in this area.

The primary difficulty stems from the fact that in TensorFlow 1.x, operations were explicitly added to a default graph, typically via lower-level functions in `tf.ops`, using `tf.placeholder` for inputs and `tf.Variable` for trainable parameters. Migrating such code directly to TensorFlow 2.x often leads to errors because this manual graph manipulation is discouraged, and the default graph behavior has been modified. TensorFlow 2.x, by default, operates in eager execution mode, meaning operations are executed immediately, rather than building a computational graph for later execution within a session. When defining custom operations in `tf.ops`, this eager execution can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures if the logic was constructed with graph execution in mind.

The correct approach involves transitioning to either using `tf.function` for graph compilation when performance is critical or restructuring code to leverage native TensorFlow operations. Using `tf.function` allows for the benefits of graph optimization while maintaining a more manageable development experience than directly dealing with the graph object. For scenarios where graph compilation is not critical, direct eager execution coupled with TensorFlow's pre-defined operations and layers within `tf.keras` provides a viable alternative.

Here's an example illustrating the problem and its resolution:

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.x Style Operation**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

def create_custom_op_v1():
  x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None, 2])
  weights = tf.Variable(initial_value=[[1.0],[2.0]],dtype=tf.float32)
  bias = tf.Variable(initial_value=[0.1], dtype=tf.float32)
  output = tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias
  return x, output

x_input, output_op = create_custom_op_v1()

with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  example_input = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
  result = sess.run(output_op, feed_dict={x_input: example_input})
  print(result)
```

In this TensorFlow 1.x example, a custom operation is constructed involving a placeholder, a variable, matrix multiplication and a bias addition. The graph is defined using the now deprecated API, and execution occurs within a `tf.Session`. Migrating this code directly to TensorFlow 2.x will result in a variety of issues, primarily because placeholders and `tf.Session` are no longer the recommended way to interact with the computational graph.

**Example 2: Incorrect Migration to TensorFlow 2.x**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_custom_op_v2_incorrect():
  x = tf.constant([[1.0,2.0],[3.0,4.0]],dtype=tf.float32) # Placeholder removed
  weights = tf.Variable(initial_value=[[1.0],[2.0]],dtype=tf.float32)
  bias = tf.Variable(initial_value=[0.1], dtype=tf.float32)
  output = tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias
  return output

output_op = create_custom_op_v2_incorrect()
print(output_op)
```

This naive update results in immediate eager evaluation. While the code does run, it no longer represents a parameterized operation. The input is hardcoded as a constant. Also, the output is a tensor with specific calculated values. The aim was to create a re-usable function for different inputs, which this version fails to achieve. It lacks the necessary abstraction and dynamic input mechanism that placeholders provided in the 1.x version.

**Example 3: Correct TensorFlow 2.x Migration with `tf.function`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def create_custom_op_v2_correct(x):
    weights = tf.Variable(initial_value=[[1.0],[2.0]],dtype=tf.float32)
    bias = tf.Variable(initial_value=[0.1], dtype=tf.float32)
    output = tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias
    return output

example_input = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
result = create_custom_op_v2_correct(example_input)
print(result)

example_input_2 = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
result_2 = create_custom_op_v2_correct(example_input_2)
print(result_2)

```

The corrected version uses the `@tf.function` decorator. This transforms the Python function into a TensorFlow graph that benefits from graph optimizations. Critically, the placeholder has been replaced with a function argument, allowing different inputs to be processed. The input `x` is passed as a `tf.Tensor` during the function call. This approach allows for a re-usable and performant operation without directly manipulating the graph.

For larger models using more complex custom operations, relying on inheritance and class structure is useful to encapsulate variables and operations properly. For example, a custom layer could be derived from `tf.keras.layers.Layer` and implement a `call` method, or a custom model derived from `tf.keras.Model`. Using these constructs ensures that variables are managed and tracked properly by TensorFlow during training and inference.

When dealing with existing code based on lower-level `tf.ops`, the strategy generally involves first identifying the key logic encapsulated in those operations. Next, you must refactor those operations to operate either directly with `tf.Tensor` objects or within a `tf.function` context. This involves careful analysis of the input and output tensors and ensures the custom operation works correctly within the TensorFlow 2.x eager execution framework. For training, the use of `tf.GradientTape` is necessary for backpropagation, as the old `tf.Session`-based automatic differentiation is no longer supported.

Debugging issues during this transition can be complex. The `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)` setting can be beneficial when debugging. This setting disables the `tf.function` graph compilation, thus exposing the underlying errors in a more readily understandable way. Once errors are resolved, remove the eager execution setting for better performance via graph compilation. The TensorFlow debugger can assist with inspecting tensors and operations during eager execution.

Resource recommendations for understanding these changes include: the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the guides on migrating to TensorFlow 2, the `tf.function` decorator, and writing custom layers using `tf.keras`. The TensorFlow API documentation for `tf.ops`, though reflecting deprecated behavior, can still be useful for understanding how the underlying operations were constructed in the older code base. Studying these resources can provide the necessary foundation for handling most migration tasks and developing new TensorFlow projects using current best practices.
