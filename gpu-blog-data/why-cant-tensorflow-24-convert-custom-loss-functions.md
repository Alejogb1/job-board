TensorFlow 2.4's inability to directly convert custom loss functions' symbolic Keras inputs/outputs to NumPy arrays stems from a fundamental design choice concerning graph execution and eager execution modes.  My experience debugging similar issues within large-scale image recognition projects highlighted this limitation.  The core problem lies in the distinction between symbolic tensors, representing computations within a TensorFlow graph, and NumPy arrays, representing concrete numerical data in memory.  While eager execution bridges this gap to some extent, custom loss functions, especially those involving complex computations or tensor manipulations, often operate within a partially-symbolic environment, hindering direct NumPy array conversion.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, under the TensorFlow 2.x umbrella, allows for the definition of custom loss functions.  These functions accept symbolic tensors as input—representing predicted values and true labels—and return a symbolic tensor representing the loss value.  These symbolic tensors aren't directly equivalent to NumPy arrays. They represent computational nodes within TensorFlow's computational graph. This graph is not executed until the model's `fit()` or `evaluate()` methods are called.  Attempting to convert these symbolic tensors to NumPy arrays before graph execution yields an error because the underlying computations haven't been performed, and thus, there's no concrete numerical data to convert.  In contrast, the numerical data represented by NumPy arrays is readily available in memory, ready for computation or manipulation.  The mismatch between the symbolic representation and the concrete numerical representation is the root cause of the conversion failure.

The challenge is further amplified when the custom loss function incorporates complex operations that cannot be easily translated into a pure NumPy context.  Operations like custom gradients, tensor reshaping within the loss function itself, or conditional logic based on tensor values may rely on TensorFlow's specific tensor operations, unavailable in NumPy.  Forcefully attempting conversion often leads to errors, indicating a fundamental incompatibility between the symbolic tensors' abstract representation and NumPy's imperative nature.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: A Simple, Convertable Loss Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def simple_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred)) # Element-wise squared difference, then mean
  return loss

# This will work because the loss function is straightforward
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8], [3.1, 3.9]])
loss_value = simple_loss(y_true, y_pred)

loss_numpy = loss_value.numpy() # Conversion successful
print(f"Loss (NumPy): {loss_numpy}")
```
This example shows a simple mean squared error loss function. It's easily converted because the operations are directly translatable to NumPy equivalents.  TensorFlow's `reduce_mean` and squaring operations have straightforward NumPy counterparts.

**Example 2: A More Complex, Unconvertable Loss Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def complex_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  diff = y_true - y_pred
  mask = tf.cast(tf.abs(diff) > 0.5, tf.float32) # Conditional logic based on tensor value
  weighted_diff = diff * mask
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(weighted_diff))
  return loss

# This will likely fail if you attempt to convert before execution.
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8], [3.1, 3.9]])
loss_value = complex_loss(y_true, y_pred)

# This line will likely throw an error, or return an unexpected value
# loss_numpy = loss_value.numpy()
print(f"Loss (Tensor): {loss_value}")

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(loss=complex_loss, optimizer='adam')
model.fit(np.array([[1],[2]]), np.array([[1],[2]]), epochs=1) #Execute the graph

loss_value_after_fit = complex_loss(y_true, y_pred)
loss_numpy = loss_value_after_fit.numpy() # Conversion now successful

print(f"Loss after fit (NumPy): {loss_numpy}")
```

This example uses conditional logic and masking, which introduce operations not directly supported in a simple NumPy context.  Attempting to convert `loss_value` directly to a NumPy array *before* the model's `fit` method is executed will likely result in an error, as described before. However after execution, the conversion works.  The symbolic tensor only resolves to a concrete numerical value *after* the TensorFlow graph has been executed.

**Example 3:  Incorporating Custom Gradients:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.custom_gradient
def custom_gradient_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

  def grad(dy):
      return dy * 2 * (y_pred - y_true), dy * 2 * (y_true - y_pred)  #Custom Gradient

  return loss, grad

y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8], [3.1, 3.9]])
loss_value = custom_gradient_loss(y_true, y_pred)

#Attempting to convert this will almost certainly fail before the graph is executed.
#loss_numpy = loss_value.numpy()
print(f"Loss (Tensor): {loss_value}")

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(loss=custom_gradient_loss, optimizer='adam')
model.fit(np.array([[1],[2]]), np.array([[1],[2]]), epochs=1)

loss_value_after_fit = custom_gradient_loss(y_true, y_pred)
loss_numpy = loss_value_after_fit.numpy()
print(f"Loss after fit (NumPy): {loss_numpy}")
```

This example demonstrates a loss function with a custom gradient.  The custom gradient itself involves TensorFlow operations, making direct NumPy conversion impossible before graph execution.  Similar to the previous example, the conversion will only be successful after running the training or evaluation steps.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation regarding custom training loops, eager execution, and gradient tapes is crucial for understanding these intricacies.  Furthermore, studying the source code of existing Keras loss functions can offer valuable insights into how to correctly design and implement custom loss functions that behave predictably within the TensorFlow framework.  A comprehensive guide on TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation mechanism will also prove beneficial.  Finally, referring to advanced materials on computational graphs and graph optimization in the context of TensorFlow will provide a deeper grasp of the underlying mechanisms affecting this conversion process.
