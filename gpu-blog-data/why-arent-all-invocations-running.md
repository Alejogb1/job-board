The intermittent execution of invocations points towards a resource contention issue, specifically a limitation in the concurrency model employed.  In my experience debugging high-throughput systems, this often stems from poorly managed thread pools or asynchronous task schedulers, leading to queuing bottlenecks and dropped tasks.  The apparent non-execution isn't necessarily a failure of the invocation mechanism itself, but rather a consequence of the system's inability to handle the requested workload concurrently.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem of "not all invocations running" arises from a mismatch between the rate of invocation generation and the system's capacity to process these invocations.  This capacity is defined by the available processing resources (CPU cores, memory, I/O bandwidth) and the efficiency of their utilization within the chosen concurrency framework.  Several factors contribute to this bottleneck:

* **Limited Thread Pool Size:**  Many invocation mechanisms rely on thread pools to manage concurrent operations. If the pool size is insufficient, new invocations are queued until a thread becomes available.  A poorly configured or statically sized thread pool, especially under peak load, can lead to significant queuing delays and eventual task abandonment or rejection.

* **I/O Bound Operations:**  If invocations involve substantial I/O operations (network requests, database queries, file access), the concurrency bottleneck may not be in the CPU but in the I/O subsystem.  Even with a large thread pool, the system might become saturated waiting for I/O responses, effectively limiting the rate of invocation processing.

* **Blocking Operations:**  Synchronous operations within the invocation handling logic can block threads, rendering them unavailable for processing other invocations. This effectively reduces the active thread count and creates a backlog.  This is particularly problematic with long-running tasks within the invocation handler.

* **Resource Exhaustion:**  Memory leaks, excessive garbage collection, or other resource exhaustion scenarios can further degrade the system's ability to handle concurrent invocations.  This could manifest as seemingly random failures to execute invocations, due to unpredictable resource limitations.

* **Deadlocks:**  In complex systems involving multiple threads and shared resources, deadlocks can completely halt processing, leading to the appearance of missed invocations.  This is often difficult to debug and requires careful analysis of thread interactions.

Effective diagnosis requires careful monitoring of system resources (CPU utilization, memory usage, I/O wait times), thread pool queue lengths, and the invocation processing times.  Profiling tools are invaluable in identifying bottlenecks and quantifying the impact of different components on overall performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Insufficient Thread Pool Size (Python)**

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def my_invocation(i):
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a time-consuming operation
    print(f"Invocation {i} completed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:  # Limited to 2 threads
        futures = [executor.submit(my_invocation, i) for i in range(10)]
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            try:
                future.result()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Invocation failed: {e}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a scenario where the thread pool size (max_workers=2) is significantly smaller than the number of invocations (10).  Only two invocations will run concurrently; the others will wait in the queue, resulting in delayed completion or appearing as "not running" due to the limited concurrency.


**Example 2: Blocking I/O Operation (Node.js)**

```javascript
const https = require('https');

function myInvocation(i) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        https.get('https://www.example.com', (res) => { // Simulate a network request
            resolve(`Invocation ${i} completed.`);
        }).on('error', (err) => {
            reject(`Invocation ${i} failed: ${err.message}`);
        });
    });
}

async function runInvocations() {
    const invocations = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        invocations.push(myInvocation(i));
    }
    try {
        const results = await Promise.all(invocations);
        console.log(results);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

runInvocations();
```

*Commentary:* This Node.js code utilizes `https.get` to simulate network requests.  If the network is slow or the server is unresponsive, these I/O-bound operations will block the event loop, potentially delaying or preventing the execution of subsequent invocations. The use of `Promise.all` allows for concurrent requests, yet network delays will still affect overall performance.


**Example 3: Deadlock Scenario (Java)**

```java
class MyResource {
    private boolean lock1 = false;
    private boolean lock2 = false;

    synchronized void acquireLocks() {
        if (!lock1) {
            lock1 = true;
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100); //Simulate work
                if (!lock2) {
                    lock2 = true;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Deadlock Avoided");
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }

    synchronized void releaseLocks() {
        lock1 = false;
        lock2 = false;
    }
}

public class DeadlockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyResource resource = new MyResource();
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> { resource.acquireLocks(); resource.releaseLocks();});
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> { resource.acquireLocks(); resource.releaseLocks();});

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();
        System.out.println("Finished");
    }
}
```

*Commentary:* This Java example, while simplified, illustrates the potential for a deadlock.  Two threads attempt to acquire two locks in different orders. If `thread1` acquires `lock1` and `thread2` acquires `lock2`, neither can proceed, resulting in a deadlock where neither invocation completes. This simplified example shows the principle; real-world deadlocks are much harder to identify and require advanced debugging techniques.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of concurrency and its challenges, I recommend studying concurrency models (e.g., actor model, thread pools), asynchronous programming paradigms, and debugging techniques for concurrent systems.  Consult documentation for your chosen programming language's concurrency libraries and explore profiling tools specific to your development environment.  A deep understanding of operating system processes and threads is crucial for effectively troubleshooting resource contention issues.  Finally, exploring the principles of distributed systems can provide valuable insights into managing concurrency at scale.
