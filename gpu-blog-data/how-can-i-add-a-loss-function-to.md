In multi-output neural networks, or when using deep supervision techniques, the requirement to apply loss functions to intermediate layers, separate from the final output layer, arises frequently. This is not the standard Keras workflow where the model's overall loss is solely based on the final layer's output. I've addressed this challenge in several research projects involving convolutional sequence-to-sequence models where I needed to enforce feature similarity at specific intermediate stages, thus requiring customized loss functions.

The standard approach to defining a Keras model involves specifying the input layer, subsequent layers, and then calling `model.compile(optimizer, loss, metrics)` where `loss` is a single loss function or a dictionary of losses for multi-output models. However, this compilation process implicitly assumes that all losses should be applied to the final output of the model. To target intermediate layers, we must bypass the standard loss specification and implement a custom training loop. This involves: 1) building a model with clearly named intermediate layers that we wish to target, 2) creating a Keras model where the output of the targeted intermediate layer(s) are made accessible, and 3) overriding the standard `model.fit` by implementing a custom training loop that computes loss at specific points of our model.

Let's begin with a simple sequential model illustration. Suppose we have a model designed for image classification but we want to also regularize the output of the third hidden layer, named "hidden_3." We can then create an intermediary Keras model where one of its outputs corresponds to this layer. Here's how we structure this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

# 1. Define the primary model with a named intermediate layer
input_shape = (32, 32, 3)
num_classes = 10
primary_model_input = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)

x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(primary_model_input)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
hidden_3 = layers.Flatten(name="hidden_3")(x) # Named layer
x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(hidden_3)
output = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

primary_model = keras.Model(inputs=primary_model_input, outputs=output)

# 2. Define the intermediary model extracting desired layers.
intermediate_model = keras.Model(inputs=primary_model.input, outputs=[primary_model.get_layer('hidden_3').output, primary_model.output])


```

In this first code example, the `primary_model` is a standard convolutional network with a specifically named layer: "hidden_3". We have constructed an `intermediate_model` where we make the output of "hidden_3" available, in addition to the original output of `primary_model`.  This new model outputs a list: the first element is the output of layer "hidden_3" and the second element is the final output of the `primary_model`. With this `intermediate_model`, we can now define custom losses for intermediate layers.

We now need to create a custom training loop to compute our custom losses. This requires implementing a step-by-step training procedure by utilizing `tf.GradientTape`, compute our customized loss, and perform gradient updates using the optimizer. The `intermediate_model` allows us to access those internal activations from which we can compute our loss function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from keras import optimizers
from keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy, MeanAbsoluteError

optimizer = optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
intermediate_loss_fn = MeanAbsoluteError()
final_loss_fn = CategoricalCrossentropy()

def custom_train_step(images, labels, intermediate_loss_weight):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        intermediate_output, final_output = intermediate_model(images, training=True)
        # Assume some target for the intermediate layer, here, a zero tensor of the same size
        intermediate_target = tf.zeros_like(intermediate_output)
        intermediate_loss = intermediate_loss_fn(intermediate_target, intermediate_output)
        final_loss = final_loss_fn(labels, final_output)
        total_loss = intermediate_loss * intermediate_loss_weight + final_loss


    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, primary_model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, primary_model.trainable_variables))

    return total_loss, intermediate_loss, final_loss

# Example usage:
batch_size = 32
epochs = 2
intermediate_loss_weight = 0.1
num_batches = 10

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(num_batches):
        images = np.random.rand(batch_size, *input_shape).astype('float32')
        labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, size=(batch_size,))
        labels = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=num_classes).numpy().astype('float32')
        total_loss, inter_loss, final_loss  = custom_train_step(images, labels, intermediate_loss_weight)
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}, batch {batch}: Total Loss = {total_loss:.4f}, Intermediate Loss = {inter_loss:.4f}, Final Loss = {final_loss:.4f}')

```
This second code example demonstrates a custom training loop using `tf.GradientTape`.  The key is the construction of the loss function. Here, we compute `intermediate_loss` using the MeanAbsoluteError function comparing the hidden layer output to a zero target. The `final_loss` is the standard CategoricalCrossentropy for classification. I combine both to form a `total_loss` which is subsequently used to perform gradient updates on the `primary_model`. The  `intermediate_loss_weight` scales the contribution of intermediate loss to the total loss. The example usage section demonstrates how these custom training steps are deployed over dummy data. This training loop decouples the gradient updates from standard `model.fit`.

The core challenge is ensuring that gradients flow correctly through the `primary_model` after the computation of `intermediate_loss` and `final_loss`. This is why `intermediate_model` returns both the target layer and the final output layer. The loss is then computed based on the outputs and the corresponding target and labels. The `tf.GradientTape` object records all tensor operations within its context, allowing Keras to then calculate gradients for all trainable variables in the primary_model.

To adapt this approach to more complex scenarios, such as training using mini-batches or employing validation datasets, we would encapsulate the core logic within a function and iterate over batches. Consider the following adaptation for loading data from the Keras Fashion-MNIST dataset using mini-batches:

```python
from keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
from keras.utils import to_categorical
batch_size = 32
epochs = 5
intermediate_loss_weight = 0.1
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0
test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels, num_classes)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels, num_classes)
train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, axis=-1)
test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, axis=-1)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_images, train_labels)).batch(batch_size)

for epoch in range(epochs):
        for images, labels in dataset:
            total_loss, inter_loss, final_loss  = custom_train_step(images, labels, intermediate_loss_weight)
            print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Total Loss = {total_loss:.4f}, Intermediate Loss = {inter_loss:.4f}, Final Loss = {final_loss:.4f}')


# Add validation loop here, similarly
```

In this third example, I load data from the Keras `fashion_mnist` dataset. Instead of generating random data, we create a `tf.data.Dataset` object to handle data loading and batching. The loop iterates over each batch from the training dataset, calculates the total, intermediate, and final losses using the same function as in the previous example. The implementation of a similar validation loop using a test dataset is left as an exercise for the user.  This refines the approach making it more suitable for real-world training scenarios.

In summary, modifying standard loss configurations in Keras to incorporate losses at intermediate layers requires a shift towards manual implementation through `tf.GradientTape`. By defining a supplementary model that outputs both the final layer and the intermediate layer target, and by implementing a custom training loop, one can explicitly define how gradients are computed and applied. Resources detailing the usage of `tf.GradientTape` and the construction of custom training loops, as found in the official TensorFlow documentation, are essential. Further insight into custom training methodologies can also be found in the books by Fran√ßois Chollet. Understanding these key concepts allows one to move beyond basic model architectures and implement more complex learning procedures.
