CUDA kernel execution failures on an RTX 3090 with CUDA 11.1 often stem from subtle inconsistencies between the host code and the device code, frequently manifesting as memory access errors or synchronization issues.  In my experience debugging similar scenarios across various high-performance computing projects, the most common culprit is neglecting to properly handle memory allocation, copying, and synchronization between the CPU and GPU.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Successful CUDA kernel execution hinges on several critical steps. First, the host code (running on the CPU) must allocate sufficient memory on the GPU.  This is typically done using `cudaMalloc`.  Second, data must be transferred from the host's main memory to the GPU's global memory using `cudaMemcpy`.  Third, the kernel itself must be launched correctly, specifying the grid and block dimensions.  Fourth, any results generated on the GPU must be copied back to the host using `cudaMemcpy`.  Finally, all allocated GPU memory must be freed using `cudaFree` to avoid memory leaks. Failure at any of these stages will result in kernel execution failure, often accompanied by error codes that need careful interpretation.

CUDA error handling is crucial.  Instead of simply relying on successful return codes, robust applications should actively check for errors after every CUDA API call.  Ignoring error checks masks the root cause, hindering effective debugging. The `cudaGetLastError()` function retrieves the last CUDA error, allowing for specific error identification and remediation.  Consistent and thorough error handling is paramount in preventing seemingly cryptic failure messages.  Furthermore, understanding the CUDA architecture, particularly the hierarchy of threads, blocks, and grids, is critical for effective parallel programming. Mismatches between the kernel's configuration and the GPU's capabilities can also lead to execution failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Memory Allocation and Copying**

This example demonstrates a typical scenario where insufficient memory allocation on the device leads to kernel failure.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024 * 1024; // Large number of elements
    size_t size = n * sizeof(int);

    int *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    h_a = (int *)malloc(size);
    h_b = (int *)malloc(size);
    h_c = (int *)malloc(size);

    // ERROR: Insufficient memory allocation for d_c
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, size/2); // Only half the required memory

    // ... (Initialization of h_a and h_b) ...

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost); // This will likely fail

    // ... (Error checking omitted for brevity) ...

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    free(h_a);
    free(h_b);
    free(h_c);

    return 0;
}
```

The error lies in the insufficient allocation of memory for `d_c`. This will cause the kernel launch to either fail outright or result in undefined behavior, often manifesting as incorrect results or a crash.  Proper error checking after each CUDA API call would reveal this problem immediately.

**Example 2: Incorrect Kernel Launch Configuration**

This example illustrates a scenario where the kernel launch configuration is mismatched with the GPU's capabilities, potentially leading to failure.

```c++
// ... (Previous code, corrected memory allocation) ...

    // ERROR: Incorrect block and grid dimensions exceeding GPU limits.
    int threadsPerBlock = 1024 * 1024; // Excessively large number of threads per block
    int blocksPerGrid = 1024; // Excessively large number of blocks

    addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

// ... (rest of the code) ...
```

Attempting to launch a kernel with a very large number of threads per block or blocks per grid might exceed the GPU's maximum limits, causing a kernel launch failure.  The CUDA runtime might return an error indicating insufficient resources.  Always consult the GPU's specifications to determine reasonable launch parameters.

**Example 3:  Lack of Synchronization**

This example demonstrates a scenario where the lack of proper synchronization can lead to unexpected results or errors. This example utilizes two kernels.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel1(int *data, int n) {
    // ... some computation ...
    data[threadIdx.x] = threadIdx.x * 2;
}


__global__ void kernel2(int *data, int n) {
    // ... some computation depending on kernel1 result
    data[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x] + threadIdx.x;
}

int main() {
    // ... (Memory Allocation and Copying) ...

    kernel1<<<1, 1024>>>(d_data, n);
    kernel2<<<1, 1024>>>(d_data, n); // No synchronization between kernel1 and kernel2


    // ... (Copy back to Host and Memory deallocation) ...
}
```

In this example, `kernel2` depends on the output of `kernel1`. Without proper synchronization (e.g., using `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after `kernel1`), `kernel2` might read data from `d_data` before `kernel1` has completed its execution, leading to unpredictable results or errors.  The `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` call ensures that all previously launched kernels have completed before proceeding.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and a comprehensive text on parallel programming with CUDA are invaluable resources.  Furthermore, utilizing CUDA debuggers and profilers provides critical insights into the kernel's behavior, aiding in efficient troubleshooting and performance optimization.  Understanding the nuances of memory management and synchronization is paramount for writing robust and efficient CUDA applications.  Finally, consulting examples and case studies from experienced CUDA developers can provide additional guidance and insight into common pitfalls.
