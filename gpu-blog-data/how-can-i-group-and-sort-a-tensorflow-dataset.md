TensorFlow Datasets, designed for efficient data pipelines, lack direct methods for in-memory grouping and sorting like Python lists.  I've encountered this limitation numerous times while working on complex sequence-to-sequence models and time-series analysis where pre-grouped or sorted batches significantly improve training efficiency. The recommended approach involves leveraging transformations to achieve the desired behavior, often with careful consideration for performance implications.  This requires moving beyond standard dataset mappings and exploiting functionalities that, while not immediately intuitive, are designed for precisely these kinds of operations.

The core challenge arises because TensorFlow Datasets operate on a streaming, potentially infinite, flow of data. Traditional in-memory grouping or sorting is infeasible due to memory constraints. Thus, we need to employ techniques that rearrange the data flow itself, which typically involves introducing a windowing operation followed by a `reduce` step, or an efficient `sort` operation based on key and `group_by_window` or `group_by_batch` based on the grouping criteria. The choice between these depends primarily on whether we want to sort first and then group or directly group. Sorting, when not pre-determined by the input data, often entails an explicit sorting step based on a key extraction function before any grouping operation can be applied. The key is understanding that these are not actual in-place operations on a container, but transformations that modify the data stream.

I will first demonstrate how to group a dataset by a specific key using the `group_by_window` method, often useful when data has a natural grouping property. The transformation functions accept a window containing an initial `batch_size` data and produce a batch, grouped by the window.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def group_by_label(element, num_groups=3):
    # Simulate an integer label, typically found in classification problems.
    label = tf.cast(element['label'], tf.int32)  # Ensure label is an integer

    # Grouping Key Logic: use modulo to assign labels to groups from 0 to num_groups-1
    key = tf.math.floormod(label, num_groups)
    return key

def reduce_fn(key, dataset):
  # Apply some reduction function to each group
    return dataset.batch(10) # Convert each group to a batch of 10

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices({
    'data': tf.range(100),
    'label': tf.random.uniform(shape=[100], minval=0, maxval=20, dtype=tf.int32)
    })


grouped_dataset = dataset.group_by_window(
  key_func=group_by_label,
  reduce_func=reduce_fn,
  window_size=10
)


for batch in grouped_dataset.take(3): #Inspect a few batches
    print(batch)

```
In this example, `group_by_label` is used as `key_func`, effectively creating three groups based on the modulo of each data point's label. The `reduce_fn` then batches each group's elements to 10 entries per batch. Note that `window_size` of 10 here controls the batch size *before* the `reduce_fn` processes them. This example shows how data is dynamically re-organized and batched based on the grouping key during the dataflow pipeline, not in memory.  This is particularly useful when each 'group' has a known or predictable data pattern, such as when dealing with time-series with distinct subject identities.

Next, consider a scenario where you need to sort data based on a certain feature and then process it. While TensorFlow Datasets donâ€™t directly support sorting, you can achieve this by generating a key for sorting and leveraging that in the transformation pipeline. The sorting is not globally applied, but only within batches that are passed to the `reduce` function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf


def sort_by_feature(element):
    #Assume some numerical feature which needs to be ordered
    feature = element['feature']
    return feature

def sort_and_batch(key, dataset):
    sorted_dataset = dataset.sort(key_func=sort_by_feature)
    return sorted_dataset.batch(10)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices({
    'data': tf.range(100),
    'feature': tf.random.uniform(shape=[100], minval=0, maxval=100, dtype=tf.float32)
    })


sorted_and_batched_dataset = dataset.group_by_window(
  key_func=lambda x: 0, #Dummy key as sorting within window
  reduce_func=sort_and_batch,
  window_size=20
)

for batch in sorted_and_batched_dataset.take(2):
    print(batch)
```

Here, the `sort_and_batch` function first sorts the elements inside the dataset window according to the 'feature' key using the `sort` method. This ensures that elements are sorted *within each window* according to the value of the `feature` and are then batched into batch size of 10. Since I am not interested in grouping before sorting, the `key_func` returns a constant of 0, effectively putting all elements into a single group within each window. The `window_size` of 20 means that the dataset is processed in windows of 20 elements at a time, which are then sorted and batched. This is an efficient way to perform a pseudo-sort across the dataset using an operation that only sorts each window of a defined size.

Finally, `group_by_batch` method groups the data in the dataset based on an equivalence relation defined by the `key_func`. The following example demonstrates how this works:

```python
import tensorflow as tf


def group_by_category(element):
    # Assume a categorical label represented as a string.
    category = element['category']
    return category

def reduce_and_batch(key, dataset):
    return dataset.batch(10)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices({
    'data': tf.range(100),
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'A']*10
    })

grouped_by_batch_dataset = dataset.group_by_batch(
  key_func=group_by_category,
  reduce_func=reduce_and_batch
)


for batch in grouped_by_batch_dataset.take(3):
    print(batch)

```
In this example, we have a 'category' feature that could represent, for instance, the different types of product categories in an e-commerce dataset.  The `group_by_category` function serves as the `key_func`, assigning each element to a group based on its 'category'.  The `reduce_and_batch` then batches the elements *within* each group into a batch size of 10. This is a useful transformation for applications where batching needs to be done within a group which shares certain attributes. The most important difference of `group_by_batch` with respect to `group_by_window` is that it maintains and processes each group, defined by the unique keys returned by the `key_func` independently throughout the dataset, while the `group_by_window` performs its grouping and reduction operation based on the fixed window sizes.

In summary, direct grouping and sorting, as commonly used with in-memory data structures, are not feasible or necessary within TensorFlow Datasets. Instead, the flexibility of the dataset API allows for custom transformations using `group_by_window` (for grouping on a specific window of samples), `sort` (for sorting samples within a window or using `key_func` during `group_by_window`), and `group_by_batch` (for grouping based on a specific key throughout the dataset). The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the task.  These tools, when combined effectively, provide sufficient capability to handle complex data preparation and organization scenarios. The key, in all cases, is to transform data while respecting the stream processing paradigm of TensorFlow Datasets.

For further exploration, I recommend examining TensorFlow's official documentation on `tf.data.Dataset` transformations. The tutorials on efficient data loading pipelines within the TensorFlow documentation provide valuable insight into optimization strategies. Additionally, studying examples of sequence-to-sequence models and reinforcement learning implementations will often showcase practical usage of these transformation techniques with TensorFlow Datasets.
