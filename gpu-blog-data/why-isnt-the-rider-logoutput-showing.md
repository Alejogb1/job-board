Rider's failure to display log output, a situation I've encountered numerous times during my development career, typically stems from a disconnect between the logging configuration within the application itself and Rider's ability to capture and present that output. This is particularly evident when frameworks or third-party libraries handle logging independently, bypassing the standard console redirection that Rider often relies upon for basic output. Pinpointing the root cause necessitates a systematic approach, considering several key points.

Firstly, the crucial factor is the chosen logging framework in your application. If you're utilizing `Console.WriteLine` or its equivalent for basic debugging, Rider's default console window should generally display that output unless a more fundamental redirection issue is present. However, most production applications employ more robust logging solutions like log4net, NLog, Serilog, or the built-in `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. These frameworks frequently require specific configuration to direct their output to a destination that Rider can effectively monitor.

A common pitfall is configuring these logging frameworks to write to files or databases instead of the console. For instance, if `log4net` is configured with a `RollingFileAppender` but not a `ConsoleAppender`, the output will be routed to the specified file, making it invisible within Rider’s output window. Similarly, Serilog might be set up to write to Seq or Elasticsearch, again diverting logs away from the console. Thus, examining the application's logging configuration file (often app.config, web.config, or appsettings.json) is the initial diagnostic step.

Secondly, project type and execution method can impact how logs are captured. A console application (.NET Core or Framework) running directly through Rider often has its standard output automatically redirected to the Rider console. However, web applications (ASP.NET Core), particularly when launched via IIS Express or another hosting mechanism, might not behave as straightforwardly. In these cases, the webserver might be handling the output, obscuring it from Rider’s console window. Therefore, if dealing with web applications, investigating the integration with the host and logging providers is essential. Additionally, if the project uses docker, the logging output may be redirected to the docker container log instead of being exposed in Rider.

Thirdly, Rider's own settings can sometimes be the culprit, although this is less common. There are instances, especially with complex solutions involving multiple projects, that an incorrect or insufficient logging level setting might result in desired information being omitted. Furthermore, if the application generates significant logging output, and Rider's buffer is limited, older log entries could be discarded or never rendered, giving the impression that no output exists. It is important to double check Rider’s “Run/Debug Configuration” settings within the IDE to see if filtering or buffer limits are in effect.

Now, let us examine some scenarios with illustrative examples:

**Example 1: Using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` with Configuration Incorrectly Set**

This example shows a .NET Core console application using the built-in logging framework. The problem stems from not adding a Console Provider.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var serviceProvider = new ServiceCollection()
            .AddLogging(builder =>
            {
              builder.AddFilter("System", LogLevel.Warning); // Filters out logs from the System category
               // Missing: .AddConsole(); 
            })
            .BuildServiceProvider();

        var logger = serviceProvider.GetService<ILoggerFactory>()
                       .CreateLogger<Program>();

        logger.LogInformation("This log message is not displayed!");
        logger.LogWarning("This log message should be displayed if the System category is not used!");

       Console.WriteLine("Simple Console.WriteLine - this should display");
    }
}

```

In this scenario, although `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` is included, the crucial part that sends the log messages to the console—`builder.AddConsole()`, is missing. While `Console.WriteLine` will be visible in Rider's output, the logs produced with the logger itself are not. The `AddFilter()` is used here to show that filters are also something that may cause logging to be suppressed. This demonstrates that using a logging framework does not automatically guarantee console output in Rider; you must configure it to use a console provider.

**Example 2:  log4net configured only for file output**

Here's a classic case involving log4net configured to write to a file, neglecting console output.

```csharp
// Log4net configuration in app.config (simplified)
/*
<log4net>
  <appender name="RollingFileAppender" type="log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender">
    <file value="log.txt" />
    <appendToFile value="true" />
    <rollingStyle value="Size" />
    <maxSizeRollBackups value="5" />
    <maximumFileSize value="10MB" />
    <staticLogFileName value="true" />
     <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
          <conversionPattern value="%date [%thread] %-5level %logger - %message%newline" />
     </layout>
  </appender>
  <root>
      <level value="ALL" />
      <appender-ref ref="RollingFileAppender" />
  </root>
</log4net>
*/

//C# Code
using log4net;

public class Program
{
  private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Program));

  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
      log.Info("This message will be written to log.txt");
      Console.WriteLine("This will be written to the console.");
  }

}
```

In this example, log4net's configuration file (`app.config`) specifies a `RollingFileAppender` that will save logs to 'log.txt', but not to the console. If the program executes, the "This message will be written to log.txt" string will be absent from Rider’s output window, but present in the log file. Meanwhile, the `Console.WriteLine` will work as expected. To fix this, an additional console appender should be defined in the configuration file and associated with the root element.

**Example 3: ASP.NET Core Web Application Log Output Redirected**

This illustrates how, by default, web applications in ASP.NET Core do not output directly to the Rider console.

```csharp
// Program.cs (ASP.NET Core) - simplified
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
               logging.AddFilter("Microsoft", LogLevel.Warning);
            })
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}

// Startup.cs (simplified)
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Startup
{
  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env, ILogger<Startup> logger)
  {
    logger.LogInformation("Startup - this log will most likely not appear in the Rider Console");

    app.Run(async context =>
    {
       await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World");
    });
  }
}
```

In this ASP.NET Core setup, the application is launched using the web host. This example uses the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` framework to generate a log message, but by default, these logs are not routed to Rider's output window. Instead they are output to IIS Express or the webserver output if docker is used. To capture the logs in Rider when the web application runs, one must either setup the IDE to capture the logs being output by the web host or add a console output provider in ConfigureLogging.

In conclusion, addressing the absence of log output in Rider requires a methodical review of the application’s logging framework configurations, the chosen execution environment, and potentially the Rider’s settings. There are several good resources available for each of the logging frameworks which include extensive documentation on configuration and usage. For `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`, resources by Microsoft are helpful. The documentation for log4net and Serilog are also very useful, in addition to the various tutorials and blog posts that exist on this topic. By systematically going through the potential causes, and working through the issues, one can resolve any logging related display problems in Rider.
