Predicting with a trained RNN Sequential model involves understanding the model's architecture and appropriately preparing input data for prediction.  My experience working on time series forecasting for a financial institution highlighted the crucial role of input shaping in obtaining accurate predictions.  Incorrectly formatted input is the most common source of prediction errors, often masking genuine model training issues.

**1. Understanding Input Requirements**

RNNs, particularly those implemented sequentially, process data in a time-dependent manner. This means the model expects input data structured as sequences. Unlike static models where a single feature vector suffices, RNNs require a sequence of feature vectors representing the temporal evolution of the system being modeled.  The length of this sequence is critical; it must match the `timesteps` parameter used during model training.  If the model was trained on sequences of length 10, attempting prediction with a sequence of length 5 will result in errors, as will using a sequence of length 15.  Furthermore, the input's shape must precisely mirror that used in training, including the number of features per timestep.

**2. Preparing Input for Prediction**

The process involves transforming raw data into the correct shape expected by the trained model.  This frequently involves reshaping and potentially scaling the data.  Scaling, often achieved using methods like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler from scikit-learn, ensures consistent data ranges between training and prediction, enhancing the model's performance.  Crucially, the same scaler used during training *must* be applied to the prediction data.  Failing to do so will almost certainly yield inaccurate results.

**3. Code Examples Illustrating Prediction**

The following code examples use Keras, a common deep learning library I've extensively utilized. These illustrate different prediction scenarios and address potential pitfalls.

**Example 1: Single-step prediction**

This example demonstrates predicting the next single timestep, given a sequence of past timesteps.  This is common in time series forecasting where you aim to predict the next value given historical data.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'model' is a trained Keras Sequential RNN model
# Assume 'scaler' is the MinMaxScaler used during training

# Sample input data (reshape to match training data)
input_sequence = np.array([[0.2, 0.5, 0.1], [0.3, 0.7, 0.2], [0.4, 0.6, 0.3], [0.5, 0.8, 0.4], [0.6, 0.9, 0.5], [0.7, 0.8, 0.6], [0.8, 0.7, 0.7], [0.9, 0.6, 0.8], [0.7, 0.5, 0.9], [0.6, 0.4, 0.7]])
input_sequence = input_sequence.reshape(1, 10, 3) # Reshape to (samples, timesteps, features)


# Scale the input data using the same scaler used during training
scaled_input = scaler.transform(input_sequence.reshape(10,3))
scaled_input = scaled_input.reshape(1,10,3)


# Make the prediction
prediction = model.predict(scaled_input)

# Inverse transform to get the prediction in the original scale
predicted_value = scaler.inverse_transform(prediction.reshape(1,3))

print(f"Predicted value: {predicted_value}")
```

**Example 2: Multi-step prediction**

For forecasting multiple future steps, a recursive approach is often necessary.  The prediction for the next timestep becomes input for predicting the subsequent timestep, and so on.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (model and scaler loaded as in Example 1) ...

# Initial input sequence
input_sequence = np.array([[0.2, 0.5, 0.1], [0.3, 0.7, 0.2], [0.4, 0.6, 0.3], [0.5, 0.8, 0.4], [0.6, 0.9, 0.5], [0.7, 0.8, 0.6], [0.8, 0.7, 0.7], [0.9, 0.6, 0.8], [0.7, 0.5, 0.9], [0.6, 0.4, 0.7]])
input_sequence = input_sequence.reshape(1, 10, 3) # Reshape to (samples, timesteps, features)
scaled_input = scaler.transform(input_sequence.reshape(10,3))
scaled_input = scaled_input.reshape(1,10,3)

predictions = []
for i in range(5): # Predict 5 future timesteps
    prediction = model.predict(scaled_input)
    predictions.append(prediction)
    # Update input sequence for the next prediction:  Append the prediction and remove the oldest timestep
    new_input = np.concatenate((scaled_input[:,1:,:], prediction), axis=1)
    scaled_input = new_input


# Inverse transform predictions
inverse_transformed_predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(np.concatenate(predictions).reshape(-1,3))

print(f"Predicted values: {inverse_transformed_predictions}")
```


**Example 3: Handling variable-length sequences**

If your model was trained on variable-length sequences, you need to ensure the input sequences for prediction also adhere to this.  This typically involves padding shorter sequences to the maximum length encountered during training.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# ... (model and scaler loaded as in Example 1.  Assume model was trained on variable length sequences) ...

# Sample input sequences of varying lengths
input_sequences = [np.array([0.2, 0.5]), np.array([0.3, 0.7, 0.2, 0.1]), np.array([0.4, 0.6, 0.3, 0.8, 0.9])]

# Pad sequences to the maximum length encountered during training. Assume max_length = 5
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(input_sequences, maxlen=5, padding='post', dtype='float32')

# Reshape and scale (handling 2D array for each sequence)
reshaped_padded_sequences = []
for seq in padded_sequences:
  reshaped_padded_sequences.append(seq.reshape(1,5,1))

scaled_padded_sequences = []
for seq in reshaped_padded_sequences:
  scaled_padded_sequences.append(scaler.transform(seq.reshape(-1,1)))

# Stack array before prediction
scaled_padded_sequences = np.array(scaled_padded_sequences).reshape(-1,5,1)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(scaled_padded_sequences)

# Inverse transform predictions (adjust based on your scaler and number of features)
inverse_transformed_predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions.reshape(-1,1))

print(f"Predictions: {inverse_transformed_predictions}")
```


**4. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of RNNs and sequential models, I suggest reviewing the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  Explore textbooks on time series analysis and forecasting, focusing on the application of neural networks.  Finally, consider specialized literature on recurrent neural networks, addressing topics like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), as these are often used in sequential models.  These resources will provide the theoretical grounding and practical examples necessary for advanced applications.
