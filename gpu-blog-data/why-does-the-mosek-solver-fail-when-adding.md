The failure of the Mosek solver within a cvxpy framework when adding constraints to a large-scale problem (such as a 10,000-variable optimization) often stems from issues related to problem formulation, numerical stability, and solver limitations, rather than an inherent flaw in the solver itself.  In my experience working on portfolio optimization problems with similar scale,  I’ve encountered this repeatedly. The core issue usually lies in how the problem is constructed and presented to the solver, specifically concerning constraint structure and data conditioning.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Mosek, like other interior-point solvers, relies on iterative methods to find the optimal solution. These methods are sensitive to numerical issues.  A poorly formulated problem, especially a large one, can lead to ill-conditioning, resulting in numerical instability and solver failure.  This manifests as error messages indicating issues with the problem's feasibility or singularity.

The addition of constraints, particularly many constraints simultaneously, significantly impacts the problem’s structure.  New constraints can introduce redundancy, infeasibility, or exacerbate existing numerical instability.  Redundant constraints are not inherently problematic but increase computational burden unnecessarily.  Infeasible constraints render the entire problem unsolvable.  And ill-conditioned problems, characterized by a high condition number, lead to inaccurate or non-convergent solutions.  The problem's condition number relates to the sensitivity of the solution to small changes in the problem data. A high condition number suggests that even minor numerical errors can significantly impact the solution accuracy, leading to solver failure.

Furthermore, Mosek's internal algorithms have limitations.  While powerful, they're not immune to problems with highly complex structures or severe numerical instability.   Memory limitations also play a role in extremely large-scale problems.  While Mosek is generally efficient, exceeding available memory can cause crashes or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, diagnosing Mosek's failure requires a systematic approach: examine the problem's structure for redundancy, check for potential infeasibility, analyze the condition number of the problem matrices, and assess memory usage.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate with three examples, focusing on common pitfalls:

**Example 1: Redundant Constraints:**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np
import mosek

# Problem with redundant constraints
n = 10000
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = np.random.rand(n, n)  # Example matrix - replace with your actual data
b = np.random.rand(n)     # Example vector - replace with your actual data

objective = cp.Minimize(cp.sum_squares(A @ x - b))  # Example objective

constraints = [cp.sum(x) == 1, cp.sum(x) <= 1] #Redundant constraints

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

try:
    problem.solve(solver=mosek.MOSEK_SOLVER_NAME)
    print("Solution found:", x.value)
except cp.SolverError as e:
    print("Solver error:", e)

```

This example shows redundant constraints (`cp.sum(x) == 1` and `cp.sum(x) <= 1`). While not directly causing solver failure, these increase computational time and potentially make the problem less numerically stable.  Removing the redundant constraint improves performance.


**Example 2: Ill-conditioned Problem:**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np
import mosek

#Problem with ill-conditioned data.
n = 10000
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = np.random.rand(n, n) * 1e10  #Ill-conditioned matrix - large values
b = np.random.rand(n)

objective = cp.Minimize(cp.sum_squares(A @ x - b))

constraints = [x >= 0, cp.sum(x) == 1]

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

try:
    problem.solve(solver=mosek.MOSEK_SOLVER_NAME)
    print("Solution found:", x.value)
except cp.SolverError as e:
    print("Solver error:", e)
```

Here,  the matrix `A` is scaled to have very large entries. This can lead to ill-conditioning, resulting in numerical instability during the solver's iterations.  Scaling the data appropriately or using regularization techniques can often mitigate this.


**Example 3: Infeasible Constraints:**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np
import mosek

#Problem with infeasible constraints
n = 10000
x = cp.Variable(n)
constraints = [x >= 1, cp.sum(x) == 0.5] #Infeasible: x >= 1 and sum(x) = 0.5 are mutually exclusive

objective = cp.Minimize(cp.sum(x))

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

try:
    problem.solve(solver=mosek.MOSEK_SOLVER_NAME)
    print("Solution found:", x.value)
except cp.SolverError as e:
    print("Solver error:", e)
```

This demonstrates mutually exclusive constraints where no feasible solution exists.  Careful examination of the constraints is crucial to avoid this.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To effectively debug these issues, I recommend consulting the Mosek documentation, particularly the sections on error codes and numerical stability.  Understanding the underlying algorithms used by interior-point solvers is also beneficial.  Furthermore, exploring techniques for preconditioning and regularization can significantly improve the numerical stability of large-scale optimization problems.  Finally, examining the problem's structure and constraints for potential redundancies and infeasibilities is a crucial first step.  Learning to analyze the condition number of matrices involved is also highly beneficial.
