Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, by their sequential nature, often produce a sequence of output vectors. These outputs are not monolithic; each vector corresponds to a specific point in the input sequence, and we may require specialized operations on each of these resulting vectors. I’ve frequently encountered this need when building attention mechanisms or implementing sequence-to-sequence models where individual time step representations necessitate distinct processing. The core challenge lies in deconstructing the LSTM's multi-dimensional output tensor into a manageable structure for per-vector computations, leveraging TensorFlow’s functionality within Keras.

The typical output of an LSTM layer in Keras, assuming you have set `return_sequences=True`, is a 3D tensor with the shape `(batch_size, timesteps, units)`, where `batch_size` denotes the number of samples processed in parallel, `timesteps` is the length of the input sequence, and `units` represents the dimensionality of the hidden state (or number of LSTM units). Accessing individual vectors requires iterating through the `timesteps` dimension, effectively slicing the tensor along this axis. This process needs to be done within the TensorFlow graph to be compatible with training and backpropagation. We accomplish this by employing Keras’ functional API combined with custom lambda layers or TensorFlow’s lower level tensor manipulation operations, typically within a `tf.function`.

The first approach involves using Keras’ `Lambda` layer and TensorFlow’s `tf.map_fn` to perform operations on each vector separately.  This offers flexibility and maintains a clear separation of concerns between the sequential nature of the LSTM and the subsequent computation. `tf.map_fn` is ideal here as it efficiently applies a given function to each element of a tensor along a specified axis. The custom function that `tf.map_fn` executes becomes our target, in which we define the desired per-vector computation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input, Lambda
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def vector_operation(vector):
  # Example: Scale each vector by its L2 norm
  norm = tf.norm(vector, ord='euclidean')
  return vector / (norm + 1e-6) # adding small value for numerical stability

def lstm_with_separate_vector_processing(input_shape, lstm_units):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    lstm_output = LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
    processed_output = Lambda(lambda x: tf.map_fn(vector_operation, x))(lstm_output)
    return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=processed_output)

# Example usage:
input_shape = (10, 20) # 10 timesteps, 20 features per timestep
lstm_units = 32
model = lstm_with_separate_vector_processing(input_shape, lstm_units)
model.summary()

# Dummy Data
import numpy as np
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 10, 20)
output = model.predict(dummy_input)
print("Output Shape: ", output.shape)
```

In this first example, `vector_operation` is defined to compute the L2 norm of each vector and then divide the vector by this norm. The small constant `1e-6` is added to avoid division-by-zero issues. The Lambda layer utilizes `tf.map_fn`, taking each output vector from the LSTM and applying the `vector_operation` to it. This results in a tensor where every output vector is normalized. The `model.summary()` displays the structure of the model and the output shape indicates we are successfully retaining the sequence dimension.

Alternatively, we can use TensorFlow’s `tf.split` function in conjunction with `tf.stack`. Although less elegant than the previous approach, this direct approach provides complete control over manipulation within the TensorFlow graph, as splitting and stacking are fundamental tensor operations. This method explicitly deconstructs the 3D tensor, operates, and reassembles it.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input, Lambda
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model


def vector_operation_tf_split(vector):
  # Example: Add a trainable bias to each vector.
  bias = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(vector.shape), trainable=True)
  return vector + bias

def lstm_with_separate_vector_processing_tf_split(input_shape, lstm_units):
  inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
  lstm_output = LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
  def process_sequence(lstm_tensor):
      split_vectors = tf.split(lstm_tensor, num_or_size_splits=lstm_tensor.shape[1], axis=1)
      processed_vectors = [vector_operation_tf_split(tf.squeeze(vec, axis=1)) for vec in split_vectors]
      return tf.stack(processed_vectors, axis=1)

  processed_output = Lambda(process_sequence)(lstm_output)
  return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=processed_output)

# Example usage:
input_shape = (10, 20)
lstm_units = 32
model = lstm_with_separate_vector_processing_tf_split(input_shape, lstm_units)
model.summary()

# Dummy Data
import numpy as np
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 10, 20)
output = model.predict(dummy_input)
print("Output Shape: ", output.shape)

```
In this second example,  `tf.split` divides the sequence along the `timesteps` axis into a list of vectors. The `vector_operation_tf_split` now adds a trainable bias to each vector. The `tf.squeeze` operation is necessary as split creates tensors with an unnecessary dimension of size 1 along the split axis. `tf.stack` then reassembles the processed vectors back into the original tensor shape. The trainable bias here means that our processing is learning something. The printed shape ensures the sequence is maintained across the layer.

A third approach is to combine slicing using a Keras layer with `tf.function` decorated function. This lets us utilize TensorFlow’s efficiency within the Keras model. Although it involves a bit more syntax, this method can be beneficial when we need to perform more elaborate computations on a per-vector basis, or when `tf.map_fn` isn't sufficient.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input, Layer
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

class SeparateVectorProcessing(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(SeparateVectorProcessing, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    @tf.function
    def call(self, inputs):
        outputs = []
        for i in tf.range(tf.shape(inputs)[1]):
            vector = inputs[:, i, :]
            # Example: Perform a simple dense operation on each vector
            dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vector.shape[-1])
            processed_vector = dense(vector)
            outputs.append(processed_vector)
        return tf.stack(outputs, axis=1)

def lstm_with_separate_vector_processing_layer(input_shape, lstm_units):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    lstm_output = LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
    processed_output = SeparateVectorProcessing()(lstm_output)
    return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=processed_output)

# Example usage:
input_shape = (10, 20)
lstm_units = 32
model = lstm_with_separate_vector_processing_layer(input_shape, lstm_units)
model.summary()

# Dummy Data
import numpy as np
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 10, 20)
output = model.predict(dummy_input)
print("Output Shape: ", output.shape)
```

In this final example, I’ve defined a custom `SeparateVectorProcessing` Keras layer which handles processing. The layer's `call` method has been decorated with `@tf.function`, which means TensorFlow can optimise its execution. Inside the loop, each vector is extracted from the input tensor. A simple dense layer applies a learned transformation to each vector.  The processed vectors are then stacked along the `timesteps` axis with `tf.stack`, reassembling the sequence. The model structure and output shape again display the sequence is maintained after processing.

For further learning, I’d recommend exploring TensorFlow’s official documentation regarding `tf.map_fn`, `tf.split`, and `tf.stack`. The Keras documentation on custom layers can aid in creating more specialized architectures.  Books on deep learning and natural language processing often contain sections dedicated to sequence modelling and manipulation of recurrent network outputs, and provide more theoretical background. Finally, examining open-source implementations of sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms, particularly those using TensorFlow and Keras, can provide significant practical insight into handling LSTM outputs in this way. Each of these methods allow for flexible, distinct per-vector computation, and choosing the appropriate approach is dependent on the task at hand and the specific computations required.
