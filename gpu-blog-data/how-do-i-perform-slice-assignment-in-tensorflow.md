TensorFlow 2.0's approach to slice assignment differs significantly from NumPy's straightforward methodology.  The key fact to understand is that TensorFlow tensors, by default, are immutable.  This immutability is crucial for TensorFlow's graph execution model and its ability to optimize computations. Therefore, direct in-place modification using slice assignment, as commonly practiced in NumPy, isn't directly supported.  Instead, TensorFlow necessitates creating a new tensor containing the modified values.  This approach, while seemingly less efficient, allows for better optimization and parallelization during execution. My experience debugging performance issues in large-scale TensorFlow models highlighted the importance of understanding this fundamental difference.

**1. Explanation of TensorFlow 2.0 Slice Assignment**

The core principle revolves around utilizing TensorFlow's array manipulation functions to generate a new tensor reflecting the desired changes.  We accomplish this by constructing a tensor representing the updated slice and then employing tensor concatenation or scattering operations to integrate this modified slice into the original tensor. This process avoids directly modifying the original tensor, upholding its immutability.  The choice between concatenation and scattering depends on the specifics of the modification: concatenation is suitable for replacing an entire slice, whereas scattering is more versatile for selectively updating elements within a slice.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Replacing an entire slice using `tf.concat`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Slice to be replaced
slice_to_replace = tf.slice(original_tensor, [1, 0], [1, 3]) # Selects row 1

# New slice values
new_slice = tf.constant([[10, 11, 12]])

# Concatenate to create a new tensor
updated_tensor = tf.concat([original_tensor[:1, :], new_slice, original_tensor[2:, :]], axis=0)

print(f"Original Tensor:\n{original_tensor.numpy()}")
print(f"Updated Tensor:\n{updated_tensor.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates replacing the second row (index 1) of the original tensor. `tf.slice` extracts the row to be replaced.  `tf.concat` then joins the parts of the original tensor before and after the replaced slice with the `new_slice` along the axis 0, creating a new tensor. Note the reliance on NumPy's `.numpy()` for printing the tensor values; this is for display purposes only; the core operations remain within the TensorFlow graph.  This approach is efficient when replacing complete slices.

**Example 2: Selective updates within a slice using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Indices to update within a slice
indices = tf.constant([[1, 1], [1, 2]]) # Update element [1,1] and [1,2]

# Values for update
updates = tf.constant([15, 16])

# Update the tensor using tensor scatter
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(original_tensor, indices, updates)

print(f"Original Tensor:\n{original_tensor.numpy()}")
print(f"Updated Tensor:\n{updated_tensor.numpy()}")
```

Here, we illustrate selective updates within a slice using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  `indices` specifies the coordinates (row, column) of the elements to modify within the original tensor. `updates` provides the new values. The function efficiently updates only the specified elements, producing a new tensor. This method is far more flexible than concatenation when dealing with scattered modifications.  Remember that `indices` are expressed relative to the original tensor, not a specific slice.

**Example 3:  Handling multi-dimensional slices and broadcasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

# Slice to modify
slice_to_modify = tf.slice(original_tensor, [0, 0, 0], [2, 1, 2]) # Select first column of both matrices

# Update values with broadcasting
update_values = tf.constant([[10], [20]])

updated_slice = slice_to_modify + update_values

#Concatenate to construct the new tensor. This requires more complex slicing to manage the dimensions properly.
updated_tensor = tf.concat([updated_slice, tf.slice(original_tensor, [0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2])], axis=1)

print(f"Original Tensor:\n{original_tensor.numpy()}")
print(f"Updated Tensor:\n{updated_tensor.numpy()}")
```

This example showcases slice assignment within a three-dimensional tensor.  The example demonstrates updating only the first column of each matrix in the original tensor by adding values specified in `update_values`.  Note the careful use of `tf.slice` and `tf.concat` to manage the dimensions correctly during the update and reassembly. Broadcasting is leveraged to add the `update_values` to the extracted slice efficiently.  The complexity underscores the importance of clearly defining the slice and its interaction with broadcasting and concatenation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation functions, particularly those related to slicing, concatenation, and scattering.   Explore examples related to tensor reshaping and broadcasting. A solid grasp of linear algebra principles and multi-dimensional array manipulation is also highly beneficial. Finally, consider working through several tutorials focusing on practical applications of these operations in different machine learning contexts.  These combined resources will provide a robust foundation for efficient and accurate slice assignment within TensorFlow 2.0.  Addressing potential performance bottlenecks will necessitate a practical understanding of these operations' computational costs within a graph context.
