TensorFlow's logistic regression, while conceptually straightforward, demands meticulous attention to tensor formatting to ensure correct model execution and performance.  My experience building and deploying large-scale recommendation systems underscored the criticality of this aspect; improperly formatted tensors frequently led to silent failures or wildly inaccurate predictions, often masked by seemingly benign error messages.  The core issue revolves around understanding TensorFlow's expectation of input data structure, specifically the dimensionality and data type of both feature tensors and label tensors.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's logistic regression expects two primary inputs: a feature tensor (X) and a label tensor (y). The feature tensor represents the independent variables, each row representing a single data point, and each column representing a feature.  Crucially, the number of columns in X must match the number of weights in the model.  The label tensor (y) holds the dependent variable (the outcome), typically binary in logistic regression (0 or 1).  Its shape should be a one-dimensional vector with the same number of rows as X, directly corresponding to the feature rows.

Data type consistency is equally crucial. TensorFlow's operations are optimized for specific data types (typically `float32` for numerical computation).  Inconsistent data types across tensors can lead to type errors or unexpected numerical behavior.  Furthermore, any missing values within the feature tensor must be handled proactively, usually through imputation strategies (e.g., mean imputation, median imputation, or more sophisticated techniques like k-NN imputation) before feeding the data to TensorFlow.  Categorical features require one-hot encoding or other suitable transformations to be represented numerically.

Finally, the shape of the tensors is paramount.  Incorrect dimensions will invariably result in shape mismatches during matrix multiplications, causing TensorFlow to throw exceptions.  Therefore, meticulous attention to both the row and column dimensions, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional input data, is indispensable.  Employing techniques like `tf.reshape()` to explicitly define the tensor shape before passing it to the model is often a preventative measure I've found invaluable.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Binary Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
features = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1]

# Convert to TensorFlow tensors and specify data types explicitly
features_tensor = tf.constant(features, dtype=tf.float32)
labels_tensor = tf.constant(labels, dtype=tf.int32) # int32 suitable for binary classification

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Single neuron for binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(features_tensor, labels_tensor, epochs=100)
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a straightforward logistic regression with two features.  Notice the explicit data type declaration for both `features_tensor` and `labels_tensor`.  `tf.int32` is suitable for binary classification labels.  The `binary_crossentropy` loss function is appropriate for binary classification problems.

**Example 2: Handling Missing Values**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data with missing values (represented by NaN)
features = [[1.0, 2.0], [np.nan, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0], [7.0, np.nan]]
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1]

# Impute missing values using mean imputation
mean_feature1 = np.nanmean(features, axis=0)[0]
mean_feature2 = np.nanmean(features, axis=0)[1]
features_imputed = [[x if not np.isnan(x) else mean_feature1 for x in row] for row in features]
features_imputed = [[row[0], x if not np.isnan(x) else mean_feature2] for row in features_imputed]


# Convert to TensorFlow tensors
features_tensor = tf.constant(features_imputed, dtype=tf.float32)
labels_tensor = tf.constant(labels, dtype=tf.int32)

# ... (rest of the model definition and training is the same as Example 1)
```

*Commentary:*  This example shows how to handle missing values (`NaN`) using mean imputation before creating the TensorFlow tensors.  Note the use of NumPy's `nanmean` function for robust mean calculation, ignoring `NaN` values.  More sophisticated imputation methods would be preferable for larger datasets.


**Example 3:  One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Features**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Sample data with a categorical feature
features = [['red', 2.0], ['green', 4.0], ['blue', 6.0], ['red', 8.0]]
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1]

# One-hot encode the categorical feature using scikit-learn
encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False)
encoded_features = encoder.fit_transform(np.array([feature[0] for feature in features]).reshape(-1, 1))

# Combine encoded features with numerical features
features_combined = np.concatenate((encoded_features, np.array([feature[1] for feature in features]).reshape(-1,1)), axis=1)


# Convert to TensorFlow tensors
features_tensor = tf.constant(features_combined, dtype=tf.float32)
labels_tensor = tf.constant(labels, dtype=tf.int32)


# ... (rest of the model definition and training is adapted accordingly)
```

*Commentary:* This example uses scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` to transform a categorical feature ('red', 'green', 'blue') into a numerical representation suitable for TensorFlow.  Notice the concatenation of the one-hot encoded features with the existing numerical feature.  The `handle_unknown='ignore'` parameter is important for handling unseen categories during inference.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for in-depth explanations of tensor manipulation, data preprocessing techniques, and model building best practices.  Explore the TensorFlow tutorials, specifically those related to logistic regression and data preprocessing.  Familiarize yourself with NumPy's array manipulation functions, as they are frequently used in conjunction with TensorFlow for data preprocessing.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra fundamentals will also greatly assist in comprehending the underlying mathematical operations within logistic regression and TensorFlow's tensor computations.  Lastly, consider reviewing resources on data cleaning and preprocessing, focusing on methods for handling missing values and transforming categorical data.
