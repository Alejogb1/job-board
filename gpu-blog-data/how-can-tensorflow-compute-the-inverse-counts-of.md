TensorFlow doesn't directly offer a single function to compute inverse label counts.  The process involves manipulating the output of standard counting operations.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects frequently required this type of calculation for tasks like weighted sampling and class balancing during training.  The challenge lies in efficiently handling potentially sparse label distributions and large datasets.  The most effective approach leverages TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities coupled with careful consideration of data types and potential numerical instability.

**1. Explanation:**

The core idea is to first obtain the label counts, then invert these counts, and finally handle potential zero counts (which would lead to division by zero errors).  Standard TensorFlow operations like `tf.unique_with_counts` are used to efficiently count the occurrences of each unique label. Subsequently, we create a tensor containing the inverse of these counts.  Careful handling is needed to manage labels with zero counts, for instance, by adding a small smoothing constant (Laplace smoothing) or replacing zeros with a predefined value (e.g., the reciprocal of the total number of samples).

This approach avoids explicit looping over the data which is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Tensor manipulation ensures vectorized computations, thus maximizing performance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Inverse Count Calculation with Laplace Smoothing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def inverse_label_counts_laplace(labels, smoothing_constant=1e-6):
  """Computes inverse label counts with Laplace smoothing.

  Args:
    labels: A 1D TensorFlow tensor of integer labels.
    smoothing_constant: A small constant added to counts to avoid division by zero.

  Returns:
    A 1D TensorFlow tensor containing the inverse counts, or None if input is invalid.
  """
  if not isinstance(labels, tf.Tensor) or labels.shape.rank != 1:
    print("Error: Input 'labels' must be a 1D TensorFlow tensor.")
    return None

  unique_labels, _, counts = tf.unique_with_counts(labels)
  inverse_counts = tf.math.reciprocal(counts + smoothing_constant)
  return inverse_counts

# Example usage:
labels = tf.constant([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])
inverse_counts = inverse_label_counts_laplace(labels)
print(f"Labels: {labels.numpy()}")
print(f"Inverse Counts: {inverse_counts.numpy()}")

```

This function leverages `tf.unique_with_counts` to efficiently count unique labels.  Laplace smoothing (adding `smoothing_constant`) prevents division by zero errors. The function includes input validation to ensure robustness.


**Example 2: Handling Zero Counts with a Default Value:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def inverse_label_counts_default(labels, default_value=1.0):
    """Computes inverse label counts, replacing zeros with a default value.

    Args:
      labels: A 1D TensorFlow tensor of integer labels.
      default_value: The value to replace zero counts with.

    Returns:
      A 1D TensorFlow tensor containing the inverse counts, or None if input is invalid.
    """
    if not isinstance(labels, tf.Tensor) or labels.shape.rank != 1:
        print("Error: Input 'labels' must be a 1D TensorFlow tensor.")
        return None

    unique_labels, _, counts = tf.unique_with_counts(labels)
    inverse_counts = tf.where(tf.equal(counts, 0), tf.constant([default_value], dtype=counts.dtype), tf.math.reciprocal(counts))
    return inverse_counts

# Example usage:
labels = tf.constant([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4])
inverse_counts = inverse_label_counts_default(labels, default_value=0.1)
print(f"Labels: {labels.numpy()}")
print(f"Inverse Counts: {inverse_counts.numpy()}")

```

This example demonstrates an alternative approach: replacing zero counts with a predefined `default_value` using `tf.where`.  This is useful when a strict inverse relationship isn't always required.


**Example 3:  Mapping Inverse Counts back to Original Labels:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def inverse_label_counts_mapping(labels):
    """Computes inverse label counts and maps them back to original labels.

    Args:
      labels: A 1D TensorFlow tensor of integer labels.

    Returns:
      A 1D TensorFlow tensor with the inverse counts mapped to their corresponding original labels, or None if input is invalid.  Returns a tensor of the same length as the input labels.
    """
    if not isinstance(labels, tf.Tensor) or labels.shape.rank != 1:
        print("Error: Input 'labels' must be a 1D TensorFlow tensor.")
        return None

    unique_labels, indices, counts = tf.unique_with_counts(labels)
    inverse_counts = tf.math.reciprocal(tf.cast(counts, tf.float32) + tf.constant(1e-6, dtype=tf.float32))  # Laplace smoothing
    inverse_counts_mapped = tf.gather(inverse_counts, indices)
    return inverse_counts_mapped


# Example usage:
labels = tf.constant([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])
inverse_counts_mapped = inverse_label_counts_mapping(labels)
print(f"Labels: {labels.numpy()}")
print(f"Inverse Counts Mapped: {inverse_counts_mapped.numpy()}")
```

This function extends the previous examples by mapping the calculated inverse counts back to their original label positions using `tf.gather`.  This is crucial for applications where the original label order needs to be preserved.  Note the use of `tf.cast` to ensure proper data type handling during division.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow documentation: Thoroughly covers tensor manipulation and numerical operations.  Pay close attention to the sections on `tf.unique_with_counts`, `tf.gather`, and `tf.math` functions.
*  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook:  A strong foundation in linear algebra is beneficial for understanding the underlying mathematical operations involved in tensor manipulation.
*  A practical guide to TensorFlow for deep learning:  Learning resources focused on TensorFlow's usage in machine learning will provide further context.  This helps to understand the application of inverse label counts in practical machine learning scenarios.
