The assertion that Keras and TensorFlow exclusively leverage GPU parallelism for *batch* processing is inaccurate.  While batch processing undeniably maximizes GPU utilization, both frameworks offer mechanisms to accelerate single predictions through GPU acceleration, albeit with varying degrees of efficiency and complexity. My experience optimizing deep learning models for high-throughput inference applications, particularly in the context of real-time systems, has highlighted the nuances of this process.  The key lies in understanding how TensorFlow's execution engine handles operations and how Keras interfaces with it.

**1. Explanation of GPU Acceleration for Single Predictions:**

TensorFlow's underlying execution engine, typically XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra), is designed for efficient computation.  While XLA excels at compiling large graphs of operations for optimal execution on GPUs, it's not intrinsically limited to batch operations.  A single prediction can still be efficiently executed on a GPU provided the computation graph is properly constructed and optimized.  Keras, as a higher-level API, simplifies this process, but its efficiency depends on the configuration of the underlying TensorFlow session and the nature of the model.  Simply placing a model onto a GPU doesn't guarantee optimal single-prediction performance; careful consideration of data transfer and computational overhead is crucial.  Significant overhead can arise from transferring a single input sample to the GPU, executing the prediction, and transferring the result back to the CPU. This overhead can often negate the benefits of GPU acceleration unless carefully managed.

The most efficient approach hinges on minimizing data transfer between the CPU and GPU.  Strategies include keeping the model resident in GPU memory (which necessitates considering memory capacity constraints for large models) and pre-allocating GPU memory for input and output tensors. The choice of the backend (e.g., CUDA) and its configuration within TensorFlow also plays a pivotal role in determining performance.  Moreover, the model's architecture itself influences the potential for GPU acceleration.  Models with highly parallelizable layers (like convolutional layers) benefit more from GPU acceleration than those with predominantly sequential operations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Single Prediction with GPU Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Ensure GPU availability.  This check is crucial.
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') # Load pre-trained model

# Ensure model is on GPU.  This step is not always implicit.
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Specify GPU device; adjust if necessary.
    input_data = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]]) # Example input shape needs to match your model input shape
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)

print(prediction)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the fundamental steps: verifying GPU availability, loading a pre-trained model, explicitly assigning the operation to the GPU using `tf.device`, and performing the prediction.  The crucial element is the `tf.device('/GPU:0')` context manager, ensuring that the prediction occurs on the GPU.  Failure to explicitly specify the device often results in the computation falling back to the CPU.  Note that the input data must be formatted to match the model's expected input shape.

**Example 2:  Using tf.function for Compilation and Optimization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def predict_on_gpu(model, input_data):
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        return model.predict(input_data)

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
input_data = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])
prediction = predict_on_gpu(model, input_data)
print(prediction)
```

**Commentary:**  This improves efficiency by using `tf.function`.  This decorator compiles the prediction function into a TensorFlow graph, allowing XLA to optimize the computation for the GPU.  This compilation step often results in significant performance gains, particularly for repeated calls with the same model architecture.  The overhead of compilation occurs only once, making subsequent predictions faster.  It's important to ensure that the model and input data types are consistent with what the model expects.

**Example 3:  Handling Batch Size of 1 (Implicit Batching)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
input_data = np.expand_dims(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), axis=0) # Adds a batch dimension
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print(prediction)
```

**Commentary:**  While seemingly counterintuitive, explicitly creating a batch of size one can sometimes improve performance.  The underlying TensorFlow execution engine might be better optimized for processing batches, even if the batch size is just one. This approach essentially leverages the optimized pathways designed for batch processing. This method avoids the overhead associated with transferring individual data samples.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is indispensable for understanding the nuances of GPU usage and optimization.  Deep learning textbooks covering TensorFlow's internals and efficient GPU programming techniques offer valuable insights.  Research papers focusing on optimizing deep learning inference pipelines, especially those dealing with single-prediction scenarios, provide advanced strategies and benchmarks.


In conclusion, while batch processing is typically preferred for maximizing GPU utilization in Keras and TensorFlow, the acceleration of single predictions on GPUs is achievable. The key lies in careful model placement, optimized function compilation using `tf.function`, and occasionally, the strategic use of batch size one.  Effective GPU acceleration in single-prediction scenarios demands a detailed understanding of TensorFlow's underlying execution engine and meticulous attention to data transfer and computational overhead.  Furthermore, proper error handling, checking GPU availability, and selecting the correct device context are essential for ensuring successful and efficient GPU utilization.
