The `ImportError: cannot import name 'keras' from 'tensorflow'` signals a fundamental incompatibility between how TensorFlow and Keras are accessed, primarily stemming from changes in their integration starting with TensorFlow 2.x. This error indicates that the Keras API is not accessible as a direct submodule of the `tensorflow` package using the older syntax. In TensorFlow 1.x, Keras was often imported as `import keras`, a separate entity. However, with TensorFlow 2.0 and onward, Keras was deeply integrated as the primary high-level API, and the correct syntax for most common uses became `import tensorflow.keras`.

My experience debugging deep learning models and their dependencies has shown me that resolving this import error usually revolves around understanding this change and adjusting import statements accordingly. The crucial aspect is to align import practices with the version of TensorFlow being used. Misconfigurations in the environment, especially those related to mismatched TensorFlow versions and their corresponding Keras integrations, are also frequent sources of this error. Furthermore, certain pre-built or community packages might still attempt the deprecated import style, thus generating this error when executed with TensorFlow 2+.

The error occurs because the Python interpreter, instructed to look for a `keras` name directly within the `tensorflow` module's namespace, does not find it; it has not been declared there as of TensorFlow 2.0. Keras has shifted internally as a sub-module within the framework. The core solution is not about installing or re-installing packages (unless you're genuinely using an older version of TensorFlow). It is about adjusting the import statements.

Here are three examples demonstrating common scenarios and the corresponding fixes:

**Example 1: Basic Model Building**

Let's say I was attempting to build a simple neural network using the older Keras import. Here's how I might have written it and the error I encountered:

```python
# Incorrect import (TensorFlow 2.x and later)
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.layers import Dense, Input
from keras.models import Model

input_layer = Input(shape=(10,))
dense_layer = Dense(units=5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)

print(model.summary()) # Executes if the import statements succeed

```

This code snippet using the old `from keras...` import statements results in the `ImportError: cannot import name 'layers' from 'tensorflow'`, as `keras` is not an accessible name in the main namespace. To resolve this, I would modify the code to import the modules via `tensorflow.keras`:

```python
# Correct import (TensorFlow 2.x and later)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

input_layer = Input(shape=(10,))
dense_layer = Dense(units=5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)

print(model.summary()) # This now executes without import errors

```

By changing the imports to `from tensorflow.keras...`, I explicitly instruct Python to find the `layers` and `models` modules within TensorFlow's integrated Keras API. The code now builds a basic neural network model using the `tensorflow` framework.

**Example 2: Using a Pre-trained Model**

Suppose I wanted to use a pre-trained model from Keras, such as ResNet, and encountered a similar import error. Below is the erroneous code:

```python
# Incorrect import (TensorFlow 2.x and later)
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.applications import ResNet50

resnet_model = ResNet50(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_shape=(224,224,3))
print(resnet_model.summary()) # Executed if imports succeed

```

This code would again raise the import error because the `keras.applications` is not available in that location. To correct it, the code should be modified like this:

```python
# Correct import (TensorFlow 2.x and later)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

resnet_model = ResNet50(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_shape=(224,224,3))
print(resnet_model.summary()) # Correctly instantiates the model.

```

The change to `from tensorflow.keras.applications...` fixes the problem, enabling me to access and utilize the ResNet50 model within TensorFlow's unified framework.

**Example 3: Utilizing Optimizers and Loss Functions**

Suppose I was attempting to utilize optimizers or loss functions available within Keras, as below:

```python
# Incorrect import (TensorFlow 2.x and later)
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = CategoricalCrossentropy()

print(optimizer) # Executes if the import statements succeed

```

This attempt, mirroring previous examples, fails due to incorrect import locations. Again, I resolve it by correctly importing these classes as sub-modules of TensorFlow:

```python
# Correct import (TensorFlow 2.x and later)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = CategoricalCrossentropy()

print(optimizer) # Successful import and print

```
The corrected code now imports Adam optimizer and CategoricalCrossentropy loss function from `tensorflow.keras.optimizers` and `tensorflow.keras.losses` respectively.

In all three cases, the solution was the same: updating the import statements to align with TensorFlow 2.0’s integration of Keras. The error disappears, and the rest of the code can function as intended.

When encountering such errors, it is important to first confirm the TensorFlow version being used, as this will dictate the correct import syntax. This information is typically available from the output of a command like `pip show tensorflow`. If using a virtual environment, it’s crucial to check if the activated environment has the intended TensorFlow version.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that community packages and pre-built scripts may have not been updated for TensorFlow 2.x integration of Keras. In such scenarios, either the problematic package should be updated if available, or, depending on usage, the problematic imports will need to be adapted to be consistent with `tensorflow.keras` if code modifications are possible. The latter is often the only viable solution for non-maintained or un-updated repositories.

As for resource recommendations, I suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, which provides thorough guides on Keras integration and the proper import strategies. Also, looking into online tutorials and examples that focus on building deep learning models using TensorFlow 2.x will help reinforce appropriate syntax practices. It would be beneficial to read through several GitHub repositories containing TensorFlow projects to examine how other engineers and researchers approach the imports, especially those that include both TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x legacy code examples. Finally, being proficient in Python's import mechanism is often fundamental when debugging these kinds of import issues as they are not specific to TensorFlow or Keras, but to Python modules, submodules, and namespaces in general.

By paying close attention to the `tensorflow.keras` namespace and consulting reliable documentation, one can quickly resolve this common import error and proceed with building and training deep learning models effectively. These adjustments will become natural with continued practice, particularly as they reflect the current framework standards for TensorFlow.
