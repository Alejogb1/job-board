The absence of a directly analogous class in LibTorch mirroring PyTorch's `torch.distributions.Normal` necessitates a composite approach to achieve similar functionality. I've encountered this need several times while porting research code from Python to C++, specifically when dealing with probabilistic models requiring explicit control over normal distributions within a custom C++ environment lacking Python's dynamism. LibTorch, unlike PyTorch, emphasizes low-level tensor operations and lacks a dedicated distributions library. Therefore, generating samples, computing probabilities, or calculating log probabilities from a normal distribution requires building these functionalities using basic tensor operations and mathematical functions provided by the library.

The core challenge lies in implementing the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF), or their logarithmic counterparts, alongside the sampling procedure. PyTorch's `torch.distributions.Normal` encapsulates all of these operations within a single class. LibTorch, however, requires explicitly crafting this functionality. This involves utilizing the standard mathematical functions available in the `<cmath>` header alongside LibTorch's tensor manipulations. For instance, calculating the PDF requires exponentiation, square roots, and squaring operations, all of which are supported by LibTorch's tensor API and the `<cmath>` library. Sampling, on the other hand, generally involves generating standard normal random variables and then scaling and shifting them according to the desired mean and standard deviation. This also requires an external mechanism for random number generation which does not come pre-packaged within LibTorch itself.

The following C++ code examples illustrate this process. Note that they assume the `torch/torch.h` header is already included, along with `iostream` and `<cmath>`.

**Example 1: Generating Normal Samples**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <random>
#include <cmath>

torch::Tensor sample_normal(torch::Tensor mean, torch::Tensor std, int num_samples) {
  // Error checking: Ensure mean and std have compatible dimensions and type
  if(mean.sizes() != std.sizes() || mean.scalar_type() != std::scalar_type()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Mean and standard deviation tensors must have the same size and data type.");
  }
  if(!mean.is_floating_point()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Mean and standard deviation tensors must be of floating-point type.");
  }
  if(std::lt(0.0f).any().item<bool>()){ // std contains negative values.
    throw std::runtime_error("Standard deviation cannot be negative.");
  }
  // Define a random engine and normal distribution for random generation
  std::random_device rd;
  std::mt19937 generator(rd());
  std::normal_distribution<> normal(0.0, 1.0);

  // Generate random samples from standard normal distribution
  std::vector<float> samples_vec;
  for(int i = 0; i < num_samples * mean.numel(); ++i)
      samples_vec.push_back(normal(generator));
  
  torch::Tensor samples = torch::from_blob(samples_vec.data(), {num_samples, mean.numel()}, torch::dtype(mean.scalar_type())).clone();
  samples = samples.reshape({num_samples}.insert(samples.sizes().begin()+1, 1));


  // Scale and shift samples to desired mean and standard deviation
  samples = (samples * std) + mean;

  return samples;
}

int main() {
  torch::Tensor mean = torch::tensor({2.0f, 3.0f});
  torch::Tensor std = torch::tensor({1.0f, 0.5f});
  int num_samples = 5;
  torch::Tensor samples = sample_normal(mean, std, num_samples);
  std::cout << "Generated samples: " << samples << std::endl;
  
  mean = torch::tensor({{2.0f, 3.0f}, {4.0f, 5.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  std  = torch::tensor({{1.0f, 0.5f}, {2.0f, 1.5f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  num_samples = 3;
  samples = sample_normal(mean, std, num_samples);
  std::cout << "Generated samples with a higher dimensional mean and std: " << samples << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how to draw samples from a normal distribution given a mean and standard deviation tensor. It uses the `<random>` library to generate random standard normal samples. These samples are then scaled and shifted using broadcasting to match the provided mean and standard deviation. Note the extensive error checking I've included; failing to do so will likely cause runtime crashes or spurious numerical results. The usage of `torch::from_blob` with a specified data type ensures the samples are created with the same floating-point type as the mean and standard deviation tensor. The reshaping operation ensures proper broadcasting across the dimensions of the input mean and standard deviation. The `clone()` is necessary as the underlying data of the tensor returned from `torch::from_blob` is owned by `samples_vec` and would be freed on scope exit.

**Example 2: Computing Log Probability Density (Log PDF)**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

torch::Tensor log_normal_pdf(torch::Tensor x, torch::Tensor mean, torch::Tensor std) {
    // Error checking: Ensure mean, std and x have compatible dimensions and type
    if(mean.sizes() != std.sizes() || mean.scalar_type() != std.scalar_type() || mean.scalar_type() != x.scalar_type()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Mean, standard deviation and sample tensors must have the same size and data type.");
    }
    if(!mean.is_floating_point()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Mean, standard deviation and sample tensors must be of floating-point type.");
    }
    if(std.lt(0.0f).any().item<bool>()){ // std contains negative values.
      throw std::runtime_error("Standard deviation cannot be negative.");
    }

    auto log_prob = -0.5 * std::log(2 * M_PI * std.pow(std, 2));
    log_prob = log_prob - (torch::pow((x-mean), 2)/(2 * torch::pow(std, 2)));
    return log_prob;
}

int main() {
  torch::Tensor x = torch::tensor({1.0f, 2.0f});
  torch::Tensor mean = torch::tensor({0.0f, 1.0f});
  torch::Tensor std = torch::tensor({1.0f, 0.5f});
  torch::Tensor log_prob = log_normal_pdf(x, mean, std);
  std::cout << "Log probability density: " << log_prob << std::endl;

  x = torch::tensor({{1.0f, 2.0f}, {3.0f, 4.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  mean = torch::tensor({{0.0f, 1.0f}, {2.0f, 3.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  std = torch::tensor({{1.0f, 0.5f}, {0.5f, 1.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  log_prob = log_normal_pdf(x, mean, std);
  std::cout << "Log probability density with higher dimensional inputs: " << log_prob << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

```

This example calculates the log probability density of given samples `x` under a normal distribution specified by mean and standard deviation. It implements the logarithmic version of the PDF, which is numerically more stable for calculations. It leverages basic tensor operations like subtraction, squaring, and exponentiation. Like the sampling example, I've added checks to make sure all inputs are floating point and that mean, standard deviation and x are of the same data type and dimension. The usage of `M_PI`, defined in `<cmath>`, is necessary for computing the log-normal pdf.

**Example 3: Computing Log Cumulative Distribution Function (Log CDF)**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

torch::Tensor log_normal_cdf(torch::Tensor x, torch::Tensor mean, torch::Tensor std) {
    // Error checking: Ensure mean, std and x have compatible dimensions and type
    if(mean.sizes() != std.sizes() || mean.scalar_type() != std.scalar_type() || mean.scalar_type() != x.scalar_type()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Mean, standard deviation and sample tensors must have the same size and data type.");
    }
    if(!mean.is_floating_point()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Mean, standard deviation and sample tensors must be of floating-point type.");
    }
    if(std.lt(0.0f).any().item<bool>()){ // std contains negative values.
      throw std::runtime_error("Standard deviation cannot be negative.");
    }


    auto erf_tensor = torch::erf((x-mean) / (std * std::sqrt(2.0)));
    torch::Tensor cdf = 0.5 * (1 + erf_tensor);
    torch::Tensor log_cdf = torch::log(cdf);
    return log_cdf;
}

int main() {
  torch::Tensor x = torch::tensor({1.0f, 2.0f});
  torch::Tensor mean = torch::tensor({0.0f, 1.0f});
  torch::Tensor std = torch::tensor({1.0f, 0.5f});
  torch::Tensor log_cdf = log_normal_cdf(x, mean, std);
  std::cout << "Log cumulative distribution function: " << log_cdf << std::endl;

  x = torch::tensor({{1.0f, 2.0f}, {3.0f, 4.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  mean = torch::tensor({{0.0f, 1.0f}, {2.0f, 3.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  std = torch::tensor({{1.0f, 0.5f}, {0.5f, 1.0f}}).reshape({1,2,2});
  log_cdf = log_normal_cdf(x, mean, std);
  std::cout << "Log cumulative distribution function with higher dimensional inputs: " << log_cdf << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
This final example computes the log of the cumulative distribution function using the error function implementation provided by LibTorch. Again, checks are present to ensure input validity. This highlights the importance of not relying on implicit behaviours and actively verifying the input tensors before attempting to compute with them.

In conclusion, LibTorch does not offer a direct equivalent to PyTorch's `torch.distributions.Normal`. Implementing this functionality requires manually coding the sampling process, PDF, and CDF or their logarithmic variants using basic tensor operations and standard mathematical functions. Libraries that provide specialized statistical functions, like the Boost library or the Eigen library could be explored as possible resources. I've found consulting the documentation of related libraries that provide statistical distributions also useful for structuring my implementations. Finally, comparing the outputs of the custom implementation with PyTorch's `torch.distributions.Normal` within unit tests can often surface any subtle numerical discrepancies.
