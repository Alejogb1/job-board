CUDA kernel execution fundamentally relies on a grid of thread blocks, each comprised of numerous threads.  Understanding thread group interaction hinges on recognizing that threads within a single block enjoy fast, shared memory access and synchronization primitives, while inter-block communication requires significantly more sophisticated mechanisms and incurs greater latency.  This inherent asymmetry dictates the design patterns employed when dealing with parallel algorithms on GPUs.  My experience optimizing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations has highlighted this distinction repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The notion of "thread groups" in CUDA is a bit ambiguous.  Strictly speaking, a thread block is the fundamental unit of execution and synchronization within a CUDA kernel.  Threads within a block share a common, fast shared memory space and can directly synchronize using barriers (`__syncthreads()`). However, threads in different blocks are completely independent execution units. They cannot directly access each other's data in shared memory or synchronize using `__syncthreads()`.

Inter-block communication necessitates using either global memory or atomic operations.  Global memory is slower due to the higher latency of accessing off-chip memory.  Atomic operations, while convenient for certain update patterns, introduce serialization and contention, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks if not carefully managed.  The optimal approach often involves careful algorithm design to minimize the need for inter-block communication or to strategically utilize global memory accesses in a way that minimizes memory conflicts.  This usually involves data partitioning and reorganization to enhance data locality.

Furthermore, the notion of "thread groups" can sometimes refer to a collection of thread blocks, usually implicitly defined by the programmer's grid launch configuration. However, there's no direct mechanism within the CUDA programming model for explicit synchronization or communication between these larger collections of blocks.  Coordination between them typically requires mechanisms external to the kernel itself, such as using a host-side process or employing asynchronous operations coupled with event synchronization.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Intra-block Summation**

This example showcases efficient summation within a single block, leveraging shared memory for fast aggregation.

```c++
__global__ void blockSum(const float* input, float* output, int size) {
  __shared__ float sharedMem[256]; // Assumes block size <= 256

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    sharedMem[threadIdx.x] = input[i];
  } else {
    sharedMem[threadIdx.x] = 0.0f;
  }

  __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads write to shared memory

  for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
    if (threadIdx.x < s) {
      sharedMem[threadIdx.x] += sharedMem[threadIdx.x + s];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
    output[blockIdx.x] = sharedMem[0];
  }
}
```

This kernel efficiently sums elements within each block using shared memory.  The `__syncthreads()` calls ensure proper synchronization between threads within the block.  The final result for each block is written to the `output` array in global memory.


**Example 2: Inter-block Summation using Atomic Operations**

This example demonstrates summing across multiple blocks using atomic operations, highlighting the limitations and potential performance issues.

```c++
__global__ void atomicSum(const float* input, float* output, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    atomicAdd(output, input[i]);
  }
}
```

This kernel is simple but suffers from potential performance bottlenecks.  All threads attempt to access and modify the same global memory location (`output`), leading to significant contention and serialization. This approach is only viable for relatively small datasets.


**Example 3: Inter-block Summation using Reduction with Global Memory**

This example demonstrates a more scalable approach to inter-block summation, using multiple reduction steps and global memory.

```c++
__global__ void globalSum(const float* input, float* partialSums, float* output, int size) {
  __shared__ float sharedMem[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  float sum = 0.0f;

  if (i < size) {
    sum = input[i];
  }

  // Intra-block reduction (similar to Example 1)
  // ...

  if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
    partialSums[blockIdx.x] = sharedMem[0];
  }

  // Second kernel to reduce partial sums (e.g., another kernel call or a hierarchical reduction)
}
```

This approach is significantly more scalable than atomic operations. It first performs an intra-block reduction as in Example 1, storing partial sums in global memory.  A subsequent kernel (or a hierarchical reduction strategy) is then needed to sum these partial sums. This avoids the contention associated with atomic operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend the official CUDA Programming Guide for a comprehensive understanding of CUDA concepts, including thread management and synchronization.  A thorough grasp of parallel algorithm design and data structures is also critical.  Exploring resources focusing on parallel algorithms, particularly those addressing reduction and scan operations, will significantly improve your ability to design efficient CUDA kernels.  Finally, a book on GPU architecture and programming would provide valuable context.  Understanding memory hierarchy and access patterns is vital for optimization.
