The perceived lack of performance improvement using `tf.contrib.data.prefetch_to_device` often stems from a misunderstanding of its role within the broader data pipeline and the interplay with other performance bottlenecks.  My experience optimizing large-scale TensorFlow models has shown that while the function *can* yield significant speedups, its effectiveness hinges critically on several factors rarely considered in isolation.  It's not a silver bullet, but rather a tool that, when applied correctly, addresses a specific component of the overall training process.


**1.  Clear Explanation of `tf.contrib.data.prefetch_to_device` and its Limitations:**

`tf.contrib.data.prefetch_to_device` (now deprecated, replaced by similar functionality within `tf.data`) aimed to improve training speed by prefetching data onto a specified device – typically a GPU – ahead of its immediate need.  The core idea is to overlap data transfer with model computation. While the GPU is processing a batch, the next batch is already being loaded onto the device, reducing idle time. However, the effectiveness is contingent on several factors:

* **Data Transfer Bottleneck:** If the data transfer speed is not the limiting factor, prefetching to the device offers marginal or no gains.  Other bottlenecks, such as insufficient GPU memory, slow model computation, or inefficient data preprocessing, will dominate.  I've encountered numerous instances where focusing on I/O optimization (e.g., using faster storage or more efficient data loading techniques) yielded far greater improvements than simply prefetching.

* **Device Saturation:** If the GPU is constantly busy, the prefetched data might accumulate in device memory without contributing to faster training.  This is especially relevant when dealing with large batch sizes or complex models with lengthy computation times.  The benefit of prefetching only manifests when there is sufficient idle time on the GPU to absorb the prefetched data.

* **Data Preprocessing Overhead:**  If the data preprocessing steps (e.g., image augmentation, data normalization) are computationally expensive, prefetching might only move the bottleneck. The CPU might become saturated preprocessing data for the prefetch buffer, negating the intended speedup.  Efficient preprocessing strategies are crucial in conjunction with prefetching.

* **Dataset Characteristics:** The size and format of the dataset significantly influence the effectiveness of prefetching.  Small datasets or those already residing in device memory will see little to no benefit.

In essence, `tf.contrib.data.prefetch_to_device` addresses only a specific aspect of the data pipeline. It's a micro-optimization, not a macro-solution, and should be used judiciously as part of a holistic optimization strategy.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Ineffective Prefetching due to Slow Data Loading**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Dataset with slow loading (simulated)
def slow_load():
  # Simulate slow I/O
  tf.compat.v1.sleep(1.0)
  return tf.constant([1.0])

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(1000).map(lambda _: slow_load())
dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)  #No Prefetch to device

# Training loop
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
  next_element = iterator.get_next()
  for _ in range(1000):
    sess.run(next_element)

```
In this example, even without prefetching to a device, data loading is the bottleneck. Prefetching to the GPU would not yield a notable improvement because the CPU is the limiting factor. The `tf.compat.v1.sleep(1.0)` simulates a slow data loading process.


**Example 2: Effective Prefetching with Balanced Computation and Data Transfer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Simulate a more computationally expensive model
def complex_computation(data):
  return tf.math.reduce_sum(tf.math.square(data))

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(1000).map(lambda x: tf.constant([x]*10000, dtype=tf.float32))

#Prefetch to GPU
dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    dataset = dataset.map(complex_computation)

#Training Loop (Simplified)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
    next_element = iterator.get_next()
    for _ in range(1000):
      sess.run(next_element)

```

Here, the computational cost of `complex_computation` is artificially high, potentially allowing the prefetch buffer to improve performance by overlapping data transfer with GPU computation.  Note the use of `tf.device` to specify the GPU.  The simulated data transfer is faster than in the previous example.  However, the efficacy still depends on relative speeds and available GPU memory.



**Example 3:  Prefetching with Optimized Data Loading and Preprocessing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Efficient data loading and preprocessing
data = np.random.rand(1000, 1000) # Simulate data loaded efficiently
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data).batch(32)
dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

#Minimal computation on the GPU (simulated)
def simple_computation(data):
    return tf.math.reduce_mean(data)

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    dataset = dataset.map(simple_computation)

#Training Loop (Simplified)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
    next_element = iterator.get_next()
    for _ in range(1000 // 32):
        sess.run(next_element)
```
This example showcases a scenario where efficient data loading and preprocessing are in place.  The `prefetch` operation is still included for completeness, but the primary gains might come from the overall pipeline optimization.  The minimal computation on the GPU reduces the potential for the device to become a bottleneck.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow data pipelines, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections detailing `tf.data` API.  Thorough examination of performance profiling tools like TensorBoard is crucial for identifying true bottlenecks.  Understanding memory management within TensorFlow and effective utilization of GPUs is also critical. Finally, explore resources focused on general optimization techniques for high-performance computing, as these principles extend beyond TensorFlow.  These combined approaches provide a robust strategy for optimizing model training speed.
