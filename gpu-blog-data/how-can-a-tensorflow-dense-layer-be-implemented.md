TensorFlow's `Dense` layer, a fundamental component for building neural networks, lacks a direct, identically named counterpart in PyTorch.  The functional equivalence, however, rests in PyTorch's `nn.Linear` module.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted the subtle yet crucial differences in their usage, primarily concerning weight initialization and bias handling.  While both layers perform a linear transformation,  their API nuances require attention for seamless transition between frameworks.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core functionality of both TensorFlow's `tf.keras.layers.Dense` and PyTorch's `torch.nn.Linear` involves a matrix multiplication of the input tensor with a weight matrix, followed by an addition of a bias vector.  Mathematically, the operation is represented as:  `output = activation(input * weights + bias)`, where `activation` is an activation function (like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh) often applied subsequently.

The key difference lies in how these layers are instantiated and integrated into the model architecture. TensorFlow's `Dense` layer is typically part of a sequential model or a functional API construction, whereas PyTorch leverages its `nn.Module` class for constructing layers and subsequently assembling them within a larger network.  Furthermore, while both frameworks handle weight initialization, they offer different levels of control and default strategies.  TensorFlow's defaults are often more implicit, while PyTorch encourages more explicit definition via the `nn.init` module.  Finally, the handling of biases, while functionally similar, displays minor differences in how they are accessed and manipulated during training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Dense Layer Equivalence:**

```python
# TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))
])

# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 64)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

model_pytorch = SimpleNet()
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the basic mapping.  TensorFlow uses a sequential model, implicitly defining the layer's input shape.  PyTorch necessitates a custom class inheriting from `nn.Module`, explicitly defining the linear layer and activation function within the `__init__` method and their application within the `forward` method.  Note the explicit specification of the input dimension (10) in both cases.

**Example 2:  Weight Initialization and Bias Access:**

```python
# TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=32, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(5,),
                        kernel_initializer='he_normal', bias_initializer='zeros')
])
weights = model.layers[0].kernel
bias = model.layers[0].bias
print(weights.numpy(), bias.numpy())


# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.init as init

class WeightInitNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(WeightInitNet, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(5, 32)
        init.kaiming_normal_(self.linear.weight) #He initialization
        init.zeros_(self.linear.bias)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.sigmoid(x)
        return x

model_pytorch = WeightInitNet()
weights = model_pytorch.linear.weight
bias = model_pytorch.linear.bias
print(weights.detach().numpy(), bias.detach().numpy())
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates how to control weight initialization and access weights and biases.  TensorFlow allows setting initializers directly within the `Dense` layer definition. PyTorch requires using the `nn.init` module to apply initializations to the `Linear` layer's weights and biases after instantiation. The `.detach().numpy()` call is crucial in PyTorch to convert the tensor to a NumPy array for printing, avoiding unintended gradient tracking.  Note the equivalent `he_normal` (Kaiming normal) initialization is used in both cases; the terminology might vary slightly between frameworks.

**Example 3:  Multiple Dense Layers in a Network:**

```python
# TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiLayerNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MultiLayerNet, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.relu1(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        x = self.relu2(x)
        x = self.layer3(x)
        x = self.softmax(x)
        return x

model_pytorch = MultiLayerNet()
```

*Commentary:*  This example highlights building deeper networks.  TensorFlow's sequential model naturally handles multiple layers. In PyTorch, each layer is explicitly defined and called sequentially within the `forward` method of the custom `nn.Module`.  This structure is more verbose but offers finer-grained control over the network's architecture and the flow of data.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's Keras API, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials. PyTorch's documentation, similarly, offers comprehensive guidance on the `nn.Module` system and the `nn.Linear` layer.  Explore examples focusing on weight initialization techniques within both frameworks.  Furthermore,  numerous online courses and textbooks dedicated to deep learning will provide substantial contextual knowledge.  Finally,  reviewing well-structured code repositories on platforms like GitHub, showcasing complex neural network architectures built with both TensorFlow and PyTorch, can significantly aid in understanding best practices and implementation strategies.
