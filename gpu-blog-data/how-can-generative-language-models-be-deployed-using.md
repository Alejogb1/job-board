Deployment of generative language models using TensorFlow Serving requires careful consideration of model architecture, input/output processing, and serving infrastructure. These models, often characterized by their dynamic and sequence-based nature, present unique challenges compared to traditional classification or regression tasks. Specifically, their autoregressive behavior and dependence on context necessitate a serving strategy that can efficiently manage state and support iterative inference.

TensorFlow Serving, at its core, is designed for serving static computational graphs. Generative language models, especially those employing recurrent neural networks or Transformers, typically involve iterative processes where the output of one step becomes the input to the next. This dynamic nature clashes with the static model representation within TensorFlow Serving. To bridge this gap, I have found a multi-stage approach to be effective, employing a combination of pre-processing, graph construction, and post-processing steps orchestrated within the TensorFlow ecosystem.

First, pre-processing involves converting raw input text into a suitable format for the model. This commonly involves tokenization, vocabulary mapping, and padding to ensure consistent sequence lengths. The pre-processing graph will exist outside of the TensorFlow Serving deployment, as it is static and easily managed via custom python scripts. This processed input, generally a tensor of token IDs, forms the input to the served model.

The core model serving logic is then constructed as follows. It usually involves a series of layers including embedding, encoder layers, and decoder layers. The decoder, crucial for autoregressive generation, outputs probability distributions over the vocabulary. During inference, only a single token needs to be generated at a time. This requires that the model maintains its internal state between calls. Typically, we handle this through explicitly passing the model's state as input and receiving it as output. This pattern makes use of TensorFlow's mechanisms for capturing mutable state within a graph. The key here is to not allow the graph to reset on every request. The output of a model inference is the logits, which need to be converted to token ID, and the internal state, which is required for the next inference request.

Third, post-processing converts the output token IDs back into human-readable text, using the same vocabulary mapping employed in pre-processing. This will also need to exist outside of the tensorflow server, and can be handled via python script.

The serving logic, therefore, consists of a series of requests and responses. The client must pass in a processed tokenized input sequence along with the models' state to the tensorflow serving endpoint. The client will need to keep track of the models state between requests. Once the model has produced logits, these logits need to be sampled and converted to token IDs. These token IDs then need to be added to the input sequence for the next serving request. Post processing is handled when the generated sequence is of the desired length.

Let’s examine this process with concrete examples, simplified for clarity. In practice, many models are significantly more complex.

**Example 1: Basic RNN-based language model**

Here, we'll focus on the core serving graph, assuming pre- and post-processing are handled externally. This example uses a simplified LSTM-based model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleLSTMModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units):
        super(SimpleLSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)

    def call(self, inputs, initial_state=None):
       embedded = self.embedding(inputs)
       if initial_state is None:
            outputs, h, c = self.lstm(embedded)
       else:
           outputs, h, c = self.lstm(embedded, initial_state=initial_state)
       logits = self.dense(outputs)
       return logits, (h,c)


vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 256
lstm_units = 512

model = SimpleLSTMModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units)

#Placeholder tensors for the model’s input and state.
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None,), dtype=tf.int32, name='input_tensor')
initial_state_h = tf.keras.Input(shape=(lstm_units,), dtype=tf.float32, name='initial_state_h')
initial_state_c = tf.keras.Input(shape=(lstm_units,), dtype=tf.float32, name='initial_state_c')
initial_state_tuple = (initial_state_h,initial_state_c)

#Call the model.
logits, state = model(input_tensor, initial_state=initial_state_tuple)
#Define the output tensors.
output_tensor = tf.identity(logits, name='output_tensor')
output_state_h = tf.identity(state[0], name='output_state_h')
output_state_c = tf.identity(state[1], name='output_state_c')

#Model used to create the SavedModel.
serving_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_tensor, initial_state_h, initial_state_c], outputs=[output_tensor, output_state_h, output_state_c])

#Save the model
tf.saved_model.save(serving_model, "saved_model_lstm")
```

Here, the key is that the `call` method accepts `initial_state`, allowing us to manage the LSTM's hidden and cell states across inference steps.  The graph is constructed such that it accepts the initial state, the input tokens, and outputs the logits as well as the final state for the model. This allows the client to sequentially call the tensorflow server to generate text. The model is then saved as a `SavedModel` which can then be deployed. Note that the state needs to be passed in on every call, and it is up to the client to correctly manage the state.

**Example 2: Transformer-based language model**

Transformers use a different approach, but state management remains crucial. Here’s a conceptual simplification, avoiding concrete implementation of the transformer architecture and focusing on the serving graph:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleTransformerModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_heads, hidden_dim):
        super(SimpleTransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.transformer_encoder = tf.keras.layers.Transformer(num_heads=num_heads, num_layers=4, hidden_dim=hidden_dim, dropout_rate=0.1, activation="relu", use_bias=True, output_proj_factor=4)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)


    def call(self, inputs, past_key_values=None):
        embedded = self.embedding(inputs)

        if past_key_values is None:
            attention_output = self.transformer_encoder(embedded)
        else:
            attention_output = self.transformer_encoder(embedded, past_key_values=past_key_values)
        
        logits = self.dense(attention_output)
        
        #Key value pairs are returned from each transformer layer, hence we concatenate.
        past_key_values = self.transformer_encoder.get_past_key_values()

        return logits, past_key_values

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 256
num_heads = 8
hidden_dim = 512

model = SimpleTransformerModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_heads, hidden_dim)
# Placeholder tensors for the model’s input and state.
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None,), dtype=tf.int32, name='input_tensor')
# Assume the past key values are a list of tensors for simplicity, normally these are stored as dictionaries.
past_key_values_input = []
for i in range(4):
    past_key_values_input.append(tf.keras.Input(shape=(None, num_heads, embedding_dim), dtype=tf.float32, name=f'past_key_value_input_{i}'))


# Call the model.
logits, past_key_values = model(input_tensor, past_key_values=past_key_values_input)
# Define the output tensors.
output_tensor = tf.identity(logits, name='output_tensor')
past_key_values_output = []
for i, key_value_pair in enumerate(past_key_values):
    past_key_values_output.append(tf.identity(key_value_pair, name=f'past_key_values_output_{i}'))


#Model used to create the SavedModel.
serving_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_tensor] + past_key_values_input, outputs=[output_tensor] + past_key_values_output)
tf.saved_model.save(serving_model, "saved_model_transformer")
```

The crucial aspect here is how `past_key_values` are handled, representing cached intermediate calculations from transformer layers. Similar to the LSTM example, this needs to be passed to the model on every request, and therefore is managed by the client.

**Example 3: Batched Inference with Padding**

For improved throughput, batched inference is often necessary. To facilitate this, we must also pad sequences to the maximum batch length.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming the previous LSTM class as defined in Example 1
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 256
lstm_units = 512

model = SimpleLSTMModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units)

# Placeholder tensors for the model’s input and state.
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None,), dtype=tf.int32, name='input_tensor')
initial_state_h = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None, lstm_units), dtype=tf.float32, name='initial_state_h')
initial_state_c = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None, lstm_units), dtype=tf.float32, name='initial_state_c')
initial_state_tuple = (initial_state_h,initial_state_c)

# Call the model.
logits, state = model(input_tensor, initial_state=initial_state_tuple)

# Define the output tensors.
output_tensor = tf.identity(logits, name='output_tensor')
output_state_h = tf.identity(state[0], name='output_state_h')
output_state_c = tf.identity(state[1], name='output_state_c')

#Model used to create the SavedModel.
serving_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_tensor, initial_state_h, initial_state_c], outputs=[output_tensor, output_state_h, output_state_c])

tf.saved_model.save(serving_model, "saved_model_batched")
```

The primary change here is the addition of a batch dimension to the state tensors. Preprocessing and postprocessing must now account for this dimension as well. This shows how the batch dimension can be inferred by tensorflow during the creation of the `SavedModel`.

For more in-depth understanding and practical implementations, I recommend studying the TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel format, TensorFlow Serving, Keras custom layers, and the documentation of the specific model architectures you are working with. Various tutorials and example projects from reputable open-source projects also provide guidance on best practices. These resources can enable a much deeper dive into the intricacies of deploying these models. Additionally, careful testing, monitoring, and iterative refinement will be critical for optimal real-world performance.
