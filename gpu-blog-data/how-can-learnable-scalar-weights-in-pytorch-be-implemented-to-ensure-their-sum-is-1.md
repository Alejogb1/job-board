In gradient-based optimization, enforcing constraints on learnable parameters often requires careful implementation. Directly learning scalar weights that must sum to one, specifically, presents a challenge because raw gradients could violate this constraint. My experience building custom loss functions for multi-modal fusion tasks highlighted the need for methods that inherently maintain these types of parameter relationships throughout training. Simply normalizing the weights after each update is unstable and can lead to oscillations. Instead, we must formulate the weights such that their sum is inherently one, thereby ensuring stability and more consistent learning.

To achieve this, the most reliable approach involves using a softmax transformation on a set of unconstrained learnable parameters, which I refer to as *pre-weights*. The softmax function, by its definition, maps any set of real numbers to values between 0 and 1, and the resulting values always sum to 1. This directly satisfies the required constraint. Consequently, the gradient flow remains smooth and parameter updates occur without breaking the sum-to-one condition.

The transformation process consists of the following steps. First, I initialize a tensor of learnable parameters that are *not* constrained. I then pass this tensor through the softmax function. The output of the softmax becomes the constrained scalar weights. The optimizer updates the unconstrained parameters, while the constrained weights are used to compute the loss.

Let’s illustrate this with Python code examples utilizing PyTorch.

**Code Example 1: Basic Implementation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class WeightedSum(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_weights):
        super().__init__()
        self.pre_weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_weights))

    def forward(self):
        weights = torch.softmax(self.pre_weights, dim=0)
        return weights

# Example Usage
num_weights = 3
model = WeightedSum(num_weights)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Dummy Input Data
input_tensors = [torch.randn(10), torch.randn(10), torch.randn(10)]
target = torch.randn(10)


for epoch in range(100): # Arbitrary epochs
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    weights = model()
    weighted_sum = sum(w * t for w, t in zip(weights, input_tensors))
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(weighted_sum, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch + 1) % 20 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Weights: {weights.detach().numpy()}")

```

In this first example, I defined a `WeightedSum` class inheriting from `nn.Module`. The `__init__` method initializes a learnable parameter `pre_weights` using `nn.Parameter`. I have specified `num_weights` to dynamically handle the number of weights required for various applications. The `forward` method performs the crucial part, applying the softmax activation over the `pre_weights` along dimension 0, resulting in normalized weights. The main section demonstrates how to utilize the class; I generate some dummy tensors to sum and subsequently compute a loss to demonstrate training. Crucially, `model()` returns the *constrained weights* which are used in the calculation of the loss function. Note the `detach` when printing the weights – I am printing the tensor’s value as a NumPy array, not the gradient history. The key here is that I never have to explicitly enforce the constraint; it is always enforced due to the softmax function.

**Code Example 2: Incorporating a Bias Term and Batching**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class WeightedSumBias(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_weights):
        super().__init__()
        self.pre_weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_weights))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))

    def forward(self, input_tensors):
        weights = torch.softmax(self.pre_weights, dim=0) # Softmax on weights only
        weighted_sum = sum(w * t for w, t in zip(weights, input_tensors)) + self.bias
        return weighted_sum


# Example Usage with batches
batch_size = 4
num_weights = 3

model = WeightedSumBias(num_weights)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Dummy Batched Input Data
input_tensors = [torch.randn(batch_size, 10) for _ in range(num_weights)]
target = torch.randn(batch_size, 10)

for epoch in range(100): # Arbitrary epochs
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    weighted_sum = model(input_tensors)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(weighted_sum, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch + 1) % 20 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Weights: {torch.softmax(model.pre_weights, dim=0).detach().numpy()}")

```

In this example, I expanded the model by incorporating an additional bias term. This bias term is also a learnable parameter and is not subject to the sum-to-one constraint. I also demonstrate using batched inputs, a necessity in many real world scenarios. The `forward` method, crucially, *still only applies the softmax to the pre-weights*, maintaining the sum-to-one constraint. Observe that I can generate tensors with any batch size and dimension, with this code being functional for a wide range of inputs. The optimization loop remains unchanged, with the model now operating on batches. The benefit here is that the code is more flexible while maintaining the essential parameter constraints.

**Code Example 3: Dynamically Determining Number of Weights**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DynamicWeightedSum(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.pre_weights = None

    def initialize_weights(self, num_weights):
        self.pre_weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_weights))


    def forward(self, input_tensors):
      num_weights = len(input_tensors)
      if self.pre_weights is None or self.pre_weights.numel() != num_weights:
        self.initialize_weights(num_weights)
      weights = torch.softmax(self.pre_weights, dim=0)
      weighted_sum = sum(w * t for w, t in zip(weights, input_tensors))
      return weighted_sum

# Example Usage with dynamic input
model = DynamicWeightedSum()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)


# Dummy Input Data, differing number of tensors each time
target_sizes = [2, 5, 3, 4]
input_tensors_list = [ [torch.randn(10) for _ in range(n)] for n in target_sizes]
target_tensors = [torch.randn(10) for _ in target_sizes]



for epoch in range(100):
  for input_tensors, target in zip(input_tensors_list, target_tensors):

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    weighted_sum = model(input_tensors)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(weighted_sum, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
  if (epoch + 1) % 20 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Weights: {torch.softmax(model.pre_weights, dim=0).detach().numpy()}")


```

The final example presents a more adaptable implementation where the number of weights is not fixed a priori. The `DynamicWeightedSum` class now has an `initialize_weights` method that allocates the correct `pre_weights` tensor, with the number being dependent on the input tensors fed to the model. The conditional logic in the `forward` method ensures that when new tensors are presented, the `pre_weights` are automatically adjusted. I create the input tensors and targets dynamically, showing the flexible nature of the updated class. The optimization loop now iterates across the dynamic tensors. Again, the softmax ensures that the output of the model sums to one. The benefit is that the model can now handle any number of inputs, without explicit adjustment.

In conclusion, learning scalar weights that sum to one in PyTorch requires employing a transformation, like softmax, that intrinsically satisfies the constraint. Directly applying gradients to raw weights can lead to unstable optimization and violation of the constraint. My experience has shown that the use of an initial unconstrained parameter set coupled with the softmax transformation results in stable and reliable training. The provided code examples highlight the implementation of this technique, including support for bias terms, batching, and dynamic adjustments to the number of weights. For further study, I would suggest examining publications focusing on constrained optimization techniques specifically within the context of neural networks and gradient-based learning. Additionally, delving into the mathematics behind the softmax function and its gradient properties can provide deeper insight into its utility for this kind of task. Finally, exploring PyTorch's documentation on parameter handling and custom modules will help to reinforce and expand these techniques.
