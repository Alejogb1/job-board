The challenge of presenting Keras model summaries for two combined sequential models stems from the inherent limitations of the `model.summary()` method, which is designed for single models.  Directly applying it to a combined structure yields a summary of only the final model, obscuring the architecture of the constituent models.  Over the years, working with complex deep learning architectures for large-scale image recognition projects, I've encountered this repeatedly. The solution necessitates a more nuanced approach focusing on individually summarizing the sub-models and then providing contextual information regarding their combination.

My approach emphasizes clarity and comprehensibility, focusing on providing the user with the architectural details of both sequential models and the manner in which they are integrated. This ensures a complete understanding of the overall model's structure, avoiding the ambiguity inherent in simply summarizing the final combined model.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The optimal method is a two-pronged approach: first, summarize each sequential model independently using the standard `model.summary()` function.  This provides a clear picture of each model's internal layers, including their shapes and parameter counts. Second, create a textual description or visualization that illustrates how these models are connected. This could be a simple diagrammatic representation showing the flow of data between the models, or a textual description outlining the connection type (e.g., concatenation, addition, multiplication).  This descriptive element is crucial because the final `model.summary()` call will only reflect the output layer, providing little information about the internal structures of the constituent models.  This structured presentation ensures complete transparency about the overall architecture.  Failing to clearly illustrate the connection leads to a significant loss of understanding.

Consider scenarios involving concatenation, where two models with different output dimensions are combined. A simple `model.summary()` on the combined model would not clarify the shapes of the outputs of the individual models before concatenation. Similarly, if one model's output is used as the input for another (sequential model composition), the intermediate layer shapes are lost in a standard summary. This necessitates the independent summarization strategy for clarity.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Concatenation of Two Sequential Models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Model 1
model1 = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu')
])
model1.summary()

# Model 2
model2 = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu')
])
model2.summary()

# Combine models using concatenate
combined_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28))
output1 = model1(combined_input)
output2 = model2(combined_input)
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([output1, output2])
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)
combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=combined_input, outputs=output)
combined_model.summary()

print("\nModel Combination Description:")
print("Model 1 and Model 2 are concatenated at their output layers.  Model 1's output shape is (64,) and Model 2's is (32,). The concatenated layer has a shape of (96,).")

```

This example demonstrates the concatenation of two sequential models.  The individual summaries give the architecture of each model, and the textual description provides the necessary context on how the concatenation affects the resultant model's structure. The final summary reveals the merged layer and the output layer.


**Example 2: Sequential Composition of Two Models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense

# Model 1
model1 = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu')
])
model1.summary()

# Model 2
model2 = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='softmax', input_shape=(32,))
])
model2.summary()

# Combine models sequentially
combined_model = keras.Sequential([model1, model2])
combined_model.summary()

print("\nModel Combination Description:")
print("Model 1's output is fed as the input to Model 2.  This creates a sequential flow of data.")
```

This shows a sequential composition where model1's output feeds into model2. The individual summaries clarify each modelâ€™s architecture, while the final summary reflects the combined model.


**Example 3:  Adding Outputs from Two Models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, Input, Add

# Model 1
model1 = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='relu')
])
model1.summary()

# Model 2
model2 = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='relu')
])
model2.summary()

#Combine models by adding their outputs
input_layer = Input(shape=(784,))
output1 = model1(input_layer)
output2 = model2(input_layer)
merged = Add()([output1, output2])
combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=merged)
combined_model.summary()

print("\nModel Combination Description:")
print("The outputs of Model 1 and Model 2, both of shape (10,), are added element-wise.")

```

Here, the outputs of two models are added.  Again, individual summaries provide the internal structure, while the description explains the addition operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras model building and visualization, I recommend exploring the official Keras documentation and tutorials.  Furthermore, reviewing advanced Keras techniques in reputable machine learning textbooks can prove beneficial.  Finally, studying examples of complex model architectures in published research papers, particularly those involving model combinations, can provide significant insights.  These resources offer a robust foundation for understanding and mastering complex model architectures and visualization techniques.
