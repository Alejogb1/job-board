The root cause of access violations when modifying UI elements from within a UWP `IAsyncOperation`'s completed handler stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the threading model inherent in the Windows Runtime (WinRT).  My experience debugging asynchronous operations in UWP applications, particularly those involving significant background tasks, has repeatedly highlighted this issue.  The core problem isn't the `IAsyncOperation` itself, but rather the implicit thread context on which the `Completed` handler executes.  It's crucial to remember that the `Completed` event is not necessarily fired on the UI thread.

**1. Explanation:**

UWP applications leverage a multi-threaded architecture.  The UI thread, also known as the dispatcher thread, is responsible for updating the visual state of the application.  While an `IAsyncOperation` can perform long-running tasks on a background thread, its `Completed` handler—the callback invoked upon completion—does *not* inherently execute on the UI thread. This means that attempts to directly manipulate UI elements from within the `Completed` handler can lead to unpredictable behavior, including access violations, crashes, and inconsistent UI updates.  The access violation occurs because the UI elements are not thread-safe;  accessing them from a non-UI thread results in a race condition, violating the implicit thread affinity the UI elements possess. The operating system's protection mechanisms then trigger an access violation to prevent data corruption.

The solution is to marshal the UI update operation back to the UI thread.  This involves using the `CoreDispatcher` to ensure all UI modifications happen within the context of the UI thread's message loop.  The `CoreDispatcher.RunAsync` method provides a mechanism for queuing work onto the UI thread, ensuring thread safety and preventing access violations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation (Causes Access Violation):**

```csharp
private async void MyAsyncOperation()
{
    var operation = MyLongRunningTaskAsync(); // Returns IAsyncOperation<string>

    operation.Completed += (asyncInfo, status) =>
    {
        // INCORRECT: This directly modifies the UI on a potentially non-UI thread
        myTextBlock.Text = asyncInfo.GetResults(); 
    };
    await operation;
}

private async Task<string> MyLongRunningTaskAsync()
{
    // Simulate a long-running task
    await Task.Delay(5000);
    return "Task Completed!";
}
```

This code directly attempts to update `myTextBlock.Text` within the `Completed` handler, leading to an access violation if the `Completed` event fires on a background thread.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation using CoreDispatcher:**

```csharp
private async void MyAsyncOperation()
{
    var operation = MyLongRunningTaskAsync();

    operation.Completed += (asyncInfo, status) =>
    {
        // CORRECT: Uses CoreDispatcher to marshal the UI update to the UI thread
        await CoreApplication.MainView.CoreWindow.Dispatcher.RunAsync(CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal, () =>
        {
            myTextBlock.Text = asyncInfo.GetResults();
        });
    };
    await operation;
}
```

This revised example uses `CoreApplication.MainView.CoreWindow.Dispatcher.RunAsync` to queue the UI update onto the UI thread.  The `CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal` parameter sets the priority of the task within the UI thread's message queue.

**Example 3:  Using `await` for a cleaner approach (Recommended):**

```csharp
private async void MyAsyncOperation()
{
    try
    {
        string result = await MyLongRunningTaskAsync();
        //This line is safe because await already ensures we are on the UI thread
        myTextBlock.Text = result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        //Handle exceptions appropriately.
    }
}

private async Task<string> MyLongRunningTaskAsync()
{
    // Simulate a long-running task
    await Task.Delay(5000);
    return "Task Completed!";
}
```

This example leverages the `await` keyword within the `MyAsyncOperation` method.  The `await` keyword implicitly handles the marshaling back to the UI thread after the asynchronous operation completes. This is often the preferred and more readable method when feasible, avoiding the explicit use of `CoreDispatcher.RunAsync`.  The `try-catch` block handles potential exceptions during the asynchronous operation. This approach is cleaner and reduces the risk of errors compared to using `Completed` handlers directly.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **Microsoft's official UWP documentation:** This is the primary source for information on UWP application development, including asynchronous programming and threading models.  It provides in-depth explanations and detailed examples.
*   **Advanced Windows Programming (book):**  This book delves into the intricacies of Windows programming, covering advanced topics like multithreading, concurrency, and the WinRT.  It offers a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
*   **UWP asynchronous programming articles:** Numerous online articles specifically address asynchronous programming in UWP.  Look for articles that emphasize the use of `async` and `await` and the importance of UI thread context.



Through years of wrestling with asynchronous operations in UWP, I've learned that understanding the threading model is paramount.  Careless handling of UI updates from background threads invariably leads to unpredictable results. The use of `CoreDispatcher.RunAsync` or, ideally, leveraging the power of `async` and `await` directly within your asynchronous methods, is the essential key to ensuring thread safety and avoiding frustrating access violations.  Remember, always prioritize thread-safe practices when interacting with UI elements in a multi-threaded UWP application.
