The efficacy of a TensorFlow regression model trained on multiple time series hinges critically on the method of data preprocessing and feature engineering.  Simply concatenating the series, without considering their inherent temporal dependencies and potential scaling differences, often leads to suboptimal performance.  My experience developing predictive models for high-frequency financial data underscores this point.  Effective combination requires careful consideration of the relationships between the series and the application of appropriate transformation techniques.

**1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**

Before feeding the data into TensorFlow, thorough preprocessing is paramount. This involves several crucial steps:

* **Alignment and Synchronization:**  Ensure all time series share the same time index.  Missing values must be handled, either through imputation (e.g., linear interpolation, k-NN imputation) or removal, depending on the dataset's characteristics and the percentage of missing data.  For high-frequency data, I've found linear interpolation to be generally effective, while for sparser datasets, more sophisticated methods may be necessary.  Inconsistent sampling rates must be addressed through resampling (upsampling or downsampling) to a common frequency.

* **Normalization or Standardization:**  Different time series often exhibit vastly different scales. This can negatively impact model training. Normalization (scaling to a range, e.g., [0, 1]) or standardization (centering around zero with unit variance) is essential to prevent features with larger values from dominating the learning process.  I've consistently observed improved model stability and convergence through standardization using `scikit-learn`'s `StandardScaler`.

* **Feature Extraction:**  Beyond raw values, time series often contain valuable information embedded within their temporal dynamics.  Extracting relevant features is crucial.  Common techniques include calculating rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance), lagged values, exponential moving averages, and differences between consecutive observations.  The selection of features is highly context-dependent and often requires domain expertise.  For instance, in predicting electricity consumption, incorporating lagged values and weather data proved significantly beneficial in my previous project.

**2. Combination Strategies:**

Several approaches exist for combining multiple time series:

* **Concatenation:**  The simplest approach is to concatenate the preprocessed time series into a single feature matrix.  Each time series becomes a separate column. This works best when the series are relatively homogenous and their relationships are linear. However, it fails to explicitly model inter-series dependencies.

* **Multivariate Time Series:**  This approach treats the multiple time series as a multivariate time series.  A recurrent neural network (RNN), such as an LSTM or GRU, can effectively learn the temporal dependencies within and between the series. The input to the RNN is a sequence of vectors, where each vector represents the values of all series at a given time step.

* **Feature Engineering with Interactions:**  Create new features that represent interactions between the time series.  For example, calculate ratios, products, or differences between pairs of series.  This can capture non-linear relationships that a simple concatenation might miss.  This approach requires careful consideration of the domain and potential spurious correlations.


**3. Code Examples:**

**(a) Concatenation with a simple feedforward network:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
series1 = np.random.rand(100, 1)
series2 = np.random.rand(100, 1)
target = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(np.concatenate((series1, series2), axis=1))
target = scaler.fit_transform(target)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, target, epochs=100)
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward concatenation of two time series.  It's simple but may not capture intricate temporal dependencies.


**(b) Multivariate Time Series with LSTM:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
series1 = np.random.rand(100, 1)
series2 = np.random.rand(100, 1)
target = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(np.concatenate((series1, series2), axis=1))
target = scaler.fit_transform(target)


# Reshape data for LSTM (samples, timesteps, features)
data = data.reshape((100, 1, 2))
target = target.reshape((100,1))

# Define the LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(1, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, target, epochs=100)

```

This example utilizes an LSTM, suitable for capturing temporal dependencies within and between the series. The data is reshaped to accommodate the LSTM's sequential input requirement.


**(c) Feature Engineering with Interactions and a Feedforward Network:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
series1 = np.random.rand(100, 1)
series2 = np.random.rand(100, 1)
target = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Feature Engineering: create interaction terms
interaction = series1 * series2

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(np.concatenate((series1, series2, interaction), axis=1))
target = scaler.fit_transform(target)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, target, epochs=100)
```

This example showcases feature engineering by adding an interaction term (the product of the two series). This allows the model to learn non-linear relationships between the series.



**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of time series analysis and TensorFlow, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on time series analysis and deep learning.  Specific resources focusing on multivariate time series forecasting and RNN architectures within the TensorFlow framework are also invaluable.  Practical guides on feature engineering and data preprocessing are essential for effectively preparing your data for model training.  Finally, research papers exploring various model architectures and their applications to specific domains can provide valuable insights.  Thorough exploration of these resources will significantly enhance one's ability to effectively combine and model multiple time series using TensorFlow.
