Implementing neural networks in PyTorch involves leveraging its autograd system and modular design.  My experience building and deploying several large-scale recommendation systems heavily relied on this framework, highlighting its efficiency and flexibility, particularly in handling complex architectures and large datasets.  The core principle lies in defining the network architecture using `torch.nn` modules, defining a loss function, and using an optimizer to iteratively adjust the network's weights.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `torch.nn` module provides a rich set of pre-built layers, allowing for the construction of virtually any neural network architecture.  These layers, such as linear layers (`nn.Linear`), convolutional layers (`nn.Conv2d`), and recurrent layers (`nn.LSTM`), are combined to form a sequential or more complex model.  The `nn.Module` class serves as the base for all neural network modules, enabling custom layer definitions and model organization.  The forward pass, where input data propagates through the network, is implemented within the `forward()` method of a custom module inheriting from `nn.Module`.  The backward pass, where gradients are computed for optimization, is handled automatically by PyTorch's autograd system.  This system tracks operations performed on tensors, building a computational graph that enables efficient gradient calculation.

Choosing the appropriate loss function is critical. The loss function quantifies the difference between the network's predictions and the true values. Common choices include mean squared error (`nn.MSELoss`) for regression tasks and cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) for classification tasks.  Optimizers, such as stochastic gradient descent (`optim.SGD`), Adam (`optim.Adam`), or RMSprop (`optim.RMSprop`), are employed to update the network's weights based on the calculated gradients.  The choice of optimizer significantly impacts training speed and convergence.  Careful hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques, is essential for optimal performance.  Data loading and preprocessing are also crucial; utilizing `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for efficient batching and data augmentation techniques are often necessary for good results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A Simple Linear Regression Model**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model
class LinearRegression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(LinearRegression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Define hyperparameters
input_dim = 1
output_dim = 1
learning_rate = 0.01
num_epochs = 1000

# Instantiate the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = LinearRegression(input_dim, output_dim)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Generate synthetic data (replace with your actual data)
X = torch.randn(100, input_dim)
y = 2*X + 1 + torch.randn(100, output_dim)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 100 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

print("Training complete.")
```

This example demonstrates a simple linear regression model.  The `LinearRegression` class inherits from `nn.Module` and defines a single linear layer.  The training loop iteratively computes the loss, backpropagates the gradients, and updates the model's weights using the SGD optimizer.


**Example 2: A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Classification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define the model
class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

# Define hyperparameters
input_dim = 10
hidden_dim = 50
output_dim = 2  # Binary classification
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 100
batch_size = 32

# Generate synthetic data (replace with your actual data)
X = torch.randn(1000, input_dim)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (1000,))

# Create DataLoader
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

# Instantiate the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = MLP(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

print("Training complete.")

```

This example showcases an MLP with one hidden layer.  The use of `nn.ReLU` as an activation function introduces non-linearity.  A `DataLoader` is used for efficient batch processing.  The Adam optimizer is employed, known for its adaptability.  The CrossEntropyLoss is suitable for multi-class classification tasks.  Remember to adapt the data generation to your specific dataset.

**Example 3: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
# ... (Data loading and preprocessing would go here, assuming you have image data)

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 128) # Assuming 32x32 input images
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10) # 10 classes

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 8 * 8)
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Define hyperparameters (adjust for your dataset)
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 20
batch_size = 64

# ... (Instantiate model, optimizer, loss function, and training loop similar to previous examples)
```

This demonstrates a basic CNN architecture.  Convolutional and pooling layers extract features from image data.  The flattened feature maps are then fed into fully connected layers for classification.  The `view()` function reshapes the tensor before feeding it to the fully connected layers.  Appropriate data loading and preprocessing specific to image data (e.g., using torchvision datasets and transforms) are crucial and are omitted for brevity.
