When fitting a Weibull distribution to data via maximum likelihood estimation using `scipy.optimize.minimize`, a common `RuntimeWarning` arises from divisions by zero or invalid values encountered during the optimization process, specifically within the likelihood function's evaluation. This isn't usually an indication of incorrect usage, but instead a consequence of the numerical methods used attempting to explore parameter spaces where the Weibull probability density function (PDF) or its log-likelihood become undefined or numerically unstable.

The core issue stems from the nature of the Weibull distribution itself. The PDF of the two-parameter Weibull distribution, defined by shape parameter 'k' and scale parameter 'lambda', includes terms involving the shape parameter in exponents. When the solver’s search algorithm ventures into regions of the parameter space with very small or near-zero values of ‘k’, problems emerge within the log-likelihood function. These problems typically manifest in two areas: the logarithmic term and the exponentiation.

Specifically, the Weibull PDF is described as: `f(x; k, lambda) = (k / lambda) * (x / lambda)^(k-1) * exp(-(x/lambda)^k)`. The log-likelihood, which is what `scipy.optimize.minimize` operates on, involves the natural logarithm of this PDF.  During minimization, algorithms often probe extreme regions of the parameter space, and can, during intermediate steps, try very small values for k. If k approaches zero, the exponent `(k-1)` becomes negative, which, when compounded with values of `x/lambda`, produces very small values, and potentially causes underflow. More critically, a very small value for k can lead to `(x/lambda)^(k-1)` becoming exceptionally large. If `x/lambda` is also less than one, in addition, this can approach 0. Finally, if the optimization algorithm explores a region with negative parameter values for ‘k’ or ‘lambda’, this will cause undefined values in the calculation of the PDF. The consequence is that when the logarithm is applied within the log-likelihood function, the argument can become zero or negative, causing `np.log(0)` or `np.log(negative number)` which produces `-inf` or `nan` values, respectively. These values then propagate to the objective function resulting in the runtime warning.

From my experience developing statistical models for wind turbine performance analysis, these warnings were a recurring issue. Wind speed data, often exhibiting a Weibull-like distribution, would sometimes cause the optimizer to explore these unstable parameter regions. My approach focused not on avoiding these parameters altogether, as some algorithms do, but on robust handling, and careful starting conditions.

Here are three code examples demonstrating the issue and common solutions:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the RuntimeWarning**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import weibull_min

def neg_log_likelihood(params, data):
    k, l = params
    return -np.sum(weibull_min.logpdf(data, k, scale=l))

# Sample data with a Weibull distribution (to be fitted).
np.random.seed(42)
data = weibull_min.rvs(2, scale=3, size=100)

# Initial guess for parameters.
initial_guess = [0.1, 0.1]

# Optimization with standard minimize.
result = minimize(neg_log_likelihood, initial_guess, args=(data,), method='Nelder-Mead')

print(f"Optimization Result:\n {result} \n")
```

In this example, a simple implementation of maximum likelihood estimation for the Weibull distribution using `scipy.optimize.minimize` is shown. The code creates sample data drawn from a known Weibull distribution then attempts to recover the parameters. The initial guess uses the value of 0.1 for each of the shape and scale parameters. Given a starting point in a numerically unstable region, the solver is more likely to explore numerically unstable regions, and result in the `RuntimeWarning` during the objective function's calculations. Notice how the results of the optimization are still returned. This means the warning is not typically fatal to the process.

**Example 2: Adding Bounds to the Parameter Space**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import weibull_min

def neg_log_likelihood(params, data):
    k, l = params
    return -np.sum(weibull_min.logpdf(data, k, scale=l))

# Sample data (same as above).
np.random.seed(42)
data = weibull_min.rvs(2, scale=3, size=100)

#Initial Guess
initial_guess = [0.1, 0.1]

# Optimization with parameter bounds.
bounds = ((1e-6, None), (1e-6, None)) # Very small but positive lower bounds.
result = minimize(neg_log_likelihood, initial_guess, args=(data,), method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=bounds)

print(f"Optimization Result:\n {result} \n")
```

This example demonstrates using bounds for the parameters. Specifically, we define that the parameters must be greater than zero, and also slightly greater than zero, using a very small number like 1e-6 as the lower bound for both ‘k’ and ‘lambda.’ This forces the optimizer to avoid searching where `k` and `lambda` would result in invalid values, and thereby, the warning.  The `L-BFGS-B` method was employed, since this method supports bounds. While a positive value is a strict requirement, a very small value, rather than zero, was chosen, so that numerical stability is maintained, and to avoid singularities in the likelihood function.

**Example 3: Using a Different Optimization Algorithm & Improved Starting Conditions**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import weibull_min

def neg_log_likelihood(params, data):
    k, l = params
    return -np.sum(weibull_min.logpdf(data, k, scale=l))

# Sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = weibull_min.rvs(2, scale=3, size=100)

# Initial guess based on data's mean/variance (a better starting point).
initial_guess = [2, np.mean(data)]

# Optimization with a gradient-based method.
result = minimize(neg_log_likelihood, initial_guess, args=(data,), method='TNC')

print(f"Optimization Result:\n {result} \n")
```

This example demonstrates using a better initial guess, and a different optimizer. Instead of providing an arbitrary guess, the initial guess was created based on the dataset to be fit. Here, the mean of the dataset is used for the initial guess of ‘lambda’ and a value of 2 is used for the initial guess of ‘k’. This approach positions the optimization algorithm closer to the optimal parameter values, reducing exploration through the problem parameter regions.  The `TNC` algorithm was used, as it is another gradient based optimizer, and often performs better than the `Nelder-Mead` option. This example is also less likely to produce the `RuntimeWarning`.

These examples show that, while the `RuntimeWarning` is caused by the structure of the Weibull distribution combined with the numerical optimization process, it can be mitigated through careful consideration of the optimization algorithm, parameter bounds, and starting values.

For further study, I would recommend examining the documentation on the `scipy.optimize` module, paying attention to the available optimization algorithms, their strengths, and limitations, and the requirements they place on parameters. Understanding the theory behind gradient based and derivative-free optimization is also essential for selecting suitable methods. Additional focus should be placed on understanding numerical stability during calculations in scientific computing and the handling of `NaN` and `-Inf` values, which are often associated with these types of warnings.

Finally, studying the Weibull distribution itself can provide crucial insights. Understanding the effect that very small or negative shape parameters have on the distribution will aid in building models which are numerically stable.
