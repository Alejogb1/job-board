One-hot encoding, while straightforward in concept, presents subtle complexities when applied to multiclass text classification within the Keras framework.  My experience working on a large-scale sentiment analysis project involving millions of tweets highlighted the crucial role of careful vectorization and appropriate model architecture choices when dealing with one-hot encoded textual data.  Incorrect handling can lead to significant performance degradation and hinder model generalization.  The key lies in understanding the limitations of this encoding scheme and leveraging Keras's capabilities to mitigate them.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

One-hot encoding represents each unique word in the vocabulary as a vector where all elements are zero except for a single element corresponding to the word's index, which is set to one.  For multiclass text classification, this means each word in a sentence is independently represented.  The entire sentence is then typically represented as the average or sum of its constituent word vectors. This approach, however, discards crucial information like word order and context.  Furthermore, the dimensionality of the input data explodes with increasing vocabulary size, leading to the curse of dimensionality and potential overfitting.  Consequently, techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText) often yield superior performance for text classification tasks.  However, understanding one-hot encoding's implementation remains essential for foundational knowledge and specific scenarios where its simplicity might be advantageous.  In such cases, regularization techniques and carefully chosen model architectures become paramount.

Applying one-hot encoding directly to sentences, rather than individual words, results in an extremely sparse and high-dimensional vector. Each unique sentence becomes a distinct vector, leading to catastrophic memory consumption and impractical model training for even moderately sized datasets. Therefore, the recommended approach is to one-hot encode individual words, then aggregate the word vectors to represent the sentence.  This aggregated representation then serves as the input to the Keras model.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple One-Hot Encoding and Classification:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
sentences = ["This is a positive sentence.", "This is a negative sentence.", "Another positive one."]
labels = [1, 0, 1]  # 1: positive, 0: negative

# Vocabulary creation
vocabulary = set()
for sentence in sentences:
    vocabulary.update(sentence.lower().split())

vocabulary = list(vocabulary)
word_to_index = {word: index for index, word in enumerate(vocabulary)}

# One-hot encoding
def encode_sentence(sentence):
    encoded_sentence = np.zeros(len(vocabulary))
    for word in sentence.lower().split():
        if word in word_to_index:
            encoded_sentence[word_to_index[word]] = 1
    return encoded_sentence

encoded_sentences = [encode_sentence(sentence) for sentence in sentences]

# Model definition
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(len(vocabulary),)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) # Binary classification

# Compilation and training
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(np.array(encoded_sentences), np.array(labels), epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a basic binary classification.  Note the creation of the vocabulary and the straightforward one-hot encoding.  The input layer's shape is defined based on the vocabulary size.  For multi-class, change the output layer and loss function accordingly.


**Example 2: Multiclass Classification with Averaging:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

# Sample data (multiclass)
sentences = ["This is good.", "This is bad.", "It's excellent!", "Terrible product."]
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1] # 0: positive, 1: negative (simplified multiclass)
# Note: this would need more classes for a proper multiclass setup.

# Vocabulary and encoding (similar to Example 1, but adjusted for multiclass)

# Model definition for multiclass
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(len(vocabulary),)))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax')) # Multi-class with softmax

# Compilation and training (adjust loss function)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(np.array(encoded_sentences), np.array(labels), epochs=10)
```

This example extends the previous one to handle a multiclass problem (although simplified for brevity).  Note the use of `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function and the softmax activation function in the output layer for multiclass probability predictions.  The sentence encoding remains the same, although a larger, more representative dataset would be necessary for a real-world application.


**Example 3:  Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, Embedding
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

#... data preprocessing and vocabulary creation as before...

# Use Tokenizer for better out-of-vocabulary word handling.
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=len(vocabulary)) # Limit to vocabulary size
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
encoded_sentences = tokenizer.texts_to_matrix(sentences, mode='binary') #Handles OOV words

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(len(vocabulary),)))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(np.array(encoded_sentences), np.array(labels), epochs=10)

```

This example uses the Keras `Tokenizer` to efficiently handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.  The `texts_to_matrix` function automatically handles words not present in the training vocabulary, avoiding errors.  This is a critical improvement over the previous examples.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation is essential.  Furthermore, a strong grasp of linear algebra and probability is crucial for understanding the underlying mathematics of neural networks and the implications of various activation functions and loss functions.  Finally, a comprehensive textbook on machine learning and deep learning will provide a solid theoretical foundation for effectively implementing and interpreting these models.  Consult these resources to deepen your understanding of the concepts presented.  Consider books dedicated to natural language processing (NLP) for more advanced techniques.
