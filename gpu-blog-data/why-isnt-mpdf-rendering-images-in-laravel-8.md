The most frequent reason for MPdf failing to render images in Laravel 8 projects stems from inadequate path resolution or access permission issues relative to the PDF generation process. Specifically, while the application server can readily locate images for web display, MPdf, running as a separate process within the server environment, often lacks the necessary context to find or read these same resources. This distinction requires careful attention to file paths and permissions.

My experience maintaining a multi-tenant Laravel application utilizing MPdf for report generation has revealed a consistent pattern. Initially, images would appear correctly in the browser but would be conspicuously absent or represented by placeholder boxes in the generated PDF documents. The root cause invariably centered on how MPdf interprets and resolves resource paths within the execution context, a context distinct from the web request lifecycle.

Letâ€™s delve into the technical intricacies. Laravel, when serving a webpage, uses relative or public URLs within HTML to load images. The browser, interpreting these paths relative to the web root, successfully retrieves the images. MPdf, however, does not inherit this web root context. Consequently, paths like `/img/logo.png` are not interpretable; MPdf looks for this file *within its own execution environment*, not the Laravel public directory. If full filesystem paths or incorrect relative paths are supplied, or if permissions prevent the underlying process from reading files, MPdf will not be able to locate and include the images within the PDF.

Another crucial element is the format of path supplied to MPdf. It isn't always sufficient to simply use `public_path('img/logo.png')`. Even this *will return a valid path to the file on the system, that's true.* The underlying `file_get_contents` or other MPdf process for loading the image can encounter errors if permissions are inadequate or if the filesystem path isn't properly passed in the correct format for MPdf to consume. This means the path might need to be properly escaped or the image converted to a base64 data-uri to allow a reliable path resolution.

Consider the following scenarios and their solutions.

**Scenario 1: Relative Paths in HTML Blade Template**

The initial problem often manifests as HTML templates that use relative URLs:

```html
<!-- resources/views/reports/invoice.blade.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Invoice</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Invoice Report</h1>
  <img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Company Logo" />
  <!-- Other invoice content... -->
</body>
</html>
```

When MPdf renders this template, `/img/logo.png` is not a valid path for the file system. The path is relative to the *web request* not the file system.

**Code Example 1: Correcting Relative Paths**

To remedy this, I would modify the Blade template and then the controller:

```html
<!-- resources/views/reports/invoice.blade.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Invoice</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Invoice Report</h1>
    <img src="{{ $logoPath }}" alt="Company Logo" />
    <!-- Other invoice content... -->
</body>
</html>
```

```php
<?php
// app/Http/Controllers/ReportController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use PDF;

class ReportController extends Controller
{
    public function generateInvoice()
    {
        $logoPath = public_path('img/logo.png');
        $pdf = PDF::loadView('reports.invoice', ['logoPath' => $logoPath]);
        return $pdf->download('invoice.pdf');
    }
}
```

In this updated code, the image path is generated with `public_path()` in the controller and is passed to the blade template as a variable named `$logoPath`. MPdf will then attempt to load this file. However, this code could still experience issues, as `public_path()` returns an absolute path, not a web relative path. This may present an issue for MPdf, which is designed to load via relative paths or by a base64 encoded data-uri. This demonstrates the first major hurdle of image loading with MPdf, and is typically the most frequent issue. We are still using absolute system paths.

**Scenario 2: Permission Denied Errors**

Even with correct absolute paths, MPdf can encounter permission problems. If the process running MPdf does not have read permissions for the image files, it won't load them. For most server environments, the user account that the webserver executes as (commonly `www-data` or `nginx`) must have read access to all the files the web server uses.

**Code Example 2: Resolving Permissions via Storage Directory & Using Base64 Encoding**

One solution for the permission and pathing problems is to use a public directory within the `storage` folder that can be made accessible. It is better still if the images are small or cannot be made accessible via url, to simply pass them in as a data-uri (base64). Consider the following code changes:

First modify the config file:

```php
<?php
// config/filesystems.php

    'disks' => [

        // other disks...

        'report_public' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'root' => storage_path('app/public/report-assets'),
            'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage/report-assets',
            'visibility' => 'public',
        ],
    ],
```

Next, add the files to the appropriate directory. If the image is a user uploaded file, such as a profile image, it may be stored in the default `storage/app/public` location. If it is a company logo, it might be located in a sub directory of `/storage/app/public/report-assets`. Then modify the controller as follows:

```php
<?php
// app/Http/Controllers/ReportController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use PDF;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

class ReportController extends Controller
{
    public function generateInvoice()
    {
         $logoPath = public_path('img/logo.png'); // or get the file location dynamically
         $file = Storage::disk('report_public')->getDriver()->read($logoPath);

         $base64 = base64_encode($file);
         $logoPath = "data:image/png;base64," . $base64; // use a dynamic extension if needed

        $pdf = PDF::loadView('reports.invoice', ['logoPath' => $logoPath]);
        return $pdf->download('invoice.pdf');
    }
}
```

By reading the file via the storage driver and then encoding it as a base64 data-uri the pathing and permission problems vanish as the file is part of the HTML content passed to MPdf and not a system file. The HTML must reflect the usage of this base64 image path:

```html
<!-- resources/views/reports/invoice.blade.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Invoice</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Invoice Report</h1>
    <img src="{{ $logoPath }}" alt="Company Logo" />
    <!-- Other invoice content... -->
</body>
</html>
```

This example leverages the storage disk to guarantee that the file is accessible, base64 encodes the data, and then includes it as a data-uri. This is a more robust solution, but can increase the size of the html generated, making it less suited for large or complex images. It is a reliable solution however. Note the `.read` call which will throw an exception if the file isn't available, so consider handling this.

**Scenario 3: Misconfigured MPdf or PHP extensions**

Occasionally, MPdf may fail due to incorrect configurations or missing PHP extensions. MPdf relies on specific PHP extensions like `gd`, `imagick` or `zlib`. If these aren't enabled, or the path to the binary for such libraries isn't accessible, MPdf may fail to render images correctly, or fail altogether.

**Code Example 3: Configuration Check**

While not directly code related, checking these dependencies is critical. I have used a function like the following in the `boot` method of a service provider (ie `AppServiceProvider.php`):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Barryvdh\DomPDF\Facade\Pdf;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{

    public function boot()
    {
        if(config('app.debug'))
        {
            $this->checkPdfDependencies();
        }

    }

    private function checkPdfDependencies()
    {
            $hasGD = extension_loaded('gd');
            $hasImagick = extension_loaded('imagick');
            $hasZlib = extension_loaded('zlib');


            if (!$hasGD) {
                 report(new \Exception("MPdf missing GD Extension")); // Log to laravel.log
                 echo "MPdf missing GD extension. Consider checking php.ini and enable.";
            }
           if(!$hasImagick) {
                report(new \Exception("MPdf missing Imagick Extension"));
                echo "MPdf missing Imagick extension. Consider checking php.ini and enable.";
            }
           if (!$hasZlib) {
                report(new \Exception("MPdf missing Zlib Extension"));
                echo "MPdf missing zlib extension. Consider checking php.ini and enable.";
            }
    }
}
```

By checking and reporting (or logging) issues with the base PHP configuration, time spent chasing path issues can be reduced, making it easier to identify underlying problems. This is also where checking other MPdf settings, such as the location of `ttf` fonts, might resolve any deeper config problems.

In summary, image rendering failures with MPdf in Laravel 8 frequently boil down to pathing, permissions, or missing dependencies. Prioritize understanding MPdf's execution context, employing absolute or base64 paths, confirming file permissions, and ensuring the requisite PHP extensions are installed and enabled. The solutions outlined above represent my most frequent resolutions to these common issues.
