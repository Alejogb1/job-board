The inherent sequential nature of Keras model training, stemming from its reliance on TensorFlow or Theano backends, initially suggests limitations in directly leveraging multiprocessing for substantial performance gains.  However, my experience optimizing large-scale neural network training pipelines reveals that a nuanced approach can yield significant improvements, circumventing the apparent limitations.  The key lies not in directly parallelizing the model training itself, but rather in parallelizing the data preprocessing and augmentation stages, as well as the evaluation of multiple models trained independently.

**1.  Explanation:**

Directly applying multiprocessing to the Keras `fit()` method is generally unproductive.  The underlying computational graph, built by TensorFlow or Theano, is optimized for single-threaded execution, with internal parallelization handled by the backend.  Attempts to force multiprocessing at this level often lead to contention and reduced performance due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python and the overhead of inter-process communication.  Furthermore, the statefulness of the model during training makes it difficult to guarantee data consistency across processes.

Instead, the most effective strategy centers on parallelizing the operations *surrounding* the model training.  These tasks are typically CPU-bound, making them ideal candidates for multiprocessing. This approach includes:

* **Data preprocessing:**  Tasks such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation are computationally intensive and can be easily parallelized.  Each process can handle a subset of the data, independently preparing it for the model.

* **Data generation:** Custom data generators, a vital component in training large datasets, can be modified to utilize multiprocessing, loading and preparing batches concurrently.

* **Model evaluation:** When comparing multiple model architectures or hyperparameter settings, the evaluation phase on a validation or test set can be significantly accelerated by distributing the evaluation across multiple processes. Each process evaluates a subset of the data and reports its results.

* **Independent model training (with limitations):** Training multiple, entirely separate Keras models concurrently across different processes presents minimal risk of data inconsistency or deadlocks, provided each model utilizes its own dataset and resources.  This is particularly effective in hyperparameter optimization using techniques such as grid search or random search.  One should ensure appropriate mechanisms to store and compare model performance at the end.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Parallelizing Data Augmentation:**

```python
import multiprocessing
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import numpy as np

def augment_images(images, datagen):
    """Augments a batch of images using a given ImageDataGenerator."""
    return datagen.flow(images, batch_size=len(images)).next()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize ImageDataGenerator
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20, width_shift_range=0.2, ...)

    # Sample image data
    images = np.random.rand(1000, 64, 64, 3)  # 1000 images, 64x64 pixels, 3 channels

    # Split the image data across processes
    num_processes = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    chunk_size = len(images) // num_processes
    image_chunks = [images[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(images), chunk_size)]

    # Create a pool of processes
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        augmented_chunks = pool.starmap(augment_images, [(chunk, datagen) for chunk in image_chunks])

    # Combine the augmented chunks
    augmented_images = np.concatenate(augmented_chunks)

```

This example demonstrates how data augmentation, a computationally expensive step, can be efficiently parallelized using `multiprocessing.Pool`. Each process handles a subset of the images, applying augmentations independently. The results are then combined into a single array.

**Example 2: Parallel Model Evaluation:**

```python
import multiprocessing
from keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

def evaluate_model(model_path, x, y):
    """Evaluates a Keras model on a given data subset."""
    model = load_model(model_path)
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x, y, verbose=0)
    return loss, accuracy

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data
    x_test = np.random.rand(1000, 100)  # 1000 samples with 100 features
    y_test = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Binary classification labels

    # Model paths
    model_paths = ["model1.h5", "model2.h5", "model3.h5"]

    # Split the test data
    num_processes = len(model_paths)
    chunk_size = len(x_test) // num_processes
    x_chunks = [x_test[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(x_test), chunk_size)]
    y_chunks = [y_test[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(y_test), chunk_size)]

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
      results = pool.starmap(evaluate_model, zip(model_paths, x_chunks, y_chunks))


    # Aggregate and print results:
    for i, (loss, accuracy) in enumerate(results):
        print(f"Model {i+1}: Loss={loss:.4f}, Accuracy={accuracy:.4f}")
```

This example shows parallel evaluation of multiple pre-trained Keras models.  Each process loads a model and evaluates it on a partitioned subset of the test data. Results are then aggregated for comparison.

**Example 3:  Independent Model Training (Simplified):**

```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

def train_model(train_data, model_config):
    """Trains a Keras model."""
    x_train, y_train = train_data
    model = Sequential(model_config)
    model.compile(...)  # Compile with appropriate optimizer and loss function
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
    return model.get_weights()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Simplified data setup (replace with your actual dataset):
  x_train = np.random.rand(500, 10)
  y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 500)
  # Create multiple datasets for independent training:
  data_sets = [(x_train[:250], y_train[:250]), (x_train[250:], y_train[250:])]
  model_configs = [[Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')],
                  [Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')]]


  with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=2) as pool:
      model_weights = pool.starmap(train_model, zip(data_sets, model_configs))

  # Handle weights:  (You will need suitable logic to save/load and compare)
  print("Training finished.  Weights are now available.")

```
This demonstrates training two distinct models concurrently. Each process receives its own data and model architecture; therefore, there's no risk of inter-process conflicts. The `model.get_weights()` call returns the trained weights to be stored for later analysis.  Note that this example simplifies data splitting and model configuration for brevity; real-world applications would require more robust data handling and hyperparameter management.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend exploring the official documentation for `multiprocessing` within the Python standard library, and the documentation for your chosen Keras backend (TensorFlow or Theano).  A thorough understanding of the GIL's impact on multiprocessing in Python is also essential.  Finally, investigating advanced techniques like `concurrent.futures` and exploring parallelization strategies in data loading libraries (such as `Dask`) can enhance performance further.  These resources will provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge for effectively applying multiprocessing in Keras-based projects.
