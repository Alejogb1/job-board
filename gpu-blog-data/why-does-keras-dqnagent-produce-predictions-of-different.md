The core discrepancy observed with Keras DQNAgent predictions changing shape on the second iteration stems from the agent's inherent mechanism of transitioning from exploration to exploitation and the delayed initialization of target network parameters, particularly concerning the Q-function's output layer. During the initial learning phase, when the agent interacts with the environment, it relies heavily on exploration, utilizing a randomly initialized Q-network to make decisions. This network, typically modeled with a fully connected layer for the final output predicting Q-values, does not yet reflect the underlying reward structure of the environment. Upon the first interaction with a training batch and the first `fit` call, the primary Q-network undergoes parameter updates based on observed experience. However, the target network, a copy of the primary network, often lags in its updates, and it’s this delay combined with the inherent shape variation at initialization of dense layers that causes the observed behaviour.

Specifically, consider a scenario where we are using a standard fully connected (Dense) output layer in the Keras model with a defined number of actions, such as three. When Keras initializes the weights of this Dense layer, it does so with small random values, according to a suitable initializer such as Glorot uniform or normal. Critically, these random values at the start are different every time the model is initialized, unless explicit seed setting is in place. The number of parameters of this final fully connected layer depends on the number of input features coming to the layer (prior layer size) multiplied by the number of actions the agent can take, plus biases. These random values cause the different output shape on the very first `fit` call, before being propagated to the target network.

The first `fit` call calculates loss based on the primary Q-network's prediction and the actual target Q-values computed using the target network's output and reward received. On that first `fit` call, the primary Q network outputs are based on the original random weights, resulting in a different shape that the target network. Due to the target network parameters typically being updated with a delayed copy or exponential average, the target network will almost always output a different prediction shape at the start. On the second iteration, the primary network’s weights are slightly changed, and the target network weights are often updated (typically after several steps to introduce stability), this results in the prediction shape changing. The important observation is that the shape is technically the same, i.e., `(batch_size, actions)`, but the numerical values inside are different. This different numerical output, due to updates to different networks after initialisation, is the core of the shape differences one observes. This is not a bug, but an inherent consequence of the delayed target updates in DQN methods. The shape only *appears* to be different between the networks on the first and second `fit` calls.

Let's illustrate this with code examples. Assume a simplified environment with four possible states and three possible actions, using a basic multi-layer perceptron:

**Example 1: Model Initialization and First Prediction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input

# Parameters
num_states = 4
num_actions = 3
batch_size = 32

# Create Q-network Model
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(num_states,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_actions) # Output Layer
])

# Dummy Input (Batch size 32)
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, num_states))

# Make Initial Predictions
initial_predictions = model(dummy_input)
print(f"Initial Prediction Shape: {initial_predictions.shape}")
print(f"Initial Prediction Values (first 3 of batch): {initial_predictions.numpy()[0:3,:]}\n")
```

This code snippet initializes a Keras model and generates initial predictions using a dummy input. The output will show a shape of `(32, 3)` , since the `Dense(3)` output layer predicts three Q-values for every observation in the batch. The printed values of the initial predictions will show randomly sampled numbers and are different between runs because of the random initialization. It showcases that the initialization of the Q-network's output layer results in unique, random weights, giving unique predictions.

**Example 2: First Fit and Prediction Change**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Parameters
num_states = 4
num_actions = 3
batch_size = 32

# Create Q-network Model
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(num_states,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_actions)  # Output layer
])

# Dummy Input (Batch size 32)
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, num_states))

# Dummy target Q values, some random numbers
target_q_values = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, num_actions))

# Optimizer (Adam with learning rate 0.001)
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# First fit
model.fit(dummy_input, target_q_values, epochs=1, verbose=0)

# Predictions After first fit
first_fit_predictions = model(dummy_input)
print(f"Predictions After First Fit: {first_fit_predictions.shape}")
print(f"Predictions After First Fit (first 3 of batch): {first_fit_predictions.numpy()[0:3,:]}")
```
This second code shows a critical step. Here we train the Q-network on dummy targets for one single iteration (`epochs=1`). The output predictions after this first training will show a new prediction shape `(32, 3)` again, as before. The difference is that the *values* at every batch position will now be different from the initial one due to backpropagation and gradient descent. As the primary Q-network parameters have been updated from the randomly initialized state, any predictions derived from it after the first fit will display a variance in the numerical output. Crucially, note that the shape is *still* `(32, 3)`. This output change, which is a change in values and not the output shape per se, highlights the impact of parameter updates during learning. The target network predictions will be similar to the initial model predictions at the start of the training, since the updates to target network are usually delayed to improve stability, resulting in different shapes being observed from different networks.

**Example 3: Target Network and Delayed Update Simulation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Parameters
num_states = 4
num_actions = 3
batch_size = 32

# Create Q-network Model
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(num_states,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_actions)  # Output layer
])

# Create Target Q-network Model (initially a copy)
target_model = tf.keras.models.clone_model(model)
target_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

# Dummy Input (Batch size 32)
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, num_states))

# Dummy target Q values
target_q_values = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, num_actions))

# Optimizer
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Predictions from Target Before fit
target_predictions_before_fit = target_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Target Predictions Before Fit: {target_predictions_before_fit.shape}")
print(f"Target Predictions Before Fit (first 3 of batch): {target_predictions_before_fit.numpy()[0:3,:]}\n")

# Fit Primary Model
model.fit(dummy_input, target_q_values, epochs=1, verbose=0)

# Make Predictions After fit
first_fit_predictions = model(dummy_input)
print(f"Predictions After First Fit: {first_fit_predictions.shape}")
print(f"Predictions After First Fit (first 3 of batch): {first_fit_predictions.numpy()[0:3,:]}")


# Update Target Model, assuming a simple replacement after 1 fit call
target_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

# Prediction from Target after update
target_predictions_after_fit = target_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Target Predictions After Update: {target_predictions_after_fit.shape}")
print(f"Target Predictions After Update (first 3 of batch): {target_predictions_after_fit.numpy()[0:3,:]}")
```
This example expands to include a target network. After initialization, the target network's prediction is almost identical to the primary network’s prediction, as it starts as a copy. After the first `fit` call, we can see the main prediction output shape has changed (not the shape, but the values inside, as discussed before). Critically, the target network's predictions are different from the primary's due to the main network update. After we manually update the target weights (in a real scenario, this is delayed), the target prediction values match the primary one. This difference in values explains why, after first fit, the two networks will output predictions with the same shape, but very different values.

For further investigation, I would suggest reviewing the source code for the Keras `DQNAgent`, with a careful focus on how target networks are initialized and updated, usually using techniques such as delayed copying or exponential averaging. I would also recommend reading about parameter initialization strategies (like Xavier/Glorot initialization) and how they affect the distribution of initial network outputs. Exploring different optimization techniques and their impact on the convergence of the model might also be insightful. Books on Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning will also provide useful background information. Studying research articles covering Double DQN and other advanced DQN techniques can enhance the understanding of target network implementations. Consulting relevant documentation of TensorFlow/Keras and its implementations of Reinforcement Learning agents is recommended.
