In D, both `const` and `enum` serve to define named values, but they do so with fundamentally different semantics and applications, stemming from D's inherent emphasis on compile-time evaluation and type safety. Having spent years working on embedded systems development where performance and correctness are paramount, I've learned to appreciate the nuances of these features. `const` introduces a read-only variable, whereas `enum` establishes a type consisting of a set of named constants.

`const`, in D, creates a named constant variable. Its value is fixed at compile time and cannot be altered during program execution. However, the compiler isn't strictly required to determine its value at compile time; it's the read-only *characteristic* that defines `const`. Crucially, a `const` variable has a specific type, dictated during its definition. This type dictates how the value is stored in memory. The initializer for a `const` variable can involve complex expressions, as long as these are computable at compile time. `const` declarations are useful for defining unchanging configurations, mathematical constants, or other values that should never be modified during the program's life cycle, thereby improving code clarity and reducing the risk of accidental modification.

An `enum`, on the other hand, defines a named type representing a set of possible values. These values are compile-time constants, and are members of the defined `enum` type. They are *not* variables; they are symbolic names representing integer values. By default, the compiler automatically assigns integer values (starting from 0) to the `enum` members. Explicit integer values can also be provided if required. The underlying type of an `enum` can be specified, for example `enum E : int` to define the enumeration as using the `int` type, or any other integer type. `enum`s are frequently used for representing a finite set of states, options, or flags. When handling state machines, command parsing, or similar finite domain scenarios, the type safety imposed by `enum` can greatly improve code maintainability and reduce logical errors.

The distinction becomes apparent in memory allocation and type checking. A `const` variable occupies memory space that depends on its type (e.g., a `const int` typically reserves 4 bytes of memory). An `enum` value, as a compile-time constant, is not associated with a specific memory location. Instead, the compiler substitutes the `enum` member with its underlying integer value during compilation, similarly to macros in C/C++, but with the added type safety of a named type. The type system ensures that `enum` values can only be used where a variable of that specific `enum` type is expected, preventing accidental mixing of unrelated integer values.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the differences:

```d
// Example 1: const declarations
const int maxBufferSize = 1024; // A constant integer
const float pi = 3.14159; // A constant float
const char[] greeting = "Hello D!"; // A constant string

void processBuffer(const ubyte[] buffer) {
   // buffer can not be modified since it's const
   // ... processing
}

void main()
{
   ubyte[maxBufferSize] buffer; // Using maxBufferSize
   processBuffer(buffer);
}
```

In the first example, `maxBufferSize`, `pi`, and `greeting` are `const` variables. Their values are fixed, and attempts to modify them would result in a compile-time error. Observe the `processBuffer` function, it takes a `const ubyte[]` which can't be mutated inside the function. `maxBufferSize` is used to declare a buffer with a fixed size, illustrating how compile-time constants can influence array size declaration. The `ubyte` type is an alias for `unsigned byte`, this is an example of user-defined types being utilized in conjunction with `const`.

```d
// Example 2: enum declaration and usage
enum TrafficLight : int {
    Red = 1,
    Yellow = 2,
    Green = 3
}

void handleTraffic(TrafficLight light) {
    switch (light) {
    case TrafficLight.Red:
        // Stop the car
        break;
    case TrafficLight.Yellow:
        // Prepare to stop
        break;
    case TrafficLight.Green:
        // Proceed
        break;
     default:
       assert(false);
    }
}

void main()
{
   TrafficLight currentLight = TrafficLight.Red;
   handleTraffic(currentLight);
   currentLight = TrafficLight.Green;
   handleTraffic(currentLight);
}

```

In the second example, `TrafficLight` is an `enum` with three members: `Red`, `Yellow`, and `Green`. Each member is implicitly associated with an integer value specified after the `=` sign. The `handleTraffic` function demonstrates how an `enum` type ensures type-safe handling within a switch statement, preventing accidental assignments of unrelated integer values, as well as ensuring every valid enum member is handled in the switch statement. The enum is used to express the state of a traffic light, rather than using raw integer values.

```d
// Example 3: const vs enum
const int startValue = 10;
enum  Action : int {
   None,
   Start = startValue, // error: compile time const required for enums
   Stop
}


void main()
{
    const int otherValue = 10 + 2; // compile time known values are allowed
    enum ActionTwo : int {
      NoneTwo,
      StartTwo = otherValue, // compile time known values are allowed
      StopTwo
    }
}
```

In the third example, an attempt to initialize an enum member with a `const` variable `startValue` which is not a compile-time constant results in a compile-time error. This is because, as mentioned previously, enum members are compile-time constants and must be initialized with a literal or a compile-time constant expression. However, when initializing an `enum` inside of `main`, the value `otherValue` which is a `const` with a compile-time known value can be used to initialize `StartTwo`. This further clarifies that `const` variables are not always compile-time known while `enum` constants have to be. This is an important distinction.

For deeper understanding, I would recommend exploring the official D documentation, particularly the sections on `const` variables and `enum` types. The book "Programming in D" by Ali Çehreli offers detailed insights on type systems and compile-time metaprogramming. For practical examples, studying the source code of D's standard library (Phobos) can be quite revealing, since it makes extensive use of both `const` and `enum` to build high quality software. Another worthwhile resource are the language-specific tutorials and guides available on the D programming language’s official website, which often provide hands-on exercises to reinforce concepts. Focusing on these resources will solidify the understanding of `const` versus `enum` in D, which are essential parts of writing safe and efficient code.
