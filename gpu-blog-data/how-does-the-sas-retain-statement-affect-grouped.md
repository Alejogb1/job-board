The SAS `RETAIN` statement, when used in conjunction with `BY` group processing, significantly alters the default behavior of data step variables, specifically how values are retained or reset at the beginning of each group. Understanding this interaction is critical for precise data manipulation, especially when creating lagged variables, accumulating values within groups, or performing other sequential computations.

Without a `RETAIN` statement, variables created within a SAS data step are implicitly set to missing at the beginning of each iteration of the data step, and therefore at the start of each BY group. This means that any value assigned in a previous observation, even within the same group, is lost unless explicitly retained. The `RETAIN` statement modifies this default by instructing SAS to hold the value of specified variables across observations, including the transitions from one group to the next. This ability to preserve values is paramount for performing calculations that require knowledge of past data points within a group.

Consider, for instance, creating a cumulative sum within each `BY` group. Without `RETAIN`, the accumulated total would be reset for every observation, regardless of the group. The `RETAIN` statement allows the total to carry over from observation to observation, but within the scope of the current BY group. Once SAS encounters a change in the BY variable, the retained variable's value persists from the last observation of the old group and then starts being re-used for the new group, therefore allowing a unique sum for each group. This fundamental difference in behavior distinguishes the functionality of the `RETAIN` statement in grouped data processing from its use in non-grouped data.

Let’s delve into specific code examples to solidify this concept. First, suppose we have a dataset of employee salaries by department, and we wish to compute the cumulative salary for each department. We have a dataset called `salaries` with variables `department` (a string) and `salary` (a numeric value). Without using `RETAIN`, the following code would yield an incorrect result:

```sas
data cumulative_salaries_incorrect;
  set salaries;
  by department;
  cumulative_salary = cumulative_salary + salary;
run;
```

This code would only calculate the salary for each record as the `cumulative_salary` variable would be reset to missing for every observation. This would yield a single cumulative sum for every observation in the original `salaries` dataset. To correct this and retain the values across records in the same group, I must use the `RETAIN` statement:

```sas
data cumulative_salaries_correct;
  set salaries;
  by department;
  retain cumulative_salary 0;
  cumulative_salary = cumulative_salary + salary;
run;
```

In this revised code, the `retain cumulative_salary 0;` statement instructs SAS to retain the value of `cumulative_salary` across observations within a `department` group. The initial value of zero is also specified, ensuring the sum starts from a correct base. When a new department is encountered, the value carries over from the last observation of the previous department, as I described earlier. This means the cumulative sum restarts at the beginning of each department. This is the standard and recommended way of creating cumulative values.

The second example demonstrates how `RETAIN` can create lagged variables within groups. Imagine I want to compare the current salary of each employee to the salary of the employee who came immediately before in the same department (assuming the data is sorted by employee id within department). Here is the data step that accomplishes this. Again, imagine the source dataset is named `salaries` with `department`, `employee_id`, and `salary`.

```sas
data lagged_salaries;
  set salaries;
  by department;
  retain previous_salary;
  lagged_salary = salary - previous_salary;
  previous_salary = salary;
run;
```

In this example, `retain previous_salary;` instructs SAS to preserve the value of `previous_salary` across records in each department group. The logic of this code is such that it first calculates the difference between the `salary` and the `previous_salary`, before overwriting the value of `previous_salary` with the current `salary`. During the first iteration within each department, `previous_salary` will be missing, as will `lagged_salary`. However, from the second observation onward, `lagged_salary` reflects the change between the current and the immediately preceding salary within that department, while respecting the BY group boundaries. Without the `RETAIN` statement, `previous_salary` would be missing for every observation.

My final example focuses on calculating a moving average within groups. Consider a dataset with daily stock prices categorized by stock ticker. I am creating a simple three-day moving average. The underlying dataset is called `stock_prices` with variables `ticker`, `date`, and `price`.

```sas
data moving_average;
  set stock_prices;
  by ticker;
  retain price_1 price_2 price_3;
  price_1 = price_2;
  price_2 = price_3;
  price_3 = price;
  if _n_ >= 3 then moving_average = (price_1 + price_2 + price_3) / 3;
run;
```

This code maintains three past price values in `price_1`, `price_2`, and `price_3` using the `RETAIN` statement. Each day the price values are shifted over and the new day's price is added to `price_3`. Then, if the record is the third or greater in the group (indicated by the _n_ value), the moving average is computed. Because `RETAIN` is included, the correct moving average is computed for each ticker independently. If the statement were omitted, the `price_1`, `price_2`, and `price_3` variables would all be reset at each observation within the ticker group, resulting in incorrect moving average calculations. Again, without the `RETAIN` statement, these previous variables would be missing.

The `RETAIN` statement's impact on grouped data hinges on its ability to override the default reset behavior of SAS data step variables. The statement is not, however, a universal solution and must be used with caution. Over-reliance on the statement can lead to confusion and incorrect values, especially if not carefully considered within the context of `BY` group processing. Careful attention to initialization and the order of operations within the data step are required for correct results.

For further study, I would recommend consulting the SAS documentation on the `RETAIN` statement and its usage within data steps. Specifically, familiarize yourself with the implicit looping of the data step and how it interacts with the BY group processing. The textbook "The Little SAS Book" provides a strong basic understanding of data step logic. Also, “Learning SAS by Example” by Ron Cody, has examples of using the `RETAIN` statement within group processing contexts. Examining publicly available SAS datasets and working through different transformations will allow for an empirical understanding of the statement's behavior in practical scenarios. These resources, coupled with carefully reviewing the SAS logs, will solidify your comprehension of the subtle, yet profound, impact of the `RETAIN` statement on grouped data processing.
