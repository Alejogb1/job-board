The discrepancy between `fit()` and `fit_generator()` in Keras (or TensorFlow/Keras) stems fundamentally from how each function handles data input and batching.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, involving image classification, time series forecasting, and natural language processing, highlights a critical difference: `fit()` operates on a single, in-memory dataset, while `fit_generator()` processes data in batches generated on-the-fly, potentially introducing variability due to differing batch compositions and order. This inherent difference affects model training dynamics, especially concerning stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`fit()` loads the entire dataset into memory before commencing training. This guarantees consistency in the order of data presentation to the model during each epoch.  The batching process, while still present, operates on a pre-defined, unchanging dataset.  Therefore, barring numerical instability issues within the optimization algorithm itself, the training trajectory should remain deterministic.  This deterministic nature simplifies debugging and ensures reproducibility of results.

Conversely, `fit_generator()` (and its successor, `fit` with `data_generator` in newer versions of TensorFlow/Keras), relies on a data generator that yields batches dynamically.  Each epoch involves processing a potentially different ordering of the data. This is crucial since data generators often shuffle the dataset before each epoch.  Even with the same underlying data, a different random shuffle will lead to different gradients during each training step. The non-deterministic nature of this process results in slightly varying weight updates in each epoch.  Furthermore, differences in batch composition—the specific data points included in a batch—can also affect the gradient calculations, especially with smaller batch sizes where a single outlier can have a disproportionate influence.

The impact of these differences is most pronounced when dealing with large datasets that cannot fit into memory.  `fit()` would fail in these cases.  `fit_generator()` becomes necessary but the price is the loss of strict reproducibility.  The variations, however, usually remain within a reasonable margin of error.  Significant deviations often point to underlying issues like improperly implemented generators, inconsistent data preprocessing, or inherent stochasticity within the optimizer itself.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  `fit()` with a simple dataset:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate a small, simple dataset
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]])
y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1])

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model using fit()
history_fit = model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=2)

# Print the training history
print(history_fit.history)
```

This example demonstrates the use of `fit()` with a small, entirely in-memory dataset.  The training process is deterministic due to the fixed order of data presentation.  The `history_fit.history` dictionary will contain consistent training metrics across multiple runs.


**Example 2:  `fit_generator()` with a custom generator:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence

# Custom data generator class
class DataGenerator(Sequence):
    def __init__(self, X, y, batch_size=32):
        self.X = X
        self.y = y
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(len(self.X) / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_X = self.X[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        batch_y = self.y[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        return batch_X, batch_y

# Generate a larger dataset (simulated)
X_large = np.random.rand(1000, 2)
y_large = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Create the data generator
data_generator = DataGenerator(X_large, y_large, batch_size=32)

# Define and compile the model (same as Example 1)
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model using fit_generator() (or fit with generator)
history_generator = model.fit(data_generator, epochs=10)

# Print the training history
print(history_generator.history)
```

This illustrates the use of a custom data generator with `fit()`.  Note that the generator shuffles the data internally; running this multiple times will yield slightly different results due to the stochastic nature of the batching process.


**Example 3: Handling potential discrepancies:**

```python
# ... (Previous code from Example 2) ...

# Set the seed for reproducibility (limited effect with generator)
np.random.seed(42)

# Train the model again, and compare results
history_generator_seeded = model.fit(data_generator, epochs=10)

# Analyze differences between history_generator and history_generator_seeded
# For instance, calculate mean absolute differences in metrics across epochs.
# Significant differences still might warrant investigation into generator implementation.
```


This example attempts to mitigate some of the randomness by setting a seed.  However, it's crucial to understand that this only affects the initial shuffling within the generator and does not eliminate all sources of variation due to the batching process itself.  Significant differences might still indicate issues within the generator's implementation, data preprocessing, or the optimizer.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of stochastic gradient descent and its variants, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks and research papers on optimization algorithms.  Understanding the intricacies of data generators in Keras/TensorFlow is crucial; exploring the official documentation and examples provided by these frameworks is highly beneficial.  Finally,  reviewing advanced topics in numerical stability and floating-point arithmetic might reveal the root cause of any significant discrepancies observed.  These areas together provide a robust foundation for tackling such issues effectively.
