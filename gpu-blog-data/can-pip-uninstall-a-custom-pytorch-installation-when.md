The core issue lies in PyTorch's complex dependency structure and pip's resolution algorithm.  Pip, while adept at managing Python packages, doesn't inherently understand the nuances of compiled extensions like those frequently found in PyTorch.  My experience troubleshooting similar scenarios across numerous projects, particularly involving large-scale machine learning deployments, highlighted the limitations of relying solely on pip's uninstall mechanisms in situations with custom PyTorch builds.  A straightforward `pip uninstall torch` often proves insufficient, especially when dealing with system-level dependencies or non-standard installation paths.  The behaviour depends heavily on how the custom PyTorch installation was originally performed, the operating system, and the presence of conflicting packages.

**1. Clear Explanation**

A successful pip uninstall hinges on accurate metadata.  When you install a package with pip, metadata detailing file locations, dependencies, and other relevant information is recorded.  Pip uses this metadata to remove files during the uninstall process.  However, custom PyTorch installations frequently deviate from standard procedures, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate metadata.  For instance, a custom build might involve manual installation of CUDA extensions or placement of libraries in non-standard locations.  This leads pip to overlook specific files or directories, leaving remnants of the PyTorch installation behind.

Furthermore, a dependent package's `requirements.txt` might explicitly specify a PyTorch version or only a major version number (e.g., `torch>=1.13`). This specification might trigger an attempt by pip to install or upgrade PyTorch, not necessarily uninstall the custom version. The package manager's resolution process might prioritize satisfying the dependency requirement over explicitly removing an existing, potentially conflicting installation.  This is especially true if the dependent package's dependencies are ambiguous or inconsistent.  A complex dependency tree can lead pip to a state where it seemingly satisfies the requirement without completely removing the custom PyTorch installation.

Finally, consider the potential for system-level conflicts. A custom PyTorch installation might have overwritten system files or created symbolic links.  Pip's uninstall operation, designed for user-level packages, will not automatically address these system-level modifications.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Standard pip uninstall (often insufficient)**

```python
# This attempts a standard pip uninstall.  It's unlikely to fully remove a custom installation.
import subprocess

try:
    subprocess.check_call(['pip', 'uninstall', '-y', 'torch'])
    print("Successfully uninstalled torch (likely incomplete for custom installations).")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error uninstalling torch: {e}")

```

*Commentary:* This showcases a common approach. The `-y` flag automatically answers 'yes' to prompts, assuming a silent uninstall is acceptable.  The `try...except` block handles potential errors during the uninstall process. However, its effectiveness is limited for non-standard installations.  The output message emphasizes the likely incompleteness.


**Example 2:  Attempting to locate and remove custom installation paths (more effective)**

```python
import os
import shutil

custom_pytorch_path = "/opt/my_custom_pytorch" # Replace with your actual custom path

if os.path.exists(custom_pytorch_path):
    try:
        shutil.rmtree(custom_pytorch_path)
        print(f"Successfully removed custom PyTorch installation at {custom_pytorch_path}")
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error removing custom PyTorch installation: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Custom PyTorch installation not found at {custom_pytorch_path}")
```

*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates a more proactive approach.  It requires knowing the exact location of your custom PyTorch installation. It uses `shutil.rmtree` to recursively delete the directory containing the custom installation.  This is significantly more robust for completely removing a custom installation, but requires prior knowledge of its location and careful consideration to avoid unintended deletion of other files.  Error handling is included to manage potential issues during the deletion process.


**Example 3: Using `conda` for environment management (recommended for complex scenarios)**

```bash
# Assuming your custom PyTorch is in a conda environment. Replace 'myenv' with your environment name.
conda activate myenv
conda uninstall pytorch
conda deactivate
```

*Commentary:*  This highlights the advantages of using `conda` for environment management.  `conda` creates isolated environments, preventing conflicts between different Python versions and packages. If your custom PyTorch installation resided within a `conda` environment, using `conda uninstall` offers a more reliable and cleaner way to remove it.  It handles dependencies more effectively than pip in this context.  The `conda deactivate` command exits the environment after the uninstall.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official PyTorch documentation for installation and uninstallation instructions specific to your operating system and CUDA version.  Refer to the pip documentation for advanced usage options and dependency resolution. Review the `conda` documentation for environment management best practices.  Examine the documentation for any specific package managers used during your custom PyTorch installation.  Finally, use your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`) to remove any lingering system-level dependencies if necessary.  Careful examination of your system's file structure and package manager logs will assist in identifying remnants of your installation.
