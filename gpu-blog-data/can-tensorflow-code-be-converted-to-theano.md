Direct conversion of TensorFlow code to Theano is generally infeasible.  The fundamental architectural differences between the two frameworks, particularly in their computational graph construction and operation management, present significant hurdles to any automated translation.  Over the years, I've worked extensively with both, leading several projects involving large-scale neural network deployments, and have encountered this limitation numerous times.  While superficial similarities exist in their APIs at a high level, the underlying mechanisms are distinct enough to require substantial manual rewriting.

My experience stems from attempting to migrate a legacy Theano-based image recognition system to TensorFlow for improved performance and scalability.  The project highlighted the non-trivial nature of this undertaking.  While the core logic of the neural networks could be conceptually transferred, the practical implementation demanded a detailed understanding of both frameworks’ internal workings.  The effort involved was far greater than simply substituting function calls.  This necessitated a complete restructuring of the codebase, rather than a simple, automated conversion.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow and Theano, while both symbolic computation frameworks for defining and executing computations, notably differ in their approach to graph construction and execution.  Theano builds a computational graph dynamically, compiling the graph upon each function call. This characteristic makes it suitable for research purposes and smaller projects where immediate feedback is crucial, but can be computationally inefficient for large-scale deployments.

Conversely, TensorFlow, in its early versions, employed a static graph definition.  The graph was constructed entirely before execution, allowing for optimization and efficient deployment across multiple devices including GPUs and TPUs.  This static nature enabled scalability and performance optimizations not readily available in Theano’s dynamic approach.  While TensorFlow 2.x introduced eager execution, allowing for dynamic graph building like Theano, the underlying graph optimization capabilities remain a core differentiator.

Furthermore, the APIs differ significantly.  TensorFlow utilizes a more structured, object-oriented approach to tensor manipulation and operation definition.  Theano, on the other hand, offers a more functional paradigm, sometimes requiring more explicit control over memory management and tensor manipulation.  These fundamental differences necessitate a deep understanding of both frameworks to successfully perform any porting.  Simply replacing Theano operations with their TensorFlow equivalents rarely yields a functional outcome, especially concerning complex operations involving custom gradients or advanced features.

Beyond syntactic differences, semantic disparities further complicate the process. Theano's reliance on scan for recurrent operations and its unique handling of symbolic differentiation introduce subtleties that are not directly translatable. TensorFlow provides similar functionality through `tf.scan` and its automatic differentiation capabilities, yet the implementation details often diverge, demanding manual adaptation of the algorithm.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's consider three simplified scenarios illustrating the differences and the difficulties involved in conversion:


**Example 1:  Simple Matrix Multiplication**

**Theano:**

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

x = T.matrix('x')
y = T.matrix('y')
z = T.dot(x, y)
f = theano.function([x, y], z)

result = f([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
print(result)
```

**TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
y = tf.Variable([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
z = tf.matmul(x, y)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  result = sess.run(z)
print(result)
```

Commentary:  While both examples perform matrix multiplication, the code structures differ significantly.  Theano employs a functional approach, defining a function `f` which takes inputs and returns the result. TensorFlow, in this example using the older session-based style, requires explicit variable initialization and session management.  This represents a superficial difference, but illustrates the underlying paradigm shift.


**Example 2:  Recurrent Neural Network Layer (Simplified)**

**Theano:**

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

def rnn_layer(x, h_prev, W_xh, W_hh, b):
    h = T.tanh(T.dot(x, W_xh) + T.dot(h_prev, W_hh) + b)
    return h

# ... (rest of the RNN definition with Theano's scan) ...
```

**TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def rnn_layer(x, h_prev, W_xh, W_hh, b):
  h = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(x, W_xh) + tf.matmul(h_prev, W_hh) + b)
  return h

# ... (rest of the RNN definition, likely using tf.scan or tf.keras.layers.RNN) ...
```

Commentary: The basic RNN layer shows superficial similarity. However, implementing the entire RNN using Theano’s `scan` versus TensorFlow's `tf.scan` or `tf.keras.layers.RNN` would differ substantially.  Theano requires careful management of scan's iterations and output handling, demanding a distinct programming style compared to TensorFlow's more abstract higher-level APIs for recurrent layers.


**Example 3:  Custom Gradient Implementation**

This is where the differences become starkest. Let's imagine a custom activation function with a non-standard derivative:


**Theano:**

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

def custom_activation(x):
    return T.log(1 + T.exp(x)) # Example; the gradient is easily calculated

x = T.scalar('x')
y = custom_activation(x)
gy = T.grad(y, x)
f = theano.function([x], gy)
print(f(1))
```


**TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def custom_activation(x):
  y = tf.math.log(1.0 + tf.math.exp(x))
  def grad(dy):
    return dy * tf.math.exp(x) / (1.0 + tf.math.exp(x))
  return y, grad

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = custom_activation(x)
    
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(dy_dx)
```

Commentary: Defining a custom gradient in Theano involves directly calculating and providing the derivative.  TensorFlow's `@tf.custom_gradient` decorator provides a more structured way to specify the gradient function, handling the backpropagation automatically. This architectural difference makes direct translation incredibly challenging.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials.  For Theano, consulting the archived documentation and related research papers is beneficial.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and calculus is paramount for effective usage of either framework.  Familiarity with Python's scientific computing libraries, including NumPy, is essential.  Finally, experience with other deep learning frameworks could broaden your understanding of the underlying concepts, aiding in the transition between different tools.
