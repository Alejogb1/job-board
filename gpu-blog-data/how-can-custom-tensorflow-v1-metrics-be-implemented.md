TensorFlow v1's metric implementation, while seemingly straightforward, often presents subtle challenges, particularly concerning state management and proper aggregation across batches.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted the need for meticulous design when crafting custom metrics beyond the readily available ones.  Ignoring these subtleties frequently leads to incorrect evaluation results, especially in scenarios involving variable batch sizes or distributed training.  The key lies in understanding the `tf.metrics` API's functionality and leveraging its features to build robust and accurate custom metrics.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow v1's `tf.metrics` module provides building blocks for creating custom metrics.  The core concept revolves around two primary operations: an *update operation* and a *result operation*. The update operation accumulates values contributing to the metric during each training step. The result operation retrieves the final computed metric value.  Crucially, these operations operate on TensorFlow tensors, inherently supporting the computation graph framework.

The update operation typically takes the *predictions* and *labels* (or ground truth) as input.  These are tensors representing the model's output and the corresponding correct values, respectively. The operation modifies internal variables to maintain the metric's running state.  This state is often represented by TensorFlow variables, ensuring persistence across multiple batches.  Careful consideration must be given to correctly initializing these variables; otherwise, incorrect metric values will be obtained.

The result operation, on the other hand, reads the accumulated state from these variables and computes the final metric value.  This is usually a single scalar tensor representing the overall metric value.  In scenarios involving multiple metrics, separate update and result operations are defined for each.

A critical aspect to avoid errors is to correctly handle variable scope.  Nested variable scopes help avoid naming conflicts and ensure proper state management when multiple custom metrics are used simultaneously.  Furthermore, understanding the difference between `tf.Variable` and `tf.get_variable` is pivotal. Using `tf.get_variable` aids in maintaining consistency and avoids accidental variable re-creation.

Finally, when working within a training loop, it's crucial to ensure the update operation is executed during each step and the result operation is called at the end of an epoch or when needed to retrieve the computed metric value.  Ignoring this sequence can lead to stale or inaccurate results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A Custom Precision Metric**

This example demonstrates a custom precision metric.  It calculates the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all predicted positive instances.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_precision(labels, predictions, thresholds=0.5):
    """Calculates precision at given thresholds."""
    with tf.variable_scope("custom_precision"):
        true_positives = tf.metrics.true_positives(labels, predictions, thresholds=thresholds)
        predicted_positives = tf.metrics.true_positives(labels, predictions, thresholds=thresholds) + tf.metrics.false_positives(labels, predictions, thresholds=thresholds)

        precision = tf.truediv(true_positives[1], predicted_positives[1], name='precision')
        return precision

# Example usage:
labels = tf.constant([1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
predictions = tf.constant([0.8, 0.2, 0.9, 0.6, 0.3])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    sess.run(tf.local_variables_initializer()) # Crucial for tf.metrics
    precision_value = sess.run(custom_precision(labels, predictions))
    print(f"Custom Precision: {precision_value}")
```

**Commentary:** This code leverages existing `tf.metrics` functions for true positives and false positives, showcasing the utility of reusing existing building blocks. The `tf.truediv` ensures numerical stability.  Initialization of both `global_variables` and `local_variables` is essential, addressing common pitfalls.


**Example 2:  A Weighted F1 Score**

This illustrates a weighted F1 score, where weights are provided for different classes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_f1_score(labels, predictions, weights, num_classes):
    """Calculates weighted F1 score."""
    with tf.variable_scope("weighted_f1"):
        class_weights = tf.constant(weights, dtype=tf.float32)
        precision = []
        recall = []
        for i in range(num_classes):
            class_labels = tf.cast(tf.equal(labels, i), dtype=tf.float32)
            class_predictions = tf.slice(predictions, [0,i], [-1,1])
            p, p_op = tf.metrics.precision(class_labels, tf.squeeze(class_predictions))
            r, r_op = tf.metrics.recall(class_labels, tf.squeeze(class_predictions))
            precision.append(p)
            recall.append(r)

        precision = tf.stack(precision)
        recall = tf.stack(recall)
        weighted_f1 = tf.reduce_sum(2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) * class_weights)

        return weighted_f1

#Example Usage (assuming 3 classes)
labels = tf.constant([0,1,2,0,1])
predictions = tf.constant([[0.2,0.7,0.1],[0.1,0.8,0.1],[0.1,0.1,0.8],[0.7,0.2,0.1],[0.3,0.6,0.1]])
weights = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    sess.run(tf.local_variables_initializer())
    f1_value = sess.run(weighted_f1_score(labels, predictions, weights, 3))
    print(f"Weighted F1: {f1_value}")
```

**Commentary:**  This demonstrates handling multiple classes with weighted averaging. Note the use of `tf.slice` to efficiently extract predictions for each class.  The careful use of `tf.stack` and `tf.reduce_sum` ensures correct aggregation.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable Batch Sizes**

This example addresses the challenge of variable batch sizes which is crucial for robust metric calculations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def variable_batch_accuracy(labels, predictions):
    with tf.variable_scope("variable_batch_accuracy"):
        correct_predictions = tf.equal(tf.argmax(labels, 1), tf.argmax(predictions, 1))
        accuracy, accuracy_op = tf.metrics.mean(tf.cast(correct_predictions, tf.float32))

        return accuracy


#Example usage with variable batch size
labels = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 2]) # variable batch
predictions = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 2])

accuracy_op = variable_batch_accuracy(labels, predictions)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    sess.run(tf.local_variables_initializer())
    #Batch 1
    batch_labels = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    batch_preds = [[0.1,0.9],[0.9,0.1]]
    sess.run(accuracy_op[1], {labels: batch_labels, predictions: batch_preds})
    print(sess.run(accuracy_op[0]))
    #Batch 2
    batch_labels = [[0,1]]
    batch_preds = [[0.2,0.8]]
    sess.run(accuracy_op[1], {labels: batch_labels, predictions: batch_preds})
    print(sess.run(accuracy_op[0]))

```

**Commentary:** This highlights using placeholders to handle variable batch sizes. The `tf.metrics.mean` function naturally adapts to varying input sizes, computing the overall average accuracy accurately.
