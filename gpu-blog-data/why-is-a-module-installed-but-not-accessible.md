The root cause of a module's unavailability despite successful installation frequently stems from inconsistencies between the Python interpreter's search path and the module's actual location.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale projects has consistently highlighted the critical role of the `sys.path` variable in resolving this discrepancy.  This variable dictates the order in which Python searches for modules during the import process.  If the directory containing your installed module is not listed within `sys.path`, the import will inevitably fail, despite the module's physical presence on the system.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Import Mechanism:**

The Python interpreter's import mechanism is a layered process. When you execute `import mymodule`, the interpreter undertakes the following steps:

1. **Search `sys.path`:** It sequentially searches through each directory listed in the `sys.path` variable.  This list typically includes the current working directory, directories specified in environment variables like `PYTHONPATH`, and standard library locations.

2. **Locate the Module:** In each directory, the interpreter searches for a file named `mymodule.py` (or `mymodule.so` for compiled modules).

3. **Compile and Load:** If found, the module's code is compiled into bytecode (if necessary) and loaded into memory.

4. **Make Available:** The module's contents become accessible to the importing script.

The failure to import, therefore, often arises because the module's directory is absent from `sys.path`.  This can occur for various reasons, including incorrect installation procedures (especially with non-standard installation methods), virtual environment misconfigurations, and conflicting package installations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Illustrating `sys.path` Manipulation**

```python
import sys
import os

# Print the current sys.path
print("Original sys.path:", sys.path)

# Add a directory to sys.path.  Replace '/path/to/your/module' with the actual path.
module_path = '/path/to/your/module'
if os.path.exists(module_path):
    sys.path.append(module_path)
    print("Modified sys.path:", sys.path)

    try:
        import mymodule  # Attempt the import after modifying sys.path
        print("Module 'mymodule' imported successfully.")
        # ... use mymodule ...
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"ImportError: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Error: Directory '{module_path}' does not exist.")
```

This example demonstrates the direct manipulation of `sys.path`.  It first prints the initial `sys.path` for diagnostic purposes.  It then attempts to add the directory containing `mymodule` to the path. Error handling ensures graceful failure if the directory is not found. The crucial step is the `sys.path.append(module_path)` line; it explicitly adds the module's location to the interpreter's search path.  Subsequently, the import attempt is made.

**Example 2:  Using `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable**

This approach avoids modifying `sys.path` directly within the script.  Instead, it leverages the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  This is generally preferred for broader applicability across multiple scripts.  The precise method of setting `PYTHONPATH` depends on the operating system.  On Linux/macOS, one would use:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/your/module:$PYTHONPATH"
```

Then run the Python script.  This preemptively adds the module's directory to the search path before the script even begins executing.


**Example 3:  Virtual Environments and Package Management**

Incorrect virtual environment setup is a frequent culprit.  Consider this scenario:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install the module within the virtual environment
pip install mymodule

# Now attempt to import
python my_script.py  # my_script.py should now be able to import mymodule
```

This demonstrates the best practice: utilizing virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.  The `pip install mymodule` command installs the package *within* the virtual environment, ensuring that its location is correctly registered within the environment's dedicated `sys.path`.  Forgetting to activate the virtual environment is a common source of this import error.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Python's official documentation:** The section on modules and packages is indispensable for a thorough understanding of the import system.
* **A comprehensive Python textbook:** Several excellent books offer detailed explanations of Python's internals, including the import process and package management.
* **Experienced colleagues or mentors:** Peer review and collaborative debugging are crucial for gaining practical experience and avoiding common pitfalls in module management.  Their insights will guide you far beyond the limitations of this response.


In conclusion, the inaccessibility of an installed module usually boils down to its location being unknown to the Python interpreter.  Addressing this requires meticulous attention to `sys.path`, virtual environment usage, and employing proper package management practices.  Understanding the sequence of steps involved in the import process is crucial for effective troubleshooting.  The provided examples showcase practical methods for resolving this common issue, ranging from direct `sys.path` modification to utilizing environment variables and virtual environments.  Consistent application of these principles will significantly reduce the frequency of encountering this particular problem.
