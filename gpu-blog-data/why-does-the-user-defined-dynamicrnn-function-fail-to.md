The core issue stems from a common misunderstanding regarding the internal state management within recurrent neural networks, specifically when implementing custom GRU layers.  My experience debugging similar custom RNN implementations points to improper handling of the hidden state's dimensionality and the sequence's temporal dependencies.  The failure to produce a valid output isn't inherently tied to the GRU architecture itself, but rather to the intricacies of how the hidden state is passed between timesteps within the user-defined function.  Let's analyze this problem systematically.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The DynamicRNN function, when implemented incorrectly, fails to correctly propagate the hidden state through the sequence. A GRU, unlike a simple recurrent unit, utilizes update gates and reset gates to control the flow of information.  These gates operate on the current input and the previous hidden state to produce the updated hidden state.  A faulty DynamicRNN implementation will often neglect one or more of the following:

* **Correct Initialization of the Hidden State:**  The hidden state must be initialized appropriately, usually with zeros or a learned embedding vector,  before processing the first timestep.  Failure to initialize correctly leads to incorrect calculations in subsequent timesteps.  The shape of this initial hidden state must match the expected output shape of the GRU cell.

* **Proper State Propagation:** The hidden state output from the current timestep must be explicitly passed as input to the GRU cell at the next timestep.  If this process isn't implemented correctly (e.g., incorrect indexing or accidental overwriting of the state), the temporal dependencies are lost, resulting in invalid outputs.  This is usually manifested as incorrect dimensionalities or outputs that are not meaningfully related to the input sequence.

* **Consistent Dimensionality:**  The dimensions of the input, hidden state, and output must be consistent throughout the network. Mismatched dimensions—caused by errors in matrix multiplications or reshaping operations within the GRU cell—will result in shape errors and invalid computations.  This is often a difficult debugging task, requiring careful attention to matrix operations and broadcasting rules.

* **Correct Output Handling:** The final output of the DynamicRNN function must be carefully constructed. Often, the sequence of hidden states or a final state vector is intended to be the output.  Errors in slicing, stacking, or otherwise aggregating the sequence of outputs generated by the GRU cell lead to invalid final outputs.

In my experience, a crucial detail often overlooked is the difference between the *hidden state* within a timestep and the *output* of the GRU cell at that timestep. These are not necessarily identical.  The hidden state is carried forward to the next timestep, while the output might be a transformed version of the hidden state (e.g., a linear transformation).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the problematic areas and their corrections.  I've worked with TensorFlow and Keras extensively, so the examples are based on that framework, though the principles are applicable to other deep learning libraries.

**Example 1: Incorrect Hidden State Propagation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def faulty_dynamic_rnn(cell, inputs):
  # Incorrect: Hidden state is not propagated correctly
  state = tf.zeros([1, cell.state_size]) #Incorrect initialization - assuming batch_size = 1
  outputs = []
  for input_ in inputs:
    output, state = cell(input_, state) # Correct call to cell but state isn't correctly handled across iterations
    outputs.append(output)
  return tf.stack(outputs)

# ... (rest of the code including GRU cell definition and input sequence) ...
```

**Commentary:** This implementation correctly calls the GRU cell, but the hidden state (`state`) is not consistently updated across timesteps.  The `state` variable is recalculated in each iteration without carrying the previous state. This effectively makes the GRU act as a series of independent feedforward networks, destroying the temporal dependency.

**Example 2: Correct Hidden State Propagation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def correct_dynamic_rnn(cell, inputs):
  # Correct: Hidden state is propagated correctly
  state = cell.get_initial_state(batch_size=tf.shape(inputs)[0], dtype=tf.float32) # Correct initialization 
  outputs = []
  for input_ in inputs:
    output, state = cell(input_, state)
    outputs.append(output)
  return tf.stack(outputs)

# ... (rest of the code including GRU cell definition and input sequence) ...
```

**Commentary:** This corrected version utilizes `cell.get_initial_state` for proper initialization handling the batch size dynamically.  Crucially, the updated `state` is passed as the second argument to the GRU cell in every iteration, ensuring correct temporal dependency.


**Example 3: Dimensionality Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_rnn_with_mismatched_dims(cell, inputs):
    state = cell.get_initial_state(batch_size=tf.shape(inputs)[0], dtype=tf.float32)
    outputs = []
    for input_ in inputs:
        # Incorrect: Input needs reshaping if its dimensionality doesn't match the GRU's expected input shape
        output, state = cell(tf.reshape(input_, [-1, 1]), state) #Potentially incorrect reshaping - needs investigation based on the actual input data
        outputs.append(output)
    return tf.stack(outputs, axis=1) # Added axis parameter for potentially correct stacking

# ... (rest of the code including GRU cell definition and input sequence) ...
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights a potential dimensionality issue. The `tf.reshape` operation might be necessary, but only if the input data's dimensions do not match what the GRU cell expects. Incorrect reshaping can lead to mismatched dimensions and subsequently invalid outputs.  This is highly context-dependent and requires a careful analysis of the input data and the GRU cell's configuration.  Always verify input and output dimensions using `tf.shape` throughout the process.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend revisiting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).  Supplement this with a reputable textbook on deep learning, focusing on chapters specifically addressing recurrent neural networks and their implementations.  Finally, reviewing research papers on GRU architectures and their applications can provide valuable insights into the nuances of state management.  Pay close attention to examples and code snippets provided in these sources.  Practice implementing simplified GRUs step-by-step to understand the internal operations better before moving on to complex implementations.  Thorough debugging practices involving print statements, dimension checks, and visualization of intermediate outputs are essential for identifying the root cause of failures in RNN implementations.
