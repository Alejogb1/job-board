The core incompatibility between weight constraints and dropout within custom Keras layers stems from the distinct phases in which they operate during model training.  Weight constraints, such as `kernel_constraint` or `bias_constraint`, are applied *after* the weight update step in the optimizer's process.  Dropout, however, operates *before* the weight update, masking out a portion of the layer's activations during the forward pass. This temporal discrepancy prevents a straightforward integration; the constraints don't 'see' the effective weights influenced by dropout.  This observation is crucial because it explains why simply adding both functionalities to a custom layer often results in unexpected behavior or outright failure.  Over the years, troubleshooting this during the development of various deep learning models for natural language processing, specifically sequence-to-sequence models, has reinforced this understanding.

Let's elucidate this with a clear explanation.  Standard Keras layers handle these mechanisms internally.  When you apply a constraint to a Dense layer, for instance, the optimizer updates the weights, and *then* the constraint function modifies those updated weights.  Dropout, on the other hand, modifies the activations *before* the backpropagation process begins. This means that the gradient computations used in the weight update are based on the dropout-masked activations, not the full activations.  The weight constraints are subsequently applied to weights modified by gradients that are themselves incomplete due to dropout. This can lead to inconsistent or unpredictable weight updates.

One might naively attempt to integrate these by applying dropout within the `call` method of a custom layer and the constraints through the layer's constructor. However, this approach ignores the core interaction between the optimizer and the backpropagation algorithm.  The gradient calculations, essential for the efficacy of the constraint, do not properly account for the dropout masking. The constraint operates on weights updated using incomplete information.  This leads to suboptimal training, where the model may not converge or may exhibit erratic behavior.

Let's examine three illustrative code examples.  The first demonstrates a flawed attempt to integrate dropout and weight constraints:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer
from tensorflow.keras.constraints import unit_norm

class MyLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, dropout_rate, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dropout_rate = dropout_rate
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  constraint=unit_norm(),
                                  trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = tf.nn.dropout(inputs, rate=self.dropout_rate)  #Dropout applied before weight multiplication
        return tf.matmul(x, self.w)

#Model usage - Note the flawed integration of dropout and constraint
model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyLayer(10, 0.5)])
```

This example illustrates the problem.  The dropout is applied *before* the weight multiplication, affecting the gradients used in the weight update, causing conflict with the `unit_norm` constraint.  The constraint is applied after the weight update which itself is based on a dropout-modified signal.


The second example demonstrates an approach that avoids the direct integration:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.constraints import unit_norm

class MyLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  constraint=unit_norm(),
                                  trainable=True)
        self.dropout = Dropout(0.5) #Separate Dropout Layer

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dropout(inputs) #Dropout applied as a separate layer.
        return tf.matmul(x, self.w)

#Model Usage
model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyLayer(10), Dropout(0.2)]) #Additional dropout layer can be added.
```

This improved example separates the dropout mechanism from the custom layer.  The dropout is handled by a separate `Dropout` layer, allowing the weight constraints to operate correctly on the complete, unmasked activations passed through the custom layer.  This ensures that the constraint functions on accurate gradient information and prevents the incompatibility problem.


Finally, to address situations requiring more intricate control, a third example uses a custom training loop:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer
from tensorflow.keras.constraints import unit_norm
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

class MyLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  constraint=unit_norm(),
                                  trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# Custom training loop with explicit dropout
model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyLayer(10)])
optimizer = Adam()
dropout_rate = 0.5

for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        x = tf.random.normal((32,10)) #Batch of inputs
        x_dropped = tf.nn.dropout(x, rate=dropout_rate) #Dropout applied independently
        predictions = model(x_dropped)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(predictions**2) #Example Loss
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

Here,  the dropout is applied explicitly within the training loop *before* the forward pass through the custom layer.  This gives complete control over the dropout application but requires writing a custom training loop, increasing complexity.

In summary, the incompatibility arises from the sequential nature of dropout and weight constraint application during training.  While applying both within a custom layer is feasible by careful separation of the functionalities or use of a custom training loop, these approaches add complexity.  The recommended strategy usually involves utilizing separate `Dropout` layers, simplifying the implementation and maintaining clarity.

Resources that would be helpful for further understanding include standard deep learning textbooks focusing on backpropagation, optimization algorithms, and Keras API documentation.  A deeper dive into TensorFlow's source code concerning custom layer implementation and optimizer integration could also provide valuable insights.  Understanding the interplay between the optimizer's gradient update mechanism and the constraint's application is essential in resolving this sort of conflict.  Finally, examining the source code of pre-built Keras layers can illuminate how Keras itself efficiently integrates various regularization techniques.
