Accessing both filenames and predictions within a test data loader context requires careful orchestration of data handling and model inference. From my experience building image classification models for autonomous robotics, I've found that directly modifying a standard `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` can be cumbersome. Instead, the most maintainable approach involves augmenting the dataset object itself to retain file information and then extracting it during prediction. This avoids introducing extraneous logic into the prediction loop and promotes cleaner, more modular code.

The primary challenge is that typical data loaders focus on efficient batching and processing of pixel data, often discarding the original filenames after loading. Consequently, we need to explicitly preserve this metadata. The standard `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class provides a means to accomplish this by overloading the `__getitem__` method. Rather than returning only the image tensor, we can return a tuple containing the image tensor and the corresponding filename. This modification ensures the file information is carried alongside the image data throughout the pipeline.

Here's how this strategy works in practice. First, we define a custom dataset that inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. This class encapsulates the loading and preprocessing logic for our images and crucially, preserves filenames. Here is the first code example.

```python
import torch
import os
from PIL import Image
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from torchvision import transforms

class ImageDatasetWithFilenames(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_dir, transform=None):
        self.image_dir = image_dir
        self.image_filenames = [f for f in os.listdir(image_dir) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(image_dir, f))]
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_filenames)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        filename = self.image_filenames[idx]
        image_path = os.path.join(self.image_dir, filename)
        image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB') # Convert to RGB if needed

        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, filename
```

In the example above, the `__init__` method takes the image directory and an optional transform function. It gathers all the filenames from the directory and stores them in `self.image_filenames`. The critical part is the `__getitem__` method. Here, it loads the image as previously, but it then returns both the transformed image *and* the original filename, thereby explicitly preserving the link. This dataset ensures the data loader receives both aspects, allowing for easy extraction in the inference phase.

Next, this dataset is used to create a data loader. The DataLoader class automatically manages batching. This does not require modifications, provided that the underlying dataset’s `__getitem__` method provides the desired output format, which is a tuple here. Now the test data loader yields both image tensors *and* their respective filenames. It’s now ready for use with the model for predictions.

Here’s how you’d construct the dataloader for a directory called 'test_images' using this custom dataset, along with an example prediction process. Here is the second code example.

```python
# Assuming you have a model and device already defined

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Example transformations: Resize, Convert to Tensor, Normalize (adjust mean and std as needed)
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

test_dataset = ImageDatasetWithFilenames(image_dir='test_images', transform=transform)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False) # Shuffling is often not needed in test mode


model.eval()
predictions = []
all_filenames = []

with torch.no_grad():
    for images, filenames in test_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted_classes = torch.max(outputs, 1)

        predictions.extend(predicted_classes.cpu().numpy()) # detach, move to cpu
        all_filenames.extend(filenames) # extract all batch filenames

# Now, predictions and filenames are ready to be used together
for filename, prediction in zip(all_filenames, predictions):
    print(f"Filename: {filename}, Prediction: {prediction}")
```

In this loop, the key aspect is unpacking the results of each batch into `images` and `filenames`. The `predicted_classes` are obtained by finding the index of the highest output value. These are then appended to a master list along with the filenames. Finally, the filename and prediction can be correlated.

Now suppose, that one needs to correlate and process these predictions differently based on subdirectories. In such scenario, it is beneficial to capture the directory information directly within the dataset and use that information to structure output processing. In such cases, the `ImageDatasetWithFilenames` can be further customized to incorporate this information. Here is the third code example.

```python
class ImageDatasetWithDirAndFilenames(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_dir, transform=None):
        self.image_dir = image_dir
        self.image_paths = []

        for subdir in os.listdir(image_dir):
           subdir_path = os.path.join(image_dir, subdir)
           if os.path.isdir(subdir_path):
               for filename in os.listdir(subdir_path):
                 if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(subdir_path,filename)):
                     self.image_paths.append((subdir, filename))

        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        subdir, filename = self.image_paths[idx]
        image_path = os.path.join(self.image_dir, subdir, filename)
        image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB') # Ensure images are RGB

        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)

        return image, subdir, filename


# Example usage with directory information
test_dataset = ImageDatasetWithDirAndFilenames(image_dir='test_images', transform=transform)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

all_predictions = {}

with torch.no_grad():
    for images, subdirs, filenames in test_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted_classes = torch.max(outputs, 1)

        for subdir, filename, prediction in zip(subdirs, filenames, predicted_classes.cpu().numpy()):
            if subdir not in all_predictions:
                all_predictions[subdir] = {}
            all_predictions[subdir][filename] = prediction

# Output grouped by subdirectory
for subdir, filenames_and_predictions in all_predictions.items():
     print(f'Subdirectory: {subdir}')
     for filename, prediction in filenames_and_predictions.items():
          print(f' Filename: {filename}, Prediction: {prediction}')
```

The modified `ImageDatasetWithDirAndFilenames` stores the subdirectory alongside the filename in the `image_paths`. The `__getitem__` returns all three: image, subdirectory, and filename. The prediction process remains mostly the same, with an additional step of capturing and grouping results by subdirectory. This allows for further segmentation of the results for processing.

For resources, I suggest researching the PyTorch documentation on `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. In addition, explore examples in the torchvision library, which often contains practical dataset and dataloader implementations for image-related tasks. Consult tutorials on custom datasets in PyTorch to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, research the standard PIL (Pillow) library for detailed operations on reading and manipulating images, and the official CUDA documentation for optimal use of GPU with PyTorch. These materials will strengthen your grasp of the involved concepts and techniques.
