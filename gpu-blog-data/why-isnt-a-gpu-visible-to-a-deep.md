The primary reason a GPU isn't visible within a deep learning container on Google Cloud, despite the host machine possessing one, stems from insufficient configuration of the container runtime and, crucially, the absence of specific drivers and libraries within the container image itself. I've encountered this exact situation numerous times during my development work with TensorFlow and PyTorch on Google Cloud, and the solution invariably involves a precise combination of container configuration and image construction.

The core issue isn't the underlying hardware; Google Cloud provides access to GPUs through managed services like Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the host operating system, where the physical GPU and its drivers reside, and the isolated environment of the container. Docker, the prevalent container runtime, employs namespaces and control groups to create this isolation, which by default also isolates GPU devices. Therefore, the container’s operating system, typically a minimal Linux distribution, lacks visibility and access to the host's GPU. To rectify this, we need to instruct Docker (or other container runtimes) to expose the GPU devices to the container, and further populate the container with the necessary software to communicate with the GPU, specifically, the NVIDIA CUDA drivers and libraries.

The default behavior of container images does not include GPU specific drivers or software because it would significantly increase image size and most use cases don’t require GPU access. These drivers are typically installed on the host system. For instance, when launching a Compute Engine instance with an attached NVIDIA GPU, Google Cloud will automatically install the necessary NVIDIA drivers on the host operating system. However, this does not translate to the containers deployed onto that machine; therefore, the following steps are often necessary for configuring your environment.

First, the container runtime must be configured to allow access to the NVIDIA GPUs present on the host. With Docker, this is typically achieved using the `--gpus` runtime flag. This flag instructs Docker to expose the GPU devices from the host within the container's `/dev` directory. Without this flag, the devices remain invisible to the container. This step alone, however, is insufficient. The container still needs the necessary drivers and CUDA toolkit installed within it to utilize the hardware. The second crucial step is ensuring the Dockerfile builds an image that contains the appropriate NVIDIA drivers, the CUDA toolkit that allows the containerized application to use the GPU, and any other necessary supporting libraries required by the deep learning framework used (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).

Here’s a breakdown of common scenarios and how to address them, including practical examples using Docker.

**Scenario 1: Basic GPU Access with NVIDIA Docker Runtime**

NVIDIA provides a modified version of the Docker runtime, aptly named `nvidia-docker`, designed to streamline GPU access. The main advantage is that it simplifies the invocation process, eliminating the need for explicitly specifying the `--gpus` flag each time. It also handles a lot of behind the scene driver configurations, simplifying a lot of initial setup requirements. However, the underlying principle remains the same: the container runtime must be configured to expose the GPUs, and the container image must include the necessary software stack.

```dockerfile
# Use an NVIDIA base image that already has CUDA installed
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code
COPY . /app

# Install python3 and pip for python-based deep learning
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Command to run
CMD ["python3", "my_gpu_app.py"]
```
In this example, the `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04` base image pre-installs CUDA drivers and libraries compatible with NVIDIA GPUs. The Dockerfile assumes you have a `requirements.txt` file listing the python dependencies. When running the container, one would use `docker run --gpus all <image_name>`.

**Scenario 2: Explicit GPU Device Configuration**

If `nvidia-docker` isn't preferred, or if only specific GPUs are required, the `--gpus` runtime flag can be used directly with Docker. This approach provides finer-grained control over GPU allocation.

```dockerfile
# Use an ubuntu base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Install dependencies 
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget software-properties-common
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.10 python3-pip
RUN python3.10 -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code
COPY . /app

# Command to run
CMD ["python3.10", "my_gpu_app.py"]

```
This Dockerfile builds on a more basic `ubuntu:22.04` image. We manually install python and then PyTorch with CUDA support. In this setup, the container is executed as follows: `docker run --gpus all <image_name>`, where `--gpus all` indicates to docker that all GPUs available on the host will be accessible from within the container. Specifying individual GPUs is also possible with this flag, such as `docker run --gpus '"device=0"' <image_name>` for a single GPU. The difference from scenario 1 is that in this scenario we are responsible for the dependencies that facilitate GPU use.

**Scenario 3: Using a Custom CUDA Toolkit Installation**

While convenient, using NVIDIA base images might not always fit every workflow. In some situations, you may need a specific version of the CUDA toolkit, or wish to have more granular control over the installation process. In this scenario, one can install the CUDA toolkit within the Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
# Use a generic ubuntu base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Install required system libraries
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget software-properties-common
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.10 python3-pip

# Download the CUDA toolkit installer
RUN wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.8.0/local_installers/cuda_11.8.0_520.61.05_linux.run

# Make the installer executable
RUN chmod +x cuda_11.8.0_520.61.05_linux.run

# Install CUDA toolkit silently
RUN ./cuda_11.8.0_520.61.05_linux.run --silent --toolkit

# Set CUDA environment variables
ENV PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:${PATH}"
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"

# Install python dependencies
RUN python3.10 -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code
COPY . /app

# Command to run
CMD ["python3.10", "my_gpu_app.py"]
```

This Dockerfile downloads and installs the CUDA toolkit directly using the official NVIDIA installer. This offers considerable flexibility but demands extra care in managing environment variables and ensuring the toolkit installation is compatible with the host's NVIDIA drivers. When executing the container we would use the command: `docker run --gpus all <image_name>`. This example demonstrates that we can manually bring our CUDA installation to the container.

In summary, a container's inability to see the GPU on Google Cloud boils down to a failure to bridge the hardware gap between the host and container. This involves more than having a GPU on the host machine. The container runtime must be told to share the device, and the container image must have the NVIDIA drivers and libraries required to use the hardware. While NVIDIA docker images can simplify this process, it is crucial to understand the mechanism at play when working with GPU enabled containers. Without this understanding, debugging issues with GPU acceleration becomes unnecessarily complex.

For further exploration, I recommend reading documentation on Docker's runtime capabilities, NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit installation guides, and the deep learning framework’s (e.g. TensorFlow or PyTorch) documentation regarding GPU support with docker. These resources provide deeper insight into the details of each component and how they integrate for successful GPU utilization within a containerized environment. Furthermore, it's often beneficial to examine example Dockerfiles provided by NVIDIA and deep learning framework providers. These can provide best practices and demonstrate how to implement the above techniques in real-world applications. I've personally referred to these numerous times when building my own environments.
