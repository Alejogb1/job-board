CUDA, or Compute Unified Device Architecture, is fundamentally designed for NVIDIA GPUs.  Its core functionality relies on massively parallel processing capabilities inherent in GPU architectures, which are distinctly different from those found in CPUs.  Therefore, directly executing CUDA code on a CPU is not possible.  My experience developing high-performance computing applications, including extensive work with CUDA and heterogeneous computing, has solidified this understanding.  The misconception likely arises from the broader context of parallel computing, where both CPUs and GPUs aim to achieve concurrent execution. However, the underlying mechanisms and programming models differ significantly.

Let's clarify this point.  CUDA provides a programming model that leverages the specialized hardware features of NVIDIA GPUs, such as Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and their associated cores.  These SMs execute many threads concurrently, enabling significant speedups for compute-intensive tasks.  In contrast, CPUs utilize a smaller number of cores, generally with more sophisticated instruction sets and complex control flow mechanisms optimized for sequential and less parallel workloads.  While CPUs do employ techniques like multithreading and hyperthreading to improve performance, they lack the massive parallel processing power of GPUs.  The architectural disparity is fundamental and insurmountable within the confines of the CUDA programming model.

Trying to directly compile and run a CUDA kernel on a CPU will result in a compilation failure. The CUDA compiler, `nvcc`, is specifically designed to target the GPU architecture. It generates machine code optimized for the NVIDIA GPU's instruction set.  A CPU lacks the necessary instructions and hardware structures understood by this compiled code.  This isn't a matter of simple porting; the underlying abstractions are irreconcilable.  The CUDA runtime library, further, is deeply entwined with the GPU's memory management and hardware resource allocation, further solidifying this incompatibility.

However, this doesn't mean all hope is lost for leveraging parallel computation on a CPU when dealing with tasks that could benefit from CUDA's parallel approach on a GPU. There are alternative approaches.  One can achieve parallel processing on CPUs through established programming models like OpenMP or MPI. These frameworks abstract away much of the low-level hardware specifics, allowing programmers to express parallelism at a higher level of abstraction. The compiler then maps this high-level parallel code to the underlying CPU architecture.

Let's examine three illustrative code examples demonstrating this concept.


**Example 1:  CUDA Kernel (GPU)**

This example shows a simple CUDA kernel performing element-wise addition of two arrays. This code would run on a GPU.

```c++
__global__ void addKernel(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... CUDA memory allocation, kernel launch, and data transfer ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This showcases the core CUDA programming elements: the `__global__` kernel declaration, thread indexing using `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx`, and the conditional check to handle boundary conditions. This code is specifically designed for the GPU architecture and will not compile on a CPU.


**Example 2: OpenMP (CPU)**

This example achieves the same element-wise addition using OpenMP, targeting a CPU.

```c++
#include <omp.h>

void addOpenMP(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... Data allocation and function call ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive instructs the compiler to parallelize the loop across available CPU cores.  This approach leverages the CPU's multi-core capabilities without requiring GPU-specific code or hardware.


**Example 3:  MPI (CPU Cluster)**

For larger datasets exceeding the capacity of a single CPU, one could utilize Message Passing Interface (MPI) for distributed parallel processing across multiple CPUs.  This example illustrates a simplified approach.

```c++
#include <mpi.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
  int rank, size;
  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
  MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

  // ... Data distribution and computation ...

  MPI_Finalize();
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** MPI facilitates communication and data exchange between multiple processes running on different CPUs within a cluster. This enables the parallel execution of a task across a distributed computing environment, overcoming single-machine memory limitations.  Note that this example is highly simplified; a practical implementation would involve sophisticated data partitioning and communication strategies.


In summary, while CUDA is inextricably linked to NVIDIA GPUs, parallel computation on CPUs is achievable through other well-established methods like OpenMP and MPI. Choosing the appropriate approach depends on the nature of the problem, the available hardware, and the desired level of performance.  My past work has consistently shown that selecting the correct parallel processing framework is paramount for efficiency and scalability.  Understanding these fundamental differences is crucial for effective high-performance computing.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of parallel programming, consult authoritative texts on OpenMP and MPI programming.  Comprehensive CUDA programming guides are also vital for GPU-based development.  Reviewing materials on heterogeneous computing will broaden your understanding of the synergy and distinctions between CPU and GPU parallel processing.  Finally, delve into the architectural details of CPUs and GPUs to gain a deeper appreciation for their intrinsic differences.
