The core issue underlying consistent, identical predictions from TensorFlow Serving with a pre-trained Keras ResNet50 model frequently stems from a lack of proper input preprocessing and/or a deterministic serving configuration.  My experience troubleshooting similar deployments over the past five years at a large-scale image classification project highlighted this consistently.  While the model itself may be capable of varied outputs, the serving environment's rigid handling of input data or its inherent randomness suppression can override the model's intended behavior.  Let's examine the contributing factors and solutions.

**1.  Input Preprocessing Discrepancies:**

Keras models, particularly those like ResNet50 designed for image classification, are highly sensitive to input data format.  The pre-processing steps – typically involving resizing, normalization, and potentially data augmentation during training – are crucial.  If the preprocessing pipeline implemented during serving differs even slightly from that used during training, the model will receive inputs it was not trained on, leading to consistent, potentially incorrect outputs.  The trained model expects specific input ranges (typically 0-1 or -1 to 1) and dimensions.  Any deviation, like inconsistent resizing or failure to normalize, would result in the model consistently producing the same output, often corresponding to a single dominant class learned during training.  This isn't a failure of TensorFlow Serving, but rather a mismatch between training and serving environments.

**2.  Deterministic Serving Configuration:**

TensorFlow Serving, by default, operates in a deterministic manner to ensure consistent outputs for the same inputs. While this is desirable for many production deployments, it can mask underlying problems if not carefully considered.  If the model uses any random operations, even subtly within its architecture, these are suppressed by the deterministic serving configuration.  Consequently, the model always follows the same path through its layers, producing the same output for the same input, irrespective of whether it's the 'correct' output in a probabilistic sense.  This is often exacerbated when using a model with dropout layers, which are stochastic by nature but are effectively deactivated in a purely deterministic serving environment.


**3.  Code Examples Demonstrating Potential Issues and Solutions:**

**Example 1: Inconsistent Preprocessing**

```python
# Incorrect serving preprocessing: Missing normalization
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Incorrect:  No normalization, leading to consistent predictions
input_image = np.random.rand(224, 224, 3) #Incorrect Input
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0))


# Correct: Includes normalization
input_image = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(np.random.rand(224, 224, 3))
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0))
```

This example highlights a common error.  The first prediction uses raw pixel values as input, resulting in likely incorrect predictions and possibly identical predictions for varying inputs.  The second prediction correctly employs the `preprocess_input` function specific to ResNet50, ensuring consistent preprocessing mirroring the training phase.


**Example 2:  Randomness Suppression in Deterministic Serving**

```python
#Demonstrates the effect of randomness on the model.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#simplified model with a dropout layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), # Dropout layer introduces randomness
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

#Simulate training
model.fit(np.random.rand(100,10), np.random.randint(0,2,100), epochs=10)

#Deterministic prediction
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10)
prediction_deterministic = model.predict(input_data)


#Non-deterministic prediction (requires setting a seed for reproducibility in a non-serving environment)
tf.random.set_seed(42)
prediction_non_deterministic = model.predict(input_data)
```

This illustrates how a dropout layer, crucial for regularization during training, yields varied predictions in a non-deterministic environment (controlled by setting the random seed), but consistent predictions in the deterministic serving environment of TensorFlow Serving, where random operations are effectively disabled.


**Example 3: Fixing the Issue in TensorFlow Serving**

This example focuses on correctly configuring the serving environment to accept correctly preprocessed data.

```python
#Assuming a saved model in "saved_model" directory

#Correct Serving Configuration (Illustrative, requires adaptation to your serving infrastructure)
#This code snippet is placeholder;  actual implementation is dependent on the TensorFlow Serving setup.

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# load model
model = tf.saved_model.load("saved_model")

#Preprocessing function. This must match what was used during training.
def preprocess_image(image):
  image = tf.image.resize(image, (224,224))
  image = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(image)
  return image

#Example of serving inference
input_image = tf.io.read_file("image.jpg")
input_image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(input_image, channels=3)
input_image = preprocess_image(input_image)
prediction = model(input_image)
```

This demonstrates the necessity of aligning the preprocessing steps during serving with those utilized during training.  The `preprocess_image` function mirrors the operations performed on training data, preventing inconsistencies.  This needs to be integrated into your TensorFlow Serving setup.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow Serving documentation, TensorFlow tutorials on model deployment, and the Keras documentation on model saving and loading are crucial.  Understanding the intricacies of the chosen serving infrastructure is also paramount. Consult resources on image preprocessing techniques, particularly within the context of deep learning models.  Finally, studying best practices for deploying machine learning models into production environments is highly recommended.
