Anaconda Spyder's behavior of restarting with previous arguments stems from how it manages its interpreter process and the persistence of environment variables within that process.  In my experience debugging complex scientific workflows involving Spyder, this behavior, while occasionally convenient, often proved a source of subtle errors and unexpected results, especially when working with dynamically changing script parameters.  The root cause lies in the interaction between Spyder's process management, the underlying Python interpreter, and the operating system's handling of environment variables and command-line arguments.

**1.  Explanation:**

Spyder, as an IDE, launches a separate Python interpreter process to execute user code.  When Spyder restarts—either intentionally by the user or due to a crash—it doesn't inherently discard the previous interpreter's state. This state includes aspects like previously loaded modules, defined variables within the interpreter's namespace, and, critically, system environment variables that were set during the previous session.  These environment variables, which are often crucial for specifying file paths, library locations, and other configuration parameters passed as command-line arguments, are not always explicitly cleared on restart.  Operating systems vary slightly in how they manage persistence of these variables, contributing to inconsistencies in the observed behavior across different platforms.

Specifically, when you launch Spyder with command-line arguments (e.g., `spyder --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2`), these arguments might be interpreted by Spyder itself, or they may influence the environment variables available to the subsequently launched Python interpreter.  If Spyder doesn't explicitly clear these variables upon restart, the interpreter, re-initialized with the same environment, will effectively retain the effect of those prior arguments, even though the user may have launched Spyder without them in the current session.  This can be particularly problematic when dealing with absolute paths or environment-dependent configurations that should be dynamically adjusted depending on the current run.

The persistence is not inherent to Python itself, but rather a consequence of Spyder's design and the way it interacts with the operating system’s process management mechanisms.  A cleaner design might involve explicit clearing of session-specific variables, but this would potentially compromise the convenience of retaining some workspace state across restarts. The current behavior represents a trade-off between convenience and the risk of inadvertently carrying over outdated or irrelevant arguments.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

To illustrate this, consider these three scenarios:

**Example 1:  Environment Variable Persistence**

```python
import os

# Within a Spyder script:
print(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# Let's assume we set this environment variable before launching Spyder:
#  export MY_PATH=/path/to/my/data

print(f"MY_PATH environment variable: {os.environ.get('MY_PATH')}")
```

If `MY_PATH` is set before launching Spyder, and Spyder restarts, the second `print` statement will still display the value of `MY_PATH` even if the environment variable has been subsequently removed from the terminal or command prompt.  This highlights the interpreter retaining information from the previous session.


**Example 2:  Command-line Arguments Affecting a Script**

```python
import sys

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        filepath = sys.argv[1]
        print(f"Processing data from: {filepath}")
        # ... process the file ...
    else:
        print("No filepath provided.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If you launch Spyder with `spyder myscript.py /path/to/my/data`, the script will process that file.  Even if you restart Spyder without providing the argument, if the Python interpreter retains state,  the script *might* still attempt to access `/path/to/my/data` (depending on how Spyder handles argument persistence). This is especially dangerous if `/path/to/my/data` is no longer available or relevant.

**Example 3:  Illustrating a mitigation strategy**

This example demonstrates a way to explicitly handle this potential issue within the code itself, rather than relying solely on Spyder's behavior:

```python
import sys
import os

def main():
    # Explicitly check and handle arguments
    filepath = os.environ.get("MY_DATA_PATH")
    if filepath and os.path.exists(filepath):
      print(f"Processing data from: {filepath}")
    elif len(sys.argv) > 1:
        filepath = sys.argv[1]
        if os.path.exists(filepath):
            print(f"Processing data from (command line): {filepath}")
        else:
            print(f"Error: Filepath '{filepath}' does not exist.")
    else:
        print("No valid filepath provided. Please set MY_DATA_PATH or provide a filepath as an argument.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This example prioritizes checking an environment variable (`MY_DATA_PATH`), and then falls back to command-line arguments, with error handling if neither is valid. This reduces the reliance on inconsistent persistence across Spyder restarts.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of process management in Python, consult the official Python documentation on the `os` and `sys` modules.  Additionally, review the Spyder documentation for specifics on its environment variable handling and the advanced configuration options available.  A thorough examination of your operating system's process management documentation will provide insight into the persistence of environment variables beyond the scope of the Python interpreter. Understanding these elements helps in formulating robust solutions that mitigate the issues arising from Spyder's restart behavior.  Finally, exploration of Python's multiprocessing library will further enhance your comprehension of how separate processes interact and manage their individual memory spaces.
