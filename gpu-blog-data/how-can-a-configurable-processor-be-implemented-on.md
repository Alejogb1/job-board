The feasibility of implementing a configurable processor on an FPGA hinges primarily on the inherent flexibility of the FPGA fabric, allowing for hardware description language (HDL) representations of processor architectures to be instantiated and modified at a low level. This characteristic distinguishes FPGAs from fixed-architecture processors like CPUs or GPUs, enabling significant customization at the instruction set architecture (ISA), pipeline stage, and even datapath level.

At its core, the process involves describing the desired processor's architecture using an HDL, such as VHDL or Verilog. This description is then synthesized and implemented on the FPGA. Configurable processors can be broadly classified into soft-core processors and extensible processors, each with distinct implementation strategies. Soft-core processors, like Xilinx’s MicroBlaze or Altera’s NIOS II, are entirely implemented in the FPGA fabric using lookup tables (LUTs), flip-flops, and block RAM. These processors offer high flexibility but typically underperform compared to hardened processor cores. Extensible processors, on the other hand, utilize a combination of hard and soft logic, frequently incorporating a pre-existing hardened processor as the base and allowing for customization via user-defined instruction extensions or custom co-processors in the soft logic. I've found that the initial architectural decision, choosing between a purely soft-core implementation or an extensible one, significantly shapes the project’s complexity and performance profile.

The first step in creating a configurable processor, regardless of approach, involves defining the ISA. This definition includes specifying the instruction formats, opcodes, addressing modes, and register file structure. I generally begin by implementing a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) ISA, a simplified yet effective architecture for initial experimentation and iterative development. This involves defining an ALU unit that supports essential arithmetic and logical operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT, and a simple load-store architecture where memory access is confined to specific load and store instructions.

The next phase is the HDL implementation. This is where the register file, control unit, ALU, instruction decoder, program counter, and memory interface modules are defined and interconnected based on the ISA specification. The control unit is usually the most complex component, as it determines the data path’s behavior during different instruction cycles. Finite state machines are frequently employed for the control unit implementation, managing the instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and writeback stages. Once the core processor is described, the focus shifts to memory implementation. On an FPGA, this will usually involve instantiating block RAM modules for both instruction and data memory. These memories are accessed according to the load and store instructions defined in the ISA. During my work with FPGA-based processor implementations, I have frequently utilized dual-port block RAM configurations for allowing concurrent reads from the instruction memory and read or write to the data memory.

After the individual modules are coded, they are integrated to form the processor system. This integration involves defining the communication interfaces between various functional units, establishing the bus structure, and ensuring proper data flow. This process often requires a top-level module that connects the processor’s units and the external memory interface of the FPGA. Following the top-level instantiation, the development environment’s synthesis, place and route tools are used to generate a bitstream. This bitstream is then downloaded to the FPGA board, effectively implementing the user-defined processor on the hardware. Debugging and verification are crucial steps at this stage; in-circuit debuggers, logic analyzers, and simulation tools are indispensable for identifying and resolving any hardware-level issues.

For a concrete example, consider a simple 8-bit RISC processor. Below is an abridged Verilog example demonstrating key module instantiation:

```verilog
module simple_processor (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    output [7:0] data_out, // Output from ALU
    output [7:0] addr_out, // Memory address output
    output mem_wr,      // Memory write enable signal
	input [7:0] mem_in     // Memory input data
);

  wire [7:0] instruction;
  wire [7:0] alu_out;
  wire [7:0] pc;

  // Instruction memory instantiation
  instruction_memory imem (
      .clk(clk),
      .addr(pc),
      .instruction(instruction)
  );

  // Control Unit instantiation
  control_unit cu (
    .clk(clk),
	.rst(rst),
    .instruction(instruction),
    .alu_out(alu_out),
	.data_out(data_out),
	.addr_out(addr_out),
	.mem_wr(mem_wr),
	.pc(pc)
  );


  // ALU instantiation
  alu alu_unit (
    .A(cu.A),  // Connecting the A input of ALU from the CU
    .B(cu.B), // Connecting the B input of ALU from the CU
    .operation(cu.alu_op), // Connecting the ALU operation signal from CU
    .alu_out(alu_out) // The ALU output
  );

  // Register file instantiation
  register_file reg_file (
      .clk(clk),
	  .write_enable(cu.reg_write_enable), // Connect the write enable signal from CU
	  .write_addr(cu.write_reg_address), // Connect the write address from CU
	  .read_addr1(cu.read_reg_address1), // Connect the read address 1 from CU
	  .read_addr2(cu.read_reg_address2), // Connect the read address 2 from CU
      .write_data(alu_out), // Write the output of ALU to register
	  .data1(cu.A),    // Reading data from register to ALU input A
      .data2(cu.B)     // Reading data from register to ALU input B
  );

// Data memory instantiation
  data_memory dmem (
    .clk(clk),
    .addr(addr_out),
    .data_in(alu_out),
    .mem_wr(mem_wr),
	.data_out(mem_in)
  );

endmodule
```

This module instantiates the core blocks and shows the connections. Note that the internal module descriptions (instruction_memory, control_unit, alu, register_file, data_memory) are omitted for brevity.

To illustrate extensibility further, consider adding a custom coprocessor to this base RISC processor. The following Verilog snippet illustrates how such an extension can be made:

```verilog
module extensible_processor (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [7:0] mem_in,
    output [7:0] data_out,
    output [7:0] addr_out,
	output mem_wr
);

  wire [7:0] instruction;
  wire [7:0] alu_out;
  wire [7:0] pc;

  // Instruction memory instantiation
  instruction_memory imem (
      .clk(clk),
      .addr(pc),
      .instruction(instruction)
  );

  // Control unit modified for coprocessor support
  control_unit_extended cu (
    .clk(clk),
	.rst(rst),
    .instruction(instruction),
    .alu_out(alu_out),
	.data_out(data_out),
	.addr_out(addr_out),
	.mem_wr(mem_wr),
	.pc(pc),
    .coprocessor_enable(coprocessor_enable), // Added signal for coprocessor enable
	.coprocessor_out(coprocessor_out) // Added signal for coprocessor output
  );

  // ALU instantiation
  alu alu_unit (
    .A(cu.A),  // Connecting the A input of ALU from the CU
    .B(cu.B), // Connecting the B input of ALU from the CU
    .operation(cu.alu_op), // Connecting the ALU operation signal from CU
    .alu_out(alu_out) // The ALU output
  );

  // Register file instantiation
  register_file reg_file (
      .clk(clk),
	  .write_enable(cu.reg_write_enable), // Connect the write enable signal from CU
	  .write_addr(cu.write_reg_address), // Connect the write address from CU
	  .read_addr1(cu.read_reg_address1), // Connect the read address 1 from CU
	  .read_addr2(cu.read_reg_address2), // Connect the read address 2 from CU
      .write_data(alu_out), // Write the output of ALU to register
	  .data1(cu.A),    // Reading data from register to ALU input A
      .data2(cu.B)     // Reading data from register to ALU input B
  );

  // Data memory instantiation
  data_memory dmem (
    .clk(clk),
    .addr(addr_out),
    .data_in(alu_out),
    .mem_wr(mem_wr),
	.data_out(mem_in)
  );


    // Custom coprocessor instantiation
    coprocessor my_coprocessor (
        .clk(clk),
        .enable(coprocessor_enable),
		.data_in(cu.B), // Data input to the coprocessor
		.data_out(coprocessor_out) // Coprocessor output
    );

endmodule
```

In this modified processor architecture, the `control_unit_extended` module would decode a special instruction that activates the `coprocessor_enable` signal. The `my_coprocessor` module, a user-defined hardware accelerator, would perform the operation and send its result back, which can be passed to the register file via `coprocessor_out`.  The key aspect here is that a new instruction is added to the ISA of the processor that makes use of the new custom hardware.

Finally, consider extending the address range from 8 bits to 16 bits:

```verilog
module address_extended_processor (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [7:0] mem_in,
    output [7:0] data_out,
    output [15:0] addr_out, // Extended address bus to 16-bits
	output mem_wr
);

  wire [7:0] instruction;
  wire [7:0] alu_out;
  wire [15:0] pc; // Extended PC to 16-bits

    // Instruction memory instantiation
  instruction_memory imem (
      .clk(clk),
      .addr(pc),
      .instruction(instruction)
  );

  // Control Unit instantiation
  control_unit_extended_address cu (
    .clk(clk),
	.rst(rst),
    .instruction(instruction),
    .alu_out(alu_out),
	.data_out(data_out),
	.addr_out(addr_out),
	.mem_wr(mem_wr),
	.pc(pc)
  );

  // ALU instantiation
  alu alu_unit (
    .A(cu.A),  // Connecting the A input of ALU from the CU
    .B(cu.B), // Connecting the B input of ALU from the CU
    .operation(cu.alu_op), // Connecting the ALU operation signal from CU
    .alu_out(alu_out) // The ALU output
  );

  // Register file instantiation
  register_file reg_file (
      .clk(clk),
	  .write_enable(cu.reg_write_enable), // Connect the write enable signal from CU
	  .write_addr(cu.write_reg_address), // Connect the write address from CU
	  .read_addr1(cu.read_reg_address1), // Connect the read address 1 from CU
	  .read_addr2(cu.read_reg_address2), // Connect the read address 2 from CU
      .write_data(alu_out), // Write the output of ALU to register
	  .data1(cu.A),    // Reading data from register to ALU input A
      .data2(cu.B)     // Reading data from register to ALU input B
  );

// Data memory instantiation
data_memory_extended dmem (
    .clk(clk),
    .addr(addr_out),
    .data_in(alu_out),
    .mem_wr(mem_wr),
	.data_out(mem_in)
  );


endmodule
```

In this iteration, the program counter (PC) is changed to 16 bits, the memory address bus is increased to 16 bits, and a custom memory module is used. These changes allow the processor to access a larger memory region. Again, note the internal modules are not fully defined here but demonstrate key points for address range modification.

For deeper study, I recommend examining "Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface" by Patterson and Hennessy for foundational processor architecture concepts. “Digital Design: Principles and Practices” by John F. Wakerly offers an excellent treatment of digital design techniques for hardware implementation, and "FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples" by Pong P. Chu provides insights into FPGA implementations, specifically using VHDL. These resources, while not FPGA or vendor-specific, have proven invaluable in navigating the complexities involved in creating configurable processor systems on FPGA boards.
