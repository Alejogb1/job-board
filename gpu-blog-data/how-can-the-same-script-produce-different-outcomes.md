A primary factor contributing to varying script outcomes despite identical code lies in the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the execution environment.  I’ve frequently encountered this when debugging seemingly straightforward data processing pipelines, where minor fluctuations in external state result in vastly different end results. This variability isn’t inherent to flawed coding, but stems from the interaction of a script with its surrounding system, which is rarely, if ever, truly static.

Scripts, interpreted or compiled, are fundamentally sets of instructions for a processor. The deterministic nature of those instructions, at a micro-level, is undeniable: `a = 5` will always assign the value 5 to the variable `a` within that specific scope. However, the *context* within which that instruction executes is a complex web of interconnected factors. This context forms the state, or the present condition of the system, at any given moment, and can be altered by numerous external and internal influences.

Several factors can cause the same script to produce different results. One prominent cause is the use of pseudo-random number generators. These generators produce deterministic sequences of numbers based on an initial seed value. Unless this seed is controlled, for example, by explicitly setting it at the script's start, the seed is usually based on the system clock, leading to a different random sequence each time the script is run. Imagine, for instance, a script that simulates a card game; shuffling the deck with a non-seeded random number generator will produce different card orders every time.

Another critical area is in the handling of external data. If a script reads data from a file, a database, or an API, changes to that data source will naturally result in different output. Similarly, if a script relies on data from external sensors, variations in the sensor’s reading will also alter the script’s behavior. I've spent countless hours tracking down discrepancies in reports only to find the source was a slightly adjusted CSV file or an API that had returned slightly different data. It's important to consider not only the *content* of the data but also the *timing* of its arrival. If multiple data sources are used in a script, the interleaving or order in which those sources are accessed can lead to vastly different results.

Furthermore, parallel processing and multi-threading are ripe for non-deterministic outcomes. While this increases performance, the scheduling of threads by the operating system is not always consistent. The race conditions that occur when multiple threads access and modify shared resources without proper synchronization mechanisms, like locks, can manifest unpredictable results. Debugging these issues is often very difficult, as the problem might only surface under specific, hard-to-reproduce circumstances. The presence of even seemingly benign differences in CPU load or the specific scheduling behavior of the operating system may lead to different timings of these threads and, in turn, different outcomes for the script.

Let’s consider these scenarios with several concrete examples.

**Example 1: Random Number Generation**

The following Python code snippet demonstrates the issue of using a non-seeded random number generator:

```python
import random

def generate_random_numbers(count):
    random_numbers = []
    for _ in range(count):
        random_numbers.append(random.random())
    return random_numbers

print(generate_random_numbers(5))
print(generate_random_numbers(5))
```

The code defines a function `generate_random_numbers` that generates a list of `count` random floating point numbers using `random.random()`. When run repeatedly, the two `print` calls will, almost assuredly, output different lists.  This difference stems from the random module initializing itself with the current system time, without explicit seeding, ensuring a new sequence each run. This is why, when writing a simulation or algorithm that utilizes randomness, setting the seed is crucial for reproducibility, as I've had to learn.

**Example 2: External Data Dependence**

Consider this simplified representation of data loading from a hypothetical file with content that fluctuates:

```python
def load_and_process_data(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
           data = [int(line.strip()) for line in file]
        return sum(data)
    except FileNotFoundError:
         return "Error: File not found."

file_path = "external_data.txt"
print("First run: ", load_and_process_data(file_path))
# Assuming external_data.txt is now updated
print("Second run: ", load_and_process_data(file_path))

```

The function `load_and_process_data` reads integer values from lines in the file specified by `file_path`, sums them, and returns the result.  If the contents of `external_data.txt` change between two runs, the output of the script will also change.  This exemplifies the dependence on a mutable external state. While this is basic, the principle extends to more complex scenarios, such as real-time sensor data or API calls. The script's behavior is directly coupled to the potentially changing contents of the file.

**Example 3: Multi-threaded Race Condition (Simplified)**

The following example, while not complete, shows the principle using a shared variable and multiple threads:

```python
import threading

shared_counter = 0

def increment_counter():
    global shared_counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        shared_counter += 1

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Final counter value:", shared_counter)
```

Here, two threads independently increment `shared_counter` 100,000 times. Ideally, after both threads finish, the final counter value would be 200,000. However, due to the lack of thread synchronization, multiple threads can attempt to access and modify the shared counter concurrently, resulting in a race condition. The outcome can vary based on thread scheduling, sometimes yielding values less than 200,000.  This illustrates the non-deterministic behavior arising from concurrent access to shared resources without proper thread management.

To mitigate the issues discussed, several best practices should be followed. For random number generation, always initialize the seed when reproducibility is required. When dealing with external data sources, consider implementing data version control, proper data validation, and if appropriate, use caching to ensure consistent data across script executions. For concurrent programming, employ synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and atomic operations to prevent race conditions. Additionally, extensive logging and error handling can aid in identifying and correcting issues.

Finally, understanding and acknowledging the inherent complexities involved with scripting within dynamic environments is fundamental. This involves not just writing robust code, but also understanding how your code interacts with the external world. Debugging issues that stem from non-deterministic behavior can be incredibly challenging, demanding meticulous attention to detail and a thorough understanding of the specific execution environment. Continuous monitoring, logging, and code reviews can be extremely valuable practices in this regard.

Further resources on this subject can be found in publications focusing on system programming, parallel computing, and software testing practices. Books on concurrency and operating system concepts offer detailed explanations of race conditions and thread synchronization. Texts on statistical analysis can illuminate random number generation. Finally, software engineering resources often delve into the nuances of system state, its influence on application behavior, and the importance of thorough testing and validation.
