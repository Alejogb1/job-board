TensorFlow's official tutorials often prioritize simplicity and ease of understanding for beginners, hence the infrequent direct use of the lower-level `tf.Tensor` and `tf.data` APIs.  My experience developing and deploying large-scale machine learning models, particularly in the context of distributed training frameworks, has highlighted the significant difference between the high-level abstractions presented in introductory tutorials and the realities of production-ready systems.  While the tutorials showcase the functionality effectively, they intentionally abstract away complexities best handled with a more advanced understanding of TensorFlow's inner workings.

The core reason boils down to abstraction levels and target audience.  The official tutorials primarily cater to individuals new to deep learning or TensorFlow itself.  Direct manipulation of tensors and the intricacies of the `tf.data` API introduce unnecessary overhead at this stage.  Presenting Keras, a high-level API built upon TensorFlow, allows for rapid prototyping and comprehension of fundamental concepts.  The emphasis is on understanding the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics without getting bogged down in the nuances of memory management, data pipelines, and tensor manipulation.  This pedagogical approach facilitates faster learning and easier adoption.

However, this does not imply that `tf.Tensor` and `tf.data` are unimportant.  Quite the contrary, they are fundamental building blocks of any robust and scalable TensorFlow application.  My experience developing a real-time anomaly detection system for network traffic underscored this point.  The high-level APIs proved insufficient to handle the streaming nature of the data and the requirement for precise control over tensor operations.  This led to the necessity of leveraging the lower-level APIs to achieve the desired performance and efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The official TensorFlow tutorials prioritize ease of use and understanding for beginners.  They abstract away complex details inherent in lower-level APIs like `tf.Tensor` and `tf.data`.  Keras' higher-level functionality allows for quicker model building and training, streamlining the learning process.  This approach sacrifices some control and customization for the benefit of improved accessibility.  Once a user understands the basics, they can then explore the more powerful, yet more complex, features offered by `tf.Tensor` and `tf.data`. This layered approach is intentional; it efficiently scales learning from basic concepts to advanced application.  Understanding the purpose and implementation of a customized `tf.data` pipeline requires a more profound grasp of TensorFlow's internal mechanisms, something that would hinder a beginner's initial understanding of core deep learning principles.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Keras Model (Tutorial Style)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the simplicity of Keras.  Tensor and data pipeline management is completely abstracted away.  The focus is on defining the model architecture and training parameters. This is ideal for introductory tutorials as it avoids unnecessary complexity.

**Example 2:  Manual Tensor Manipulation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create tensors directly
tensor_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
tensor_b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

# Perform element-wise addition
tensor_c = tf.add(tensor_a, tensor_b)

# Print the result
print(tensor_c)

#Further operations, like matrix multiplication, reshaping etc. can be performed.
tensor_d = tf.matmul(tensor_a, tensor_b)
print(tensor_d)
```

This example showcases direct tensor manipulation using TensorFlow's core API.  This approach offers fine-grained control but requires a deeper understanding of tensor operations and their implications. This level of control is essential for advanced applications requiring optimized performance or highly specialized tensor manipulations but is not beginner-friendly.

**Example 3:  Custom tf.data Pipeline**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def preprocess_image(image):
  image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
  image = tf.image.resize(image, [224, 224])
  image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0
  return image


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.list_files('path/to/images/*.jpg')
dataset = dataset.map(lambda filename: tf.io.read_file(filename))
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_image)
dataset = dataset.batch(32)
dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


for batch in dataset:
  #Process the batch
  pass
```

This example demonstrates a custom `tf.data` pipeline for image preprocessing.  It allows for efficient data loading and augmentation, crucial for larger datasets. This surpasses the capabilities of simple `fit` methods and is essential for real-world applications.  However, understanding the nuances of `tf.data`, including optimization strategies like prefetching, requires significant experience.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's core APIs, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation's sections on `tf.Tensor` and `tf.data`.  Further, exploring advanced TensorFlow concepts within the official documentation, such as distributed training and performance optimization, will offer valuable insight into when and how to utilize these APIs effectively.  Finally, seeking out intermediate and advanced TensorFlow courses will provide practical experience necessary to harness the power of `tf.Tensor` and `tf.data` in complex projects.  Pay close attention to the examples within those resources â€“ they often show the practical implementation of concepts in more detail than theoretical explanations can.  Remember that mastering these APIs requires consistent practice and application to diverse problems.  Successfully applying `tf.data` pipelines often involves careful consideration of dataset size, data formats, and computational resources.  The more experience you gain, the better you'll understand when the trade-offs of using these APIs are worth the extra complexity they bring.
