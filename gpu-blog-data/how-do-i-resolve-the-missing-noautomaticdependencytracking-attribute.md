TensorFlow version 2, specifically after the removal of graph-based execution and the adoption of Eager Execution by default, no longer utilizes the `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` attribute as it existed in its predecessor, TensorFlow v1. This change fundamentally alters how operations are handled, making the original problem of disabling automatic dependency tracking largely irrelevant in the context of the new framework. In v1, the user could use this attribute, typically within the context of `tf.control_dependencies`, to precisely manage execution order and prevent unnecessary backpropagation. The focus in v2 shifts toward dynamic graph generation and the use of functional paradigm with Keras layers and custom models.

The essence of the issue lies in the architectural transformation of TensorFlow. In TensorFlow v1, the framework relied heavily on constructing a static computation graph. Operations were defined but not executed until a `tf.Session` was run. During this graph construction phase, the `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` attribute was useful in cases where you wanted to define an operation without implying a dependency for backpropagation purposes or for ordering execution within specific scopes. It was primarily a workaround for a graph based execution model that did not have an easy and direct way to order dependencies on a more dynamic basis.

However, TensorFlow v2 embraces Eager Execution. This means operations are executed immediately as they are defined, without the need for session management. Consequently, the concept of a static graph and fine-grained dependency control using `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` becomes obsolete. The framework now automatically manages dependencies based on the flow of tensors. The removal of this attribute does not signal a loss of control but an evolution to a more intuitive and Pythonic approach. If your workflow relies heavily on granular dependency management, you will have to shift your design and take advantage of the way that TensorFlow now handles dependencies implicitly. The key is to understand that the execution is now defined by the order of the code itself and not a predefined computation graph. This change results in a more flexible framework, but understanding its behavior takes a little bit of retraining for anyone accustomed to v1 dependency control.

To illustrate, consider the following scenarios involving a hypothetical use case in machine learning that might have previously needed explicit dependency tracking. Suppose I wanted to update the weights of a model using one optimizer but then apply a separate update, using another optimizer, without explicitly backpropagating the loss again on the same tensor. In TensorFlow v1 with graph operations and sessions, I might use `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` when applying the secondary update to avoid unintended updates. I can accomplish the same with slightly modified code in TensorFlow v2:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model and optimizers
model = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
optimizer1 = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
optimizer2 = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(0.1)

# Initial data
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# First optimization step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean((y_pred - y)**2)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer1.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

# Second optimization step (independent)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred_independent = model(x) # Re-evaluate on the updated model, but not part of the prior gradient calculation
    loss_independent = tf.reduce_mean((y_pred_independent - y)**2)
grads_independent = tape.gradient(loss_independent, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer2.apply_gradients(zip(grads_independent, model.trainable_variables))

print("Model weights after two independent updates:", model.trainable_variables)
```

In this example, two optimization steps are implemented. The second update is intentionally independent of the first by simply recomputing the predictions and loss within a separate gradient tape. This makes the usage of `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` unnecessary; the use of independent scopes allows for the needed behavior. In the v1 paradigm, `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` was used to explicitly disassociate the second step from the first. In the v2 Eager Execution, the separation occurs naturally through the scope defined by the `with tf.GradientTape() as tape` statement, which handles the automatic differentiation process.

Here is a second example demonstrating a case with custom training loops where you might have previously considered using such an attribute. The main point here is that the management of scopes implicitly governs dependency tracking, rendering the attribute itself superfluous.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom layer
class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal([1, units]), trainable=True)
        self.b = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros([units]), trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Initialize a custom layer and optimizers
layer = CustomLayer(1)
optimizer_a = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
optimizer_b = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(0.1)

# Dummy data
x_data = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
target_y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define a training step, where we perform an update with optimizer_a.
@tf.function
def train_step_a(x, y):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = layer(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean((y_pred - y)**2)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, layer.trainable_variables)
  optimizer_a.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, layer.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Define another training step, but using optimizer_b and not backpropagating from the first training step.
@tf.function
def train_step_b(x,y):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred_independent = layer(x)
    loss_independent = tf.reduce_mean((y_pred_independent - y)**2)
  gradients_independent = tape.gradient(loss_independent, layer.trainable_variables)
  optimizer_b.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_independent, layer.trainable_variables))
  return loss_independent


# Run steps
for _ in range(10):
  loss_val = train_step_a(x_data, target_y)
  loss_val_b = train_step_b(x_data, target_y)
  print(f"Loss (A): {loss_val.numpy():.4f}, Loss (B): {loss_val_b.numpy():.4f}")

print("Trained Layer weights", layer.trainable_variables)
```
This second example highlights that multiple independent optimization steps can be cleanly implemented without any concern for complex dependency declarations. The `tf.function` decorator provides performance gains by executing the function in a graph environment while still retaining the benefits of Eager Execution, without requiring the old `no_automatic_dependency_tracking`.

Lastly, consider a data pipeline scenario. In TensorFlow v1, if you had a computationally intensive data preparation function that you wanted to execute just once and not have it included in subsequent backpropagation steps, `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` might have been used. Now, that same result can be achieved through functional decomposition and using the `tf.data.Dataset` API and pre-processing layers that do not have trainable parameters, without any implicit dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def data_prep(x):
    # Assume a computationally intensive task
    y = tf.square(x)
    return y

x_data_in = tf.constant([[1.0],[2.0],[3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
target_y = tf.constant([[2.0],[4.0],[6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Using tf.data for processing
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_data_in, target_y))
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x, y : (data_prep(x), y))

# Build a basic Model
model_c = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
optimizer_c = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

#Training
@tf.function
def train_step_c(x_data_processed, y_target):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_predicted = model_c(x_data_processed)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean((y_predicted - y_target)**2)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model_c.trainable_variables)
    optimizer_c.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model_c.trainable_variables))
    return loss

#Iterate on the dataset
for x,y in dataset:
    loss_val = train_step_c(x,y)
    print(f"Loss: {loss_val.numpy():.4f}")

print("Trained model weights", model_c.trainable_variables)
```

This third example shows that dataset transformations, as long as they are performed using Tensorflow primitives and not as custom layers with trainable weights are decoupled from the main training loop. Operations within the map function, even if they involve significant computation like `tf.square`, operate on a `tf.Tensor` object as inputs and outputs, and this data pipeline structure is naturally decoupled from backpropagation in the training loop. This is another instance where the architecture of v2 negates the need for `no_automatic_dependency_tracking`.

In essence, the removal of the `no_automatic_dependency_tracking` attribute is not a regression but a natural evolution toward a more intuitive and flexible framework. You should design TensorFlow v2 systems with the assumption of implicit dependency tracking through scopes and the dynamic nature of Eager Execution. If you find yourself needing to explicitly control dependencies in your workflow, carefully re-evaluate the code for possible solutions using functional decomposition, explicit data pipelines, and scoped gradient calculations.

For those wanting to deepen their understanding of these concepts, I suggest focusing on resources covering: 1) TensorFlow’s Eager Execution and dynamic graph construction 2) The `tf.GradientTape` API for automatic differentiation, 3) The `tf.data` module for efficient data pipelining, and 4) The structure and behavior of custom training loops. Material from the TensorFlow documentation, tutorials, and white papers would be good starting points.
