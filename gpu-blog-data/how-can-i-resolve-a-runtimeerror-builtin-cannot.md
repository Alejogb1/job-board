The core issue behind the "RuntimeError: builtin cannot be used as a value" error when saving PyTorch checkpoints involving JIT-compiled modules and dictionaries stems from PyTorch's serialization limitations concerning built-in functions and certain data structures within the state dictionaries of `torch.jit.ScriptModule` instances.  My experience troubleshooting this during the development of a large-scale image recognition system highlighted the necessity of careful data handling prior to checkpoint creation.  The error arises because PyTorch's `state_dict()` method attempts to serialize objects it cannot inherently handle, such as built-in functions often embedded within custom JIT-compiled modules.

The problem manifests when the `state_dict()` method encounters a built-in function or a data structure containing a built-in function as a value within the module's internal parameters or buffers.  This is particularly problematic when using dictionaries where keys might point to functions or when functions are inadvertently included as part of the module's internal representation.  The solution requires a pre-processing step to remove or replace these problematic elements before calling `state_dict()`.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The error isn't directly about the JIT compilation itself; it's about what the compiled module's internal state contains. JIT compilation transforms Python code into a more efficient, optimized representation. However, this optimized representation might still reference Python built-in functions, which are not directly serializable.  The `state_dict()` function, responsible for saving the model's parameters and buffers, encounters these references and throws the error.

To resolve this, you must ensure that the state dictionary only contains serializable data. This typically involves:

* **Identifying the source:** Carefully examine the structure of your JIT-compiled module's `state_dict()`.  Print the dictionary to the console and inspect its contents.  The offending elements will be built-in functions directly or indirectly referenced within the nested structures.
* **Data sanitization:**  The most common approach involves removing or replacing non-serializable elements before saving the checkpoint.  This might entail creating a copy of the state dictionary and selectively removing keys corresponding to problematic values or replacing those values with appropriate placeholders (e.g., strings representing the function's name for later reconstruction).
* **Custom serialization:** In complex scenarios, you may need to implement a custom serialization method that handles the non-serializable elements appropriately. This involves designing a scheme to save and reload the necessary information, potentially relying on external files or custom data structures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Removing a problematic key**

```python
import torch
import torch.jit

class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10))
        self.func = lambda x: x * 2 # Problematic element

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.func(x) + self.param1

model = MyModule()
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)

#Inspect the state_dict before modification:
print("Original state dict:", scripted_model.state_dict())

# Create a copy and remove the problematic key
state_dict = scripted_model.state_dict().copy()
del state_dict['func']

# Save the checkpoint
torch.save(state_dict, 'checkpoint.pth')

# Load the checkpoint (Note: you'll need to reconstruct 'func' during loading)
loaded_state_dict = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')
# ... reconstruct func ...
loaded_model = MyModule()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
```

In this example, the lambda function `func` is the culprit.  We create a copy of the state dictionary, explicitly remove the 'func' key, and save the modified dictionary.  Loading requires reconstructing the lambda function.


**Example 2: Replacing with a placeholder**

```python
import torch
import torch.jit

class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10))
        self.func_name = "my_lambda" # Placeholder

    def forward(self, x):
        # Replace the lambda function with a conditional statement during load
        if self.func_name == "my_lambda":
            return (lambda x: x*2)(x) + self.param1
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown function")

model = MyModule()
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)

state_dict = scripted_model.state_dict()
#No modification needed, placeholder already in place

torch.save(state_dict, 'checkpoint_placeholder.pth')

loaded_state_dict = torch.load('checkpoint_placeholder.pth')
loaded_model = MyModule()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
```

This example uses a string placeholder (`func_name`) to represent the function.  The loading process then reconstructs the function based on the placeholder value.  This method is preferred when the function's logic needs to be replicated during the load process.


**Example 3: Handling dictionaries with function values**

```python
import torch
import torch.jit

class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10))
        self.functions = {'func1': lambda x: x + 1, 'func2': lambda x: x * 2}

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.functions['func1'](x) + self.param1

model = MyModule()
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)

state_dict = scripted_model.state_dict()
#print(state_dict)  #Inspect the state dictionary

#Clean the state_dict before saving it.
cleaned_state_dict = {}
for key, value in state_dict.items():
    if key == 'functions':
        continue
    else:
        cleaned_state_dict[key] = value

torch.save(cleaned_state_dict, 'checkpoint_dict.pth')

#Loading (functions would need to be recreated during load)
loaded_state_dict = torch.load('checkpoint_dict.pth')
loaded_model = MyModule()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
```

Here, the `functions` dictionary contains lambda functions. We completely remove the `functions` entry.  During loading, these functions would need to be manually reconstructed.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `torch.jit` and checkpointing, are crucial.  Thorough examination of the `state_dict()` method's behavior and limitations is essential.  Consult advanced PyTorch tutorials focusing on custom model serialization and deserialization.  Understanding the serialization process within Python itself will be beneficial.  Finally, review existing Stack Overflow questions and answers related to PyTorch serialization errors for further insights.
