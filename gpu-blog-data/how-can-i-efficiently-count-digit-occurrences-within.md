Given that large numerical ranges can easily exceed the capabilities of naive iteration, optimizing digit counting within those ranges requires a strategy beyond simply looping and checking each individual number. Specifically, leveraging the inherent patterns within the decimal system and applying a divide-and-conquer approach proves significantly more efficient.

My experience working on large-scale data processing revealed that brute-force methods for this type of problem quickly become bottlenecks. Consider a range like 1 to 1,000,000; iterating through each number and checking each digit is computationally expensive. A better approach involves understanding how digit occurrences change predictably within a number's place values.

Let's establish the core concept: when considering the number of times a specific digit appears in, for example, the ones place across a range of 100 numbers (0-99), each digit will appear exactly 10 times. For the tens place, each digit also appears 10 times, albeit in runs of 10. This pattern scales up to higher place values. We can exploit this. The strategy involves breaking down the problem into a series of simpler subproblems based on place values. We calculate the contribution of each place value individually for each digit. Then we combine the results. This drastically reduces the number of operations.

For instance, to find the number of times the digit '2' appears between 1 and 200: For the ones place: 2 appears 20 times. For the tens place: 2 appears 10 times. For the hundreds place: 2 appears 0 times. We then add those counts up. But, this ignores numbers like 22 or 122, which contain 2's in multiple places. That requires a little more calculation. To accomplish this, we need to consider the prefix of a number and how it influences digit counts in lower place values. The strategy involves processing each digit position separately. It looks at the contribution of the digit in its specific place and also the contribution related to how the numbers before influence subsequent counts.

Hereâ€™s the core idea implemented in Python:

```python
def count_digit_occurrences(low, high, digit):
    count = 0
    low_str, high_str = str(low), str(high)
    len_low, len_high = len(low_str), len(high_str)

    for i in range(len_high):
        power_of_ten = 10**(len_high - 1 - i)
        prefix_high = int(high_str[:i] or '0') if i > 0 else 0
        
        # Count occurrences in the current place value for high bound.
        digit_at_place = int(high_str[i])
        
        count += prefix_high * power_of_ten

        if digit_at_place > digit:
            count += power_of_ten
        elif digit_at_place == digit:
            count += (high % power_of_ten) + 1

        # Adjust for range if low bound is not 1
        if low != 1:
            prefix_low = int(low_str[:i] or '0') if i > 0 else 0
            digit_at_place_low = int(low_str[i]) if len_low > i else 0
            low_count = prefix_low * power_of_ten
            if digit_at_place_low > digit:
              low_count += power_of_ten
            elif digit_at_place_low == digit:
              low_count += (low % power_of_ten)
            count -= low_count
            
    return count
```
This code iterates over each digit of the upper range, represented by `high_str`. It calculates the base number of occurrences in the current place value using the prefix of that number `prefix_high`. It takes advantage of the fact that for each range of 10's power, each digit appears 10 ^ (place_value -1) times. If the actual digit in the current place value in the number we are considering (from the string of the upper limit) is greater than the digit we are counting, then an additional full block is added. If it is equal to, it needs to see how much of the current power of 10 is used up in the upper limit. This logic covers the high bound. The logic for the low bound is a similar deduction.  This function returns the total number of occurrences.

Here is another function which extends the above concept to count all digit occurrences:

```python
def count_all_digit_occurrences(low, high):
    counts = {i:0 for i in range(10)}
    for digit in range(10):
        counts[digit] = count_digit_occurrences(low,high,digit)
    return counts
```

This function iterates over all possible digits and uses the `count_digit_occurrences` to calculate their respective counts and returns a dictionary of these counts. This approach avoids redundant computations by directly leveraging the output of the optimized digit-specific counting function.

Here's an example demonstrating usage of the functions:

```python
def test_counting():
    low_range = 1
    high_range = 1000
    digit_to_count = 2

    count = count_digit_occurrences(low_range,high_range,digit_to_count)
    print(f"Digit {digit_to_count} appears {count} times between {low_range} and {high_range}")

    all_counts = count_all_digit_occurrences(low_range,high_range)
    print(f"All digits in range {low_range} to {high_range} appear as follows:{all_counts}")

    low_range_2 = 100
    high_range_2 = 2000
    digit_to_count_2 = 7
    count_2 = count_digit_occurrences(low_range_2,high_range_2,digit_to_count_2)
    print(f"Digit {digit_to_count_2} appears {count_2} times between {low_range_2} and {high_range_2}")

    all_counts_2 = count_all_digit_occurrences(low_range_2,high_range_2)
    print(f"All digits in range {low_range_2} to {high_range_2} appear as follows:{all_counts_2}")
test_counting()
```

This test function demonstrates the use of the functions to calculate digit counts for the digit 2 and for all digits between two sample ranges. It outputs the counts to the console.  This shows how the function can be incorporated into a larger application. This is a concise test, but it provides a view of what the user will experience.

In my experience, for range-based number problems, these techniques are critical. Beyond basic digit counting, these concepts can be extended to other operations involving numerical ranges. The key is to recognize that individual numbers are less relevant than the patterns embedded within their place values. Applying such logic produces a far more efficient algorithm.

For further understanding of algorithm optimization, I recommend exploring resources on algorithmic complexity analysis (particularly Big O notation). Also, studying resources on divide-and-conquer algorithms will help to grasp the underlying methodology here. Number theory resources also help in understanding the mathematical principles at play, which is critical for improving solutions to problems like these. Finally, examining various number-related problems on sites like LeetCode or HackerRank can greatly refine practical skills in applying these principles.
