Implementing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow's `GradientTape` provides fine-grained control over the training process, particularly the computation and application of gradients necessary for optimizing the model's parameters. VAEs, as generative models, differ from standard autoencoders by learning a probability distribution over the latent space, enabling sampling of new data points. The `GradientTape`, a core feature of TensorFlow's eager execution, facilitates this by recording operations for automatic differentiation.

Fundamentally, a VAE consists of two primary components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps input data to a latent space, represented by a mean and a standard deviation. Sampling from this distribution forms the latent vector, which is then input into the decoder. The decoder reconstructs the original input. Unlike a regular autoencoder, the encoding does not directly produce a single latent vector. It generates a representation of a probability distribution, usually a Gaussian. The use of `GradientTape` allows us to backpropagate the reconstruction loss combined with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure of the difference between the learned latent distribution and a standard normal distribution, during training. This forces the latent space to be continuous and encourages the generation of meaningful samples.

The specific process with `GradientTape` involves the following steps. First, initialize the encoder and decoder networks as TensorFlow `Model` instances or classes. Second, define the loss function, typically composed of two parts: reconstruction loss (e.g., mean squared error or binary cross-entropy) and KL divergence. Third, during each training step, use the `GradientTape` to record forward passes through the encoder and decoder. Within this context, sample from the latent distribution using the mean and standard deviation produced by the encoder. Calculate the loss using the reconstructed output and the original input. Then compute the gradients with respect to all trainable variables. Finally, apply the calculated gradients using an optimizer.

Here's an illustrative example using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class Encoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim, intermediate_dim=128):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = layers.Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')
        self.mu = layers.Dense(latent_dim)
        self.log_var = layers.Dense(latent_dim)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        mu = self.mu(x)
        log_var = self.log_var(x)
        return mu, log_var

class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim, intermediate_dim=128, output_dim=784):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = layers.Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')
        self.output_layer = layers.Dense(output_dim, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, z):
      z = self.dense1(z)
      reconstruction = self.output_layer(z)
      return reconstruction

class VAE(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim=2, intermediate_dim=128, input_dim=784):
        super(VAE, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = Encoder(latent_dim, intermediate_dim)
        self.decoder = Decoder(latent_dim, intermediate_dim, input_dim)

    def call(self, x):
        mu, log_var = self.encoder(x)
        epsilon = tf.random.normal(shape=tf.shape(mu))
        z = mu + tf.exp(0.5 * log_var) * epsilon
        reconstruction = self.decoder(z)
        return reconstruction, mu, log_var
```

This snippet provides the base classes for our encoder, decoder, and a VAE model, which handles the sampling process. Note the reparameterization trick in the `call` method of the `VAE`. This allows gradients to flow through the stochastic sampling process. The encoder outputs the mean and log variance which are used to sample from the Gaussian distribution in the latent space.

Next, we implement a `train_step` method leveraging `GradientTape`:

```python
def vae_loss(original, reconstructed, mu, log_var):
    reconstruction_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_sum(
        tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(original, reconstructed), axis=1))
    kl_loss = -0.5 * tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_sum(
        1 + log_var - tf.square(mu) - tf.exp(log_var), axis=1))
    total_loss = reconstruction_loss + kl_loss
    return total_loss

@tf.function
def train_step(model, optimizer, x):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        reconstruction, mu, log_var = model(x)
        loss = vae_loss(x, reconstruction, mu, log_var)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss
```

The `vae_loss` function calculates the combined reconstruction and KL divergence losses. The `train_step` function encapsulates one training step.  Within the `GradientTape` context, the forward pass through the VAE is performed. The loss is then computed using the return from the VAE (the reconstructed output, the mean, and the log variance) and the input data. The gradients are calculated with respect to the loss using `tape.gradient`, and then applied using the passed optimizer with `optimizer.apply_gradients`. The `@tf.function` decorator improves performance using graph compilation.

Finally, an example showcasing usage within a training loop:

```python
import numpy as np

input_dim = 784
latent_dim = 2
batch_size = 32
epochs = 100
learning_rate = 1e-3

(x_train, _), (_, _) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, input_dim).astype("float32") / 255.0

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(x_train).batch(batch_size)

vae = VAE(latent_dim, input_dim=input_dim)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate)

for epoch in range(epochs):
  epoch_loss = []
  for batch in train_dataset:
        loss = train_step(vae, optimizer, batch)
        epoch_loss.append(loss.numpy())
  print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {np.mean(epoch_loss)}")
```

This example demonstrates the usage of the defined components. It loads MNIST data, creates the training dataset, and initializes the VAE and optimizer. It then iterates through each epoch, processing mini-batches, and calculates the average loss for each epoch.

For deeper understanding and more advanced implementations, I recommend exploring TensorFlow's official documentation for `GradientTape` and Keras models. Works by authors focusing on variational inference and deep generative models, along with research papers on VAEs will also be highly beneficial. Books covering deep learning and machine learning topics using TensorFlow can provide a theoretical foundation. Exploring tutorials and code examples focusing on VAEs, especially those from reputable sources such as the TensorFlow tutorials or online learning platforms, can be valuable.
