The core difference in performance computation between NVIDIA Nsight Compute's SOL (System-Level Optimization) and Roofline models lies in their granularity and the aspects of performance they prioritize.  My experience optimizing CUDA applications over the past decade has consistently shown that while both models provide valuable insights, they serve distinct purposes and offer complementary perspectives on performance bottlenecks.  SOL focuses on the holistic performance of a kernel, identifying major sources of latency and throughput limitations across the entire system, while Roofline offers a more fine-grained analysis centered on memory bandwidth and computational limitations of the GPU architecture.

**1.  A Clear Explanation of the Differences:**

The SOL model in Nsight Compute performs a comprehensive analysis of your kernel execution, encompassing various factors beyond just raw computational speed. It considers aspects such as kernel launch overhead, memory transfers (including data movement between the CPU and GPU, as well as within the GPU's memory hierarchy), synchronization points, and the impact of the underlying system resources.  The results are presented as a hierarchical breakdown of the time spent in different phases of execution.  This allows for the identification of bottlenecks not directly related to the kernel's algorithmic efficiency, but rather to aspects like inefficient memory access patterns or poorly optimized data transfers.

Conversely, the Roofline model provides a more theoretical performance upper bound based on the GPU's architectural capabilities.  It visually represents the peak performance attainable by the hardware, constrained by both memory bandwidth and computational capability (FLOPS). By plotting your kernel's achieved performance against this theoretical roofline, you can quickly assess whether your kernel is limited by arithmetic intensity (the ratio of computational operations to memory accesses), memory bandwidth, or a combination thereof.  This provides a direct measure of how efficiently your kernel utilizes the available resources.

The crucial distinction is that SOL provides a *measured* performance profile reflecting the actual execution, while Roofline presents a *theoretical* performance limit defined by the hardware's specifications.  A kernel might show excellent performance relative to the roofline, indicating efficient utilization of computational and memory resources, yet still exhibit significant overhead as revealed by the SOL model due to external factors like data transfer times.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate with three example scenarios, highlighting how SOL and Roofline models would provide different, yet complementary, insights:


**Example 1: Memory-Bound Kernel**

```cpp
__global__ void mem_bound_kernel(float *in, float *out, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    out[i] = in[i] * 2.0f;
  }
}
```

* **SOL Analysis:**  A SOL analysis might reveal that a significant portion of the execution time is spent on data transfer between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU).  Even if the kernel itself is computationally simple, the large data volume might dominate the overall execution time.

* **Roofline Analysis:** The Roofline model would likely show that the kernel operates far below the computational peak, primarily constrained by the memory bandwidth. The arithmetic intensity is low, meaning many memory accesses are performed for each floating-point operation.

**Example 2: Computationally-Bound Kernel**

```cpp
__global__ void comp_bound_kernel(float *in, float *out, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    float temp = in[i];
    for (int j = 0; j < 1000; ++j) {
      temp = temp * temp; //intensive computation
    }
    out[i] = temp;
  }
}
```

* **SOL Analysis:**  The SOL analysis would likely show a higher proportion of the execution time spent within the kernel itself, indicating that the computation is the dominant factor.  Data transfer overhead might be relatively small compared to the computational cost.

* **Roofline Analysis:** This kernel would demonstrate higher arithmetic intensity, potentially approaching or even exceeding the computational roofline.  Memory bandwidth might be a secondary constraint in this case.

**Example 3:  Kernel with Synchronization Overhead**

```cpp
__global__ void sync_overhead_kernel(float *in, float *out, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    __syncthreads(); //Synchronization point
    out[i] = in[i] + 1.0f;
  }
}
```

* **SOL Analysis:** The SOL model would clearly identify the synchronization point (`__syncthreads()`) as a major contributor to the execution time. This overhead is not directly reflected in the Roofline model.

* **Roofline Analysis:** The Roofline analysis may show that the kernel operates well below the peak performance, but the reason wouldn't be immediately apparent without the SOL analysis revealing the synchronization overhead.  The analysis might indicate a memory or computational limitation, misleading without the more detailed SOL information.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further in-depth understanding of GPU architecture and performance optimization, I recommend consulting the NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide,  the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, and advanced texts focusing on parallel computing and GPU programming.  Familiarization with performance analysis tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems can also provide invaluable insights into system-level bottlenecks that complement the data provided by Nsight Compute.  Finally, studying published research papers on GPU optimization strategies can broaden your knowledge of effective techniques.
