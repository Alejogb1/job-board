Q-learning, a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning, often involves episodes of varying lengths as the agent explores the environment. Computing the average steps per episode is crucial for monitoring training progress and diagnosing potential issues, such as prematurely terminated or extremely long episodes. This metric provides a clear indication of how effectively the agent is learning a policy that allows it to complete the task in a reasonable number of steps. Throughout numerous projects, I have found this a consistently informative indicator of learning dynamics.

The challenge primarily lies in accumulating episode-specific step counts and subsequently calculating the average. During the execution of a Q-learning algorithm, the agent interacts with the environment for a set number of episodes. Within each episode, the agent takes a series of steps until either a terminal state is reached or a predefined maximum number of steps is exceeded, thus ending the episode. The task is to record the steps taken in each episode and then perform averaging across all completed episodes. A simple counter for the steps within the episode and a list to store episode lengths will work.

Here's a detailed explanation of how to implement this calculation effectively in Python. The approach requires careful bookkeeping within the main training loop of the Q-learning algorithm. I’ll demonstrate this with examples.

**Explanation:**

The primary requirement is to initialize a counter to track steps taken within each episode. This counter should be reset at the start of each new episode. Simultaneously, a list needs to be maintained to store the number of steps taken during each completed episode. At the conclusion of each episode, the step counter's value is appended to this list. Finally, to compute the average steps per episode, one should divide the total accumulated steps across all episodes by the total number of episodes completed.

The calculation can be summarized by these steps:

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize `step_counter` to 0 and `episode_lengths` as an empty list.
2.  **Episode Start:** At the beginning of each episode, reset `step_counter` to 0.
3.  **Step Increment:** During each step within an episode, increment `step_counter` by 1.
4.  **Episode End:** When an episode terminates, append the current value of `step_counter` to the `episode_lengths` list.
5.  **Average Calculation:** After a certain number of episodes (or at regular intervals), compute the average steps per episode by summing all the values in `episode_lengths` and dividing by the number of elements in `episode_lengths`.
6. **Handling No Episodes**: Before calculating an average, one must check the `episode_lengths` list is not empty to avoid a division by zero error. Return 0 if the list is empty, or calculate the average as described before.

**Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic implementation within a dummy Q-learning loop.**

```python
import numpy as np

def dummy_q_learning(num_episodes=100, max_steps_per_episode=200):
    step_counter = 0
    episode_lengths = []
    all_episode_rewards = []  # Added to illustrate potential usage
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        step_counter = 0 # Reset at episode start
        episode_reward = 0 # Reset at episode start (just for demonstration)
        for step in range(max_steps_per_episode):
            # Agent takes a step in the environment (simulated)
            reward = np.random.choice([-1, 1, 0], p=[0.1, 0.1, 0.8])
            episode_reward += reward
            step_counter += 1 # Increment on each step
            if reward == 1: # Simplified termination condition (reach goal or max steps)
                break
        episode_lengths.append(step_counter) # Record steps at episode end
        all_episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)

    if episode_lengths: # Check for empty list before calculating the average
        average_steps_per_episode = sum(episode_lengths) / len(episode_lengths)
    else:
        average_steps_per_episode = 0

    return average_steps_per_episode, episode_lengths, all_episode_rewards


average, lengths, rewards = dummy_q_learning()
print(f"Average steps per episode: {average:.2f}")
print(f"All episode lengths: {lengths}")
```

This code illustrates a basic structure. The `step_counter` is reset at the start of each episode and incremented at each step. When an episode ends (here, simulated by achieving a positive reward), the `step_counter` value is appended to the `episode_lengths` list. The average is calculated after completing all episodes, and a check is implemented to avoid a division by zero when no episodes are in the list yet. This structure, while basic, is the backbone for integrating step tracking in a full Q-learning implementation. The `all_episode_rewards` list was added to give more context as to how this would fit within a more complex system.

**Example 2: Integrating with a custom environment class**

```python
class SimpleEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = 0
    def step(self, action):
        if action == 1:
            self.state += 1
            reward = 1 if self.state == 5 else 0
        elif action == 0:
            self.state -= 1
            reward = -0.1
        else:
            reward = -0.2
        done = self.state == 5 or self.state < -5
        return self.state, reward, done
    def reset(self):
        self.state = 0
        return self.state

def q_learning_with_env(num_episodes=100, max_steps_per_episode=200):
    env = SimpleEnvironment()
    step_counter = 0
    episode_lengths = []
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        step_counter = 0
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done and step_counter < max_steps_per_episode:
            action = np.random.choice([0,1,2]) # Simulate an action selection
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
            step_counter+=1
        episode_lengths.append(step_counter)

    if episode_lengths:
        average_steps_per_episode = sum(episode_lengths) / len(episode_lengths)
    else:
       average_steps_per_episode = 0
    return average_steps_per_episode, episode_lengths

average_steps, all_lengths = q_learning_with_env()
print(f"Average steps per episode: {average_steps:.2f}")
print(f"All episode lengths: {all_lengths}")
```

This example incorporates a custom environment class. Here, the environment’s `step` function is called during the simulation. The key observation remains: the `step_counter` is reset at episode start and incremented during each interaction. After an episode ends, indicated by the `done` flag or reaching the maximum steps, the step count is stored and subsequently used for calculating the average. The introduction of an environment here is a common scenario in practice.

**Example 3: On-the-fly average calculation.**

```python
def q_learning_rolling_avg(num_episodes=100, max_steps_per_episode=200):
    step_counter = 0
    episode_lengths = []
    rolling_average_lengths = []
    total_steps = 0
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        step_counter = 0
        for _ in range(max_steps_per_episode):
            step_counter += 1
            if np.random.choice([False, True], p = [0.9, 0.1]):
                break

        episode_lengths.append(step_counter)
        total_steps += step_counter
        if episode > 0: # Check to avoid division by zero on the first episode
            rolling_average = total_steps / (episode + 1) # calculate rolling average on each episode
        else:
           rolling_average = step_counter
        rolling_average_lengths.append(rolling_average)
    return rolling_average_lengths, episode_lengths

rolling_averages, all_lengths = q_learning_rolling_avg()

print(f"Rolling average steps per episode: {rolling_averages}")
print(f"All episode lengths: {all_lengths}")
```

This final example illustrates how to compute a *rolling* average. Rather than waiting for the end of training, the average is updated on a per-episode basis.  `total_steps` stores the total number of steps encountered up to a given episode, which is then used to calculate the average. The benefit is the capacity to monitor the metric throughout the learning process, allowing for early detection of potential problems or confirmation of successful learning.
