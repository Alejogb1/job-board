The most frequent cause of Google OAuth 2.0 login errors stems from misconfigurations in the client application's interaction with the Google OAuth 2.0 authorization server, specifically concerning the handling of redirect URIs and the scope of requested permissions.  In my experience troubleshooting these issues across numerous projects—ranging from internal tools to publicly facing web applications—this fundamental disconnect consistently emerges as the root cause.  Improperly registered redirect URIs or overly permissive scope requests are often the culprits.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The Google OAuth 2.0 flow is a carefully orchestrated exchange between your client application (e.g., a web application, mobile app, or server-side application) and Google's authorization servers.  This process involves several steps:

1. **Authorization Request:** Your application initiates the OAuth flow by redirecting the user to a Google authorization URL. This URL includes parameters specifying the client ID, redirect URI, requested scopes (permissions), and other configuration details.

2. **User Authentication:** Google prompts the user to authenticate themselves and grant your application the requested permissions.

3. **Authorization Code Grant:** Upon successful authentication and consent, Google redirects the user back to your application's redirect URI with an authorization code.  This code is temporary and short-lived.

4. **Token Exchange:** Your application exchanges this authorization code for access and refresh tokens at the Google token endpoint.  The access token provides temporary access to the user's data, while the refresh token allows you to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

5. **API Access:**  Using the access token, your application can now make requests to Google APIs on the user's behalf.

Errors can occur at any stage of this flow, but the most common problems center around the redirect URI and the requested scope.

* **Redirect URI Mismatch:** The redirect URI registered in your Google Cloud Console must exactly match the URI Google redirects the user back to after authentication.  Even a minor discrepancy, like a missing trailing slash or a different protocol (HTTP vs. HTTPS), will result in an error.  This is a frequent source of frustration; the error messages themselves can be unhelpful, simply indicating a general authentication failure.

* **Scope Issues:** Requesting excessive permissions can lead to the user denying access, resulting in an authorization failure.  It's crucial to request only the minimum necessary permissions.  Requesting too broad a scope increases security risks and decreases the likelihood of user acceptance.  Conversely, requesting insufficient scope will prevent your application from accessing the required data.

* **Client ID and Secret Management:**  Securely storing and handling your client ID and secret is critical.  Exposing these credentials can compromise your application's security.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate common scenarios and potential pitfalls using Python.  These scenarios focus on the authorization stage where many problems manifest.  Error handling is simplified for brevity.

**Example 1:  Correct Redirect URI Handling (Flask)**

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, request, url_for
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import Flow

app = Flask(__name__)

# ... (Configuration - Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI, Scopes) ...

@app.route('/')
def index():
    flow = Flow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', scopes=SCOPES)
    flow.redirect_uri = url_for('callback', _external=True) # Important: _external=True for correct URL generation
    authorization_url, state = flow.authorization_url()
    return redirect(authorization_url)

@app.route('/callback')
def callback():
    flow = Flow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', scopes=SCOPES, state=request.args.get('state'))
    flow.redirect_uri = url_for('callback', _external=True)
    authorization_response = request.url
    flow.fetch_token(authorization_response=authorization_response)
    # ... (Access token handling) ...
    return "Login Successful"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

*Commentary:* This example correctly uses `_external=True` in `url_for` to ensure the redirect URI is generated correctly, especially in development environments.  The `state` parameter ensures CSRF protection.

**Example 2: Incorrect Scope Request**

```python
# ... (Import statements and configuration) ...

SCOPES = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"] #Overly permissive scope

# ... (Rest of the code as in Example 1) ...
```

*Commentary:* This example requests excessive permissions.  Restricting the scope to only `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email` if only email is needed would improve security and user experience.

**Example 3:  Handling Errors Gracefully**

```python
# ... (Import statements and configuration) ...

try:
    flow = Flow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', scopes=SCOPES)
    # ... (Authorization and token exchange) ...
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    # Handle the error appropriately (e.g., display an error message to the user, log the error for debugging)
```

*Commentary:*  This snippet demonstrates essential error handling.  Always anticipate potential failures—network issues, incorrect credentials, or authorization errors—and implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage such situations.  Logging errors facilitates effective debugging.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

1. The official Google OAuth 2.0 documentation.  Carefully review the sections on authorization code grant flow, redirect URIs, and scope management.

2.  A well-structured tutorial on implementing Google OAuth 2.0 in your chosen programming language. This should cover the entire flow from authorization request to API access.

3.  A debugging guide for common OAuth 2.0 issues.  This guide will likely provide helpful tips on resolving specific error messages you encounter.  Pay attention to network traffic analysis tools to check the exact parameters being exchanged during the process.


By meticulously following the Google OAuth 2.0 specifications, carefully managing your redirect URIs and scopes, and implementing robust error handling, you can significantly reduce the occurrence of authentication errors and build more secure and reliable applications. My experience shows that attention to detail in these areas prevents most issues. Remember that even small inconsistencies between your configuration and Google's expectations can lead to seemingly inexplicable errors, so rigorous verification of all parameters is paramount.
