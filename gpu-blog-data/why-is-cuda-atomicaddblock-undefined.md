The undefined behavior associated with `atomicAdd_block` stems from its inherent limitations within the CUDA programming model and the architecture of modern GPUs.  My experience debugging parallel algorithms on various NVIDIA architectures, spanning from Fermi to Ampere, has consistently highlighted the crucial distinction between global memory atomics and those operating within a single block.  While `atomicAdd` operates reliably on global memory, its block-scoped counterpart, `atomicAdd_block`, is not a standard CUDA function. This absence is deliberate and reflects the underlying hardware limitations and potential performance pitfalls.

The core issue lies in the memory access patterns and synchronization mechanisms available at the block level. Global memory atomics are implemented through specialized hardware instructions that guarantee atomic operations across all threads within a CUDA kernel.  These instructions utilize mechanisms such as cache coherence protocols and inter-thread synchronization to maintain data consistency.  However, shared memory, typically employed for inter-thread communication within a block, has different properties.  While much faster than global memory, shared memory lacks the same robust hardware-level atomic guarantees across all threads in a block that global memory offers.  Implementing a truly atomic operation across all threads within a single block would require substantial synchronization overhead, potentially negating any performance advantage.

Instead of a dedicated `atomicAdd_block`, efficient inter-thread synchronization within a block usually relies on techniques such as reduction algorithms.  These algorithms leverage the shared memory's faster access speeds and carefully orchestrate thread execution to aggregate data atomically within smaller groups of threads, then combining the results through hierarchical reductions. This approach avoids the need for a hypothetical `atomicAdd_block` by managing atomicity at a more granular level, thereby offering superior performance characteristics.

Let's examine three code examples illustrating alternative approaches to achieving atomic summation within a block.  These examples showcase techniques that are both efficient and avoid undefined behavior.

**Example 1: Reduction with Shared Memory**

```c++
__global__ void blockReduce(int *input, int *output, int n) {
    __shared__ int sdata[256]; // Assumes block size <= 256
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int idx = threadIdx.x;

    if (i < n) {
        sdata[idx] = input[i];
    } else {
        sdata[idx] = 0;
    }
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block

    for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
        if (idx < s) {
            sdata[idx] += sdata[idx + s];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if (idx == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a classic reduction algorithm.  Each thread loads its portion of the input data into shared memory.  The algorithm then iteratively sums pairs of values, halving the number of active threads at each step.  Crucially, the `__syncthreads()` call ensures that all threads within the block have completed their summation before proceeding to the next iteration.  This coordinated approach eliminates the need for `atomicAdd_block` while guaranteeing correct results.

**Example 2: AtomicAdd with Global Memory for Block-level Aggregation**

```c++
__global__ void globalAtomicReduce(int *input, int *output, int n) {
    __shared__ int blockSum;
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int idx = threadIdx.x;

    if (i < n) {
        blockSum = input[i];
        for (int j = 1; j < blockDim.x && i + j < n; ++j){
            blockSum += input[i + j];
        }
    } else {
        blockSum = 0;
    }
    __syncthreads();

    if(idx == 0){
        atomicAdd(output, blockSum);
    }
}
```

This approach utilizes shared memory for efficient accumulation within a block, then employs `atomicAdd` on global memory to consolidate the block sums.  This leverages the existing, reliable global memory atomic functionality, avoiding the undefined behavior of a hypothetical `atomicAdd_block`. The use of `__syncthreads()` ensures that the accumulation within shared memory is completed before the atomic addition to global memory.

**Example 3:  Using a warp-level reduction for improved performance**

```c++
__global__ void warpAtomicReduce(int* input, int* output, int n){
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int lane = threadIdx.x % warpSize;
    __shared__ int sharedData[256];

    if (i < n) {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = input[i];
    } else {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = 0;
    }
    __syncthreads();


    for (int offset = warpSize / 2; offset > 0; offset >>= 1) {
        if (lane < offset) {
            sharedData[threadIdx.x] += sharedData[threadIdx.x + offset];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if(lane == 0){
        atomicAdd(output + blockIdx.x, sharedData[threadIdx.x]);
    }

}
```

This example showcases a technique that reduces the overhead by performing a reduction at the warp level before using global atomics. This can be significantly faster than the previous examples, especially for large blocks, as it minimizes the number of atomic operations.

The absence of `atomicAdd_block` is not a deficiency; it's a design choice dictated by the underlying hardware and a reflection of the most efficient programming practices for parallel processing on GPUs.  Understanding these principles and leveraging appropriate reduction techniques is crucial for writing high-performance and robust CUDA code.
