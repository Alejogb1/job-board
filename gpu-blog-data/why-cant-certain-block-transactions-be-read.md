Block transactions, particularly within certain blockchain architectures, can exhibit characteristics that render them opaque to straightforward read attempts. This opacity stems primarily from the deliberate use of encryption techniques applied to the transaction data itself, coupled with the inherent design of privacy-focused blockchain protocols.

I've spent a considerable amount of time working with different blockchain implementations, from public ledgers to private permissioned systems, and the reasons for transaction unreadability always boil down to a few core principles. The crux of the matter isn’t that the data is *gone*, but rather that it's structured in such a way that direct interpretation without the appropriate cryptographic keys or contextual information is computationally infeasible.

First, consider that many blockchain networks, particularly those aiming for user privacy, do not simply store plaintext transaction details. Instead, they frequently employ encryption at multiple layers. The most fundamental level often involves asymmetric cryptography, where the sender encrypts the transaction using the recipient’s public key. Only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt and read the transaction. This ensures that even if an observer intercepts the transaction data as it propagates across the network, they cannot ascertain its contents. Without access to the private key, the transaction remains indecipherable.

Secondly, zero-knowledge proofs play a significant role. In systems utilizing zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs, transactions can be validated without revealing the specifics of the transferred assets or the participating parties. These proofs allow nodes to confirm the transaction's validity—for example, verifying that the sender possessed sufficient funds and the transaction was authorized—without disclosing the actual amounts or addresses involved. The result is that the data contained on the blockchain itself is only a mathematical proof of validity, not a direct representation of the transaction details. Anyone can verify the validity of the proof, but not glean information about the transaction.

Third, the concept of "shielding" transactions further contributes to unreadability. Protocols like Zcash use shielded addresses. When a transaction involves shielded addresses, the transaction data is encrypted and the sender's and receiver's addresses are not part of the observable data on the ledger. Instead of addresses, the transaction involves cryptographic commitments that hide these details. These commitments are generated using one-way functions, making it computationally intractable to derive the original data.

This deliberate obscurity is not a bug, but a feature, integral to the design of these systems. While on public blockchains like Bitcoin, transaction details are viewable by anyone, these privacy-centric protocols prioritize confidentiality over transparency. The trade-off between transparency and privacy is a core consideration in the design of various distributed ledger technologies.

Let's illustrate this with some examples. Imagine a simplified scenario using asymmetric encryption with RSA.

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

# Example: Asymmetric Encryption
def generate_keys():
    private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
        public_exponent=65537,
        key_size=2048
    )
    public_key = private_key.public_key()
    return private_key, public_key

def encrypt_transaction(message, public_key):
    encrypted_message = public_key.encrypt(
        message.encode('utf-8'),
        padding.OAEP(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            label=None
        )
    )
    return encrypted_message

def decrypt_transaction(encrypted_message, private_key):
    decrypted_message = private_key.decrypt(
        encrypted_message,
        padding.OAEP(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            label=None
        )
    )
    return decrypted_message.decode('utf-8')


# Example usage:
sender_private_key, sender_public_key = generate_keys()
recipient_private_key, recipient_public_key = generate_keys()

transaction_data = "Send 100 tokens to recipient"
encrypted_data = encrypt_transaction(transaction_data, recipient_public_key)
# The encrypted_data is what will be written to the ledger.
# This is unreadable without the recipient's private key.
print(f"Encrypted transaction data: {encrypted_data}")

decrypted_data = decrypt_transaction(encrypted_data, recipient_private_key)
print(f"Decrypted transaction data: {decrypted_data}")

```

In this simplified RSA example, the transaction data is not stored as readable text. Only the receiver with access to the private key can decrypt it.  This demonstrates how standard cryptographic techniques are used to restrict who can access transaction information on a ledger. In a real-world scenario, far more sophisticated techniques are implemented.

Now, let's consider a pseudo-code example to illustrate how zero-knowledge proofs could work. This example isn't executable as it simplifies mathematical complexities, but aims to demonstrate the conceptual process.

```python
# Simplified Example: Zero-Knowledge Proof (Conceptual)
def commit(data, salt): #One way hash
   # This is a simulation of how a commitment is calculated
   # In reality, cryptographic hash function would be used
    return hash(f"{data}{salt}")

def verify_commitment(proof, commitment):
  # Verifies proof, but doesn't reveal original data
   # In reality, involves complex math and cryptographic proofs
    return is_valid_proof(proof, commitment)

# Simulation usage
transaction_amount= 100
secret_salt = "randomsalt123"
transaction_commitment = commit(transaction_amount, secret_salt)

# Proof created using zk-Snark/Stark methods.
# Note that this is a placeholder.
transaction_proof = create_zk_proof(transaction_amount, secret_salt)

if verify_commitment(transaction_proof, transaction_commitment):
  print("Transaction Validated")
else:
  print("Transaction Failed")
#The amount remains secret because verification only uses the proof.
print(f"Transaction commitment: {transaction_commitment}")

```
This pseudo-code depicts that the commitment and proof are what is stored on the ledger, not the transaction amount itself. The proof convinces a verifier of transaction validity without revealing the original data. The `create_zk_proof` and `is_valid_proof` functions are placeholders to represent the intricate mathematics that ensure the integrity and privacy of zero-knowledge transactions.

Finally, considering shielded transactions, let's represent the high-level conceptual process.

```python
# Simplified Example: Shielded Transaction (Conceptual)
def generate_commitment(value, secret, randomness):
    # Simulates a cryptographic commitment function (real impl. uses elliptic curves)
   return hash(f"{value}{secret}{randomness}")

def create_nullifier(secret):
    # Simulates generation of nullifier to prevent double spends
    return hash(secret)


# Simulation usage
sender_balance = 500
sender_secret = "sender_unique_key"
sender_randomness= "random_bytes_sender"
value_to_transfer = 100
recipient_secret = "recipient_unique_key"
recipient_randomness= "random_bytes_recipient"
#Sender commits to transfer.
sender_commitment = generate_commitment(value_to_transfer, sender_secret,sender_randomness)

recipient_commitment = generate_commitment(value_to_transfer,recipient_secret,recipient_randomness)


sender_nullifier = create_nullifier(sender_secret)

print(f"Sender commitment: {sender_commitment}")
print(f"Recipient commitment: {recipient_commitment}")
print(f"Sender nullifier: {sender_nullifier}")
# These are published on the ledger.
# The transaction value and sender/recipient identities remain shielded.
```
In this simplified depiction, the actual transaction value and identities of the participants are not directly included on the blockchain. Instead, commitment and nullifier values are recorded, and these obfuscate the transaction details. Real implementations employ complex mathematics using elliptic curves and Pedersen commitments, for example.

In summary, certain blockchain transactions cannot be read because privacy features are designed to obfuscate the transaction details using cryptographic techniques. These include asymmetric encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and shielded transactions, each serving to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive transactional data.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring literature on cryptographic primitives such as elliptic curve cryptography, zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs, and Pedersen commitments. Additionally, reviewing the technical documentation of privacy-focused blockchain protocols can also provide valuable insight into these complex designs. Finally, I recommend studying the basics of how consensus protocols work to understand how these transactions are added to the blockchain and validated. These combined efforts would solidify an understanding of why certain blockchain transactions are designed to be unreadable by default.
