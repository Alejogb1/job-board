Neural network training accuracy degradation is a multifaceted problem I've encountered frequently in my years developing and deploying deep learning models for high-frequency trading.  The root cause isn't always readily apparent, often stemming from a complex interplay of factors rather than a single, easily identifiable bug.  My experience suggests that the issue rarely originates from a fundamental flaw in the network architecture itself, but rather in the data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, or the training process itself.

1. **Data Issues:** This is, by far, the most common culprit.  Insufficient, noisy, or improperly preprocessed data will invariably lead to poor model generalization and declining accuracy during training.  Insufficient data prevents the network from learning the underlying data distribution effectively, resulting in overfitting on the training set and subsequently poor performance on unseen data. Noisy data introduces irrelevant information that confounds the learning process, hindering the network's ability to extract meaningful patterns.  Improper preprocessing, including inadequate normalization or standardization, can also lead to significant performance degradation.  For instance, failing to center and scale features with differing ranges can cause gradients to explode or vanish, significantly impacting training stability and accuracy.  In one project involving time-series prediction for stock prices, I experienced a dramatic drop in accuracy until I implemented robust outlier detection and removal techniques, along with careful feature scaling using a robust scaler, specifically designed to handle outliers.

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  The selection of appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for effective training.  Incorrect choices can lead to several problems.  A learning rate that is too high can cause the optimizer to overshoot the optimal weights, leading to oscillations and divergence. Conversely, a learning rate that is too low can result in slow convergence and insufficient exploration of the weight space.  Similarly, the choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop) significantly influences training dynamics.  I've personally witnessed situations where switching from Adam to SGD with momentum dramatically improved performance due to the inherent properties of each optimizer and their suitability to the specific dataset and architecture.  Furthermore, the batch size plays a crucial role. Larger batch sizes can lead to faster convergence but may result in suboptimal solutions due to less exploration of the loss landscape.  Smaller batch sizes provide a more stochastic gradient estimate, allowing for more exploration but potentially slower convergence.  The optimal batch size is often dataset-specific and requires experimentation.  Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, also influence generalization ability.  Incorrectly setting the regularization parameters can either lead to underfitting (too strong regularization) or overfitting (too weak regularization).

3. **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, leading to poor generalization.  Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Both scenarios manifest as declining accuracy during training.  Overfitting is often manifested by high training accuracy and low validation/test accuracy, while underfitting shows low accuracy across both training and validation/test sets.  Detecting and addressing these issues requires careful monitoring of training and validation curves, and employing techniques like early stopping, cross-validation, and regularization.


**Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Preprocessing using RobustScaler:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

# Sample data with outliers
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [100, 101, 102]])

# Initialize RobustScaler
scaler = RobustScaler()

# Fit and transform the data
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

print(scaled_data)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the use of `RobustScaler` from scikit-learn to handle potential outliers during data preprocessing.  RobustScaler uses the median and interquartile range, making it less sensitive to extreme values compared to standard scaling using mean and standard deviation.


**Example 2: Implementing Early Stopping:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a callback for early stopping
early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, restore_best_weights=True)

# Compile and train the model with the early stopping callback
model.compile(...)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping])
```

This illustrates the implementation of early stopping using TensorFlow/Keras.  The `EarlyStopping` callback monitors the validation loss and stops training if it doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs (`patience`), preventing overfitting and saving computational resources.  The `restore_best_weights` parameter ensures that the weights corresponding to the best validation loss are restored.


**Example 3:  Adjusting Learning Rate using Learning Rate Scheduler:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a learning rate scheduler
def scheduler(epoch, lr):
  if epoch < 10:
    return lr
  else:
    return lr * tf.math.exp(-0.1)

lr_schedule = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(scheduler)

# Compile and train the model with the learning rate scheduler
model.compile(...)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, callbacks=[lr_schedule])
```

This example shows a custom learning rate scheduler.  The learning rate is initially kept constant for the first 10 epochs, and then decays exponentially thereafter.  This type of schedule is commonly used to fine-tune the model's learning in later epochs.  Experimenting with various learning rate schedules can significantly impact the convergence and final accuracy of the model.


**Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron; "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen.  These texts provide a comprehensive foundation in deep learning principles and techniques, addressing many of the challenges associated with training neural networks.  Further, exploring documentation for specific deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) is crucial for understanding the intricacies of model building and training.  Finally, actively participating in relevant online communities and forums allows for the exchange of knowledge and troubleshooting expertise.
