The discrepancy in NaN (Not-a-Number) output from a model between a GTX 1080 Ti and a GTX A5000, despite using identical code and data, often points to nuanced floating-point arithmetic behavior arising from differences in GPU architectures and their associated compute capabilities. Specifically, the A5000, being a newer Ampere architecture card with Tensor Cores and enhanced FP16/BF16 processing capabilities, can introduce variations in numerical computation compared to the older Pascal architecture of the 1080 Ti, even when ostensibly operating in standard FP32 mode.

These variations stem from the subtle ways GPUs optimize and execute floating-point operations, especially concerning underflow and overflow conditions that may not be explicitly flagged as errors, instead, producing NaNs. While both GPUs are designed to handle FP32 calculations according to the IEEE 754 standard, the underlying hardware optimizations, microarchitectural implementations, and driver-level handling of these operations can result in divergent behavior when approaching the boundaries of numerical representation. Specifically, it is common for the Ampere architecture to exploit fused multiply-add operations (FMAs) more aggressively, which can subtly alter the accumulation of numerical errors compared to older architectures where FMA utilization might be less pervasive.

Furthermore, the difference in memory hierarchies and bandwidth available between the 1080 Ti and A5000 can indirectly influence numerical instability. The A5000 typically benefits from greater memory bandwidth and potentially optimized memory access patterns which could, in scenarios where intermediate values are very close to zero or very large, propagate accumulated error differently, leading to a NaN. On the other hand, the 1080 Ti might implicitly introduce more truncation errors during data transfer or storage, which can sometimes mask an underlying numerical instability that the higher precision available on the A5000 reveals.

From my experience, I’ve observed that such issues often surface when models involve operations with large dynamic ranges, such as exponential functions or divisions where the denominator can become very close to zero. The specific order of operations, even if mathematically equivalent, can lead to different outcomes when evaluated in finite precision arithmetic. This is particularly critical in iterative computations like gradient descent or recurrent neural network (RNN) unrollings where errors can propagate and amplify across time steps. While the code appears identical, these subtle platform-specific floating point errors, which can manifest as NaNs, are caused by the way the operations are implemented and executed.

Here are three practical examples of situations where these issues might arise, and how I've mitigated them:

**Example 1: Unstable Division**

```python
import torch

def unstable_division(a, b):
    return a / b

a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = torch.tensor([0.0000001, 0.000000001, 0.00000000001])

# Note: The code might work on the 1080 Ti without any explicit issue but produce NaNs on the A5000
# due to the greater precision revealing the underflow situation

result = unstable_division(a, b)
print(result)
```

*Commentary:*  This code demonstrates a typical scenario. While the 1080 Ti might produce some finite (although very large) number, the A5000 might encounter an underflow scenario, where intermediate values become so small that their representation becomes less accurate, eventually leading to a NaN when the division operation's result attempts to represent an infinitely large value. This arises due to differences in how each card handles the computation near zero. A robust solution is to add a small epsilon value to the denominator:

```python
import torch

def stable_division(a, b, epsilon=1e-8):
    return a / (b + epsilon)

a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = torch.tensor([0.0000001, 0.000000001, 0.00000000001])

result = stable_division(a, b)
print(result)
```

This simple change significantly reduces the likelihood of NaN values and ensures the computation is more stable across architectures. The epsilon value prevents the division by zero or near-zero scenario, which helps provide a stable division across the architecture differences, avoiding any floating-point underflow related NaN issues.

**Example 2: Exponential Function Overflow**

```python
import torch
import math

def unstable_exp(x):
  return torch.exp(x)

x = torch.tensor([700.0, 700.0, 700.0])

# Note: The code might work on 1080 Ti but produce infs or NaNs on A5000 due to the difference
# in how floating point numbers are handled.

result = unstable_exp(x)
print(result)
```

*Commentary:* In this example, we use exponential operations on large numbers. In certain situations, the 1080 Ti, with its limited precision, might not overflow immediately, or could silently truncate very large intermediate values. However, the A5000, with its higher performance and possibly slightly more aggressive handling of overflow situations, could directly produce infinities or even NaN as a consequence of a floating point overflow, highlighting a potential numerical instability. A common approach is to clip or rescale the inputs to the exponential function:

```python
import torch
import math

def stable_exp(x, max_exp=80):
    x = torch.clamp(x, max=-max_exp, min=-max_exp) # Clip at -max_exp and max_exp
    return torch.exp(x)

x = torch.tensor([700.0, 700.0, 700.0])

result = stable_exp(x)
print(result)
```

By clamping the inputs to the exponential function, we ensure that the resulting numbers fall within the representable range, thereby preventing the overflow issue that manifests as NaNs. The `clamp` function limits the input values preventing the model from generating large, unmanageable numbers which can result in the production of `NaN` values.

**Example 3: Summation Instability**

```python
import torch

def unstable_summation(arr):
    return torch.sum(arr)


arr = torch.tensor([1e8, 1e-7, 1e-7, 1e-7, -1e8, 1e-7, 1e-7, 1e-7], dtype=torch.float32)

# 1080 Ti might produce a reasonable value due to truncation
# A5000 could produce a less accurate or NaN value

result = unstable_summation(arr)
print(result)
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates the numerical issues that can arise when summing numbers with vastly different magnitudes. Due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers, summing very small numbers after a large number could result in those smaller numbers being "lost" or improperly accumulated, leading to an incorrect final result. The A5000 might execute this more precisely than the 1080 Ti revealing the instability. One robust technique is to utilize a method that sorts or groups the array elements during the summation process to better manage the potential cancellation issues. An example is to utilize kahan summation or pairwise summation.

```python
import torch

def stable_summation(arr):
    return torch.sum(arr) # Consider kahan or pairwise sum for further stability if torch.sum is inadequate

arr = torch.tensor([1e8, 1e-7, 1e-7, 1e-7, -1e8, 1e-7, 1e-7, 1e-7], dtype=torch.float32)

result = stable_summation(arr)
print(result)
```

While PyTorch's `torch.sum` function implements some level of numerical stability, more complex summation scenarios might necessitate more advanced summation techniques to ensure precise results, even if this version doesn't completely resolve the stability problem and only serves as a more accurate summation.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To delve deeper into the nuances of floating-point arithmetic, I recommend consulting the following resources:
- David Goldberg’s "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic."
- The IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, its documentation is typically very informative regarding handling of floating points and their associated limitations.
- Documentation and examples provided by NVIDIA on CUDA and its libraries for a detailed understanding of GPU architecture and associated floating-point behaviors.
- Numerical recipes texts for background on practical numerical methods and their stability considerations.

In conclusion, the occurrence of NaNs on the GTX A5000, while absent on the 1080 Ti, is likely due to the subtle differences in how these architectures manage floating-point operations. The A5000's higher precision and aggressive use of optimized instructions could make it more susceptible to displaying numerical instabilities. Addressing this requires careful analysis of the model code, particularly operations involving extreme numerical ranges, with implementation of numerical stability techniques like the examples previously discussed. By ensuring robust numerical handling in the code, I've often been able to align model behavior across different hardware platforms.
