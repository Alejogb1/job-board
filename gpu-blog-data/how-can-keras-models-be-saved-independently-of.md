The inherent coupling between Keras and TensorFlow, especially in earlier versions, often leads to deployment challenges when TensorFlow isn't the desired runtime environment.  This tight integration stems from Keras's historical reliance on TensorFlow as a backend. However,  my experience working on large-scale deployment projects – particularly those involving legacy systems – has shown that achieving true model independence requires a deliberate approach leveraging the flexibility of the Keras API and careful consideration of serialization formats.  The key to saving Keras models independently of TensorFlow rests in utilizing the `save_model` function with appropriate configurations and leveraging alternative serialization formats, such as HDF5 or the newer SavedModel format with a non-TensorFlow serving environment.

**1. Clear Explanation of Model Independence from TensorFlow:**

Keras, by its design, allows for the use of multiple backends (TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK – although Theano and CNTK are largely deprecated now).  Saving a model "independently" doesn't imply a complete severance from TensorFlow's influence if it was used during training.  Rather, it means saving the model's architecture and weights in a format that can be loaded and used by a different runtime environment, or even a self-contained environment without requiring a TensorFlow installation. This independence becomes crucial when dealing with:

* **Deployment Environments:**  Target deployment environments may not have TensorFlow installed, due to resource constraints, licensing issues, or compatibility problems with existing software stacks.
* **Model Serving:** Model serving frameworks often have specific requirements, and direct TensorFlow integration might not be optimal.  A standalone model format increases compatibility and portability.
* **Collaboration and Reproducibility:** Sharing models with collaborators who might be using different deep learning frameworks necessitates an independent format.

Achieving this independence relies heavily on the choices made during model saving.  Simply using `model.save('my_model.h5')` is insufficient in many cases, as it still binds the model's internal representation to the TensorFlow backend.  More robust methods are necessary.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using HDF5 for simple model architectures**

This approach is best suited for simpler models where custom layers or complex functionalities are not heavily involved.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate dummy data for demonstration
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

# Train the model (briefly, for demonstration)
model.fit(x_train, keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train), epochs=1)

# Save the model using HDF5 format
model.save('my_model.h5')

# Load the model (in a new environment potentially without TensorFlow)
# Note: You would need h5py to load the model
# import h5py
# loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
```

**Commentary:** HDF5 is a widely used file format for storing large amounts of numerical data. Keras utilizes it effectively for saving model architectures and weights. While generally efficient, HDF5 might not capture all aspects of complex models efficiently.


**Example 2: Utilizing SavedModel format with custom objects:**

The SavedModel format offers a more robust and flexible approach, particularly when dealing with custom layers, metrics, or callbacks.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Layer
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()

    def call(self, inputs):
      return tf.nn.relu(inputs)

# Model with custom layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy data and training (omitted for brevity)

# Save the model using SavedModel
model.save('my_saved_model', save_format='tf')

# Load the model (requires TensorFlow but demonstrates SavedModel's capability)
reloaded_model = load_model('my_saved_model')
```

**Commentary:** The `save_format='tf'` argument explicitly saves the model using the TensorFlow SavedModel format. This method better handles custom components, but still retains a TensorFlow dependency for loading.  To achieve complete independence, one must explore alternative loading mechanisms after saving in this format, potentially using only the architecture description exported by Keras, and re-creating the model in a different framework.


**Example 3:  Exporting Architecture and Weights Separately:**

This technique provides the most control and facilitates portability, even if a rebuild of the model in the new framework is needed.

```python
import json
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# ... (model definition and training as in Example 1) ...

# Save model architecture (JSON is a good choice)
model_json = model.to_json()
with open("model_architecture.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)

# Save model weights (NumPy's .npy format is suitable)
model.save_weights("model_weights.h5")

# Load architecture and weights (In a different environment, potentially without TensorFlow)
# from tensorflow import keras  #(Or a different framework)
# with open('model_architecture.json', 'r') as f:
#     model_json = f.read()
# loaded_model = keras.models.model_from_json(model_json)
# loaded_model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')
```

**Commentary:**  This approach separates the model's structural description (JSON) from its numerical weights (HDF5). This allows for rebuilding the model using different frameworks, provided they support the architectural description format and the weight loading mechanism.  This gives the greatest level of independence.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly sections focusing on model saving and loading, remains the primary reference.  Consult documentation specific to the chosen framework (e.g., PyTorch, scikit-learn) for information on importing and utilizing weights from Keras models.  Books on practical deep learning deployment and model serialization will provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Finally, examining the source code of various model serving platforms can provide insight into best practices for independent model deployment.  Note that the specific methods for loading models from these saved files vary based on the chosen framework.  Careful attention must be paid to format compatibility.
