Converting Keras symbolic inputs or outputs to NumPy arrays during the execution of a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` requires a careful understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and execution model. The core issue arises from the fact that within a `tf.keras.Model`'s `call` method, or any method used during the forward pass, you are not directly working with concrete numerical values; you are handling symbolic tensors that represent the computation that *will* be performed when the model is executed. Directly attempting to cast these symbolic tensors into NumPy arrays will result in an error.

The key to effectively handling this is to understand the difference between the *definition* of the model’s forward pass and the *execution* of it. Within `call`, you are defining the graph; you're not actually evaluating it. To get NumPy arrays, you must first complete the forward pass, allowing TensorFlow to calculate the output tensors. Then, you must retrieve the actual numeric values from those tensors.

This typically means that you cannot perform this conversion *inside* your `call` method. Instead, you must let the `call` method operate on symbolic tensors, complete the forward pass, then subsequently, after model execution, access and convert the resulting concrete tensor values to NumPy arrays. This usually happens during training or prediction stages, outside of the core model definition.

Let's explore several scenarios and techniques to illustrate this process. Consider a simplified model subclassing `tf.keras.Model`, specifically dealing with scenarios where one might require access to NumPy arrays during development and debugging:

**Scenario 1: Accessing output as a NumPy array during prediction.**

Suppose we have a simple linear regression model implemented as a subclass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class LinearRegression(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units=1):
        super(LinearRegression, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

model = LinearRegression(units=1)

# Generate dummy input data (NumPy array)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10).astype(np.float32)

# Pass through the model to execute the forward pass.
output_tensor = model(input_data)

# Convert the resulting tensor to NumPy:
output_numpy = output_tensor.numpy()

print("Output NumPy array shape:", output_numpy.shape)
print("Output NumPy array:", output_numpy)
```

In this example, the `call` method accepts a symbolic tensor `inputs` and returns another symbolic tensor. We *do not* try to convert this to a NumPy array inside `call`.  Instead, we create an instance of the model (`model`), then we pass a real NumPy array (`input_data`) *through* the model with `model(input_data)`. This triggers the forward pass, resulting in a concrete tensor `output_tensor` containing real numerical values. *Then* we call `.numpy()` on `output_tensor` to obtain the desired NumPy array representation, `output_numpy`. The shape and content of the NumPy array are printed, confirming the conversion. It's critical to perform the conversion after model execution.

**Scenario 2: Accessing intermediate activations during development for analysis.**

Occasionally, it’s beneficial during the model development stage to access intermediate layer outputs to assess their behavior. Let's consider a slightly more complex model that includes an activation function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class ModelWithIntermediate(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units=1):
        super(ModelWithIntermediate, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units * 2)
        self.relu = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = self.relu(x)
        intermediate_output = x # Capture intermediate tensor.
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x, intermediate_output

model = ModelWithIntermediate(units=1)

# Dummy input
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 5).astype(np.float32)

# Execute model and retrieve both outputs
output, intermediate_tensor = model(input_data)

# Convert intermediate tensor to NumPy
intermediate_output_numpy = intermediate_tensor.numpy()

# Convert final output tensor to NumPy
output_numpy = output.numpy()


print("Intermediate NumPy output shape:", intermediate_output_numpy.shape)
print("Final NumPy output shape:", output_numpy.shape)
```

Here, within `call`, we've assigned `x` after the ReLU operation to `intermediate_output`. The `call` method now returns *two* symbolic tensors – `x` which is the final output and `intermediate_output` which allows us to observe what happened after the first dense layer and ReLU. After the model has been executed,  `output` and `intermediate_tensor` are concrete tensors and we convert `intermediate_tensor` and `output` to their respective NumPy arrays using `.numpy()`. This allows detailed inspection of the forward pass at various points. Note this approach should be reserved for development and debugging, and be avoided during actual training.

**Scenario 3: Combining NumPy operations with TensorFlow operations.**

Sometimes during analysis, or even within custom training loops, you might require some form of NumPy operation alongside the model output. A critical point here is to avoid doing this inside the model definition. Here is an example illustrating this.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class BasicModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units=1):
        super(BasicModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

model = BasicModel(units=1)

# Example input
input_data = np.random.rand(2, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Execute model
output_tensor = model(input_data)

# Convert output to NumPy
output_numpy = output_tensor.numpy()

# Perform NumPy operations on the output array
output_sum = np.sum(output_numpy, axis=1) # NumPy operation.

# Convert numpy back to tensor if needed:
result_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(output_sum, dtype=tf.float32)

print("Output NumPy Array:", output_numpy)
print("Summed output NumPy array:", output_sum)
print("Tensor after NumPy operation", result_tensor)
```

Here, after executing the `BasicModel`, we obtain the NumPy array via `.numpy()`. Then, we perform a sum operation on the output along axis 1 using NumPy's `sum` function. This sum operation occurs *after* the model execution and on actual values, not symbolic tensors. Should you require the NumPy result to be reintroduced to the TensorFlow graph, it can be converted back to a tensor with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To solidify your understanding of these concepts, I recommend exploring the following official TensorFlow resources:

1.  The "TensorFlow Guide" section provides comprehensive material on fundamental TensorFlow concepts including tensors, graphs and model creation. This resource is available through the TensorFlow website and documentation portal.
2.  The "TensorFlow Keras API Documentation" section details specifically the usage of `tf.keras.Model`, the `call` method, and other essential elements of Keras for building custom models. This is key for understanding how to define and use subclasses of `tf.keras.Model`.
3.  The "TensorFlow Eager Execution" section provides information about the way TensorFlow handles execution and computation. Understanding the nature of symbolic tensors and how computations are carried out is essential.

These resources, combined with the code examples and commentary presented above, should provide you with a robust foundation for handling tensor-to-NumPy conversions within custom Keras models. Always remember that converting symbolic tensors to NumPy arrays requires model execution, and this conversion must happen outside the model's `call` method.
