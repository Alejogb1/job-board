`tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()` operates on the principle of slicing along the *first* dimension of a tensor, and therefore it expects that all input tensors share the same size on that dimension, which represents the number of data instances. DataFrames, however, are fundamentally structured with rows as instances and columns as features. This mismatch is the root cause of the inability to directly load DataFrame columns using `from_tensor_slices()`. I've encountered this limitation numerous times while building custom data pipelines for TensorFlow models.

The functionâ€™s mechanics center around treating each slice extracted from a given tensor as a single data element. Imagine a NumPy array, shaped `(100, 5)`, where `100` signifies the number of samples and `5` signifies five features per sample. `from_tensor_slices()` would produce a dataset of 100 elements, each corresponding to a row of data with 5 elements. This is an explicit feature: if you supply multiple tensors, they *must* have matching dimensions across the first axis, so that corresponding slices form a single dataset item (e.g., the features, label, and sample weights all for a single instance of data).  DataFrames, in contrast, organize data by rows and each column has its own separate values for each of those rows. Therefore, supplying DataFrame columns directly results in a tensor shape mismatch. `from_tensor_slices` attempts to slice each column individually along the rows and expects it to produce matching rows across all columns. 

To understand why this fails, consider a typical DataFrame where we have a dataset with three features (`col1`, `col2`, `col3`) and, for illustration, ten rows. If `from_tensor_slices` were to work with columns, it would treat each column individually. Therefore, for one row, it would require the slice of `col1` at that row, and then find a corresponding "slice" of `col2`, and `col3`. However, this is not how the column-wise data is organized. Each column is inherently a tensor of length 10 and the slicing should occur row-wise, across all columns, to provide slices that map to a single data instance. Let's illustrate this concept with code examples that simulate this error.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Column Loading**

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulating a DataFrame
data = {'col1': np.random.rand(10), 
        'col2': np.random.rand(10), 
        'col3': np.random.rand(10)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

try:
    dataset_columns = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
        (df['col1'], df['col2'], df['col3']))
    for element in dataset_columns.take(2):
        print(element)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, we are attempting to directly load the DataFrame columns into `from_tensor_slices`. The error will be a shape mismatch because each column is passed as an independent tensor of shape `(10,)`. The function expects to find matching "row-slices" across the first dimension of the tensors, which we are *not* supplying. Instead, we are giving individual columns and it tries to make sense of that.

**Code Example 2: Correct Row Loading**

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulating a DataFrame
data = {'col1': np.random.rand(10), 
        'col2': np.random.rand(10), 
        'col3': np.random.rand(10)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert the entire DataFrame to a NumPy array
array_data = df.values

# Load the rows into the dataset
dataset_rows = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(array_data)

for element in dataset_rows.take(2):
    print(element)
```

This code snippet exemplifies the proper approach. We convert the entire DataFrame into a NumPy array before using `from_tensor_slices`. The array is organized such that each row becomes a single data point, so the slicing operation creates the dataset correctly.  The result is a dataset where each element is a tensor of the shape (3,) representing all of the feature values for a single row. The first dimension of `array_data` is now the number of data instances. This fulfills the requirements of `from_tensor_slices`.

**Code Example 3: Loading Specific Columns**

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulating a DataFrame
data = {'col1': np.random.rand(10), 
        'col2': np.random.rand(10), 
        'col3': np.random.rand(10),
        'col4': np.random.randint(0, 2, 10)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Select specific columns
selected_cols = ['col1', 'col2', 'col4']
selected_data = df[selected_cols].values

# Load only the selected columns
dataset_selected = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(selected_data)

for element in dataset_selected.take(2):
    print(element)
```

This third example shows how to select specific columns for loading. We select the desired columns from the DataFrame, then transform that to a NumPy array. This maintains the correct row-wise structure and produces a tensor with dimensions (3,) from a single sample. This approach allows you to control precisely which features are included in the training process.  If we had supplied columns separately in the original erroneous way, we would have encountered an error even with only selected columns, since it is the overall approach that creates the shape mismatch.

In summary, `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()` is designed to slice tensors along their first dimension, expecting that these slices represent individual data instances. DataFrames are organized in a row-wise manner, making direct column loading unsuitable. Therefore, you must first convert a DataFrame to a NumPy array before utilizing `from_tensor_slices()`. It is sometimes helpful to extract a set of columns using pandas indexing before transforming it to a NumPy array. This process creates the tensor structure required by `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()`.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset` and its creation methods.  Also examine resources for efficient data handling in TensorFlow using `tf.data`. Additionally, books dedicated to practical machine learning using TensorFlow often dedicate sections to data ingestion, which will further clarify these concepts.
