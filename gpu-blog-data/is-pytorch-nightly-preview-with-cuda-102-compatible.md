The compatibility of PyTorch nightly builds with specific CUDA versions is not guaranteed and hinges critically on the interplay between the PyTorch build's CUDA capabilities and your system's driver and toolkit installation.  My experience troubleshooting compatibility issues across numerous projects, particularly involving high-performance computing tasks relying on GPU acceleration, highlights the importance of meticulous version management.  CUDA 10.2, while not the latest, remains relevant in certain legacy systems, demanding a careful approach to nightly PyTorch integration.

The first crucial step in determining compatibility is verifying your CUDA toolkit version.  A mismatch between the CUDA version your PyTorch nightly build was compiled against and the CUDA toolkit installed on your machine is the most frequent cause of errors.  PyTorch nightly builds frequently incorporate cutting-edge features and optimizations, often tied to specific CUDA versions.  Installing an incompatible CUDA toolkit will likely result in runtime errors, ranging from cryptic segmentation faults to explicit `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` exceptions.

To ascertain your CUDA toolkit version, open a terminal or command prompt and execute `nvcc --version`. This command will output the version of the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, directly indicating your installed toolkit version.   Compare this version number to the CUDA version specified in the PyTorch nightly build documentation, which should be clearly stated in the release notes or build instructions. If a match exists, chances of successful compatibility are significantly improved. However, even with a matching CUDA version, driver incompatibility remains a possibility.

Next, investigate your NVIDIA driver version.  The driver serves as the interface between your operating system and the GPU, and it must be compatible with both your hardware and the CUDA toolkit. An outdated or incompatible driver can lead to numerous issues, including kernel launch failures or unexpected behavior.  Use the `nvidia-smi` command (after verifying that the NVIDIA driver is properly installed) to check your driver version.  Consult the NVIDIA website for compatibility information between your GPU model, CUDA toolkit version (10.2 in this case), and the required driver version.  In my experience, discrepancies here frequently manifest as unexpected crashes during PyTorch tensor operations or CUDA kernel executions.

Finally, the PyTorch nightly build itself carries inherent risks. Nightly builds are inherently unstable and contain untested code. Expect bugs, unexpected behavior, and potential incompatibilities. This is why rigorous testing is crucial before relying on them in production environments.

Here are three code examples illustrating potential compatibility issues and debugging strategies.  These examples assume a basic understanding of PyTorch and CUDA programming.

**Example 1:  Checking CUDA Availability**

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"CUDA is available. Version: {torch.version.cuda}")
    print(f"CUDA device count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
    # Access the device properties
    device_props = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0)  #Get properties of device 0
    print(f"Device name: {device_props.name}")
    print(f"CUDA Driver Version: {device_props.major}.{device_props.minor}")
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.  Check your installation.")
```

This code snippet verifies CUDA availability and provides essential information regarding the CUDA version, device count, and driver version within PyTorch's runtime environment. Mismatches between the reported information and the results of `nvcc --version` and `nvidia-smi` point towards installation problems.

**Example 2:  Handling CUDA Errors**

```python
import torch

try:
    device = torch.device("cuda:0")  # Assuming CUDA device 0
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    y = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    z = x + y  # Simple CUDA operation
    print("CUDA operation successful.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"CUDA error encountered: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates a crucial aspect of robust CUDA programming: error handling.  The `try-except` block catches potential `RuntimeError` exceptions, which frequently signal CUDA-related problems.  The specific error message within the exception provides vital clues regarding the nature of the incompatibility.  Carefully examine the exception message for keywords indicating driver issues, memory allocation problems, or invalid CUDA API calls.

**Example 3:  CUDA Kernel Launch Failure (Simplified)**

```python
import torch

@torch.jit.script
def my_kernel(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    return x * 2  # Simple kernel

try:
  device = torch.device('cuda:0')
  x = torch.randn(10, device=device)
  y = my_kernel(x)
  print(y)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Kernel launch failed: {e}")
```

While this is a simplified example, it illustrates a potential failure point where a custom CUDA kernel might fail to launch due to incompatibility.  Examine the error message carefully; it may pinpoint driver issues, conflicts with other libraries, or problems with the kernel code itself.  This scenario necessitates further investigation, potentially involving more detailed CUDA debugging tools.


In conclusion, successful PyTorch nightly build integration with CUDA 10.2 necessitates rigorous attention to version compatibility. Ensuring a precise match between your PyTorch build's CUDA requirements and your CUDA toolkit and driver versions is paramount. Always utilize robust error handling mechanisms in your PyTorch code to capture and analyze potential CUDA errors effectively. Regularly consult the official PyTorch and NVIDIA documentation, particularly release notes and compatibility matrices, to mitigate compatibility issues.  Remember, nightly builds are inherently unstable; rigorous testing is mandatory before deployment to production.  For deeper debugging, familiarize yourself with CUDA debugging tools provided by NVIDIA.  Thorough understanding of CUDA programming concepts and best practices will significantly aid in resolving compatibility and runtime issues.
