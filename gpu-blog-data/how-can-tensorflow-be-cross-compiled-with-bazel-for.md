Cross-compiling TensorFlow with Bazel to leverage OpenCL acceleration for a target device fundamentally requires manipulating the build configuration to substitute the standard CUDA dependencies with OpenCL alternatives. This process deviates significantly from a typical CPU-only or CUDA-enabled build and involves intricate modifications within TensorFlow's build environment. I’ve successfully implemented such a configuration in a resource-constrained embedded system project where specialized hardware lacked native CUDA support, requiring extensive adjustments and iterative refinements to achieve the desired outcome.

The first challenge lies in understanding that TensorFlow’s standard Bazel build setup is primarily designed for NVIDIA CUDA architectures. The transition to OpenCL necessitates modifying the `tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl` file and various other related build files to exclude CUDA dependencies while incorporating the appropriate OpenCL libraries, headers, and compilation flags for the target system. Specifically, this involves overriding the default compiler configurations and defining new rules for OpenCL kernels. This process is not a simple ‘switch’ of dependencies, but rather a careful replacement and reconfiguration of the existing build mechanism.

The essential steps include, but are not limited to: (1) defining custom toolchains within Bazel that align with the target OpenCL device’s architecture, (2) specifying the required OpenCL header paths and library paths within the build configuration, (3) modifying TensorFlow's default GPU-related build flags, (4) implementing customized build rules to integrate OpenCL kernel compilation, and (5) setting up appropriate cross-compilation options for the target architecture. This goes beyond simply installing OpenCL drivers; it requires the proper integration of the OpenCL environment within Bazel's build system.

To illustrate, let's consider some code snippets.

**Code Example 1: Toolchain Definition**

This example demonstrates defining a custom toolchain for an imaginary ARM-based embedded system utilizing an OpenCL-enabled processor.

```python
def _arm_opencl_toolchain_impl(ctx):
  cc_toolchain = ctx.attr.cc_toolchain
  toolchain = struct(
      compiler=cc_toolchain.compiler,
      linker=cc_toolchain.linker,
      ar_executable=cc_toolchain.ar_executable,
      objcopy_executable=cc_toolchain.objcopy_executable,
      strip_executable=cc_toolchain.strip_executable,
      supports_header_parsing=False,  # Disable if header parsing is not supported
      cpu_environment_group = cc_toolchain.cpu_environment_group,
      libc_top = cc_toolchain.libc_top,
      # Add the OpenCL header and library paths
      cxx_builtin_include_directories = depset(
            transitive = [
                cc_toolchain.cxx_builtin_include_directories,
                depset(direct=['/opt/arm-opencl-headers/include']), #Path of opencl header files
            ]
      ),
      linker_flags=depset(
          transitive=[
              cc_toolchain.linker_flags,
              depset(direct=['-L/opt/arm-opencl-libs/lib', '-lOpenCL']),  #Path of opencl libraries
          ]
      ),
      compiler_flags = depset(
          transitive = [
              cc_toolchain.compiler_flags,
              depset(direct=['-DCL_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION=200', #Optional to specify the version
                           '-O3',  #optimization flag
                           '-march=armv8-a',  #Target architecture
                           '-mcpu=cortex-a53' #Target processor
                         ]
              ),
         ]
      )
  )
  return toolchain

arm_opencl_toolchain = rule(
    implementation = _arm_opencl_toolchain_impl,
    attrs = {
        "cc_toolchain" : attr.label(mandatory = True),
    },
)


def arm_opencl_toolchains(cpu="arm64"):
  return {
      cpu: arm_opencl_toolchain(
        cc_toolchain = "@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain",
      ),
  }
```

This code block defines a new `arm_opencl_toolchain` rule. Within, I override the necessary compiler, linker, and include paths, incorporating the locations of the OpenCL headers and libraries pertinent to the embedded system. Additionally, it incorporates architecture-specific compiler flags for optimal performance on the targeted device. The `cxx_builtin_include_directories` attribute is used to incorporate paths for header files while `linker_flags` attribute is used to incorporate the libraries and the location of the libraries. Compiler flags are incorporated using `compiler_flags` attribute.  This specific example targets ARM64 but can be adapted to different architectures. This toolchain would then be specified in the `.bazelrc` file to be used for building targeted binaries.

**Code Example 2: Bazel Configuration Modification**

This snippet demonstrates modifications to TensorFlow's `tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl` or an associated configuration file to conditionally disable CUDA and enable OpenCL.

```python
def _configure_tensorflow(repo_ctx):

    # Check for OpenCL flag. Assume OPENCL_ENABLED environment variable is set
    if "OPENCL_ENABLED" in repo_ctx.os.environ and repo_ctx.os.environ["OPENCL_ENABLED"] == "1":
        # disable CUDA support
        repo_ctx.file("tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config.bzl", content="""
        def build_config():
            return struct(
                enable_cuda = False,
                enable_gpu = True,
                gpu_device_name = "OpenCL"
            )
            """)
        # specify opencl dependencies
        repo_ctx.file("tensorflow/core/platform/default/opencl_deps.bzl", content="""
        def opencl_deps():
          return struct(
              include_paths=["/opt/arm-opencl-headers/include"],
              lib_paths=["/opt/arm-opencl-libs/lib"],
              libs=["OpenCL"]
           )
        """)
        repo_ctx.symlink("tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config_opencl.bzl",
                          "tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config.bzl") #symlink to opencl config
    else:
      repo_ctx.file("tensorflow/core/platform/default/build_config.bzl", content="""
      def build_config():
        return struct(
            enable_cuda = True,
            enable_gpu = True,
            gpu_device_name = "CUDA"
            )
      """)
```

In this fragment, I am using environment variable `OPENCL_ENABLED` to switch between CUDA and OpenCL compilation. If `OPENCL_ENABLED` is set to "1", we specifically disable CUDA, enable generic GPU support (which will later be configured for OpenCL), and point the GPU device name to OpenCL. I am creating separate `build_config_opencl.bzl` to define the configurations for OpenCL. `opencl_deps.bzl` defines the OpenCL libraries and header paths. I am using symlinks to replace the standard build config with the custom one.  This approach ensures that standard CUDA configuration gets overridden. A similar approach can be employed by changing specific configurations such as compiler flags instead of replacing the entire `build_config.bzl` file.

**Code Example 3: Custom Kernel Compilation Rule**

This demonstrates a skeletal Bazel rule to compile OpenCL kernels. This would be used to handle OpenCL kernel source files (`*.cl`).

```python
def _opencl_kernel_compile_impl(ctx):
  output_path = ctx.actions.declare_file(ctx.label.name + ".spv")
  ctx.actions.run(
    executable = ctx.executable.compiler,
    inputs = ctx.files.srcs,
    outputs = [output_path],
    arguments = [
        "-cl-std=CL1.2", # Specify opencl version
        "-o",
        output_path.path,
        ctx.files.srcs[0].path
    ]
  )
  return struct(
    binary=output_path,
  )

opencl_kernel_compile = rule(
    implementation = _opencl_kernel_compile_impl,
    attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(allow_files = True, mandatory = True,
                doc = "The input OpenCL kernel source file"),
        "compiler": attr.executable(
            default = Label("@opencl-tools//:spirv_cross"),
            doc = "The tool to compile cl files to spirv"),
    },
    outputs = {
        "binary" : "%{name}.spv",
    }
)
```

This code defines a custom Bazel rule, `opencl_kernel_compile`, which compiles OpenCL kernel files (*.cl) into SPIR-V binaries (*.spv). This is simplified to illustrate the fundamental concept of how to integrate the OpenCL kernel compilation in the build process. The rule takes an OpenCL kernel source file, uses a specified compiler (which can be a command-line tool such as `spirv_cross`), and generates a compiled binary. The generated binary will be used by the OpenCL runtime.  For a more comprehensive implementation, a robust OpenCL compiler and necessary tool chain will be required. This can be linked in the `BUILD` file.

Cross-compiling for OpenCL significantly complicates the build process beyond standard CPU or CUDA builds. The challenges are related to the custom toolchains, OpenCL driver integration, OpenCL compiler selection, and proper linking of libraries. These steps require a meticulous process of identifying the correct build parameters for the target device.  I spent multiple iterations troubleshooting compilation errors and runtime issues, which is not uncommon with cross-compilation. Debugging the kernel is significantly harder compared to debugging the application running on CPU as it requires specialized debugging tools provided by the hardware vendor.

For further exploration, I would recommend several resources. The Bazel documentation provides comprehensive information on creating toolchains and defining custom rules. The OpenCL documentation and specifications, especially those specific to the target hardware, are invaluable for ensuring compatibility. Lastly, forums for embedded systems developers often contain discussions that may offer solutions to the common pitfalls encountered during cross-compilation. Consulting documentation and forums from the chip vendor which provides the opencl-enabled processor or GPU is also highly recommended. Specific resources depend largely on the target hardware and the specific compiler being used.
