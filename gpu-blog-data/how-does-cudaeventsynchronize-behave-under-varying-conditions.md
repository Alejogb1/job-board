The core behavior of `cudaEventSynchronize` hinges on its role as a synchronization primitive within the CUDA execution model;  it guarantees that all preceding CUDA operations on the specified stream have completed before the function returns.  This seemingly straightforward functionality exhibits nuanced behaviors influenced by error handling, stream management, and the interplay with asynchronous operations. My experience debugging high-performance computing applications built on CUDA has highlighted several crucial aspects of this function's behavior under various conditions.

**1.  Explanation:**

`cudaEventSynchronize` takes a single argument: a `cudaEvent_t` handle. This handle represents an event object created using `cudaEventCreate`.  The event acts as a marker within a CUDA stream.  Prior to calling `cudaEventSynchronize(event)`, any CUDA kernel launches or memory transfers enqueued on the stream associated with the event will execute concurrently, if possible, with other parts of the program. However, calling `cudaEventSynchronize(event)` creates a blocking point.  The CPU thread executing this function will halt until all operations in the specified stream *preceding* the recording of the event (using `cudaEventRecord`) have completed.  Only then will `cudaEventSynchronize` return.  Failure to correctly manage events and streams can lead to subtle race conditions and performance bottlenecks that are particularly challenging to diagnose.

Crucially, `cudaEventSynchronize` operates on a *per-stream* basis.  Multiple streams can execute concurrently, even if their associated events are synchronized. This allows for overlapping computation and data transfer, maximizing GPU utilization.  However, if you need to ensure operations across different streams have completed, more sophisticated inter-stream synchronization mechanisms are required, such as using events and `cudaStreamWaitEvent`.

Error handling is a critical consideration.  `cudaEventSynchronize` can return error codes, indicating issues like invalid event handles, driver failures, or other system-level problems.  Robust CUDA applications should always check the return value of `cudaEventSynchronize` and handle potential errors appropriately. Ignoring error returns can lead to silent failures and unpredictable behavior.  Furthermore, the event itself might be in an invalid state (e.g., due to prior errors during creation or recording), causing `cudaEventSynchronize` to fail.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic Synchronization:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel(int *data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) data[i] *= 2;
}

int main() {
    int N = 1024;
    int *h_data, *d_data;
    cudaEvent_t event;

    // Allocate host and device memory
    cudaMallocHost((void **)&h_data, N * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_data, N * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize host data
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) h_data[i] = i;

    // Copy data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Create event
    cudaEventCreate(&event);

    // Launch kernel and record event
    kernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_data, N);
    cudaEventRecord(event, 0); // Record on default stream (0)

    // Synchronize
    cudaError_t err = cudaEventSynchronize(event);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaEventSynchronize failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // Copy data back to host
    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Verify results
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (h_data[i] != i * 2) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error at index %d: Expected %d, got %d\n", i, i * 2, h_data[i]);
            return 1;
        }
    }

    // Clean up
    cudaEventDestroy(event);
    cudaFree(d_data);
    cudaFreeHost(h_data);
    return 0;
}
```
This example showcases the basic usage, synchronizing on the default stream (stream 0).  Error checking is explicitly included.


**Example 2: Multiple Streams and Synchronization:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// ... (kernel code remains the same) ...

int main() {
    // ... (memory allocation and initialization as before) ...

    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
    cudaEvent_t event1, event2;

    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);
    cudaEventCreate(&event1);
    cudaEventCreate(&event2);

    // Launch kernel on stream1
    kernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256, 0, stream1>>>(d_data, N/2);
    cudaEventRecord(event1, stream1);

    // Launch kernel on stream2
    kernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256, 0, stream2>>>(d_data + N/2, N/2);
    cudaEventRecord(event2, stream2);

    cudaEventSynchronize(event1); //Synchronize stream1
    cudaEventSynchronize(event2); //Synchronize stream2


    // ... (copy data back and verification as before) ...

    cudaEventDestroy(event1);
    cudaEventDestroy(event2);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
    // ... (cleanup as before) ...
}
```

This demonstrates synchronization across multiple streams.  Note that each stream is synchronized independently.


**Example 3: Handling Errors:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// ... (kernel and memory management as before) ...

int main() {
    // ... (memory allocation and initialization as before) ...

    cudaEvent_t event;
    cudaEventCreate(&event);

    // ... (kernel launch and event recording as before) ...

    cudaError_t err = cudaEventSynchronize(event);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaEventSynchronize failed with error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        // Handle error appropriately, e.g., clean up resources and exit
        cudaEventDestroy(event);
        cudaFree(d_data);
        cudaFreeHost(h_data);
        return 1;
    }

    // ... (rest of the code) ...

}
```

This example highlights the importance of checking the return value of `cudaEventSynchronize` and taking appropriate action if an error occurs.  Error handling is crucial for robust application development.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Occupancy Calculator, and the CUDA Toolkit documentation are invaluable resources for understanding and mastering CUDA synchronization primitives.  Furthermore, a strong grasp of parallel programming concepts and multithreading is essential.  Finally, effective debugging techniques, including the use of profiling tools, are crucial for identifying and resolving synchronization-related issues.
