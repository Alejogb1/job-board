TensorFlow's core strength lies in numerical computation, particularly with tensors.  Directly feeding string data into TensorFlow models for prediction requires careful preprocessing and transformation.  My experience developing NLP models for sentiment analysis and named entity recognition extensively involved this very challenge.  The key lies in converting strings into numerical representations that the TensorFlow model can understand. This typically involves techniques like tokenization, embedding, and one-hot encoding, the choice depending on the specific model architecture and the nature of the string data.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

String data, unlike numerical arrays, lacks the inherent mathematical structure TensorFlow thrives on.  A model expecting numerical input cannot directly interpret a string like "This is a positive sentence."  Therefore, we must transform the string into a numerical vector that captures its semantic meaning or relevant features.  This involves several steps:

* **Tokenization:** Breaking down the string into individual units (words, characters, or sub-words, depending on the application). This can be done using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.  For example, "This is a positive sentence" becomes ["This", "is", "a", "positive", "sentence"].

* **Embedding:** Mapping each token to a dense vector representation that captures its contextual meaning.  Pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText provide readily available vector representations for many words.  Alternatively, one can train custom embeddings alongside the main model. Each word is then converted from a string into a vector of floating point numbers.

* **Sequence Representation:** Since sentences vary in length, we need a way to represent them uniformly to feed them into the TensorFlow model.  Common methods include padding (adding zeros to shorter sequences) or masking (identifying padded positions).  The resultant input will be a matrix where each row represents a token's embedding vector and the number of rows corresponds to the sentence length.

* **Model Selection:** The choice of model architecture depends on the task.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs and GRUs, are well-suited for sequential data like text.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can also be effective for capturing local patterns within the text.  Transformer models like BERT are exceptionally powerful for complex NLP tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Sentiment Analysis with Word Embeddings:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
sentences = ["This is good.", "This is bad.", "I love this!", "This is awful."]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Tokenize the sentences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000)  # Adjust num_words as needed
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)

# Pad sequences to a uniform length
maxlen = max(len(s) for s in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=maxlen)

# Assume pre-trained word embeddings are loaded as 'embedding_matrix'
# embedding_matrix.shape should be (vocabulary_size, embedding_dimension)

# Build a simple LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1, 100, weights=[embedding_matrix], input_length=maxlen, trainable=False), #Freeze embeddings for demonstration
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels, epochs=10)

# Prediction with new string input
new_sentence = ["This is excellent!"]
new_sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(new_sentence)
padded_new_sequence = pad_sequences(new_sequence, maxlen=maxlen)
prediction = model.predict(padded_new_sequence)
print(f"Prediction for '{new_sentence[0]}': {prediction[0][0]}")
```

This example uses pre-trained word embeddings and a simple LSTM for sentiment classification.  The crucial parts are tokenization, padding, and utilizing the pre-trained embeddings to convert words into vectors.


**Example 2: Character-level CNN for Text Classification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense

# Sample data (character-level)
sentences = ["ThisIsGood", "ThisIsBad", "ILoveThis", "ThisIsAwful"]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]

# Create character vocabulary
vocab = sorted(list(set("".join(sentences))))
char_to_idx = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(vocab)}
idx_to_char = {idx: char for idx, char in enumerate(vocab)}

# Convert sentences to numerical representations
max_len = max(len(s) for s in sentences)
X = [[char_to_idx[char] for char in sentence] + [0] * (max_len - len(sentence)) for sentence in sentences]
X = np.array(X)

# Build a character-level CNN
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(len(vocab), 32, input_length=max_len),
    Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X, labels, epochs=10)

#Prediction:
new_sentence = ["ThisIsGreat"]
new_sequence = [[char_to_idx[char] for char in new_sentence[0]] + [0] * (max_len-len(new_sentence[0]))]
prediction = model.predict(np.array(new_sequence))
print(f"Prediction for '{new_sentence[0]}': {prediction[0][0]}")
```

This example demonstrates a character-level approach, suitable for situations where word embeddings might not be readily available or appropriate.


**Example 3: Using a Pre-trained Transformer (BERT):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import transformers

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = transformers.TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2) #Assuming binary classification

# Sample data (with longer sentences and more complex contexts)
sentences = ["This movie is fantastic and highly recommended!", "I disliked the plot; it was confusing and poorly written.", "The acting was superb, but the story lagged."]
labels = [1, 0, 1] #1 positive, 0 negative

# Tokenize the sentences
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf')

# Fine-tune the BERT model
model.compile(optimizer='adamw', loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(encoded_input['input_ids'], labels, epochs=3) #Adjust epochs for practical application

#Prediction
new_sentence = ["A truly remarkable performance."]
encoded_new_input = tokenizer(new_sentence, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf')
prediction = model.predict(encoded_new_input['input_ids'])
predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction.logits, axis=1)[0]
print(f"Prediction for '{new_sentence[0]}': {predicted_class}") #0 or 1
```
This example utilizes a pre-trained BERT model, significantly simplifying the preprocessing steps and often providing superior performance for complex NLP tasks.  The tokenizer handles much of the conversion to numerical representations.
