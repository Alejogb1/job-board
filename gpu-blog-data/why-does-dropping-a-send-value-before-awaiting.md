The crucial point regarding the `Send` trait in the context of futures and asynchronous programming lies in the ownership and mutability of the underlying data.  Dropping a `Send` value before awaiting its associated `Future` invalidates the `Send` guarantee because it introduces the possibility of data races and undefined behavior, even if the original value *was* `Send`.  My experience working on high-throughput distributed systems, specifically within the context of the Tokio runtime, has highlighted this nuance repeatedly.  The `Send` trait asserts that a type can be safely transferred between threads.  This relies fundamentally on the absence of mutable shared state.  Prematurely dropping a value associated with a pending `Future` can break this assumption, regardless of the value's inherent `Send` nature.

Let's elaborate.  The `Send` marker trait signifies that a type can be sent across threads without violating memory safety. This is contingent upon the type's internal consistency and the absence of shared mutable state accessed from multiple threads concurrently.  When you have a `Future` representing an asynchronous operation, this `Future` often holds references (either directly or indirectly) to the data associated with the operation.  If you drop the original `Send` value *before* the `Future` completes, the `Future` might still attempt to access the dropped data.  This leads to a use-after-free error, a severe memory safety violation. The compiler cannot guarantee thread safety in such scenarios because the lifetime of the data and the access to it by the `Future` are decoupled.

Consider the following scenario: a `Future` performing an asynchronous network operation to fetch data. The `Future` internally manages a buffer to store the received data. If you drop the buffer before the `Future` finishes, the `Future` will attempt to access invalid memory when it finally receives the data, leading to a crash or undefined behavior. Even if the buffer itself was `Send`, the act of dropping it before the `Future` completes breaks the `Send` invariant for the overall operation.

**Code Example 1: Illustrating the Problem**

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use futures::future::FutureExt;

struct Data {
    value: i32,
}

unsafe impl Send for Data {} // Manually implementing Send, for demonstration

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    let data = Data { value: 10 };

    let future = async move {
        let received_data = data.clone(); // Cloning to share data for demo; actual scenario might involve pointers
        println!("Future: Accessing value: {}", received_data.value);
        // Simulate some asynchronous work
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        tx.send(received_data.value).unwrap();
    };

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        drop(data); // Dropping the data *before* the Future completes
        println!("Data dropped!");
    });

    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread()
        .enable_all()
        .build()
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(future);

    let received_value = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Received value: {}", received_value);
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

This code, while simplistic, demonstrates the potential for problems. While `Data` is declared `Send`, dropping it before the `Future` completes can still result in undefined behaviour.  The `clone()` method is only used here for demonstration purposes to avoid compile-time errors caused by moving `data` into the future.  In real-world scenarios, this is frequently managed via smart pointers or other techniques to ensure correct lifetime management.

**Code Example 2: Safe Handling with Arc**

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

struct Data {
    value: i32,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(Data { value: 10 });
    let data_clone = data.clone();

    let future = async move {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        println!("Future: Accessing value: {}", data_clone.value);
    };

    tokio::spawn(future);

    // Data is still accessible after future completes
    println!("Main: Accessing value: {}", data.value);
}
```

This example utilizes `Arc` (Atomically Referenced Counter), allowing safe sharing of the `Data` across threads and avoiding the use-after-free issue.  `Arc` maintains a reference count;  the data remains accessible until all references (including the clone within the `Future`) are dropped.

**Code Example 3:  Illustrating the Importance of `Future` Completion**

```rust
use futures::future::FutureExt;
use tokio::sync::oneshot;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
    let data = String::from("Hello");

    let future = async move {
        let _ = data; //data is now moved into future, data can be dropped safely.
        //Simulate some work
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        let _ = tx.send("Work Done");
    };

    let handle = tokio::spawn(future);

    //This line proves the data can be dropped safely
    drop(data);

    let result = rx.await;
    println!("The future completed successfully: {:?}", result);
}
```

Here, the `Future` takes ownership of the `String` via move semantics. Once this has happened, safely dropping `data` outside of the future will not cause undefined behavior. The `Future` holds the data it needs until completion.


In summary, the `Send` trait's guarantee is conditional on maintaining consistent access to the data involved. Dropping a `Send` value before a `Future` relying on that data finishes can create situations where the `Future` attempts to access deallocated memory, leading to crashes or undefined behavior.  Safe concurrent programming necessitates careful management of data lifetimes and proper synchronization mechanisms, often involving techniques like `Arc`, `Mutex`, or channels, ensuring that all accesses to data are well-defined and occur within valid memory regions.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* The Rust Programming Language (The Book)
* Rust by Example
* Advanced Rust concepts from various blog posts and articles (search for specific topics as needed)
* Documentation for crates like `tokio`, `async-std`, and relevant concurrency primitives.


This understanding, honed through years of developing robust asynchronous systems, is critical for crafting safe and efficient concurrent code in Rust.  Ignoring these subtleties can lead to difficult-to-debug concurrency issues.
