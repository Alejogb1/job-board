The intermittent failure of `aiohttp.ClientSession().get()` after numerous requests stems primarily from resource exhaustion within the underlying connection pool, not necessarily a defect in the `aiohttp` library itself.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across several large-scale asynchronous projects highlights the critical role of proper connection management and the potential for unhandled exceptions to silently deplete available resources.  A seemingly innocuous request failure can cascade into broader system instability if not addressed with diligent error handling and strategic resource allocation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`aiohttp` employs a connection pool to reuse TCP connections, optimizing performance by avoiding the overhead of establishing a new connection for each request.  This pool, however, has a finite size, typically configurable via the `connector` argument during `ClientSession` initialization.  When all connections in the pool are in use and awaiting responses, subsequent requests block, potentially leading to timeouts or exceptions such as `ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host`.  Moreover, improperly handled exceptions during requests can leave connections in a unusable state within the pool, effectively reducing its capacity even further, exacerbating the issue.  Failure to properly close the `ClientSession` after use also contributes to resource leakage and eventual failure.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage Leading to Resource Exhaustion:**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_data(session, "http://example.com") for _ in range(1000)] # Excessive requests
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print(f"Fetched {len(results)} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates a potential pitfall: launching an excessive number of concurrent requests without regard for connection pool limits.  The default pool size in `aiohttp` is relatively small.  Attempting to execute thousands of requests concurrently will quickly saturate the pool, resulting in the failure of subsequent requests. The absence of error handling further compounds the problem.  A more robust approach would involve implementing rate limiting or using `asyncio.Semaphore` to control concurrency.


**Example 2: Improved Resource Management with Semaphore:**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url, semaphore):
    async with semaphore:
        try:
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                if response.status == 200:
                    return await response.text()
                else:
                    print(f"Error fetching {url}: Status code {response.status}")
                    return None # Explicitly handle non-200 responses
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            print(f"ClientError fetching {url}: {e}")
            return None # Handle network errors

async def main():
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(100) # Limit concurrency to 100 requests
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_data(session, "http://example.com", semaphore) for _ in range(1000)]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print(f"Fetched {len([r for r in results if r])} pages successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, the `asyncio.Semaphore` limits the number of concurrent requests to 100, preventing the connection pool from being overwhelmed.  Furthermore, explicit error handling catches both HTTP errors (non-200 status codes) and `aiohttp.ClientError` exceptions, preventing them from silently consuming resources.  The code also filters out `None` results to accurately report successful fetches.


**Example 3:  Custom Connector for Fine-Grained Control:**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url):
    try:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()
    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
        print(f"ClientError fetching {url}: {e}")
        return None

async def main():
    connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=200, limit_per_host=50) # Custom connection limits
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(connector=connector) as session:
        tasks = [fetch_data(session, "http://example.com") for _ in range(500)]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print(f"Fetched {len([r for r in results if r])} pages successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates the use of a custom `aiohttp.TCPConnector` to exert finer control over connection pool parameters.  `limit` specifies the total number of connections, while `limit_per_host` sets a per-host limit, preventing excessive connections to a single server.  This is particularly crucial when dealing with many requests to a small number of endpoints. Error handling remains crucial even with this more sophisticated approach.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To gain a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, consult the official Python documentation on `asyncio`.  Examine the `aiohttp` library's documentation to fully comprehend its connection management capabilities, including the various options available within the `TCPConnector`.  Familiarize yourself with best practices for exception handling in asynchronous contexts and explore the use of tools like `asyncio.Semaphore` and `asyncio.Timeout` for enhanced resource management and request control.  Finally, learning about network programming concepts, including TCP connection management, will provide crucial context for debugging network-related issues.
