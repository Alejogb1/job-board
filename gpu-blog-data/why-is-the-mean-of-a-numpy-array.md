The most frequent cause of a NumPy array's mean returning NaN (Not a Number) is the presence of NaN values within the array itself.  This isn't a subtle issue;  NaN propagates through most arithmetic operations, including the mean calculation.  In my experience debugging numerical computations in large-scale scientific simulations, encountering NaN values was a recurring theme, often indicative of underlying errors in data acquisition or algorithmic flaws.  Identifying the source is crucial, and it frequently involves more than simply checking for NaN's directly.

**1.  Understanding NaN Propagation:**

NaN is a special floating-point value representing an undefined or unrepresentable number. Operations involving NaN typically result in NaN. For instance, `NaN + 5 = NaN`, `NaN * 0 = NaN`, `NaN / 10 = NaN`.  This characteristic makes detecting the source of NaN difficult.  A simple `np.isnan()` check on the final result isn't sufficient because it doesn't pinpoint the *origin* of the NaN within the data. It only confirms the symptom, not the disease.

Consider a scenario where you're calculating the average of several sensor readings.  A malfunctioning sensor might produce a NaN reading.  Even if only one value out of many is NaN, the mean of the entire array will become NaN.  Therefore, the strategy must involve a thorough examination of the array's contents *before* calculating the mean.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three different scenarios and their solutions.  These examples draw on my experience troubleshooting similar problems in geophysical data processing where outliers and missing data points are common occurrences.

**Example 1:  Direct NaN Detection and Removal:**

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([10.5, 12.2, np.nan, 15.1, 11.8])

# Simple check for NaNs
contains_nan = np.isnan(data).any()
print(f"Contains NaN: {contains_nan}")  # Output: Contains NaN: True

# Removing NaNs using masked arrays
masked_data = np.ma.masked_array(data, mask=np.isnan(data))
mean_masked = np.ma.mean(masked_data)
print(f"Mean (after masking NaNs): {mean_masked}")  # Output: Mean (after masking NaNs): 12.4

#Alternative using nanmean
mean_nan = np.nanmean(data)
print(f"Mean (using nanmean): {mean_nan}") # Output: Mean (using nanmean): 12.4
```

This example demonstrates the simplest approach. `np.isnan(data).any()` efficiently checks for the presence of at least one NaN.  `np.ma.masked_array` creates a masked array, effectively ignoring NaN values during the mean calculation.  `np.nanmean` is a direct and efficient method for computing the mean, ignoring NaN values.

**Example 2:  Identifying the Source of NaN using Debugging Techniques:**

```python
import numpy as np

data1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
data2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 0, 9])

# Potential division by zero causing NaN
result = data1 / data2
print(f"Result: {result}")  # Output: Result: [0.16666667 0.28571429 0.375      inf 0.55555556]

#Using a np.where statement to handle potential division by zero
result2 = np.where(data2 !=0, data1/data2,0)
print(f"Result after handling division by zero: {result2}") # Output: Result after handling division by zero: [0.16666667 0.28571429 0.375      0.         0.55555556]

# Calculating the mean after handling potential division by zero
mean_result2 = np.mean(result2)
print(f"Mean of the result after handling division by zero: {mean_result2}") # Output: Mean of the result after handling division by zero: 0.2755773719

```

In situations where the NaN originates from an operation like division by zero,  direct inspection of intermediate results becomes critical.  This example showcases how careful error handling—in this instance, a conditional statement to avoid division by zero—prevents NaN generation.  The use of `np.where` provides a powerful way to conditionally assign values, preventing errors before they propagate.

**Example 3:  Handling NaN in a More Complex Calculation:**

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, np.nan, 5])
b = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# A more complex operation potentially leading to NaNs
result3 = np.sqrt(a * b)
print(f"Result: {result3}") #Output: Result: [2.44948974 3.74165739 4.89897949        nan 7.07106781]

# Using nanmean for a complex calculation
mean_result3 = np.nanmean(result3)
print(f"Mean using nanmean: {mean_result3}") #Output: Mean using nanmean: 4.54029850

```

This example shows a more intricate calculation involving a square root.  Again, NaN propagation is demonstrated, and the solution involves `np.nanmean`.  This highlights that even with more complex operations, the underlying principle of detecting and handling (or avoiding) NaNs remains the same.   Advanced debugging techniques, such as stepping through the code using a debugger, can be highly effective for isolating the precise operation producing the NaN.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NumPy documentation is an invaluable resource, offering comprehensive details on array operations and functions for handling missing data.  Consult the documentation for thorough descriptions of functions like `np.isnan()`, `np.nanmean()`, `np.ma.masked_array()`, and error handling techniques in NumPy.  A solid grasp of Python's error handling mechanisms (e.g., `try-except` blocks) is also essential when dealing with potential numerical errors.   Consider studying numerical analysis texts to gain a deeper understanding of floating-point arithmetic and the nature of NaN values.  Finally, proficiency in debugging techniques for Python code is indispensable for effectively tracking down the origin of such issues.
