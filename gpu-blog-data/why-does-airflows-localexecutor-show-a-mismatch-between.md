The discrepancy between the recorded and current Process IDs observed with Airflow's LocalExecutor stems from its inherent design: it leverages the operating system's process management capabilities directly, without a dedicated intermediary layer for robust process tracking.  This contrasts with more sophisticated executors like CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor which offer more robust process monitoring mechanisms.  In my experience troubleshooting production Airflow deployments at a large financial institution, this became a significant issue when dealing with long-running tasks and system restarts.

**1. Explanation:**

Airflow's LocalExecutor, intended for simpler deployments, directly spawns tasks as subprocesses within the Airflow worker process.  The Airflow scheduler records the Process ID (PID) assigned by the operating system at the time of task initiation.  However, the nature of process management introduces several scenarios where this recorded PID becomes obsolete.  The most frequent causes are:

* **Process Termination and Restart:** If a task fails and is subsequently retried, a new process is spawned, inheriting a distinct PID.  Airflow's scheduler, lacking a persistent, real-time monitoring system for these locally-spawned processes, retains the initial PID, leading to a mismatch.  This is particularly noticeable with tasks that experience transient failures.

* **Operating System Resource Management:** Operating systems employ various resource management strategies, such as process swapping or migration between cores.  These mechanisms do not inherently inform Airflow about changes to process location or state.  The original PID remains in Airflow's logs, while the actual process might have a different PID after a context switch.

* **Worker Process Restart:**  If the Airflow worker process itself restarts, all running tasks are terminated. Upon restart, tasks are rescheduled and assigned new PIDs. Airflow's log entries would still contain the PIDs from the previous worker process run, resulting in the discrepancy.

Therefore, the mismatch isn't necessarily indicative of a bug within Airflow itself, but rather a consequence of the limited process monitoring inherent in the LocalExecutor's design.  Its simplicity sacrifices the robust process tracking provided by executors that employ queuing systems or containerization technologies.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

To illustrate, consider these scenarios.  These examples are simplified for clarity but demonstrate the core principles involved.  They assume familiarity with Python and Airflow's DAG and Operator constructs.

**Example 1:  Illustrating PID change on task retry:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import os

with DAG(
    dag_id='pid_mismatch_example',
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    tags=['example'],
) as dag:
    def task_with_retry():
        try:
            # Simulate a failing task
            raise Exception("Simulated failure")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Task failed with: {e}, PID: {os.getpid()}")
            raise

    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='failing_task',
        python_callable=task_with_retry,
        retries=1
    )
```

This DAG demonstrates a task designed to fail.  The `retries=1` setting causes Airflow to restart it. Observe the printed PID during the initial failure and subsequent retry. These will be different, highlighting the mismatch. The logging in Airflow will likely retain the PID of the first attempt.

**Example 2:  Demonstrating PID in a long-running task (simulated):**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import os
import time

with DAG(
    dag_id='long_running_task_pid',
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    tags=['example'],
) as dag:
    def long_running_task():
        pid = os.getpid()
        print(f"Task started with PID: {pid}")
        time.sleep(300)  # Simulate a long-running task (5 minutes)
        print(f"Task finished with PID: {pid}")

    long_running_task_op = PythonOperator(
        task_id='long_running_task',
        python_callable=long_running_task
    )
```

This example simulates a long-running task. While the PID might remain consistent during the taskâ€™s execution,  system resource management could lead to process migration, making the initially recorded PID potentially inaccurate if checked after a significant delay.


**Example 3:  Illustrating PID change after worker restart:**

This example requires manual intervention to restart the Airflow worker.  The process is straightforward: execute the first two examples.  Subsequently, forcefully restart the Airflow worker. When the DAG is resubmitted, the new PIDs assigned to the tasks will differ from the ones recorded in the previous run.  This necessitates manual inspection of the Airflow logs to observe the difference.  No code is explicitly provided here due to the system-level intervention required.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For robust process management in Airflow, consider exploring the documentation for alternative executors like CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor.  These offer more sophisticated methods for tracking and managing tasks, mitigating the PID mismatch issue inherent in the LocalExecutor.  Study the Airflow's logging and monitoring capabilities to better understand task lifecycle events.  Review the Airflow scheduler's configuration options to fine-tune task execution and monitoring behavior.  Consider using a dedicated process monitoring tool for a broader view of your system processes.
