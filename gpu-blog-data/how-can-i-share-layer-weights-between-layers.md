Weight sharing in custom Keras models, while seemingly straightforward, requires careful consideration of the underlying TensorFlow mechanisms to avoid unintended consequences and ensure correct gradient propagation.  My experience building highly parameterized, resource-constrained models for medical image analysis highlighted the importance of precise weight-sharing implementation, especially when dealing with large numbers of layers.  The key is to leverage TensorFlow's `tf.Variable` objects and carefully manage their assignment across layers.  Directly assigning weights between layers is generally discouraged due to the complexities of managing updates during backpropagation; instead, one should share the *same* variable instance across multiple layers.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core principle is to create a single `tf.Variable` and use it as the weight tensor for multiple layers.  This contrasts with the default Keras behavior, where each layer receives a unique set of weights.  When Keras automatically creates weight tensors, it utilizes an internal mechanism to track gradients and updates them individually during optimization.  Forcing weight sharing requires overriding this behavior.  We must explicitly manage the weights, ensuring they're appropriately initialized and updated in a coordinated manner.  Failure to do so will likely result in incorrect gradient calculations and model instability.

Consider the case of sharing weights between multiple convolutional layers.  Instead of allowing Keras to initialize separate weight tensors for each layer, we create a single weight tensor and assign it as the `kernel` attribute for each layer.  Similarly, we handle the bias weights (if applicable). The critical step is ensuring that the shape of this shared weight tensor is compatible with all layers intended to share it.  Inconsistencies in filter size, input channels, or output channels will lead to shape mismatches and runtime errors.

Furthermore, correctly managing the weight sharing is crucial for ensuring proper gradient updates during backpropagation. Since all layers share the same weights, their gradients must be aggregated appropriately. TensorFlow's automatic differentiation handles this transparently if the weight variable is shared correctly, allowing for efficient training.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Sharing Weights Between Two Conv2D Layers:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D

# Define the shared weight tensor
shared_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([3, 3, 3, 64]), name='shared_weights')  # 3x3 kernel, 3 input channels, 64 output channels

# Create the first Conv2D layer
conv1 = Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), use_bias=False, trainable=False)(keras.Input(shape=(28,28,3)))
conv1.kernel = shared_weights

# Create the second Conv2D layer
conv2 = Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), use_bias=False, trainable=False)(conv1)
conv2.kernel = shared_weights

# Combine layers into a model (optional, for visualization or further processing)
model = keras.Model(inputs=conv1.input, outputs=conv2.output)
model.summary()

```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates sharing weights between two convolutional layers.  The `trainable=False` argument prevents the underlying layers from creating their own weights. We explicitly set the `kernel` attribute of each layer to point to the same `shared_weights` variable. Note the consistent kernel shape across layers. The use_bias=False argument simplifies the example by omitting bias weights.


**Example 2: Sharing Weights Across Multiple Dense Layers with Bias:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define shared weights and bias
shared_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([128, 64]), name='shared_weights')
shared_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([64]), name='shared_bias')

# Input Layer
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(128,))

# Create the first Dense layer
dense1 = Dense(units=64, use_bias=False, trainable=False)(input_layer)
dense1.kernel = shared_weights

# Create the second Dense layer
dense2 = Dense(units=64, use_bias=False, trainable=False)(dense1)
dense2.kernel = shared_weights

# Add bias layer (separate from weight sharing)
bias_layer = keras.layers.Add()([dense2, shared_bias])

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=bias_layer)
model.summary()
```
*Commentary:* This extends Example 1 to include dense layers and a bias term. The bias is shared separately because its shape differs from the weights. This highlights the flexibility of the approach; different parts of the layer can be shared independently.  Again, `trainable=False` on the dense layers is crucial to avoid conflicts.


**Example 3:  More Complex Scenario â€“  Layer-Specific Weight Sharing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Shared weights for convolutional layers
shared_conv_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([3, 3, 3, 16]), name='shared_conv_weights')
shared_conv_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([16]), name='shared_conv_bias')

# Shared weights for Dense layers
shared_dense_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([16*7*7, 10]), name='shared_dense_weights') #Assuming 16 filters and 7x7 output
shared_dense_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]), name='shared_dense_bias')

# Input Layer
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3))

# Conv layers
conv1 = Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), use_bias=False, trainable=False)(inputs)
conv1.kernel = shared_conv_weights
conv2 = Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), use_bias=False, trainable=False)(conv1)
conv2.kernel = shared_conv_weights
maxpool = MaxPooling2D()(conv2)
flatten = Flatten()(maxpool)
bias_add = keras.layers.Add()([flatten, shared_conv_bias]) # Adding bias


# Dense layer
dense1 = Dense(units=10, use_bias=False, trainable=False)(bias_add)
dense1.kernel = shared_dense_weights

dense_bias_add = keras.layers.Add()([dense1, shared_dense_bias]) #Adding Bias

model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=dense_bias_add)
model.summary()

```
*Commentary:* This example showcases a more complex network architecture where weights are shared across both convolutional and dense layers but separate weight variables are used for convolutional and dense layers. Note the careful handling of bias terms and the consideration of the output shape for flattening in between.  This illustrates how to modularize weight sharing in larger and more sophisticated models.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on `tf.Variable` and custom Keras model building, are invaluable.  A thorough understanding of backpropagation and automatic differentiation within TensorFlow's framework is also essential.  Consider reviewing linear algebra fundamentals pertaining to matrix multiplication and tensor manipulation, as this directly relates to how weight sharing affects calculations.  Finally, a good grasp of Python object-oriented programming principles will aid in structuring and managing the shared weight variables effectively.
