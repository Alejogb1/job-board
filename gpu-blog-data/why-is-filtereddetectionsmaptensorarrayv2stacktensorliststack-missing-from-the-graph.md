The absence of the `filtered_detections/map/TensorArrayV2Stack/TensorListStack` node in your TensorFlow graph often stems from an optimization performed during graph construction or execution, specifically related to the handling of dynamically sized tensors within a `tf.while_loop` or similar control flow construct.  My experience debugging complex TensorFlow models has shown this to be a surprisingly common issue, particularly when dealing with object detection pipelines or similar tasks requiring variable-length sequences.  The core problem lies in how TensorFlow manages resource allocation and tensor shapes during graph optimization.

Let's clarify this with a precise explanation.  The `TensorArrayV2Stack` and `TensorListStack` nodes are intermediate structures used to manage the accumulation of tensors within loops where the number of iterations—and consequently, the final tensor size—isn't known a priori.  These structures allow for the dynamic growth of tensors throughout the loop. However, certain optimization passes in TensorFlow aim to improve performance by potentially removing these intermediate nodes if the final tensor size can be statically determined or if the intermediate tensors are not explicitly accessed later in the graph.  This optimization, while performance-enhancing in many cases, can lead to the disappearance of these nodes, making debugging challenging.  The optimization removes the intermediate steps to create a more efficient, but less verbose, graph representation.  If the graph's functionality relies on examining the intermediate results, as is sometimes the case during debugging or specialized post-processing, this removal can be problematic.


The crucial factor is whether the output of the `tf.while_loop` (or equivalent) actually *uses* the contents of the `TensorArrayV2`.  If the final result is simply a concatenated or reshaped tensor derived from the accumulated values within the `TensorArrayV2`, the intermediate stack nodes might be optimized away.  TensorFlow's optimization passes are quite sophisticated and can infer that the intermediate steps are unnecessary for the final computation.  This means the data is still correctly processed, but the intermediate representation is absent from the visualized graph.


To illustrate this, let's examine three code examples.  These examples demonstrate how the presence or absence of `TensorArrayV2Stack` and `TensorListStack` nodes are influenced by the use of the intermediate tensors within a TensorFlow graph.

**Example 1: Optimization Occurs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_tensor_creation(num_elements):
    ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
    i = tf.constant(0)
    c = lambda i, ta: i < num_elements

    def body(i, ta):
        value = tf.cast(i, dtype=tf.float32)
        ta = ta.write(i, value)
        return i + 1, ta

    _, final_ta = tf.while_loop(c, body, [i, ta])
    stacked_tensor = final_ta.stack()  #Intermediate tensors consumed here.
    return stacked_tensor

num_elements = tf.constant(5)
result = dynamic_tensor_creation(num_elements)

# TensorBoard visualization will likely show optimized graph
# without TensorArrayV2Stack and TensorListStack nodes
```

In this example, the `TensorArrayV2`'s contents are immediately consumed by the `stack()` operation.  This allows for significant optimization; TensorFlow recognizes that the intermediate representation is not needed and removes it from the final graph.


**Example 2: Intermediate Access Prevents Optimization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_tensor_creation_with_access(num_elements):
    ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
    i = tf.constant(0)
    c = lambda i, ta: i < num_elements

    def body(i, ta):
        value = tf.cast(i, dtype=tf.float32)
        ta = ta.write(i, value)
        return i + 1, ta

    _, final_ta = tf.while_loop(c, body, [i, ta])
    stacked_tensor = final_ta.stack()
    intermediate_access = final_ta.read(2) # Accessing an intermediate element
    return stacked_tensor, intermediate_access

num_elements = tf.constant(5)
result, intermediate = dynamic_tensor_creation_with_access(num_elements)

# TensorBoard visualization might show TensorArrayV2Stack nodes
# due to the explicit read operation.
```

Here, the explicit reading of an element from `final_ta` before stacking prevents the complete optimization.  The optimizer cannot remove the `TensorArrayV2`  because its contents are accessed directly.  This forces the retention of the intermediate nodes in the graph visualization.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.function` and its impact**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def dynamic_tensor_creation_with_tf_function(num_elements):
    ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
    i = tf.constant(0)
    c = lambda i, ta: i < num_elements

    def body(i, ta):
        value = tf.cast(i, dtype=tf.float32)
        ta = ta.write(i, value)
        return i + 1, ta

    _, final_ta = tf.while_loop(c, body, [i, ta])
    stacked_tensor = final_ta.stack()
    return stacked_tensor

num_elements = tf.constant(5)
result = dynamic_tensor_creation_with_tf_function(num_elements)

# tf.function's graph optimization might still remove the intermediate nodes
# depending on the complexity of the function and TensorFlow version.
```

The use of `@tf.function` introduces another layer of graph optimization.  Even if the code appears similar to Example 1, the additional optimization passes within `tf.function` might still lead to the removal of intermediate nodes.  The behavior here is more version-dependent and less predictable than the previous examples.


**Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on `tf.TensorArray`, `tf.while_loop`, and graph optimization.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution and optimization is crucial.  The TensorFlow debugging tools, including TensorBoard and debugging APIs, are invaluable for inspecting graph structure and identifying performance bottlenecks.  Furthermore, exploring the concepts of static vs. dynamic shapes in TensorFlow will clarify the underlying mechanics of this optimization.

In conclusion, the absence of `filtered_detections/map/TensorArrayV2Stack/TensorListStack` is usually a consequence of TensorFlow's graph optimization.  Understanding how your code utilizes the `TensorArrayV2` and whether its contents are directly accessed is critical in determining why these nodes are missing.  Inspecting the optimized graph using tools like TensorBoard and analyzing your code's control flow logic will ultimately provide a conclusive diagnosis.  Remember that even if the nodes are missing, the underlying computation might still be correct if the intermediate results are not explicitly used.
