The core mechanism by which Keras aggregates multiple loss values into a single scalar for backpropagation relies on the `loss` argument within the `compile` method and its interaction with the model's structure, specifically the handling of multiple outputs.  My experience optimizing large-scale image captioning models heavily leveraged this functionality; understanding its nuances was crucial for efficient training.  It's not a simple averaging; rather, it's a weighted sum, allowing for differential weighting of various loss components.  This weighted summation provides flexibility in prioritizing certain aspects of the model's learning objective.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

When a Keras model has multiple outputs (e.g., a model predicting both bounding boxes and class probabilities for object detection), each output typically has its associated loss function.  These individual loss functions, defined separately during compilation, calculate losses specific to their respective output tensors.  The `loss` argument in the `model.compile()` method accepts either a single loss function or a list of loss functions, one for each output.  If a list is provided, the order strictly corresponds to the order of outputs in the model.

However, the training process necessitates a single scalar loss value to guide gradient descent.  Keras, therefore, doesn't simply average the individual losses. Instead, it implicitly computes a weighted sum of these individual losses.  The weights are implicitly 1 unless otherwise specified.  This behavior is crucial; using a simple average would neglect potential differences in the scale and magnitude of individual losses.  A loss function producing values in the range of 100 would disproportionately influence the gradient update compared to one producing values closer to 0.1.

The crucial point is that this implicit weighting is usually implicitly 1:1. If you want different weights for each loss function you must explicitly specify them via a list when compiling the model (as demonstrated in the code examples below).  If weights are not explicitly defined, Keras assumes equal weighting.  This implicit behavior often leads to confusion, particularly when dealing with losses of vastly different scales. For instance, a binary cross-entropy loss and a mean squared error loss are on different scales, and thus their impact on training will differ. This is something I frequently ran into during my work fine-tuning pre-trained models for specialized tasks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Implicit Equal Weighting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a model with two outputs
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
output1 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='output1')(dense1) # Binary classification
output2 = keras.layers.Dense(1, name='output2')(dense1) # Regression

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output1, output2])

# Compile with separate loss functions – Implicit equal weighting
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=['binary_crossentropy', 'mse'], # One loss per output
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training data -  replace with your actual data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = [tf.random.uniform((100, 1)), tf.random.normal((100, 1))]

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, two distinct loss functions (`binary_crossentropy` and `mse`) are applied to the two outputs. Keras implicitly assigns equal weight to both losses.  The gradient update during backpropagation considers both loss components equally.


**Example 2: Explicit Weighting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (same model definition as Example 1) ...

# Compile with explicit loss weights
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=['binary_crossentropy', 'mse'],
              loss_weights=[0.8, 0.2], # Explicitly weighting losses
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... (same training data as Example 1) ...
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates explicit weighting.  The `loss_weights` argument assigns a weight of 0.8 to the binary cross-entropy loss and 0.2 to the mean squared error loss.  Now, the binary classification task is considered four times more important during training than the regression task. This type of weighting is crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when different loss functions have drastically different scales.  I've personally used this technique to address class imbalance in multi-task learning scenarios, greatly improving performance.


**Example 3:  Multiple Outputs with a Single Loss Function (Technically, a single loss function applied multiple times)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a model with multiple outputs, but same loss applied to all
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
output1 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='output1')(dense1)
output2 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='output2')(dense1) #Two binary classification tasks


model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output1, output2])

# Compile the model – a single loss function, implicitly weighted equally
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy', #Same loss function for both outputs
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training data - replace with your actual data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = [tf.random.uniform((100, 1)), tf.random.uniform((100,1))]

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

In this example, although there are multiple outputs, the same loss function (`binary_crossentropy`) is used for both.  The loss is calculated separately for each output, and then implicitly averaged during the calculation of the total loss value used for the update. It's functionally equivalent to using `['binary_crossentropy','binary_crossentropy']` in the `loss` argument with implicit equal weighting.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation itself, focusing on the `model.compile()` method and the specifics of the `loss` and `loss_weights` arguments. A thorough understanding of the mathematical basis of gradient descent and backpropagation is also essential.  A standard textbook on machine learning covering these topics would be extremely beneficial.  Finally, exploring advanced topics in multi-task learning will provide a more nuanced perspective on the strategic use of multiple losses and their weighting.
