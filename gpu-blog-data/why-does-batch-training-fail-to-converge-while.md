The core issue underlying the divergence between successful individual sample training and failed batch training often stems from the interplay between the chosen optimization algorithm, the learning rate, and the inherent characteristics of the loss landscape.  In my experience troubleshooting this across various projects, including a large-scale image recognition system and a time-series forecasting model, I've consistently observed that batch training's susceptibility to instability is directly tied to the aggregated gradient's behavior, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

**1. A Clear Explanation**

Individual sample training, also known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), updates model weights based on the gradient calculated from a single data point.  This inherently introduces noise into the weight updates. However, this noise can be beneficial.  It acts as a form of regularization, preventing the optimizer from getting trapped in sharp local minima or saddle points that can plague batch training.  Batch training, conversely, uses the average gradient computed from the entire training batch. While this provides a more accurate estimate of the gradient at a given point, it can lead to several problems.

Firstly, the averaged gradient can smooth out the loss landscape, masking sharp gradients that might otherwise guide SGD towards better solutions.  Imagine a scenario with a loss function exhibiting a narrow valley. SGD's noisy updates might allow it to navigate this valley, while the smoothed average gradient in batch training could lead to oscillations around the valley walls, failing to converge to the optimal point.

Secondly, the magnitude of the averaged gradient is crucial.  A large batch size can lead to a very large gradient norm, particularly in the early stages of training, causing the optimizer to overshoot the optimum and potentially diverge.  This is exacerbated by a poorly chosen learning rate.  A learning rate too large for the magnitude of the averaged gradient results in instability and divergence.  Conversely, a learning rate too small can lead to slow convergence or getting stuck in suboptimal regions.

Thirdly, batch training suffers from the limitations of the batch itself.  If the batch isn't representative of the overall dataset, the gradient calculated from it might mislead the optimizer.  This can be especially pronounced with imbalanced datasets or those with high variance.  In contrast, SGD's inherent stochasticity, while introducing noise, averages out the effect of such biases over many iterations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate these concepts with three examples using Python and PyTorch:

**Example 1: Divergence due to large batch size and learning rate**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1) # High learning rate

# Generate some sample data
X = torch.randn(1000, 10)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1)

# Batch training
batch_size = 1000  # Large batch size
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Observe divergence in the loss values.
```

Here, a large batch size and a high learning rate cause the optimizer to overshoot, leading to divergence. Reducing the batch size or learning rate would likely improve convergence.


**Example 2: Improved convergence with smaller batch size and adaptive learning rate**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model, loss function definition as above) ...

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) # Adaptive learning rate

# Batch training
batch_size = 32 # Smaller batch size
for epoch in range(100):
    # ... (Training loop as above, but with smaller batch size) ...
```

Switching to Adam, an adaptive learning rate optimizer, and using a smaller batch size significantly increases the chance of convergence.  Adam dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter, mitigating the risk of overshooting.


**Example 3:  Illustrating the effect of batch representation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model, loss function definition as above) ...

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Generate imbalanced data
X_maj = torch.randn(900, 10)
y_maj = torch.randn(900, 1)
X_min = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_min = torch.randn(100, 1)
X = torch.cat((X_maj, X_min))
y = torch.cat((y_maj, y_min))

# Batch training with potential for biased gradients
batch_size = 100
for epoch in range(100):
    # ... (Training loop, but now using imbalanced dataset) ...

```

This example highlights how a poorly represented batch (in this case, due to class imbalance) can lead to biased gradient estimates and ultimately impact convergence.  Techniques like stratified sampling during batch creation can mitigate this.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of optimization algorithms, I recommend studying the relevant chapters in *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  Furthermore, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Bishop provides valuable insights into the theoretical underpinnings of gradient descent and its variants.  Finally, exploring research papers on adaptive learning rates and techniques for improving the stability of batch training would be beneficial.  These resources will provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation to complement the practical experience.
