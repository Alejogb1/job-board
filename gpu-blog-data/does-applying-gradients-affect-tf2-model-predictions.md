TensorFlow 2 model predictions are indeed affected by applied gradients, but not in the way one might naively expect. The gradients themselves are instrumental during model *training*, specifically to update the model's learnable parameters (weights and biases) via optimization algorithms. However, simply computing and applying gradients to a *trained* model, outside of the training loop, will *not* directly alter the output of a forward pass if the applied gradients are derived from the model's own predictions. Instead, the prediction itself is affected by the weights and biases, and only the training process updates these. Applying gradients calculated from a trained model's output to the weights and biases in an uncontrolled way can destabilize or corrupt the model.

Let's clarify what gradients represent and how they are used during training. When performing a forward pass in a neural network, the model transforms input data through successive layers using its current weights and biases to produce a prediction. This prediction is then compared to the desired output (the ground truth) using a loss function. The loss function quantifies the difference between the prediction and ground truth. Gradients are the partial derivatives of this loss function with respect to the model's trainable parameters. These partial derivatives indicate the direction and magnitude in which each parameter needs to be adjusted to reduce the loss. This gradient information is then used by optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD) to update the model's parameters, moving them towards a state that minimizes the prediction error. After several training iterations (epochs), a well-trained model will generalize to previously unseen data.

Now, focusing specifically on the query about applying gradients outside the training loop. If you were to calculate the gradients of the prediction itself, with respect to the model parameters, and then try to update those parameters with these new gradients in an uncontrolled way, the consequences would be detrimental. The weights and biases, being carefully tuned during training to achieve a specific function, are now being directly manipulated based on the prediction of *one particular* input, not a batch of inputs and their associated ground truths used in model training. This leads to overfitting the current prediction, causing the model to lose its ability to generalize. Essentially, it will move its weights and biases in the direction that makes the current prediction "fit" the output data perfectly, even if the prediction was initially wrong. The consequence is degradation of generalization performance.

Consider, for example, if you apply the gradients derived from a single example, where a classification model incorrectly predicts the wrong class. Then, you try to update its weights using those error gradients. The model might then "learn" to classify *only that specific example* correctly, but at the expense of accuracy on every other input.

Let’s examine this through a few code snippets. In these examples, I'll demonstrate the incorrect application of gradients outside of the training loop and its effects on a model's predictions.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Application**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Create some random data and labels
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

# Get the initial prediction
initial_prediction = model(input_data)

# Calculate gradients of the prediction w.r.t. model variables
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    prediction = model(input_data)
grad = tape.gradient(prediction, model.trainable_variables)

# Apply the gradients (incorrectly)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)  # Using a simple optimizer for demonstration
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grad, model.trainable_variables))

# Get the new prediction
new_prediction = model(input_data)

print("Initial prediction:", initial_prediction.numpy())
print("New prediction:", new_prediction.numpy())
```

This code creates a simple sequential model, generates a random input, calculates the prediction, and then calculates the gradient of that *prediction* with respect to the model's parameters. It then applies those gradients using a simple Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. As you'll observe by running this, the new prediction will often move significantly towards 0 or 1, but doesn't make the model more accurate in any general sense. This is a single iteration, applying a gradient derived from the prediction itself, a form of adversarial attack against the model, not a process that improves model generalization.

**Code Example 2: Pre-trained Model Modification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16)
base_model = tf.keras.applications.VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(32, 32, 3))
# Add a pooling and classification layer.
global_average_layer = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()
prediction_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation = 'softmax')
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([base_model, global_average_layer, prediction_layer])

# Create some random data
input_image = tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 3))

# Get initial prediction
initial_prediction = model(input_image)

# Calculate gradients based on prediction, similar to example 1
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    prediction = model(input_image)
grad = tape.gradient(prediction, model.trainable_variables)


# Apply gradients, similarly incorrectly
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate = 0.001)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grad, model.trainable_variables))

# Get new prediction
new_prediction = model(input_image)


print("Initial prediction: ", np.argmax(initial_prediction, axis=1))
print("New Prediction: ", np.argmax(new_prediction, axis=1))

```

In this example, a pre-trained VGG16 model is loaded (without its classification head) and modified with a global average pooling and classification head. After predicting with some random noise, we again calculate the gradients from the prediction itself and attempt to apply them to the model parameters. The pre-trained model is particularly vulnerable to this type of manipulation and one can expect a sharp change in its output. This is because the weights of a pre-trained model are optimized in a specific domain, and any manipulation that deviates away from that domain with arbitrary gradients has no generalizable quality. It quickly and significantly degrades generalization performance of the model.

**Code Example 3: Controlled Gradient Updates During Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Create a simple optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Generate some dummy training data
inputs = tf.random.normal((100, 5))
labels = tf.random.uniform((100, 1), minval = 0, maxval=2, dtype = tf.int32)
labels = tf.cast(labels, dtype = tf.float32)

# Define the loss function
loss_function = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()


# Perform training loop
for i in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      prediction = model(inputs)
      loss = loss_function(labels, prediction)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

# Test the trained model
test_input = tf.random.normal((1, 5))
test_prediction = model(test_input)
print("Trained Model Prediction:", test_prediction.numpy())
```

This final code snippet illustrates the correct application of gradients. This code demonstrates a typical training loop, where gradients are computed with respect to a *loss function* which measures the difference between model's *predictions* and target *labels*. The calculated gradients are then used to update the model weights using the optimizer. This controlled process updates the model in a manner that *generalizes* to unseen data, as opposed to a random gradient update outside the training loop which is destructive to the model.

In summary, while gradients are fundamental to model training, applying gradients to an already trained model, especially those computed using the model’s own prediction, can corrupt the model by creating an overfitting bias to the current input. It is the controlled application of gradients during the training process, where we use gradients derived from a loss function that relates prediction to ground truth, that tunes model parameters for generalization.

For further reading on the concepts detailed in this answer, consider exploring resources such as the official TensorFlow documentation, and books on Deep Learning and Neural Networks which explain both forward and backward propagation, loss functions, and optimizers in detail. These will allow for deeper understanding of both the mathematics and implementation of neural network training. These will include sections covering loss function, backward propagation, and gradient-based optimizers. It's advisable to explore several resources to build a complete understanding.
