Feature scaling significantly improves LSTM performance in time series classification due to the gradient descent optimization process inherent to training these models. The raw data, often characterized by variables with disparate scales and ranges, can impede the learning process by creating uneven contribution of different features during weight updates, leading to slower convergence and potentially suboptimal model parameters.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a class of recurrent neural networks particularly suited for sequence data. They learn dependencies over time, making them effective for time series data, whether it’s forecasting or classification. However, the internal mechanisms of LSTMs, and by extension the training process, are sensitive to the magnitude and range of input features. Consider the case where one input feature is on the scale of 0 to 1, while another feature is on the scale of 1000 to 10000. During backpropagation, the gradients for the feature with a larger scale will, by virtue of its numerical magnitude, have a much larger influence on the weight updates, effectively dominating the learning. This issue, often referred to as "feature dominance," can prevent the model from effectively learning from all the available features, leading to diminished classification performance.

Feature scaling alleviates this issue by transforming the input features to a comparable range, typically between 0 and 1 or with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This transformation ensures that each feature contributes more equally to the loss calculation and subsequent weight updates, allowing the gradient descent algorithm to converge more efficiently to an optimal or near optimal solution. Without scaling, features with larger ranges can lead to the optimization algorithm exhibiting oscillations during convergence, and requiring considerably more epochs to reach a reasonable solution. Further, large magnitude feature values can lead to numerical instability issues during training, especially with the repeated matrix operations involved in LSTM computations. Scaling also can help with regularization, since features with large values are more likely to lead to overfitting. In effect, it pre-conditions the data, facilitating the learning process.

There are two prevalent methods of feature scaling: Min-Max scaling and Standardization. Min-Max scaling scales values between a set minimum and maximum value, typically 0 and 1. Standardization scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. I have found that in time series data where the distribution of values is not normal or contains outliers, Min-Max scaling tends to perform more robustly in my experience. This is because it preserves relative distances within the original data by not centering the values, something that can be advantageous if there are specific peak or trough relationships that need to be maintained within the time series during the training process. However, this comes at the expense of being sensitive to outliers, as an extreme value can squish most other data points into a very small sub-range, a situation that should be addressed during the exploratory data analysis phase. Standardization works better in cases where values are relatively gaussian distributed because it centers the data around 0 and gives the features a similar spread. This can be preferable for some models and often requires some experimentation with both approaches.

I will now provide three examples showcasing the effect of applying feature scaling to time series classification.

**Example 1: Min-Max Scaling**

This example shows how to scale a time series using Min-Max scaling, using Python’s scikit-learn library. I had previously used this scaling method when working on predicting machine fault detections based on vibration sensor data, a dataset where the range of vibrational magnitudes differed considerably across sensor locations.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'time_series_data' is a pandas DataFrame
time_series_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'feature2': [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000]
})

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(time_series_data)
scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns = time_series_data.columns)


print(scaled_df) # Prints scaled data with values between 0 and 1.
```

In this code, I am instantiating a `MinMaxScaler` object. The `fit_transform` method computes the minimum and maximum for each column, then transforms the data using the scaler. The resulting scaled dataframe now has all feature values between 0 and 1, thus eliminating the initial disparity in ranges. This scaled dataframe is now suitable as input for the LSTM model.

**Example 2: Standardization**

This example demonstrates standardization using scikit-learn. I utilized this method on weather data for predicting severe storms, a dataset where features like temperature and humidity exhibited more gaussian distributions, making standardization a better initial approach than Min-Max scaling.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd

time_series_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'feature2': [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000]
})

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(time_series_data)
scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns = time_series_data.columns)

print(scaled_df) # Prints scaled data with mean around 0 and std of 1.
```

Here, a `StandardScaler` is instantiated and applied to our dataframe. The `fit_transform` calculates the mean and standard deviation for each column and transforms the data such that each has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Again, this produces a scaled dataframe that mitigates the effects of feature dominance, improving the efficiency of the training process of the LSTM network.

**Example 3: Scaling During LSTM Training**

This example demonstrates the integration of scaling within a simplified LSTM training loop using the Keras deep learning library. I used similar code during my work with sensor data analysis, where incorporating scaling prior to the training of the LSTM model improved detection performance across the board.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Simplified time series data (input and target)
time_series_data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 2) # 100 samples, 10 time steps, 2 features
time_series_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

#Scaling before training
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(time_series_data.reshape(-1, time_series_data.shape[2]))
scaled_data = scaled_data.reshape(time_series_data.shape)

# Defining a simple LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(time_series_data.shape[1], time_series_data.shape[2])),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with scaled data
model.fit(scaled_data, time_series_labels, epochs=20, verbose=0) # Verbose is turned off for brevity.

_, accuracy = model.evaluate(scaled_data, time_series_labels, verbose=0)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

In this example, I first reshape the input `time_series_data` in preparation for the `MinMaxScaler` which requires a 2D array for scaling. After applying the `MinMaxScaler`, I reshape it back to the original dimensions so it can be inputted into the LSTM.  A simplified LSTM model is defined and compiled. The model is then trained using the scaled data. This illustrates how data pre-processing with feature scaling can seamlessly integrate into the LSTM model training procedure.

In terms of resources for further learning, I recommend consulting textbooks and online documentation focused on practical machine learning and deep learning. Specifically, search for materials that cover topics like 'data pre-processing,' 'feature scaling,' and 'optimization algorithms' as applied to LSTMs and neural networks in general. Books that delve into the mathematical aspects of gradient descent can provide more profound understanding of why feature scaling has such a big impact on performance. Also, thoroughly understanding scikit-learn’s `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler` functionalities is key to correct implementation. These resources will supplement a practical and theoretical knowledge base regarding the significance of feature scaling when training LSTM networks for time series data.
