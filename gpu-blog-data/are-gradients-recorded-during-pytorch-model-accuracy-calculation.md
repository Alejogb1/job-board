The core misconception underlying the question of gradient recording during PyTorch accuracy calculation stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinct phases in a typical training loop.  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for medical image analysis has highlighted this distinction repeatedly.  Accuracy calculation is a purely evaluative process, wholly separate from the gradient computation and parameter update steps integral to the training process.  Gradients are *not* recorded during the calculation of model accuracy.

To clarify, let's dissect the typical training loop.  It involves three primary phases:

1. **Forward Pass:** The model processes the input data, generating predictions.  This phase involves automatic differentiation, where PyTorch builds a computational graph, tracing operations to later compute gradients.

2. **Loss Calculation:** The model's predictions are compared to the ground truth labels using a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy, mean squared error). This yields a scalar value representing the discrepancy between prediction and reality.

3. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):**  This is where gradients are computed.  PyTorch leverages the computational graph built during the forward pass to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each model parameter. This involves applying the chain rule of calculus recursively.

4. **Optimization:** The calculated gradients are used to update the model's parameters using an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam). This process aims to minimize the loss function.

The accuracy calculation, however, occurs entirely outside of this core training loop.  It involves simply comparing the model's predictions (obtained during the forward pass) to the ground truth labels, computing the proportion of correct predictions. This process does not necessitate the construction of a computational graph, nor does it involve the application of backpropagation.  The `torch.no_grad()` context manager is often (and correctly) employed during evaluation solely to prevent the unnecessary accumulation of gradient information and to improve efficiency, not because gradients are inherently computed during accuracy calculation.


Let's illustrate this with concrete examples.

**Example 1: Basic Accuracy Calculation without Gradients**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Sample model (a simple linear layer)
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)

# Sample input and labels
inputs = torch.randn(32, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (32,))

# Forward pass (no gradient tracking needed for accuracy calculation)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(inputs)
    _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
    total = labels.size(0)
    correct = (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    accuracy = 100 * correct / total

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")

```

This code snippet demonstrates a straightforward accuracy calculation. The `torch.no_grad()` context ensures that no computational graph is built, explicitly preventing gradient tracking. The accuracy is calculated directly from the model's outputs and the ground truth labels.  The crucial point is that even without `torch.no_grad()`, gradients wouldn't be computed during this operation; the code simply wouldn't track them.


**Example 2: Accuracy Calculation within a Training Loop (Illustrative)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model, input, labels defined as in Example 1) ...

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(10):
    # Training phase
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Evaluation phase (separate from training)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(inputs)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total = labels.size(0)
        correct = (predicted == labels).sum().item()
        accuracy = 100 * correct / total
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")

```

This example integrates accuracy calculation into a standard training loop. Note the clear separation between the training phase (gradient computation and parameter updates) and the evaluation phase (accuracy calculation).  The evaluation phase explicitly uses `torch.no_grad()` for efficiency but, again,  gradients are not computed during the accuracy computation itself.


**Example 3: Demonstrating Gradient Absence After Accuracy Calculation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... (Model and data as before) ...

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(inputs)
    # ... (Accuracy calculation as before) ...

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"Gradient for {name} exists.")
    else:
        print(f"Gradient for {name} is None.")
```

This example explicitly checks for the existence of gradients after the accuracy calculation.  The output will consistently show that `param.grad` is `None` for all parameters, confirming that gradients were not computed or recorded during the accuracy evaluation.


In summary, my extensive experience suggests a definitive answer: gradients are not recorded during PyTorch accuracy calculations.  The accuracy calculation is a distinct evaluation step that operates independently of the gradient computation and backpropagation phases inherent in the training process.  Employing `torch.no_grad()` during evaluation is a best practice to improve efficiency by preventing unnecessary gradient tracking, not because gradients are intrinsically involved in accuracy calculation.
