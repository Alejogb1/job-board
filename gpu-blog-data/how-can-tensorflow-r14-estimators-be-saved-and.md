TensorFlow r1.4 estimators, while possessing a streamlined API for model definition and training, require a specific approach to save and load compared to session-based models. The core challenge stems from the estimator's reliance on `tf.train.Estimator` rather than direct session management. Simply serializing the computational graph isn’t enough; one must preserve the estimator’s metadata, including its model_fn, parameters, and training state. Over my years working with TensorFlow, particularly in migration projects from older versions, I’ve found neglecting this crucial distinction can lead to significant headaches.

The primary mechanism for saving and loading TensorFlow r1.4 estimators revolves around the `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec` and its interaction with `tf.train.CheckpointSaverHook` and `tf.train.latest_checkpoint`. The estimator's internal logic automatically manages checkpointing using the parameters defined during its initialization. Thus, the key is to leverage these parameters during saving and reloading.

To save an estimator model, ensure that the `model_fn` within the estimator correctly returns an `EstimatorSpec`. This specification object should define a `train_op`, `loss` and potentially evaluation metrics, along with a saver hook which is automatically added when the estimator is provided a `model_dir` during its instantiation. The `model_dir` parameter defines the location on disk where checkpoint files are written. If `model_dir` isn’t provided, checkpointing and therefore saving is not enabled.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # Example: simple linear model
    W = tf.get_variable("weights", [features.shape[1], 1], dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.get_variable("bias", [1], dtype=tf.float32)
    predictions = tf.matmul(features, W) + b

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, predictions=predictions)

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - labels))
    
    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        train_op = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)
    
    eval_metric_ops = {
        'rmse': tf.metrics.root_mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=predictions)
    }
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)

# Dummy input feature shape for the example
input_shape = (10,)

# Define an input function
def input_fn(mode):
    features = tf.random_normal(shape=(100, input_shape[0]), dtype=tf.float32)
    labels = tf.random_normal(shape=(100, 1), dtype=tf.float32)
    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels)).batch(32).repeat()
    else:
        return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels)).batch(32)

params = {}  # Add any model parameters here
model_dir = 'model_checkpoints'

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, params=params, model_dir=model_dir)

estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN), steps=100) # Training the model
```

In the preceding example, a custom model function, `my_model_fn`, is defined, returning the appropriate `EstimatorSpec` based on the mode. The crucial part of this example is specifying a `model_dir` during `Estimator` instantiation, which triggers checkpoint saving. When training is called via `estimator.train()`, the model parameters are saved incrementally inside `model_dir`.

To load a saved estimator, one does *not* need to load a specific checkpoint file, but rather the estimator can be instantiated using the same parameters as before, including the `model_dir`. During initialization the estimator will automatically locate and restore the latest checkpoint. This assumes the same `model_fn` is available. Crucially, the `model_dir` and original parameters must match the training setup.

```python
# Loading the model (assuming the same my_model_fn and input_fn as above)
loaded_estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, params=params, model_dir=model_dir)

# Perform Evaluation
evaluation_results = loaded_estimator.evaluate(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL))
print("Evaluation Results:", evaluation_results)

# Perform Prediction
predictions = loaded_estimator.predict(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT))
# Iterate through the prediction result set
for prediction in predictions:
  print("Prediction:", prediction)
```

Here, we demonstrate loading the model and utilizing it for both evaluation and prediction tasks. Notice we use the same `model_dir` to locate the checkpoints. We instantiate a new estimator instance, `loaded_estimator`, which will automatically recover the latest checkpoint and restore all the trainable variables within the model. No manual checkpoint loading is necessary.

It is important to note that the saving mechanism is not dependent on the `input_fn`. The `input_fn` provides the data to the model, but the checkpoint files will only store model parameters and global training state. When the estimator is initialized, any input function provided will define the way the model should consume data.

Finally, I'd like to share a crucial tip I learned the hard way during one particularly difficult migration project. When dealing with custom input data, the input function can sometimes be the source of issues. If, after loading, you notice an unexpected performance drop, ensure your `input_fn` is generating data as expected. A thorough data sanity check immediately after loading is a recommended best practice.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing the TensorFlow documentation sections on "Estimators," "Checkpoints," and "Input Functions". Additionally, the TensorFlow official example projects, particularly the ones focusing on image classification and text processing, can be invaluable as they often implement checkpointing practices. Exploring user discussions surrounding specific `tf.estimator.Estimator` errors on forums can also be fruitful. The official TensorFlow guides, though geared towards later versions, often contain information that is translatable to version 1.4. Finally, reviewing the source code of the estimator API itself can illuminate the underlying saving and loading logic if you have a deeper need to understand.
