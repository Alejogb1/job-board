TensorFlow's graph execution model, particularly in versions prior to 2.x's eager execution, necessitates a nuanced understanding of tensor lifecycle and graph dependencies.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale machine learning models has highlighted a critical fact: TensorFlow tensors are inherently tied to the specific computational graph in which they are defined.  Direct reuse across distinct graphs is not possible.  This stems from the fundamental design of TensorFlow's graph construction and execution.

**1. Explanation of Graph Dependency and Tensor Lifecycle**

TensorFlow, in its core design, represents computations as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  Nodes in this graph are operations (like matrix multiplication or addition), and edges represent the flow of tensorsâ€”multi-dimensional arrays that hold data.  A tensor's existence is intrinsically linked to its originating graph.  When a graph is built, TensorFlow allocates memory and resources for the tensors defined within it.  These resources are managed internally by the TensorFlow runtime and are not globally accessible.  Attempting to access a tensor from a graph outside its originating scope results in an error, primarily because the runtime has no awareness or reference to that tensor in the context of a different graph.  The same tensor name in two different graphs will represent distinct entities with separate memory allocations.

The key difference lies in the concept of graph context.  Each `tf.Graph()` object creates a distinct computational environment.  While the naming convention might suggest otherwise, tensors defined within one graph are completely isolated from those defined in another.  The graph is the operational namespace for tensors.  This is crucial for managing memory and preventing unintended side effects, especially in parallel or distributed training scenarios.  Even if two graphs use identical operations and structures, the tensors generated within each will be distinct instances.  This separation is deliberate to ensure modularity and avoid conflicts.

Furthermore, the TensorFlow runtime manages the allocation and deallocation of tensor memory.  After a graph execution completes, tensors generated within that graph are typically released.  Attempting to reference these post-execution within a different graph will result in errors, as the underlying memory may have been reclaimed by the system. The persistent memory allocation across graphs required for reuse isn't a part of TensorFlow's design.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the limitations of tensor reuse across graphs in TensorFlow.

**Example 1:  Attempting to access a tensor from a different graph**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Graph 1
graph1 = tf.Graph()
with graph1.as_default():
    tensor_a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

# Graph 2
graph2 = tf.Graph()
with graph2.as_default():
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        try:
            # This will fail. tensor_a is not accessible here.
            result = sess.run(tensor_a) 
            print(result) 
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}") # Expected error indicating tensor_a is not in graph2's scope
```

This example explicitly creates two separate graphs (`graph1` and `graph2`).  The attempt to access `tensor_a`, defined within `graph1`, from within `graph2` results in an error. The error message typically indicates that the tensor is not found within the current graph's context.


**Example 2:  Creating identical tensors in separate graphs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Graph 1
graph1 = tf.Graph()
with graph1.as_default():
    with tf.Session() as sess1:
        tensor_b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])
        result1 = sess1.run(tensor_b)
        print(f"Graph 1 result: {result1}")

# Graph 2
graph2 = tf.Graph()
with graph2.as_default():
    with tf.Session() as sess2:
        tensor_c = tf.constant([4, 5, 6]) # Identical value, but a different tensor
        result2 = sess2.run(tensor_c)
        print(f"Graph 2 result: {result2}")

#Even though the values are identical, tensor_b and tensor_c are distinct tensors residing in different graphs.

```

While `tensor_b` and `tensor_c` have the same numerical values, they are distinct TensorFlow tensors, each uniquely allocated within its respective graph.  They occupy different memory locations and are managed independently by the TensorFlow runtime.


**Example 3:  Illustrating the need for data transfer between graphs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Graph 1:  Tensor creation
graph1 = tf.Graph()
with graph1.as_default():
    tensor_d = tf.constant([7, 8, 9])
    with tf.Session() as sess1:
        tensor_d_val = sess1.run(tensor_d)

# Graph 2: Using data from Graph 1
graph2 = tf.Graph()
with graph2.as_default():
    tensor_e = tf.constant(tensor_d_val) # Pass the value, not the tensor itself
    with tf.Session() as sess2:
        result3 = sess2.run(tensor_e)
        print(f"Graph 2 result using data from Graph 1: {result3}")

```

This example shows the correct method for transferring data between graphs. The value of `tensor_d` from `graph1` is explicitly copied and used to create `tensor_e` within `graph2`.  It does not directly reuse the original tensor but rather creates a new one with the same data. This is the standard approach to achieve the effect of reusing data.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections covering graph construction, execution, and session management.  Consult advanced materials on distributed TensorFlow for a more comprehensive perspective on graph management in parallel and distributed settings.  Focus on understanding the concept of `tf.Session()` and its role in managing graph execution and resource allocation.  Exploring TensorFlow's internal memory management would also prove highly beneficial in grasping the context of tensor lifecycle within the graph.
