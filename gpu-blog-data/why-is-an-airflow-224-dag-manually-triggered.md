The persistent queuing of a manually triggered task within an Airflow 2.2.4 DAG often stems from resource contention within the scheduler or executor.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous production environments, involving diverse DAG complexities and scaling strategies, points to this as the primary culprit.  Let's examine the contributing factors and illustrative solutions.

**1.  Explanation:**

Airflow's scheduler is responsible for assigning tasks to available workers.  In a typical setup utilizing the SequentialExecutor (common in smaller deployments or for testing), only one task runs at a time. Consequently, if the scheduler is overwhelmed – for example, by a high volume of tasks across multiple DAGs or resource constraints on the Airflow worker machine – a manually triggered task might remain queued indefinitely while awaiting its turn.  The situation worsens with the CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor, where while parallel execution is possible, resource limitations on the worker nodes (CPU, memory, network) or insufficient worker pods can lead to similar queueing issues.  Furthermore, configuration problems like an improperly configured worker pool size or insufficient resources allocated to the Airflow environment itself can exacerbate this.  Finally, potential problems within the task itself, such as infinite loops or unhandled exceptions that block the worker, must also be considered.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Resource-Intensive Task Causing Bottleneck:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import time

with DAG(
    dag_id='resource_intensive_dag',
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,  # Manually triggered
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='intensive_task',
        python_callable=lambda: time.sleep(3600) # Simulates a 1-hour task
    )

```
*Commentary:* This DAG contains a single task simulating a resource-intensive operation (a one-hour sleep). If multiple such DAGs are triggered concurrently, or if the worker machine has limited resources, this task might remain queued for an extended duration.  The solution involves optimizing the task itself or increasing worker resources (CPU, memory).


**Example 2: Task Failure Leading to Worker Blockage (CeleryExecutor):**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

with DAG(
    dag_id='failing_task_dag',
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,  # Manually triggered
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='failing_task',
        python_callable=lambda: 1/0 # Intentional ZeroDivisionError
    )
```

*Commentary:* This DAG demonstrates a task that inherently fails due to a `ZeroDivisionError`.  With the CeleryExecutor, this exception, if not properly handled, can lead to the worker process becoming unresponsive, preventing other tasks from running. The solution is to implement robust exception handling within the `python_callable` function, ensuring graceful termination and error logging.  Proper error handling and monitoring mechanisms are crucial for diagnosing this type of issue.


**Example 3: Incorrectly Configured Worker Pool (CeleryExecutor):**

```python
# airflow.cfg configuration snippet (relevant section)

[celery]
celeryd_concurrency=1 # Incorrectly configured concurrency

```
*Commentary:* This configuration snippet illustrates an incorrectly set `celeryd_concurrency`.  A value of '1' limits the Celery worker to handling only one task at a time, essentially mimicking the SequentialExecutor and negating the benefits of parallel processing.  This can cause tasks to queue even with sufficient resources available, especially with high task volumes.  The solution is to adjust `celeryd_concurrency` to a value appropriate for the hardware resources and the expected task workload.  This value must be carefully considered; setting it too high can lead to resource exhaustion.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth troubleshooting of Airflow scheduling and execution issues, consult the official Airflow documentation.  Explore advanced topics like logging configuration, worker monitoring, and executor-specific settings.  Understanding the limitations and capabilities of different executors is vital.  Familiarize yourself with Airflow's metrics and monitoring capabilities to better identify bottlenecks.  Finally, investigate debugging techniques for Python code to help identify and resolve issues within individual tasks.
