TensorFlow 1.15 presents a unique challenge for Windows installations due to its reliance on a specific CUDA and cuDNN version compatibility matrix,  a constraint absent in later TensorFlow versions that leverage more generalized CUDA support.  My experience troubleshooting this on various enterprise projects highlighted the critical need for meticulous attention to these dependencies.  Failure to precisely match versions often results in cryptic error messages,  significantly impeding the installation process.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Installation Process:**

Successful installation of TensorFlow 1.15 on Windows hinges on three core components: Python, CUDA, and cuDNN.  The process is not a straightforward pip install, and requires careful selection of compatible versions.  First, ensure you have a compatible Python version installed; 3.6 or 3.7 are generally recommended. I've personally found that utilizing a dedicated Python environment via Anaconda or Miniconda offers superior isolation and version management, reducing conflicts with other projects.  

Next, determining the correct CUDA toolkit version is crucial.  TensorFlow 1.15 has stringent compatibility requirements;  referencing the official TensorFlow 1.15 documentation (or its archived versions readily available via web archives) is essential to identify the supported CUDA version.  Once this is identified, download and install the CUDA Toolkit from the NVIDIA website, ensuring you select the correct installer for your Windows architecture (x86 or x64).  The installation itself is fairly standard, requiring only user interaction during typical software installation processes.  Pay close attention to the installation directory; this will be needed later.

Following CUDA, the cuDNN library is installed.  Similar to CUDA, precise version matching is paramount.  Again, the TensorFlow 1.15 documentation will outline the appropriate cuDNN version for your selected CUDA toolkit version. Download the cuDNN library from the NVIDIA website.  The installation process involves extracting the downloaded archive's contents into the CUDA Toolkit's installation directory; usually, this involves placing the `bin`, `include`, and `lib` folders into the corresponding CUDA folders.

Finally, TensorFlow 1.15 itself can be installed.  Avoid using pip directly; instead, download the appropriate wheel file from the TensorFlow website (again, archived versions may be needed).  Using pip to install from a wheel file offers better control over dependency management than relying solely on pip's package resolution.  The command would take the form:  `pip install <path_to_wheel_file>`  where `<path_to_wheel_file>` is the location of the downloaded wheel file.  Once installed, verify the installation by executing `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"` in your command prompt or terminal.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA and cuDNN Installation:**

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Check if CUDA is available
print("CUDA is available:", tf.test.is_built_with_cuda())

#Check CUDA Version (requires CUDA toolkit)
try:
    cuda_version_str = os.environ["CUDA_VERSION"]
    print(f"CUDA version: {cuda_version_str}")

except KeyError:
    print("CUDA environment variable not set.")

# Check if cuDNN is available (indirect method, relies on CUDA availability)
if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda():
    print("Checking cuDNN support...requires successful CUDA setup.")
    try:
        # Simulate cuDNN-dependent operation (requires CUDA and cuDNN)
        x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
        y = tf.math.add(x, x)
        print(f"cuDNN seems operational. Result: {y}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"cuDNN related error encountered: {e}")

else:
    print("cuDNN check skipped; CUDA not detected.")

```

This script provides a basic verification of the CUDA and cuDNN installation.  Note the reliance on CUDA being successfully installed before probing for cuDNN.  Direct cuDNN version verification is often less straightforward; the most reliable method is testing TensorFlow's ability to leverage GPU computation (if CUDA and cuDNN are properly configured, this will occur automatically).

**Example 2: Simple TensorFlow 1.15 Operation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple TensorFlow graph
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], shape=[5, 1])
b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], shape=[1, 5])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)

# Initialize the session
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()

# Run the session and print the result
result = sess.run(c)
print(result)
sess.close()
```

This example showcases a basic matrix multiplication within a TensorFlow 1.15 session.  Its primary purpose is to confirm TensorFlow is functioning correctly, leveraging CUDA and cuDNN if available for enhanced computational speed.  If the GPU is utilized, the execution will be considerably faster than a CPU-only implementation.

**Example 3: Handling potential errors during installation:**

```python
try:
    # Code for installing TensorFlow 1.15 using a wheel file (pip install)
    import subprocess
    subprocess.check_call(['pip','install','<path_to_your_tensorflow_1.15_wheel_file>']) #Replace with actual path
    print("TensorFlow 1.15 installation successful!")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: TensorFlow wheel file not found.  Check the path.")

except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error during TensorFlow installation: {e}")

except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error importing TensorFlow: {e}. Check your installation.")

except Exception as e: # catch all other exceptions.
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This code snippet demonstrates proper error handling during the installation process.  Instead of relying on a simple `pip install`, it utilizes the `subprocess` module to execute the command.  This allows for more granular control and the handling of various potential errors (e.g. a missing wheel file, issues within the pip process itself, failure to import after the installation).

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (archived versions for 1.15 are crucial), the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, and the NVIDIA cuDNN documentation are essential resources.  Furthermore,  reviewing the release notes for both TensorFlow 1.15 and the relevant CUDA/cuDNN versions will help anticipate potential compatibility issues and identify any known bugs or workarounds.  Consulting community forums and Stack Overflow posts related to TensorFlow 1.15 Windows installations can prove invaluable for troubleshooting specific errors.  Finally, having a solid understanding of Python, particularly its package management via pip and virtual environments (like those provided by Anaconda), is beneficial.
