Efficiently creating a mask of the top *k* elements within a TensorFlow tensor requires careful consideration of computational graph optimizations and avoiding expensive operations.  My experience developing custom loss functions and attention mechanisms in deep learning models has highlighted the importance of such efficiency. A naive approach involving sorting the entire tensor before extracting the top *k* would be particularly inefficient, especially with large tensors. Instead, `tf.math.top_k` combined with suitable type casting and potentially sparse tensor usage provides a much more optimized solution.

The primary challenge lies in creating a boolean mask that is 1 where an element is among the top *k* values and 0 otherwise, without introducing redundant computations. Direct application of `tf.math.top_k` yields indices and values but not a mask directly. The recommended strategy involves utilizing these indices to construct a sparse tensor representation of the top *k* locations, and converting that back into a dense mask via an efficient `tf.sparse.to_dense` operation.

The core idea relies on leveraging sparse tensors. Sparse tensors are highly efficient representations when dealing with data containing a substantial proportion of zero or default values.  `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` stores only the non-zero values and their corresponding indices; this contrasts with dense tensors which store all values including zeroes. Since the top-k mask is typically highly sparse within a large tensor, a sparse representation minimizes memory usage and computations during mask creation.

Here's a breakdown of the process, illustrated with examples:

**Example 1: 1-Dimensional Tensor**

Let's consider a 1-dimensional tensor where I want to generate a mask for the top 3 values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_top_k_mask_1d(tensor, k):
  """
  Creates a boolean mask of the top k elements in a 1D tensor.

  Args:
    tensor: A 1D TensorFlow tensor.
    k: The number of top elements to mask.

  Returns:
    A boolean TensorFlow tensor representing the top k mask.
  """
  values, indices = tf.math.top_k(tensor, k) # Extract top k values and indices.
  sparse_mask = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(
      indices=tf.expand_dims(indices, axis=1), # Convert indices to sparse tensor format.
      values=tf.ones(k, dtype=tf.bool), # Non-zero values are all true.
      dense_shape=tf.shape(tensor) # Shape of the original tensor.
  )
  dense_mask = tf.sparse.to_dense(sparse_mask) # Convert back to a dense mask.
  return dense_mask

# Example usage
tensor_1d = tf.constant([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6])
k_1d = 3
mask_1d = create_top_k_mask_1d(tensor_1d, k_1d)
print(f"Original tensor: {tensor_1d.numpy()}")
print(f"Top {k_1d} mask: {mask_1d.numpy()}")
```

The `create_top_k_mask_1d` function encapsulates the complete operation. First, `tf.math.top_k` is used to find the indices of the top *k* elements. Subsequently, a `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` is constructed. The indices returned by `tf.math.top_k` are expanded to have an additional dimension to conform to the sparse tensor’s expected index shape. The values of the sparse tensor are set to `True`, and its dense shape is set to match the input tensor’s shape. Finally, `tf.sparse.to_dense` converts the sparse representation to a dense boolean tensor representing the mask, which is then returned.

**Example 2: 2-Dimensional Tensor, Top-k per Row**

In scenarios involving matrices or tensors of higher dimension, the top *k* operation is often desired on a per-row basis (or along another designated axis).

```python
def create_top_k_mask_2d_row_wise(tensor, k):
  """
  Creates a boolean mask of the top k elements per row in a 2D tensor.

  Args:
    tensor: A 2D TensorFlow tensor.
    k: The number of top elements to mask per row.

  Returns:
    A boolean TensorFlow tensor representing the top k mask.
  """
  values, indices = tf.math.top_k(tensor, k) # Find top k indices per row
  batch_size = tf.shape(tensor)[0]
  row_indices = tf.range(batch_size) # Create batch indices for sparse representation
  row_indices = tf.expand_dims(row_indices, axis=1)
  row_indices = tf.tile(row_indices, [1, k])
  row_indices = tf.reshape(row_indices, [-1]) #Reshape row indices to flattened shape
  indices = tf.stack([row_indices, tf.reshape(indices, [-1])], axis = 1) # Stack to format indices
  sparse_mask = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(
    indices = indices,
    values = tf.ones(batch_size * k, dtype=tf.bool),
    dense_shape = tf.shape(tensor)
  )
  dense_mask = tf.sparse.to_dense(sparse_mask)
  return dense_mask


# Example usage
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[3, 1, 4, 1],
                        [5, 9, 2, 6],
                        [8, 7, 0, 5]])
k_2d = 2
mask_2d = create_top_k_mask_2d_row_wise(tensor_2d, k_2d)
print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor_2d.numpy()}")
print(f"Top {k_2d} mask:\n{mask_2d.numpy()}")
```

This function extends the previous approach to handle 2D tensors. It calculates the top *k* elements along the last axis (rows). To form a correct index set for the sparse tensor, I generate a sequence of row indices repeated *k* times. These are reshaped and stacked with the column indices returned by `tf.math.top_k` to create index pairs representing the positions of the top *k* elements within the 2D tensor. The subsequent creation of `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` and its conversion to a dense mask remain consistent.

**Example 3: Handling Non-Constant *k***

Occasionally, the value of *k* is determined at runtime, potentially changing for each input tensor. This does not drastically alter the approach but requires flexibility in tensor manipulation.

```python
def create_top_k_mask_dynamic(tensor, k_tensor):
    """
    Creates a boolean mask of the top k elements where k is a tensor.

    Args:
        tensor: A TensorFlow tensor of any rank.
        k_tensor: A TensorFlow tensor with dynamic k value. Must be scalar.

    Returns:
        A boolean TensorFlow tensor representing the top k mask.
    """
    k_int = tf.cast(k_tensor, tf.int32) # Cast to integer type
    values, indices = tf.math.top_k(tensor, k_int) # Use dynamic k
    flat_indices = tf.reshape(indices, [-1]) # Flatten indices

    flat_indices_2d = tf.transpose(tf.stack([tf.range(tf.size(flat_indices))//k_int , flat_indices]), perm=[1,0])
    sparse_mask = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(
        indices=flat_indices_2d,
        values=tf.ones(tf.size(flat_indices), dtype=tf.bool),
        dense_shape=tf.shape(tensor)
    )
    dense_mask = tf.sparse.to_dense(sparse_mask)
    return dense_mask

#Example usage
tensor_dyn = tf.constant([7, 2, 9, 1, 8, 5, 3, 6])
k_dyn_1 = tf.constant(3)
k_dyn_2 = tf.constant(5)
mask_dyn_1 = create_top_k_mask_dynamic(tensor_dyn, k_dyn_1)
mask_dyn_2 = create_top_k_mask_dynamic(tensor_dyn, k_dyn_2)
print(f"Original tensor: {tensor_dyn.numpy()}")
print(f"Top {k_dyn_1.numpy()} mask: {mask_dyn_1.numpy()}")
print(f"Top {k_dyn_2.numpy()} mask: {mask_dyn_2.numpy()}")
```

In the `create_top_k_mask_dynamic` function, the `k` parameter is now a TensorFlow tensor. Before usage, this tensor is explicitly cast to an integer data type. The rest of the steps involved in generating the mask remains consistent; using `tf.math.top_k` with the potentially dynamic k value and converting to a mask through sparse tensor usage.

For further study, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation relating to the following areas: `tf.math.top_k`, `tf.sparse.SparseTensor`, `tf.sparse.to_dense`, and relevant sections on optimizing tensor operations. Examining specific use cases within the TensorFlow Model Garden repository can provide additional insights and examples. Furthermore, studying the source code for high-performance implementations of similar operations in other deep learning frameworks can offer valuable perspectives. Understanding the underlying computational graphs and avoiding eager execution bottlenecks will also contribute to writing more efficient TensorFlow code in general.
