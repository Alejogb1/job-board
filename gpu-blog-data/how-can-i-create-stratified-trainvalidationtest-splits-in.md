The core challenge in creating stratified train/validation/test splits within PyTorch lies not in PyTorch itself, but in the preprocessing of the data.  PyTorch excels at model definition and training, but it doesn't inherently provide stratified splitting functionality.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects has repeatedly highlighted the crucial need for robust stratified sampling, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.  Failing to stratify leads to biased models that perform poorly on under-represented classes in the validation and test sets. Therefore, the solution requires leveraging external libraries capable of handling stratified sampling before feeding data into PyTorch's `DataLoader`.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Stratified sampling ensures that the class proportions in each split (train, validation, test) accurately reflect the class distribution in the overall dataset. This is particularly important when dealing with class imbalances, where some classes have significantly more samples than others.  Without stratification, a simple random split might lead to a validation or test set lacking sufficient examples of a minority class, rendering model evaluation and performance comparison unreliable.

The process generally involves these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Label Extraction:**  Load your dataset.  This could be images with associated labels, text data with categories, or any other type of data with corresponding class labels.  Extract these labels and store them alongside the data.

2. **Stratified Splitting:** Utilize a library like scikit-learn to perform a stratified split.  Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function, with the `stratify` parameter set to the label array, provides the functionality needed.  This function creates stratified splits for the training and testing sets.  Further splitting of the training set into training and validation sets should also be stratified using the same function.

3. **PyTorch DataLoader Creation:**  Once the data is split, create PyTorch `DataLoader` instances for each set (train, validation, test). These `DataLoader`s handle batching and data shuffling efficiently during training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Image Classification with scikit-learn and PyTorch**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Assume 'images' is a NumPy array of images and 'labels' is a NumPy array of corresponding labels.
# Replace this with your actual data loading mechanism.
images = np.random.rand(1000, 3, 32, 32)  # 1000 images, 3 channels, 32x32 size
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)  # 10 classes

# Stratified split using scikit-learn
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(images, labels, test_size=0.2, stratify=labels, random_state=42)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.25, stratify=y_train, random_state=42) # 0.25 x 0.8 = 0.2

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_train = torch.tensor(X_train).float()
y_train = torch.tensor(y_train).long()
X_val = torch.tensor(X_val).float()
y_val = torch.tensor(y_val).long()
X_test = torch.tensor(X_test).float()
y_test = torch.tensor(y_test).long()

# Create PyTorch Datasets
class ImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, images, labels):
        self.images = images
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.images)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.images[idx], self.labels[idx]

train_dataset = ImageDataset(X_train, y_train)
val_dataset = ImageDataset(X_val, y_val)
test_dataset = ImageDataset(X_test, y_test)

# Create DataLoaders
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

# ... proceed with model training and evaluation using train_loader, val_loader, and test_loader ...
```

This example demonstrates a basic stratified split using scikit-learn and then creating PyTorch `DataLoader`s for efficient training and validation.  The `random_state` ensures reproducibility.


**Example 2: Handling Imbalanced Datasets with Custom Sampling**

For significantly imbalanced datasets, consider custom samplers:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader, WeightedRandomSampler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

# ... (Data loading as in Example 1) ...

# Count class occurrences
class_counts = Counter(y_train)
class_weights = {cls: 1.0 / count for cls, count in class_counts.items()}
weights = [class_weights[label] for label in y_train]
sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(weights, len(y_train))

# Create DataLoader with custom sampler
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, sampler=sampler)

# ... (Rest of the code remains similar to Example 1) ...
```

This example uses a `WeightedRandomSampler` to address class imbalance by assigning weights inversely proportional to class frequencies. This ensures that minority classes are adequately represented during training.


**Example 3:  Stratified Splitting for Text Classification**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Assume 'texts' is a list of text strings and 'labels' is a list of corresponding labels.
texts = ["text1", "text2", ...]
labels = [0, 1, 0, ...]

# Stratified split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2, stratify=labels, random_state=42)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.25, stratify=y_train, random_state=42)

# Create custom dataset for text data (requires text preprocessing, tokenization, etc.)
class TextDataset(Dataset):
    # ... (Implementation for text data processing and label access) ...

# Create DataLoaders as in Example 1

# ... (Model training and evaluation) ...

```
This example adapts the process for text classification.  Remember that you will need to incorporate appropriate text preprocessing and tokenization techniques before feeding the data into the `TextDataset` class.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of stratified sampling, consult statistical textbooks on sampling techniques.  Scikit-learn's documentation provides comprehensive information on its model selection tools, including `train_test_split`.  The PyTorch documentation thoroughly covers the creation and usage of `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes.  Finally, resources on data preprocessing and handling imbalanced datasets will be invaluable for building robust machine learning models.
