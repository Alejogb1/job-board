The core challenge in obtaining accurate predictions from a Keras LSTM regression model, trained on time-series data segmented into windows or batches, lies in properly handling the statefulness and sequence dependence inherent in LSTMs. The model learns temporal relationships within each window, and for accurate out-of-sample predictions, we must maintain the correct internal state across the input sequences during the prediction phase. If this isn't managed, the model will treat each input sequence as a fresh start, disregarding learned dependencies from prior windows.

My experience stems from developing predictive maintenance systems for industrial equipment. We consistently encountered this issue when moving from training on historical batches of sensor data to deploying the model on live streams. Initially, our naive prediction process, applying the trained model to each new input window independently, yielded highly erratic results, particularly when predictions relied on longer-term patterns. Correctly handling the LSTM’s hidden state proved critical to generating stable, meaningful predictions.

The essential strategy involves iteratively feeding new input windows into the model, saving and subsequently passing the LSTM's internal states from the previous window's prediction step into the next. This ensures continuity in the model's memory and enables it to leverage learned temporal relationships across the entire sequence being evaluated, even when that sequence is presented as a series of non-overlapping windows.

Let’s delve into a practical approach, assuming a Keras LSTM model built with the assumption of batch training, i.e., it expects input of a particular shape and is capable of maintaining state between these batches when configured to do so. We also assume that we have preprocessed our input data, and the batches or sequences of inputs are correctly formatted to align with the model’s input layer shape.

Here's how one might implement this using Keras:

**Code Example 1: Basic Stateful LSTM Prediction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def predict_sequence_stateful(model, input_sequence, window_size, batch_size):
    """
    Performs sequence prediction with a stateful LSTM, maintaining state across windows.

    Args:
        model: The trained Keras LSTM model (must be stateful).
        input_sequence: The complete input sequence to predict on.
        window_size: The size of the input window used during training.
        batch_size: The batch size used during training.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array containing the model's predictions for the entire input sequence.
    """

    num_windows = len(input_sequence) // window_size
    predictions = []

    # Reset the state before starting the sequence
    model.reset_states()

    for i in range(num_windows):
      start_index = i * window_size
      end_index = (i + 1) * window_size
      input_window = input_sequence[start_index:end_index]

      # Reshape the input to (batch_size, window_size, features) expected by the model.
      input_window_reshaped = np.reshape(input_window, (batch_size, window_size, -1))
      
      # Make prediction
      prediction = model.predict(input_window_reshaped, verbose=0) # Avoid verbose output
      
      # Append the prediction, assuming a single output node.
      predictions.append(prediction[0][0])

    # Handle any remaining data, less than window_size, by padding if necessary, or discarding it.
    remaining_data_len = len(input_sequence) % window_size
    if remaining_data_len > 0:
        remaining_data = input_sequence[num_windows * window_size:]
        
        # We either pad the remainder, or we discard this.
        # Here, we discard it for brevity, but in some cases padding would be desired.
        print("Warning: Remaining data discarded:", remaining_data_len)
    
    return np.array(predictions)
```

*Commentary:* This function assumes that the input sequence’s length is an exact multiple of the window size used during training, except for any remaining data, which it then discards. It iterates through the input sequence, taking a window at a time, reshaping it to a batch (even if it's just a batch of size one), and performs the prediction. Crucially, `model.reset_states()` is called initially and because the model is stateful, the state is maintained across each windowed prediction. The verbose argument is set to zero to avoid superfluous output. Note that the shape of the input needs to be explicitly reshaped to fit what the model expects. This might need adjusting depending on how many features you have. For example, if each time point has three feature dimensions, the reshape could be `np.reshape(input_window, (batch_size, window_size, 3))`.

However, our initial implementation makes the assumption that input sequences will be exactly divisible by `window_size`, a limitation. In practice, input sequences may be of arbitrary length. We need to account for this. Also, we are assuming the batch size of the prediction will be equal to the training batch size, which might be incorrect as well.

**Code Example 2: Stateful LSTM Prediction with Handling of Varying Length Sequences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def predict_sequence_stateful_flexible(model, input_sequence, window_size, batch_size):
    """
    Handles sequences of varying length by padding the last window if necessary.

    Args:
        model: The trained Keras LSTM model (must be stateful).
        input_sequence: The complete input sequence to predict on.
        window_size: The size of the input window used during training.
        batch_size: The batch size used during training.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array containing the model's predictions for the entire input sequence.
    """

    predictions = []
    model.reset_states()
    sequence_length = len(input_sequence)
    
    for start_index in range(0, sequence_length, window_size):
        end_index = min(start_index + window_size, sequence_length)
        input_window = input_sequence[start_index:end_index]

        # Pad the remaining data if necessary. This ensures that the input window is always the correct shape.
        if len(input_window) < window_size:
            padding_size = window_size - len(input_window)
            padding = np.zeros((padding_size, input_sequence.shape[1] if len(input_sequence.shape) > 1 else 1))  # Handles 1 or 2 dim sequences
            input_window = np.concatenate((input_window, padding), axis=0)

        input_window_reshaped = np.reshape(input_window, (1, window_size, -1)) # Assume a batch size of 1 during prediction
        prediction = model.predict(input_window_reshaped, verbose=0)

        if len(input_window) > (window_size - padding_size): # Only keep original values if unpadded
            for i in range(min(end_index - start_index, window_size) ):
                 predictions.append(prediction[0][i][0] if len(prediction.shape) > 2 else prediction[0][0])

    return np.array(predictions)
```

*Commentary:* This version uses a flexible approach, capable of dealing with arbitrary sequence lengths. It addresses cases where the input sequence length is not a multiple of `window_size`. Specifically, when an input window is shorter than `window_size`, it pads the window with zeros and ensures it is fed into the model with correct dimensions. It also avoids generating predictions on padding when padding is required. This approach is preferred as it does not discard any useful information. Importantly, we assume a batch size of 1 for each prediction, and use that to reshape our input. We also make a more robust assumption about the dimensionality of the input sequence to allow for different number of features per time point.

The previous implementations assume that the input is a single continuous sequence. However, often the training and prediction inputs may be composed of many independent sequences. In that case, we need to handle the state and predictions for each of these sequences independently.

**Code Example 3: Stateful LSTM Prediction for Multiple Independent Sequences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


def predict_multiple_sequences_stateful(model, input_sequences, window_size, batch_size):
    """
    Performs sequence prediction with a stateful LSTM on multiple independent sequences.

    Args:
        model: The trained Keras LSTM model (must be stateful).
        input_sequences: A list of input sequences to predict on.
        window_size: The size of the input window used during training.
        batch_size: The batch size used during training.

    Returns:
        A list of NumPy arrays containing the model's predictions for each sequence.
    """

    all_predictions = []

    for input_sequence in input_sequences:
        predictions = []
        model.reset_states()  # Reset state before processing each new sequence
        sequence_length = len(input_sequence)
        
        for start_index in range(0, sequence_length, window_size):
            end_index = min(start_index + window_size, sequence_length)
            input_window = input_sequence[start_index:end_index]

            if len(input_window) < window_size:
                padding_size = window_size - len(input_window)
                padding = np.zeros((padding_size, input_sequence.shape[1] if len(input_sequence.shape) > 1 else 1))
                input_window = np.concatenate((input_window, padding), axis=0)

            input_window_reshaped = np.reshape(input_window, (1, window_size, -1))
            prediction = model.predict(input_window_reshaped, verbose=0)

            if len(input_window) > (window_size - padding_size): # Only keep original values if unpadded
                for i in range(min(end_index - start_index, window_size) ):
                  predictions.append(prediction[0][i][0] if len(prediction.shape) > 2 else prediction[0][0])
        all_predictions.append(np.array(predictions))

    return all_predictions
```

*Commentary:* This final implementation provides a function that can take a *list* of input sequences and applies the same stateful approach, but crucially, resets the model's internal states *before processing each sequence*. This allows us to accurately make predictions over sets of independent sequences. This is highly common and important in real-world applications.

In summary, successful prediction with stateful LSTMs trained on batch data requires careful management of the model's internal state across input windows. Resetting the state at the start of each new sequence is critical for independent sequences; and proper padding and reshaping of inputs is necessary to handle arbitrary sequence lengths during the prediction phase.

For further study, I recommend focusing on resources covering time series analysis, particularly with recurrent neural networks. Look at discussions about stateful versus stateless LSTMs, and understand how batching impacts the training and prediction process. Also, consider researching advanced techniques such as masking, which can provide alternatives to zero padding. Understanding these fundamental concepts and implementing them will enable you to extract accurate predictions from your trained LSTM models effectively.
