The crux of handling gradient calculations for non-neural network elements within the PyTorch framework lies in leveraging PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities beyond its inherent neural network structures.  My experience optimizing physics simulations within a large-scale climate modeling project highlighted this precisely:  we needed to incorporate computationally intensive, non-differentiable atmospheric models into a larger PyTorch-based optimization loop.  Successfully achieving this required a nuanced understanding of PyTorch's `torch.autograd` functionality and the strategic use of custom autograd functions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `autograd` system automatically computes gradients for operations performed on tensors with the `requires_grad=True` flag.  However, this automatic differentiation only works for operations defined within PyTorch's computational graph.  For external or non-differentiable elements, you must explicitly define how gradients should propagate through them.  This is achieved through the creation of custom autograd functions, which define the forward and backward passes for your non-PyTorch components.  The forward pass computes the output of your function, while the backward pass calculates the gradients with respect to the inputs.

The key is understanding that PyTorch's automatic differentiation is a chain rule application.  If a function `f(x)` is non-differentiable according to PyTorch, we need to supply the gradient `df/dx` manually in the backward pass.  This often involves employing numerical methods (such as finite differences) or analytical derivatives derived from the underlying mathematical formulation of your non-neural network element.

Moreover, correctly handling the gradient calculation requires careful consideration of the input and output tensor shapes and gradients to ensure the chain rule is correctly applied throughout the entire computation graph.  Inaccurate gradients lead to incorrect parameter updates and potentially unstable optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Numerical Differentiation for a Non-Differentiable Function**

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we have a non-differentiable function, `my_external_func`, representing a complex physical process.  We approximate its derivative using a central difference method.

```python
import torch

def my_external_func(x):
    #  Represents some external, potentially non-differentiable function.
    #  Example: A function call to a compiled C++ library
    return torch.exp(x) * torch.sin(x*2)  # this part IS differentiable, but let's pretend it is not.

class MyExternalFunc(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        return my_external_func(x)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        # Approximate gradient using central difference
        h = 1e-6  # Step size
        grad_x = (my_external_func(x + h) - my_external_func(x - h)) / (2 * h)
        return grad_x * grad_output

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = MyExternalFunc.apply(x)
y.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

This code defines a custom autograd function `MyExternalFunc`. The `forward` method simply calls our external function. The `backward` method approximates the gradient using central differences.  This approach avoids symbolic differentiation but introduces numerical approximation errors.


**Example 2:  Incorporating an Analytical Derivative**

If we have an analytical expression for the derivative of `my_external_func`, we can achieve greater accuracy.  Let's assume, hypothetically, that the derivative of `my_external_func` is known to be `g(x) = exp(x) * (sin(2x) + 2cos(2x))`.

```python
import torch

def my_external_func(x):
    return torch.exp(x) * torch.sin(x * 2)

def my_external_func_derivative(x):
    return torch.exp(x) * (torch.sin(2 * x) + 2 * torch.cos(2 * x))

class MyExternalFunc(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        return my_external_func(x)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_x = my_external_func_derivative(x)
        return grad_x * grad_output

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = MyExternalFunc.apply(x)
y.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

This example leverages the exact analytical derivative, resulting in significantly improved gradient accuracy compared to numerical approximation.


**Example 3:  Handling a Jacobian Matrix for Multi-Dimensional Outputs**

Consider a scenario where `my_external_func` produces a multi-dimensional output.  This necessitates computing the Jacobian matrix in the backward pass.

```python
import torch

def my_external_func(x):
    return torch.stack([torch.sin(x), torch.cos(x)], dim=-1) # Example multi-dimensional output

class MyExternalFunc(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        return my_external_func(x)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        # Calculate Jacobian matrix
        jacobian = torch.stack([torch.cos(x), -torch.sin(x)], dim=-1)
        grad_x = torch.bmm(grad_output.unsqueeze(1), jacobian).squeeze(1)  # matrix multiplication for vector-Jacobian product
        return grad_x


x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = MyExternalFunc.apply(x)
y.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

Here, the `backward` method computes the Jacobian matrix and performs the necessary matrix multiplication to obtain the gradient with respect to the input `x`.  This demonstrates handling a more complex scenario where the output and its derivative are multi-dimensional.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on `torch.autograd` is invaluable.  Understanding the concepts of computational graphs, tensor operations, and the chain rule is fundamental.   Furthermore, a solid grasp of linear algebra, particularly matrix calculus, is crucial for handling multi-dimensional gradients and Jacobians.  Finally, exploration of numerical methods for approximating derivatives, such as finite difference schemes, proves beneficial for situations where analytical derivatives are unavailable.
