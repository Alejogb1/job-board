TensorFlow's interaction with R under Ubuntu 18.04 can be problematic, stemming primarily from memory management inconsistencies between the R interpreter and the TensorFlow C++ backend.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects involving large-scale data analysis and deep learning model training, the root cause often lies in improper resource allocation and the handling of TensorFlow's session initialization and termination.  Failing to manage these aspects meticulously leads to R session crashes manifested as segmentation faults or outright kernel panics.

**1.  Understanding the Memory Conflict:**

The core issue arises from TensorFlow's heavy reliance on dynamic memory allocation.  While TensorFlow's memory management is sophisticated, it doesn't always seamlessly integrate with R's garbage collection mechanism.  If TensorFlow allocates significant memory without proper cleanup—for instance, during the lifecycle of a TensorFlow session—R's memory space can become fragmented or exhausted. This leads to instability, ultimately culminating in a crash.  Furthermore, the interaction between R's package loading mechanism and TensorFlow's initialization can exacerbate these problems.  If a TensorFlow session remains open across multiple R operations, memory leaks progressively increase the likelihood of a system crash.  This is especially true in cases with limited system RAM.

**2.  Strategies for Preventing Crashes:**

To mitigate these problems, several crucial steps are necessary.  First, explicit session management is paramount.  Always ensure you create and close TensorFlow sessions correctly within well-defined scopes.  Second, careful control of the TensorFlow graph's size and the amount of data fed to it is essential.  Large graphs and datasets can rapidly consume system memory, overwhelming R and the underlying operating system.  Finally, monitoring system resource usage, particularly RAM and swap, provides valuable insights into the health of the R session and can offer early warning signs of potential problems.

**3. Code Examples illustrating Best Practices:**

The following examples demonstrate effective techniques for controlling TensorFlow sessions within R, emphasizing proper initialization and closure.  They utilize the `tensorflow` package in R.  Assume that necessary TensorFlow operations have been established and the required packages loaded.

**Example 1: Basic Session Management:**

```R
library(tensorflow)

# Initialize the TensorFlow session
sess <- tf$Session()

# Perform TensorFlow operations within the session
# ... Your TensorFlow code here ...  (e.g., model training, prediction)

# Explicitly close the session
sess$close()

# Subsequent operations in R will not be affected by previous sessions
# ... More R code here ...
```

This example showcases the core principle of explicitly creating and closing the session.  This is a fundamental safeguard against memory leaks.  The `sess$close()` call is crucial; omitting it will almost certainly lead to resource contention and eventual crashes with prolonged or repeated execution.


**Example 2:  Handling Larger Datasets:**

```R
library(tensorflow)

# Define a function to process data in batches
process_batch <- function(data_batch) {
  sess <- tf$Session()
  # ... TensorFlow operations on data_batch ...
  sess$close()
}

# Load the complete dataset
full_dataset <- load_large_dataset()

# Process the dataset in batches
batch_size <- 1000  # Adjust based on available RAM
for (i in seq(1, length(full_dataset), batch_size)) {
  batch <- full_dataset[i:(min(i + batch_size -1, length(full_dataset)))]
  process_batch(batch)
}
```

This example demonstrates handling large datasets. By processing data in smaller batches, we limit the amount of memory held by TensorFlow at any given time. Each batch's processing occurs within its own session, providing isolation and preventing accumulation of memory across iterations.  The `batch_size` parameter needs to be tuned based on the system's RAM and dataset characteristics.


**Example 3:  Error Handling and Resource Monitoring:**

```R
library(tensorflow)
library(utils) # For memory.limit()

tryCatch({
  sess <- tf$Session()
  # ... TensorFlow operations ...
  sess$close()
}, error = function(e) {
  # Handle errors gracefully, including cleaning up resources
  message(paste("Error encountered:", e))
  if (inherits(e, "tensorflow_error")) {
    # Specific error handling for TensorFlow errors
    # ... Handle TensorFlow specific errors ...
  }
  gc() # Garbage collect R objects
  # Monitor and log resource usage if necessary
  mem_limit <- memory.limit()
  message(paste("Current memory limit:", mem_limit))
}, finally = {
  # Ensure the session is closed even if an error occurs
  if (exists("sess")) {
    sess$close()
  }
})

```

This example incorporates error handling and resource monitoring.  `tryCatch` handles potential exceptions, ensuring that `sess$close()` is always executed, even if errors occur during TensorFlow operations.  The inclusion of a garbage collection (`gc()`) call helps reclaim unused R objects.  Monitoring system resources, although not directly within the code, is a crucial accompanying practice. Using system monitoring tools outside R (e.g., `top`, `htop`) alongside this code can give a much clearer picture of the overall system resource consumption.


**4.  Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of TensorFlow's memory management, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Explore R's memory management capabilities by reviewing its manual, focusing on garbage collection and memory limits.  Investigating the `pryr` package in R can be helpful in debugging memory usage within R sessions. Additionally, becoming proficient in using system monitoring tools like `top` and `htop` under Ubuntu will improve your ability to proactively identify and address memory-related issues.  These tools offer real-time system resource usage monitoring.  Understanding the memory usage patterns of your TensorFlow operations, in combination with these tools, will greatly assist in prevention of future crashes.
