The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'layer'` in TensorFlow/Keras frequently stems from a misunderstanding of how model building and layer access function within the Keras sequential and functional APIs.  This error specifically indicates that a variable you're attempting to access the `.layer` attribute from is `None`, implying that a layer or model object hasn't been properly instantiated or returned from a function call.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous large-scale projects involved identifying incorrect model construction, improper indexing, or issues with custom layer implementations.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The root cause is almost always a failure to correctly retrieve a layer object within your Keras model.  The `.layer` attribute is only applicable to Keras `Layer` objects or those within a `tf.keras.Model` instance.  Attempting to access it on anything else – a `None` object, a list, a string, or even a mis-indexed tensor – will result in this error. This commonly arises in the following scenarios:

* **Incorrect model indexing:**  If you are trying to access a layer by index (`model.layers[i]`), ensure that `i` is within the valid range of layers present in your model.  An index out of bounds will return `None`.  This is particularly problematic when dealing with dynamically sized models or those involving conditional branching during training.

* **Misunderstanding of `Model.get_layer()`:** While `model.layers` provides a list of all layers, `model.get_layer(name)` requires a precise layer name as input.  A misspelling or attempting to access a layer that doesn't exist will also return `None`.

* **Asynchronous or delayed model compilation:**  If the model compilation happens asynchronously or in a separate thread/process, you may inadvertently attempt to access layers before the compilation process is finished, resulting in `None` being returned.  Synchronization mechanisms are crucial for correct layer retrieval in this instance.

* **Custom layer issues:** If you've created custom layers with unusual initialization behavior, errors within the `__init__` method could prevent proper object instantiation and lead to `None` being returned from a layer-creation function.

* **Incorrect return values in custom functions:**  If you have custom functions that are supposed to return a Keras layer, ensure that your function explicitly returns the correct object, rather than `None` due to an error or unexpected program flow.

Addressing these points systematically usually solves the `AttributeError`. Let's illustrate with examples.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Indexing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect indexing - attempting to access a non-existent layer
try:
    layer = model.layers[2] #Only two layers exist.
    print(layer.name)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Error will be caught here.

# Correct indexing
layer = model.layers[1]
print(layer.name) # Output: dense_1 (or similar)
```

This example demonstrates the common error of trying to access an index beyond the existing layers in a Sequential model.  Proper error handling is shown using a `try-except` block, a best practice when dealing with potential exceptions during model manipulation.


**Example 2: Misuse of `get_layer()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,), name='dense_layer_1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output_layer')
])

# Incorrect layer name
try:
    layer = model.get_layer('dense_layer') #Typo in layer name
    print(layer.name)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Error will be caught

#Correct Layer retrieval
layer = model.get_layer('dense_layer_1')
print(layer.name)  #Output: dense_layer_1
```

This illustrates a critical point: `model.get_layer()` is case-sensitive and requires the exact layer name.  In my experience, this is a frequent source of the error.  This example includes error handling to gracefully handle the situation where the layer is not found.


**Example 3: Custom Layer Issue**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        #Error: missing weight initialization
        #self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units), initializer='random_normal') # Corrected line

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs * self.units

model = tf.keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(name='custom_layer')])


try:
    #Attempting to access layer before proper initialization.
    layer = model.layers[0]
    print(layer.name)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #This error is caught if the above line is uncommented.
    #Corrected line to initialize the layer.
    model.build(input_shape=(None,10)) # Build the model to initialize weights
    layer = model.layers[0]
    print(layer.name) #Output: custom_layer

```

This example showcases a potential problem with custom layers.  If a custom layer's `__init__` method fails to correctly instantiate necessary attributes (like weights), or if the model isn't built correctly using `model.build()` before attempting to access layers, the layer object itself might not be fully initialized, leading to `None` being returned from `model.layers[0]`.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation on Keras models and layers.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, specifically addressing model building and TensorFlow/Keras implementations.  A reputable online course dedicated to TensorFlow/Keras, focusing on best practices and advanced concepts.  These resources provide in-depth explanations and practical examples to solidify understanding of model building and layer management.  Careful study of these materials will greatly reduce the likelihood of encountering this and similar errors.
