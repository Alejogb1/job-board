The core issue lies in understanding PyTorch's autograd engine and its reliance on the computational graph.  While `backward()` initiates the gradient calculation,  the computational graph itself is constructed independently, and its nodes contain the necessary information for gradient computation *without* explicitly invoking `backward()`.  This is crucial for scenarios requiring gradient-based computations within larger models or for selectively computing gradients for specific subgraphs.  My experience developing a physics simulation engine using PyTorch heavily leveraged this feature to optimize performance and avoid redundant computations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `autograd` system operates by tracking operations on tensors.  Each tensor with `requires_grad=True` is considered a leaf node in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Operations on these tensors create new nodes in this graph, with each node representing an operation and its input tensors.  The crucial point is that the gradient calculation itself is performed during a traversal of this DAG, starting from the leaf nodes and following the edges (representing the operations).  This traversal, triggered by `backward()`, is essentially a reverse-mode automatic differentiation algorithm.

However, constructing the computational graph and calculating gradients are distinct processes.  The graph is built automatically as you perform operations, regardless of whether you call `backward()`. This allows us to access and utilize gradient information without explicitly initiating the backward pass.  This is achieved primarily using the `.grad` attribute of a tensor and, more subtly, by leveraging the `torch.autograd.grad` function.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accessing Gradients After `backward()` (Illustrative)**

This example demonstrates the standard approach, but it serves as a foundation for understanding how to avoid explicitly calling `backward()`.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.mean()
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Gradients are computed and available after backward()
```

Here, `backward()` triggers the gradient calculation, and `x.grad` contains the resulting gradients.  This is straightforward, but it's not what the question seeks.


**Example 2: Utilizing `torch.autograd.grad` for Selective Gradient Calculation**

This example showcases the power of `torch.autograd.grad` to compute gradients without calling `backward()` on a specific output.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.mean()

gradients = torch.autograd.grad(outputs=z, inputs=x, create_graph=True) # create_graph for higher-order gradients
print(gradients[0]) # gradients[0] contains the gradient of z with respect to x.

#Further operations can be done with the computed gradient without calling backward again
w = gradients[0] * 3
print(w)
```

Here, `torch.autograd.grad` directly computes the gradient of `z` with respect to `x`. Crucially,  `backward()` is not called. The `create_graph=True` argument is particularly useful if higher-order derivatives are needed for more complex computations later in the process.


**Example 3:  Gradient Computation within a Custom Function (Advanced)**

This example demonstrates building a custom function where gradient computation is embedded within the function's logic, effectively decoupling it from the caller's need to invoke `backward()`.

```python
import torch

class MyCustomFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input) # Save the input for the backward pass (if needed later)
        return input * 2

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_input = grad_output * 2 # simple gradient calculation here
        return grad_input

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
my_func = MyCustomFunction.apply
y = my_func(x)
# No backward() call needed here if the gradient is not required immediately

# demonstrate access to the grad if backward is called explicitly later
y.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

This example presents a sophisticated method by leveraging PyTorch's custom function capabilities. The `forward` method defines the main computation, while the `backward` method explicitly calculates the gradients. The key is that the caller doesn't need to explicitly manage the backward pass; it is handled within the custom function.   This is vital for modularity and encapsulation of gradient-related logic within custom layers or functions.  The `backward` method is only called explicitly for obtaining the final gradients, but the function still internally handles all the necessary computations for the gradient.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

PyTorch documentation.  The official PyTorch tutorials, specifically those covering autograd and custom functions.  A good introductory linear algebra text covering multivariate calculus and gradients.  A deep learning textbook explaining automatic differentiation techniques.  Reading research papers on automatic differentiation and computational graphs will be exceptionally helpful.



In conclusion, defining PyTorch functions that use autograd without needing an explicit `backward()` call is achievable through several strategies.  The choice depends on the specific requirements of your application.  Direct gradient calculation using `torch.autograd.grad` offers flexibility, while creating custom functions provides better control and encapsulation.  Understanding the underlying computational graph and its role in automatic differentiation is essential for harnessing these powerful features.  My experience in various projects highlights the importance of these techniques in optimizing complex, gradient-dependent systems.
