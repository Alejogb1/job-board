The behavior of `tf.shape()` returning a 2D tensor, specifically when applied to a tensor that would logically seem to possess a 1D shape representation, stems from TensorFlow's core design principle of treating all dimensions as potentially batched. This design choice, while sometimes counterintuitive, promotes consistent code behavior across various input scenarios, facilitates efficient execution on hardware accelerators, and enables dynamic reshaping operations.

My experience working with TensorFlow, particularly when developing custom layers for image processing pipelines, has highlighted the practical implications of this design decision. Specifically, when debugging reshape operations involving tensors whose shapes were derived from `tf.shape()`, understanding this 2D return structure became crucial.

The fundamental reason is that TensorFlow treats the rank of a tensor as an attribute of its data arrangement, not as a fixed characteristic of its content. The output of `tf.shape()`, rather than representing a direct mapping of dimensions, is itself a tensor intended to encapsulate the dimensions of another tensor. A single tensor, even if it conceptually represents one dimension or even a scalar, is itself an array of potentially batched scalar values, making the rank of the shape output itself a tensor with another dimension.

Let me clarify. Consider a tensor `x` defined as follows: `x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])`.  Intuitively, we perceive `x` as a 1D tensor. However, TensorFlow's internal representation allows for batch processing. Even what we perceive as a single tensor is technically considered as a single batch of data with a specified dimension. This is the key point that influences how `tf.shape()` operates.

Therefore, when calling `tf.shape(x)`, the function doesn't directly return a list or a tuple of integers representing the dimensions. Instead, it returns a *tensor* whose elements are the shape values, encoded in a way that aligns with TensorFlow's internal tensor representation and batching mechanism. Because this shape information itself can be subjected to other tensor operations (e.g., concatenation, slicing), it must be represented by the framework's common data structure: a tensor.

The crucial element is that the resulting tensor has shape `[rank]` where rank is the dimension of the tensor passed to the tf.shape function and each element is the dimension's size. Thus, for a rank 1 tensor the output of `tf.shape` would be a tensor of rank 1 of size [number of elements] representing shape.

The output of `tf.shape(x)` will have shape `[1, n]`, where `n` corresponds to the rank (or number of dimensions) of tensor `x` and *1* denotes one batch (default batch). However, if we have a higher-rank tensor, the rank dimension returned by tf.shape is still of rank 1, and therefore will be of rank 2.

Let's break down some examples to solidify this:

**Example 1: 1D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 1D tensor
x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

# Get the shape of x
shape_of_x = tf.shape(x)

# Print the shape of shape_of_x
print(f"Shape of x: {x.shape}")
print(f"Shape of shape_of_x: {shape_of_x.shape}")
print(f"Values of shape_of_x: {shape_of_x}")

```
**Commentary:**

Here, `x` is a 1D tensor with three elements. `x.shape` returns `(3,)`, as expected. However, the `tf.shape(x)` operation returns a *tensor* which can have its shape queried, and that's where the 2D nature comes in. The printed `shape_of_x.shape` will output `(1, 1)` representing a single batch and one element per batch (representing the rank of the input). The values of shape_of_x will be `[3]` as we expect.

**Example 2: 2D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 2D tensor
y = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Get the shape of y
shape_of_y = tf.shape(y)

# Print the shape of shape_of_y
print(f"Shape of y: {y.shape}")
print(f"Shape of shape_of_y: {shape_of_y.shape}")
print(f"Values of shape_of_y: {shape_of_y}")
```

**Commentary:**

In this case, `y` is a 2D tensor of shape `(3, 2)`. The output of `y.shape` correctly gives `(3, 2)`. `tf.shape(y)`,  returns a tensor that encodes the dimension sizes. `shape_of_y.shape` outputs `(1, 2)`, indicating one batch of shape information with two dimensions, while `shape_of_y` contains the tensor `[3 2]`.

**Example 3: Scalar (0D) Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a scalar tensor
z = tf.constant(5)

# Get the shape of z
shape_of_z = tf.shape(z)

# Print the shape of shape_of_z
print(f"Shape of z: {z.shape}")
print(f"Shape of shape_of_z: {shape_of_z.shape}")
print(f"Values of shape_of_z: {shape_of_z}")

```

**Commentary:**

`z` here is a scalar tensor or rank 0. `z.shape` outputs `()`, correctly noting its lack of dimensions. But `tf.shape(z)` returns a tensor with shape `(1, 0)`, with no actual dimensions, but itself being a rank-1 tensor. The output of `shape_of_z` itself will be an empty tensor `[]`.

The common pattern you can observe is that regardless of the input's rank, `tf.shape()` consistently produces a tensor of rank 1 that conveys the shape of the given tensor. This behavior, while initially perplexing, is rooted in the need for consistency in TensorFlowâ€™s computational graph and the utilization of tensors for all data representation, including metadata.

Another important reason is that by returning a tensor, the output of `tf.shape()` can be seamlessly integrated into other TensorFlow operations, such as reshaping, broadcasting, or dynamic size computation in a custom layer. If `tf.shape()` were to return a static list of integers, these operations would require conversion steps and add unnecessary complexity to the computational graph.

For those new to this behavior, it is common to encounter situations where one might intend to directly use the output of `tf.shape()` to index into a tensor directly, only to encounter errors. To access individual shape elements, one should index the resulting tensor, for example, `tf.shape(x)[0]` to get the first dimension's size. Also, when operating on tensor shapes, one must take into account the shape of the shape tensor, using indexing and potentially applying tf.squeeze if needed.

For those seeking to deepen their understanding of TensorFlow's tensor representation, the official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive information on tensor concepts, ranks, and shapes. Also, studying the source code of functions such as `tf.shape()` can offer profound insights into their implementation. Finally, consulting the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" provides clear explanations with examples, although it might not go into details of shape function outputs. Reading the API of the tf.shape functions itself is another crucial source for understanding this behavior.
