OpenCV's CUDA support relies heavily on the correct configuration of your system's CUDA toolkit and its interaction with the OpenCV build system.  A failing Makefile often points to inconsistencies in environment variables, library paths, or the CUDA toolkit's installation itself.  In my experience, troubleshooting these issues requires a methodical approach, focusing on identifying the precise point of failure within the compilation process.

**1. Explanation of Potential Causes and Troubleshooting Steps:**

The most common reason for OpenCV's CUDA Makefile failing in Ubuntu is an incorrect or incomplete CUDA installation, or a mismatch between the OpenCV version and the CUDA toolkit version.  Other contributing factors include:

* **Missing CUDA Libraries:**  The Makefile needs explicit paths to the CUDA libraries (`libcuda.so`, `libcudart.so`, etc.).  If these are not correctly specified, the compiler will not find them during the linking stage.  Incorrectly configured `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is a frequent culprit.
* **Incorrect CUDA Architecture:** OpenCV's CUDA modules are compiled for specific CUDA architectures (e.g., sm_75, sm_80). If your GPU's compute capability doesn't match the architectures specified during compilation, the build will fail. You must ensure the correct compute capability flags are passed during compilation.
* **Environment Variable Conflicts:**  Conflicting environment variables, particularly those related to CUDA, can interfere with the Makefile's ability to locate necessary headers and libraries.  A clean environment, or carefully curated environment variables, is crucial.
* **Insufficient Permissions:** The build process might require elevated privileges to access certain directories or libraries. Running the `cmake` and `make` commands with `sudo` might resolve permission-related errors, though this should be done cautiously.
* **CMake Configuration Errors:** Incorrect CMake options during the configuration stage can lead to a flawed Makefile.  Double-checking the `cmake` command and its parameters for accuracy is essential.  Specifically, ensure that `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` is correctly set and points to your CUDA installation directory.  Failure to properly enable CUDA support within CMake (`-DBUILD_opencv_cuda=ON`) is also a common mistake.

Debugging these problems involves systematically examining the compiler's error messages. These messages often pinpoint the exact location of the failure, such as a missing header file, a linking error, or a CUDA runtime error.  The log files generated during the build process (often located in a `build` or `CMakeFiles` directory) should be carefully analyzed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate some scenarios and their corresponding solutions.

**Example 1: Missing CUDA Libraries**

This scenario demonstrates how a missing `libcudart.so` library manifests and how to rectify it.  Imagine the following error in the build log:

```
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcudart
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [libopencv_cuda.so.4.8.0] Error 1
```

**Solution:**  This error indicates that the linker cannot find the CUDA runtime library (`libcudart.so`). To resolve this, we need to add the CUDA library path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64 # Adjust path as needed
cmake -DBUILD_opencv_cuda=ON ..
make
```

This ensures that the linker searches the correct directory for the library. Note: replace `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` with the actual path to your CUDA libraries.


**Example 2: Incorrect CUDA Architecture**

This example focuses on specifying the correct CUDA compute capability. Suppose the GPU's compute capability is `sm_75` but the build isn't configured for it.

**Solution:** We need to provide the appropriate CUDA architecture flags during CMake configuration.  The specific flags depend on your CUDA version and GPU architecture, which can be found using `nvidia-smi`.  My experience suggests this solution.

```bash
cmake -DBUILD_opencv_cuda=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="75" .. # Replace 75 with your GPU's compute capability
make
```


**Example 3: CMake Configuration Errors and Environment Variables**

This scenario involves a more general configuration problem where environment variables aren't correctly set, resulting in various errors.

**Solution:**  Starting with a clean build directory is recommended. I usually use a separate build directory to keep things tidy. The below example shows setting essential environment variables and explicitly setting the CUDA toolkit path.

```bash
mkdir build_cuda
cd build_cuda
export CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda # Adjust path as needed
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
cmake -DBUILD_opencv_cuda=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc) #Use multiple cores for faster build
```

This approach ensures that the build system has access to the necessary environment variables and paths for a successful compilation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of building OpenCV with CUDA support, consult the official OpenCV documentation. The CUDA Toolkit documentation provides detailed information on installing and configuring the toolkit, which is crucial for successful integration with OpenCV. Finally, familiarize yourself with the CMake documentation, particularly on how to use CMake variables to manage compilation options for CUDA.  Thoroughly examine the error messages reported during compilation, as they provide essential clues to pinpointing the problem's root cause.  Understand the significance of compute capability and ensure your OpenCV build matches the capability of your CUDA-enabled GPU. Careful attention to these aspects greatly simplifies the building process.
