The reported failure of informative features code likely stems from a conflation of feature engineering strategies with the specific data characteristics or underlying model requirements. My experience, spanning several large-scale machine learning projects, indicates that informative features are not intrinsically defined; rather, their efficacy is contingent on their interaction with the chosen model and the dataset's statistical properties. This response will detail this interaction, offer clarifying code examples and suggest avenues for diagnosis.

The core challenge in identifying "informative features" is the absence of a universal definition. A feature that substantially improves prediction accuracy for one model architecture might introduce noise for another. Furthermore, a feature effective on a subset of data might be detrimental across the entire dataset. Therefore, feature engineering is an iterative process that demands both domain knowledge and rigorous empirical validation. It is not sufficient to presume that a feature, due to a perceived connection to the target variable, will invariably contribute positively to model performance. The features must provide unique and valuable predictive power *for the particular model being used*.

My diagnostic approach to this scenario begins by scrutinizing how the features are generated. If, for example, features are derived using techniques that are sensitive to outliers or skewed distributions without proper pre-processing steps, it's entirely probable that those features introduce more noise than information. Similarly, feature extraction methods that assume a certain functional form, such as polynomial features, might prove inappropriate for data exhibiting a non-linear relationship with the target variable.

Here are three concrete examples, using Python and common data science libraries, with commentary to highlight potential pitfalls:

**Example 1: Improper Handling of Categorical Features**

Consider a scenario where categorical data, say `product_type`, is encoded into numerical representations using simple ordinal encoding without considering if the target variable exhibits an ordering or hierarchy based on product type.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample Data
data = {'product_type': ['electronics', 'books', 'clothing', 'books', 'electronics', 'clothing'],
        'feature1': [10, 20, 15, 25, 12, 18],
        'target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Incorrect Ordinal Encoding (no meaningful ordering)
df['product_type_encoded'] = df['product_type'].astype('category').cat.codes

# Feature Selection
features = ['product_type_encoded', 'feature1']

X = df[features]
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"Accuracy with incorrect encoding: {accuracy}")

# Correct One-Hot Encoding

df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['product_type'], drop_first=True)

features_encoded = [col for col in df_encoded.columns if col.startswith('product_type_') or col == 'feature1']
X_encoded = df_encoded[features_encoded]
X_train_encoded, X_test_encoded, y_train_encoded, y_test_encoded = train_test_split(X_encoded, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model_encoded = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
model_encoded.fit(X_train_encoded, y_train_encoded)
predictions_encoded = model_encoded.predict(X_test_encoded)
accuracy_encoded = accuracy_score(y_test_encoded, predictions_encoded)
print(f"Accuracy with correct one-hot encoding: {accuracy_encoded}")
```

*Commentary:* The first approach applies ordinal encoding, implicitly assigning an order to the product types. However, without such an underlying ordinal relationship in the target variable, this encoding introduces spurious numerical relationships detrimental to logistic regression. The one-hot encoding method appropriately represents each category as a binary vector, enabling the model to discern patterns without artificial numerical constraints, leading to potentially improved performance. This underscores the necessity of choosing an encoding scheme tailored to the nature of the categorical data and the chosen model. Incorrect categorical feature processing often explains why some features do not contribute positively.

**Example 2: Ignoring Feature Scaling for Distance-Based Models**

Many machine learning algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernels, are sensitive to the scales of the input features. If features vary widely in magnitude, those with larger numerical values will disproportionately influence distance calculations, effectively overpowering the effect of features with smaller scales.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample Data
data = {'feature1': [10, 20, 15, 25, 12, 18],
        'feature2': [1000, 2000, 1500, 2500, 1200, 1800],
        'target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
features = ['feature1', 'feature2']
X = df[features]
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Without Scaling
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = knn.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy without scaling: {accuracy}")


# With Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

knn_scaled = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn_scaled.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
predictions_scaled = knn_scaled.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy_scaled = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions_scaled)
print(f"Accuracy with scaling: {accuracy_scaled}")
```

*Commentary:* In this example, `feature2` has values much larger than `feature1`. KNN computes distance based on raw values; `feature2` will dominate distance calculations, essentially nullifying the effect of feature1. After feature scaling is applied via `StandardScaler`, both features have roughly comparable influence, which, based on your model, can improve accuracy. Scaling features before training models sensitive to magnitude is often crucial for better performance.

**Example 3: Overfitting due to excessive feature interaction terms**

Adding too many features that interact with one another (e.g., polynomial terms, cross-products) can lead to overfitting, especially if there isn't sufficient training data to support the increased complexity. Such overfitting is effectively a loss of signal.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
        'feature2': [2, 4, 5, 4, 6, 7],
        'target': [4, 9, 12, 13, 18, 20]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
features = ['feature1', 'feature2']
X = df[features]
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# Linear Regression Without Polynomial Features
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print(f"RMSE without polynomial features: {rmse}")


# Adding Polynomial Features (degree=2)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)
model_poly = LinearRegression()
model_poly.fit(X_train_poly, y_train)
predictions_poly = model_poly.predict(X_test_poly)
rmse_poly = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions_poly))
print(f"RMSE with polynomial features: {rmse_poly}")


# Adding Polynomial Features (degree=3)
poly_3 = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
X_train_poly_3 = poly_3.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_poly_3 = poly_3.transform(X_test)
model_poly_3 = LinearRegression()
model_poly_3.fit(X_train_poly_3, y_train)
predictions_poly_3 = model_poly_3.predict(X_test_poly_3)
rmse_poly_3 = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions_poly_3))
print(f"RMSE with polynomial features (degree=3): {rmse_poly_3}")

```

*Commentary:* This example shows how the increased feature space of polynomial features will decrease the error on training data but can increase the test error, as shown with degree=3 when the test error increased. While polynomial features can improve model fit, excessive use, especially with limited data, often leads to overfitting, ultimately hindering performance on unseen data. Feature selection techniques, or regularization, become essential for managing the complexity.

To diagnose the reasons behind ineffective informative features code, I suggest using the following approaches. First, systematically evaluate the impact of each feature on model performance (i.e. using something like feature importance or permutation importance). Second, experiment with different encoding schemes and scaling techniques to ensure data representation aligns with the model assumptions. Third, use cross-validation, not single train-test split, to make sure results aren't spurious. Fourth, simplify the feature space by starting with a minimal set of features and iteratively adding more only if performance improves consistently. Last, understand the model's bias-variance trade-off by using techniques to help find the right balance based on the task.

Recommended resources for further investigation include textbooks focusing on feature engineering, the documentation of scikit-learn library, and articles focused on model selection and validation. I have found that "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and "Feature Engineering for Machine Learning" by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari to be invaluable for understanding these concepts. The scikit-learn user guide provides an excellent overview of feature pre-processing methods. By addressing the interaction of features with model assumptions, the underlying causes of failure can often be discovered and rectified, and I hope the suggestions here are helpful in doing so.
