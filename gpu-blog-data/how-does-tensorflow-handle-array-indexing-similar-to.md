TensorFlow, despite its primary focus on deep learning and computational graphs, provides a robust mechanism for array indexing that closely mirrors NumPy's syntax and behavior, facilitating ease of transition for those familiar with the latter. This is largely accomplished via the `tf.Tensor` object, which, while representing a node in a computation graph, exposes indexing capabilities analogous to NumPy arrays. I’ve frequently utilized this feature when pre-processing image batches and dealing with model outputs, and the similarities are often a huge time saver.

The crucial aspect is that `tf.Tensor` objects, unlike static arrays, are symbolic representations within a graph. Indexing, therefore, doesn't directly modify the data itself until the computation graph is executed. Instead, it creates new tensor nodes that represent the slice or selection of the original tensor. This delayed execution behavior, intrinsic to TensorFlow’s graph-based computation, can be initially confusing for those coming from NumPy, where indexing operations are immediately carried out.

To be more specific, indexing on a `tf.Tensor` produces a new `tf.Tensor`, encapsulating the requested portion. The indexing syntax allows for scalar indices, range selections (using colons), and advanced indexing techniques, mirroring NumPy’s flexible handling of multidimensional arrays. Negative indexing is also supported, enabling access to elements from the end of a tensor. Furthermore, boolean and integer arrays can be used for advanced indexing which permits sophisticated selections based on conditions or specified indices. These selections are not necessarily contiguous segments, providing flexibility in data manipulation. The key differentiation lies in that the resulting tensor node, at execution, only pulls the indexed data from the original, and the original data remains unchanged.

Here are a few code examples demonstrating different types of indexing in TensorFlow, alongside explanations of their behavior and nuances:

**Code Example 1: Basic Indexing and Slicing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 2D tensor (similar to a NumPy array)
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Accessing a single element
element = tensor_2d[0, 1] # element will be tf.Tensor(2, shape=(), dtype=int32)
print(f"Single element: {element}")

# Slicing a row
row_slice = tensor_2d[1, :] # row_slice will be tf.Tensor([4 5 6], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
print(f"Row slice: {row_slice}")

# Slicing a column
column_slice = tensor_2d[:, 2] # column_slice will be tf.Tensor([3 6 9], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
print(f"Column slice: {column_slice}")

# Slicing a submatrix
submatrix_slice = tensor_2d[0:2, 1:3] # submatrix_slice will be tf.Tensor([[2 3] [5 6]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)
print(f"Submatrix slice: {submatrix_slice}")
```

*Commentary:*  This first example showcases basic indexing.  Accessing a single element uses standard comma-separated index notation, identical to NumPy. Row and column slices leverage the colon operator to select all elements along a particular dimension.  Importantly, these operations do not produce concrete values immediately but define new nodes in the computational graph. The `print` statements, when executed, will only print the actual results after TensorFlow has evaluated these tensors within a session. This is often overlooked by those new to the framework. Notice, also, how specifying a range using `0:2` produces a submatrix, with the end point being exclusive.

**Code Example 2: Advanced Indexing with Integer Arrays**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 1D tensor
tensor_1d = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Create an integer array of indices
indices = tf.constant([0, 3, 2])

# Perform advanced indexing
indexed_values = tf.gather(tensor_1d, indices) # indexed_values will be tf.Tensor([10 40 30], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
print(f"Indexed values: {indexed_values}")

# Create a 2D tensor
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Select specific elements using integer array indexing on rows
row_indices = tf.constant([0,2])
column_indices = tf.constant([1,0])
indexed_values_2d = tf.gather_nd(tensor_2d, tf.stack([row_indices, column_indices], axis=1)) # indexed_values_2d will be tf.Tensor([2 7], shape=(2,), dtype=int32)
print(f"2D Indexed values: {indexed_values_2d}")
```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates advanced indexing using integer arrays. While standard indexing is limited to sequential slices, advanced indexing allows selection of non-contiguous elements using a tensor of index positions. `tf.gather` is the key function when gathering values from a 1D tensor based on these indices. When dealing with higher dimensionality,  `tf.gather_nd` is required, where it receives a 2D tensor of [row,column] pairs and returns a tensor with the indexed values. It's crucial to understand the `tf.gather` or `tf.gather_nd` semantics when using a vector or matrix of indices to ensure the correct selections. I frequently use this when sampling mini-batches of data with specific labels for training sets.

**Code Example 3: Boolean Masking**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Create a boolean mask
mask = tf.constant([True, False, True, False, True, False])

# Apply the mask
masked_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, mask) # masked_tensor will be tf.Tensor([1 3 5], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
print(f"Masked tensor: {masked_tensor}")

# Create a tensor and mask of higher dimensions
tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
mask_3d = tf.constant([[True, False],[False, True]])
masked_tensor_3d = tf.boolean_mask(tensor_3d, mask_3d) # masked_tensor_3d will be tf.Tensor([[1 2] [7 8]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)
print(f"Masked 3D tensor: {masked_tensor_3d}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates boolean masking, a crucial feature when conditional selection of elements based on a boolean tensor is required.  Here, a `tf.constant` object serves as the mask where a `True` value corresponds to the inclusion of the element at that location and `False` values correspond to an exclusion. `tf.boolean_mask` is the critical function that performs this masking operation. I commonly use boolean masking when selecting a subset of predictions based on confidence scores within a machine learning application. Also, as shown in the second example, this applies equally to higher dimensions.

For further exploration of TensorFlow's indexing capabilities and related operations, consulting the official TensorFlow documentation is paramount. Look for sections detailing `tf.Tensor` operations, specifically sections regarding slicing, advanced indexing, and boolean masking. In addition, the TensorFlow guide section on manipulating tensors is invaluable. Furthermore, research around the specifics of `tf.gather`, `tf.gather_nd`, and `tf.boolean_mask` will provide a complete understanding of the advanced features. Reading through the frequently asked questions section on TensorFlow's forums and GitHub repository can also prove helpful as it often covers common pitfalls and unexpected behaviour. I have found these sources reliable in clarifying subtle differences and nuances between the different indexing techniques.
