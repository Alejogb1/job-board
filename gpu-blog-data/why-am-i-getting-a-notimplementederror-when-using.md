The `NotImplementedError` in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) context almost always stems from a mismatch between the defined model architecture and the utilized training or inference procedures.  Specifically, it indicates that a crucial method or operation within your CNN implementation lacks a concrete definition, preventing the model from executing the intended computations.  Over the years, debugging these errors has become routine for me, stemming from both subtle coding errors and larger architectural mismatches.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `NotImplementedError` isn't inherently tied to CNNs; it's a broader Python exception indicating that an abstract method or function hasn't been implemented in a specific subclass.  In the case of CNNs built using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, this error frequently arises in several scenarios:

* **Abstract Base Classes:**  You might be inadvertently using an abstract base class (ABC) without implementing all its required methods.  Frameworks often use ABCs to define a common interface for various model components (e.g., layers, optimizers).  Failing to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods within your custom layer or optimizer leads directly to the error.

* **Custom Layers:** When designing custom convolutional layers, pooling layers, or activation functions, you must implement the `call()` method (TensorFlow/Keras) or the `forward()` method (PyTorch).  These methods define the forward pass computations within your layer.  Omitting these definitions or introducing errors within their implementations results in the `NotImplementedError` during model training or inference.

* **Incorrect Inheritance:**  Improper inheritance from parent classes, particularly when extending existing layer types or optimizers, can lead to this error.  Ensuring you correctly inherit from the appropriate base class and override the necessary methods is critical.

* **Missing Backpropagation Definitions (PyTorch):** In PyTorch, automatic differentiation (autograd) relies on correctly defining the backward pass.  If you implement a custom layer or function without defining the `backward()` method (or using `torch.autograd.Function` appropriately), you'll encounter the error during backpropagation.

* **Incompatible Framework Versions:** Using incompatible versions of TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch with your custom layers or models can also lead to this issue.  Check your framework versions and ensure compatibility with your code.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Missing `call()` method in TensorFlow/Keras custom layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, 3, activation='relu') #Correctly implemented

    # Missing call() method - this will cause NotImplementedError
    #def call(self, inputs):
    #    x = self.conv(inputs)
    #    return x

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(32),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# model.fit(...)  # This will raise NotImplementedError
```

This example demonstrates a common error: the `call()` method, essential for defining the layer's operation, is missing.  Uncommenting the `call()` method resolves the issue.


**Example 2: Incorrect inheritance in PyTorch:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyIncorrectLayer(nn.Module): #Should inherit from nn.Conv2d or similar
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyIncorrectLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3,3)) #Should define conv parameters correctly

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.conv2d(x, self.weight) #Incorrect convolution application


model = nn.Sequential(
    MyIncorrectLayer(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(100,10)
)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1,3,32,32)
#output = model(input_tensor) #This will lead to runtime error, not necessarily NotImplementedError, but highlights a related problem in structure
```

This shows a conceptual problem. While not directly a `NotImplementedError`, this example highlights how an incorrect layer definition—inheriting from `nn.Module` without proper convolutional structure—leads to runtime errors.  A correct implementation would involve inheriting from a specific convolutional layer type and properly defining the convolution operation. The `torch.conv2d` function is generally not used directly when defining custom CNN layers within PyTorch.


**Example 3: Missing `backward()` method in a PyTorch custom autograd function:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.autograd as autograd

class MyCustomFunction(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input) #saves for backprop calculation
        return input.pow(2) #Simple squaring operation


    #@staticmethod
    #def backward(ctx, grad_output):
    #    input, = ctx.saved_tensors
    #    return grad_output * 2 * input #Gradient of squaring

#Note: Commenting the backward method will result in NotImplementedError

my_custom_func = MyCustomFunction.apply
input = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
output = my_custom_func(input)
output.backward() #This will raise NotImplementedError if backward is missing
```

This illustrates the necessity of defining the `backward()` method within a custom `autograd.Function` in PyTorch. The `backward()` method is crucial for defining how gradients are computed during backpropagation.  Omitting it, as shown by the commented-out section, leads directly to a `NotImplementedError`.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing the official documentation for the specific deep learning framework you are using (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).  Focus on sections related to custom layer implementation, automatic differentiation (for PyTorch), and abstract base classes.  Pay close attention to examples demonstrating correct implementation patterns.  Further, consider searching for relevant tutorials and Stack Overflow questions concerning custom layer implementations within your framework.  Thoroughly examining error messages and stack traces is crucial, as they often provide precise information on the line of code causing the problem and the context of the error.  Finally, utilize a debugger effectively to step through your code and understand the state of your variables during the problematic operation.  This combination of reading documentation, searching for information, and using debugging tools has helped me effectively solve numerous `NotImplementedError` issues over the years.
