TensorFlow’s computational graph, once defined, is immutable. This presents a challenge when you need to execute the same network architecture with varying input data. I’ve encountered this situation countless times while iterating on models and experimenting with different data augmentation techniques during my work on image processing applications. The key lies in understanding that we are not “rerunning” the same graph with a different input, but rather providing a *new* tensor as input to the *existing* graph at each execution.

The core concept is to avoid redefining the network each time. Instead, define placeholders or, when using Keras, `Input` layers, that serve as entry points for data. These placeholders are not assigned concrete values during graph construction. Instead, concrete tensors are fed into them during each execution using the `session.run()` method or, in Keras, by passing data to the model’s `predict` or `fit` methods. This separation allows the underlying computational graph to remain fixed while the input data changes.

The most fundamental way to achieve this is by utilizing `tf.placeholder`. This approach is more explicit and provides finer control over the feeding mechanism, though it is less abstracted than Keras’s method.

**Example 1: Using `tf.placeholder` with a basic graph**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the graph using placeholders
input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 784), name="input_data")
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((784, 10)), name="weights")
biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((10)), name="biases")
output = tf.matmul(input_placeholder, weights) + biases

# Define the loss function and optimizer (for demonstration)
labels_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=(None,), name="labels")
cross_entropy = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=output, labels=labels_placeholder)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy)
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss)

# Initialize variables and start a TensorFlow session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    # Dummy input data
    input_data_1 = np.random.rand(10, 784)
    labels_1 = np.random.randint(0, 10, 10)

    # Run the graph with input data 1
    loss_val_1, _ = sess.run([loss, optimizer], feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_data_1, labels_placeholder:labels_1})
    print(f"Loss for input data 1: {loss_val_1}")


    # Different input data
    input_data_2 = np.random.rand(20, 784)
    labels_2 = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)


    # Run the graph again with input data 2
    loss_val_2, _ = sess.run([loss, optimizer], feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_data_2, labels_placeholder:labels_2})
    print(f"Loss for input data 2: {loss_val_2}")
```

In this example, `input_placeholder` is defined with a shape `(None, 784)`, allowing batches of input vectors of length 784. I specify `None` for the first dimension, which corresponds to the batch size, allowing flexibility during execution. During each call to `session.run()`, I provide `feed_dict`, a dictionary that maps placeholders to concrete NumPy arrays. The graph’s structure remains the same; only the input tensor's values are changing, driving the network’s computation. This is the basic mechanics of providing different input data to an existing TensorFlow graph. I use labels placeholder to illustrate that additional inputs to the computational graph can be fed with feed_dict in similar manner.

**Example 2: Using Keras `Input` layer**

Keras, a high-level API for TensorFlow, offers a more streamlined approach to this process. The `Input` layer within Keras effectively acts as a placeholder and is far easier to integrate into more complex architectures. The model itself manages data feeding internally.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define the model using Input layer
input_layer = keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,))
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(input_layer)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)


# Define the optimizer and loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy input data
input_data_1 = np.random.rand(10, 784)
labels_1 = np.random.randint(0, 10, 10)

# Train the model with the first input data
model.fit(input_data_1, labels_1, epochs=1, verbose = 0)
predictions_1 = model.predict(input_data_1)
print(f"Predictions for data 1: {predictions_1.shape}")



# Different input data
input_data_2 = np.random.rand(20, 784)
labels_2 = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)


# Train the model with the second input data
model.fit(input_data_2, labels_2, epochs=1, verbose = 0)
predictions_2 = model.predict(input_data_2)
print(f"Predictions for data 2: {predictions_2.shape}")

```

Here, the `Input` layer is defined with the shape `(784,)`, indicating input vectors of length 784. During training, or when invoking `model.predict`, the concrete input data is passed directly to these methods. Keras handles the process of feeding the data into the network, abstracting away much of the manual placeholder handling we saw in the previous example. Crucially, the underlying model definition remains unchanged. We are merely providing different data tensors to it during training and prediction using `model.fit` and `model.predict` respectively.

**Example 3: Using Keras with Data Generators**

For very large datasets, loading everything into memory at once is often not feasible. In such cases, Keras `ImageDataGenerator` and its derived classes prove invaluable by enabling iterative loading of batches of images. This further demonstrates how the same network is used with different input tensors – batches of data – generated dynamically.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Dummy training data (replace with real images)
num_samples = 100
image_height = 64
image_width = 64
input_shape = (image_height, image_width, 3)
images = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, num_samples)

# Define the model using Input layer
input_layer = keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
flatten_layer = keras.layers.Flatten()(input_layer)
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten_layer)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)

# Define optimizer and loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Initialize the data generator
datagen = keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator()


# Define a training generator function
def training_data_generator(images, labels, batch_size):
    num_batches = (len(images) + batch_size - 1) // batch_size
    for batch_index in range(num_batches):
        start = batch_index * batch_size
        end = min(start + batch_size, len(images))
        batch_images = images[start:end]
        batch_labels = labels[start:end]
        yield batch_images, batch_labels

# Training with a batch size of 16
batch_size = 16

# Train the model using batches
model.fit(training_data_generator(images, labels, batch_size), steps_per_epoch=len(images) // batch_size, epochs=2, verbose = 0)

# Generate new images
new_images = np.random.rand(20, *input_shape)

# Prediction on the new images
new_predictions = model.predict(new_images)

print(f"Shape of new predictions: {new_predictions.shape}")
```

In this example, I utilize a custom training generator, which iteratively yields data batches to the model during training. The model operates on each batch, which represents a different input tensor of the same shape. The `ImageDataGenerator` can be used directly as a more advanced alternative which simplifies the iterative data batching process. I've kept this approach explicit to demonstrate the fundamental process. Again, the model’s structure remains fixed while the generator continuously provides different batches of image data for training. Following training, new images are passed through model’s `predict` method.

In summary, the core idea when rerunning a TensorFlow network with a different input is to use placeholders (or `Input` layers in Keras) to define the points where input tensors are provided. This technique decouples the network architecture from the specific input data, enabling the network to be reused multiple times with different tensors, either provided directly or generated in batches. It is not actually a “rerun” but rather the execution of the *same* graph with *different* inputs.

For further exploration, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation on placeholders and Keras input layers. Also, familiarize yourself with the Keras documentation on Data Generators. Understanding these concepts is foundational for effective and efficient utilization of TensorFlow in various machine learning tasks. Specifically look for tutorials that detail the feeding mechanisms for TensorFlow sessions. Exploring the differences between graph mode and eager execution and their effects on data feeding strategies can be helpful as well.
