The core issue hindering Jenkins' display of Docker container command output often stems from a misconfiguration of the Jenkins build step, specifically concerning how standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams are handled within the Docker execution context.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous large-scale CI/CD pipelines points to this as the primary culprit.  The problem isn't necessarily that the commands within the container are failing; rather, the output isn't being properly channeled to the Jenkins console.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Jenkins interacts with Docker containers through its various plugins, most commonly the Docker Pipeline plugin.  When executing commands inside a container using `docker run`, `docker exec`, or similar commands within a Jenkinsfile, the success or failure of the command is usually determined by the container's exit code. However, the *output* of the command, whether it's informational messages, warnings, errors, or progress indicators, requires explicit handling.  If this handling is missing or incorrectly implemented, the output remains within the container's ephemeral environment and is not relayed to the Jenkins console for viewing.

Several scenarios lead to this output capture failure:

* **Incorrect `sh` or `bat` commands:**  Using the `sh` (for bash) or `bat` (for batch) steps within a Jenkins Pipeline without proper redirection (e.g., `2>&1`) causes stdout and stderr streams to be handled differently than intended, possibly losing output entirely.

* **Lack of Container Logging Configuration:**  The Docker container itself might not be correctly configured to forward its logs to a central location (like the Docker daemon's logs or a dedicated logging service). This is a separate concern from Jenkins, but crucial for debugging.

* **Jenkins Plugin Issues:** Occasionally, a buggy or outdated Docker plugin within Jenkins might prevent the proper capture of the streams. Though less frequent, this should be considered if other troubleshooting methods fail.

* **Insufficient Privileges:** If the Jenkins user lacks the necessary permissions to access the Docker socket or the container's filesystem, it can indirectly affect output capture. This often manifests as silent failures rather than explicit error messages.

Addressing these scenarios requires careful review of the Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, and the relevant Jenkins plugin configurations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect use of `sh` command**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                docker.image('my-image').inside {
                    sh 'my-command' // Incorrect: Output might be lost
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example fails to capture the output of `my-command`.  The correct approach is to explicitly redirect both stdout and stderr to the Jenkins console using `2>&1`:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                docker.image('my-image').inside {
                    sh 'my-command 2>&1' // Correct: Redirects stdout and stderr
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


**Example 2: Using `withDockerContainer` for better control**

The `withDockerContainer` step provides more granular control and improves error handling.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                withDockerContainer('my-image', args: ['-v', '/path/to/host:/path/to/container']) {
                    container ->
                    script {
                        def result = sh(script: 'my-command', returnStdout: true)
                        echo "Command output: ${result.trim()}"
                        // Check the exit code:
                        if (result.exit == 0) {
                            echo "Command executed successfully"
                        } else {
                            error "Command failed with exit code ${result.exit}"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

This example leverages `returnStdout: true` to explicitly capture the output. The `trim()` function removes leading/trailing whitespace, and the exit code is checked for a more robust error handling mechanism.  The use of `withDockerContainer` promotes better resource management compared to direct `docker run` commands within `sh`.


**Example 3:  Handling container logs directly**

If the above solutions fail, consider inspecting container logs directly using the `docker logs` command within the Jenkins pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                docker.image('my-image').inside {
                    sh 'my-command & sleep 5' //Run in background and sleep to ensure logs are written.
                    def containerId = sh(script: 'echo $CONTAINER_ID', returnStdout: true).trim()
                    def logs = sh(script: "docker logs ${containerId}", returnStdout: true)
                    echo "Container logs:\n${logs.trim()}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note the use of `sleep` to allow time for logs to be generated before retrieving them with `docker logs`.  The `$CONTAINER_ID` environment variable (available within the `docker.image().inside` block) provides the container's ID for log retrieval.  If a command is particularly long-running, consider using `docker logs -f ${containerId}` to follow logs in real-time, but managing this output in a Jenkins pipeline can require more advanced techniques.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Jenkins official documentation:** Focus on the sections concerning the Docker Pipeline plugin and pipeline syntax.  Thoroughly explore the various ways to interact with Docker containers within a Jenkins pipeline.

* **Docker documentation:**  Review the documentation on Docker's logging mechanisms and how to configure logging drivers. Understanding how logging operates within the Docker environment is essential.

* **Jenkins plugin documentation:**  For each plugin used in the pipeline (e.g., Docker Pipeline plugin, other plugins managing the build process), consult their documentation for proper usage and potential limitations.


Through careful attention to the details outlined above—proper stream redirection, utilization of robust Jenkins steps like `withDockerContainer`, and, if necessary, direct access to container logs—one can effectively resolve the issue of missing command output from Docker containers within a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.  My experience emphasizes the need for meticulous attention to detail in pipeline scripting and Docker container configuration.  Remember to always prioritize comprehensive error handling and logging to facilitate troubleshooting.
