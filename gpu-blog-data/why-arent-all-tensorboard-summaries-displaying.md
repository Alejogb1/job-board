TensorBoard failing to display all expected summaries, particularly when dealing with complex deep learning models or custom logging, often stems from a mismatch between the summaries generated within the training loop and the specific filtering or data retrieval logic employed by TensorBoard. In my experience debugging countless model training pipelines, the most common culprits are scoping issues, incorrect naming conventions for summary ops, and insufficient logging frequency.

Let's dissect these issues. TensorBoard relies on a structured organization of event files, where each event contains scalar values, images, histograms, or other data points related to model training. These event files are created by TensorFlow’s `tf.summary` operations, which must be properly configured and executed within the computational graph. If these operations are not running or are not writing the data correctly, no visualization will appear in TensorBoard.

One fundamental problem is the concept of "scopes" in TensorFlow. If summaries are defined within specific variable scopes, their names will be prefixed with that scope. This creates a hierarchical structure that is crucial for organization but can also lead to confusion if TensorBoard is not configured to look within the proper scope or if the names are inconsistently applied. If a summary, for instance, is nested under `model/layer1/weights` and the user attempts to filter or display data using `layer1/weights` without the `model/` prefix, it won't be found. Similarly, using different scopes for different runs of a model without accounting for it in TensorBoard's filtering can cause only partial displays.

Another potential issue lies with the execution of summary ops. A `tf.summary` operation, in isolation, merely defines the operation; it does not execute it or persist its data. To actually write to disk and thus be picked up by TensorBoard, summary operations must be explicitly evaluated during the training loop. Usually, this is done by merging all summary operations via `tf.summary.merge_all()` and then using a session's `run` method to execute the merged op. If the `run` call is missing or is incorrectly placed, the summary data is not collected. Furthermore, if a `FileWriter` object is not consistently used to write these summaries to the designated log directory, data will be lost.

Furthermore, summary frequency is a critical factor. Writing summaries too infrequently can result in incomplete visualization, especially for rapidly changing training metrics. Conversely, over-frequent writing can bog down the training process and create very large event files. I've encountered scenarios where summaries were only recorded every few hundred training steps, leading to sparse, hard-to-interpret TensorBoard visualizations that hid potentially useful information about the training progress.

Here are a few code examples demonstrating some of these common errors, along with commentary:

**Example 1: Missing Execution of Summary Op**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder and variable
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
y = tf.Variable(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)
loss = tf.square(x-y)

# Define a scalar summary op
tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
# Merge all summaries
merged_summary = tf.summary.merge_all()

# Create a summary writer
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs', tf.get_default_graph())

# Training loop
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for i in range(100):
        _loss, _merged = sess.run([loss, merged_summary], feed_dict={x: float(i)}) # Summary was evaluated!
        if i % 10 == 0:
          writer.add_summary(_merged, i)

writer.close()
```

*Commentary:* In this example, the core issue is that the `merged_summary` needs to be evaluated in the training loop, alongside the other computations, which results in the writing of summary data when `writer.add_summary` is called. If we comment out the evaluation step in `sess.run([loss, merged_summary])`, TensorBoard will have nothing to visualize because the summary data was never actually computed. The key to generating summaries is to execute the ops with the `sess.run` function along with other training steps. The `feed_dict` provides necessary input to perform the computation. Without the execution, the merged summaries are not computed and the write does nothing. We also added a periodic write of the summary to file using `writer.add_summary` which takes the merged summary and the current step number.

**Example 2: Scope Issues and Inconsistent Naming**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="input_placeholder")

# Model architecture in a scope 'model'
with tf.variable_scope('model'):
    weights = tf.get_variable('weights', shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32, initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
    output = tf.multiply(x, weights, name="model_output")
    # summary inside the scope
    tf.summary.scalar('weights', weights)
    #summary of the output
    tf.summary.scalar('output', output)


# Training step
loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(output))
tf.summary.scalar('total_loss', loss) # This summary lives outside the scope


merged_summary = tf.summary.merge_all()

writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs2', tf.get_default_graph())

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for i in range(100):
        _loss, _merged = sess.run([loss, merged_summary], feed_dict={x: float(i)})

        if i%10 ==0:
          writer.add_summary(_merged, i)

writer.close()

```

*Commentary:* In this example, summaries for `weights` and `output` are defined inside the `model` scope. If TensorBoard is configured to only look for `weights` or `output` without the `model/` prefix, the plots will not appear. The `total_loss` summary, on the other hand, will appear as `total_loss` in TensorBoard. The scope needs to be specified when filtering in Tensorboard. Also note that `tf.variable_scope()` allows you to define a name space for variables and related operations. This allows you to organize your graph and manage namespaces. This example highlights the need to be consistent with names and scoping when configuring summaries for a model. We also make use of `tf.get_variable` which will ensure that the `weight` variable is not recreated during each training loop step. We should be very careful to ensure that the correct summaries are being added in the correct scoping environment.

**Example 3: Inconsistent FileWriter Usage and Sparse Logging**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
y = tf.Variable(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)
loss = tf.square(x-y)

# Define a scalar summary
tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
merged_summary = tf.summary.merge_all()

#Incorrect usage of FileWriter (creates new writer object per step)
#writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs3', tf.get_default_graph())

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for i in range(100):
      _loss,_merged = sess.run([loss,merged_summary], feed_dict={x: float(i)})
      if i % 20 == 0:
        writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs3', sess.graph) # Writer is being re-created each time
        writer.add_summary(_merged, i)
        writer.close() # Writer is being closed immediately

    # missing writer.close()
```
*Commentary:* In this example, a new `FileWriter` object is created in each logging step and immediately closed. This is incorrect behavior since the summaries cannot be collected efficiently. The `FileWriter` is usually created once at the beginning of the training process. The `add_summary` function call is made at each logging step. Note how the summary is written only every 20 steps. When TensorBoard reads this event file, it will not display any values for steps that do not have recorded summary data. Also there is a missing call to the `writer.close()` method at the end of the program. It is necessary to close the writer to ensure that all events have been written to the file.

In summary, addressing the "missing summary" issue requires meticulous review of the summary definitions, their execution, and logging frequency. These issues are not always straightforward to diagnose due to the distributed and parallel nature of computation in TensorFlow.

For further learning, consult TensorFlow’s official documentation on summaries and TensorBoard visualization, particularly the sections detailing scoping, `FileWriter` functionality, and the usage of summary ops. Investigate tutorials about practical summary techniques for debugging complex models. Additionally, study the implementation details within popular deep learning frameworks to gain a deeper understanding of summary operations and their relationship to training loop execution. There are also many resources online that cover best practices for effective TensorBoard visualization, especially for large-scale training.
