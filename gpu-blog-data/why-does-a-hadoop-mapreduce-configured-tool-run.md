Hadoop MapReduce job failures subsequent to a successful first job often stem from improperly handled intermediate data or misconfigurations within the job control flow, rather than inherent platform issues.  In my experience troubleshooting production Hadoop clusters for over eight years, I've encountered this specific scenario numerous times.  The first job completes successfully because it operates within a clean slate.  The subsequent failure indicates a problem within the workflow or data generated by the preceding job.

Let's dissect the potential causes and illustrate them with code examples.  The issue generally falls into one of these categories:

1. **Output Path Conflicts:** The most common reason a second MapReduce job fails after a successful first job is a conflict in the output directory.  If the second job attempts to write to the same directory as the first, it will encounter an error, as Hadoop's file system, HDFS, is designed to prevent overwriting data.

2. **Data Corruption or Inconsistent Data Format:**  A successful first job doesn't guarantee data integrity.  Issues like data skew, malformed output, or incomplete processing during the first job can lead to the second job failing. The second job's input depends entirely on the output of the first, making it vulnerable to any imperfections.

3. **Job Configuration Errors:**  While the first job may have successfully launched with specific settings, the second job's configuration might contain errors that prevent execution.  This could involve incorrect input paths, mismatched data formats, resource allocation issues, or improper jar dependencies.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Output Path Conflict**

```java
// Job 1: Word Count (Illustrative)
Job job1 = Job.getInstance(conf, "WordCount");
job1.setJarByClass(WordCount.class);
FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job1, new Path("/input/data.txt"));
FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job1, new Path("/output/wordcount")); //Output path

// Job 2:  Word Frequency Analysis
Job job2 = Job.getInstance(conf, "WordFrequency");
job2.setJarByClass(WordFrequency.class);
FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job2, new Path("/output/wordcount")); // Input is the output of job1.
FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job2, new Path("/output/wordcount")); //ERROR: Same output path as job1!

```

This code demonstrates a classic error.  Both `job1` and `job2` attempt to write to `/output/wordcount`.  `job1` will succeed, but `job2` will fail because the directory already exists.  The solution is to provide a unique output path for each job, for example, `/output/wordcount/job1` and `/output/wordfrequency`.


**Example 2: Data Corruption – Missing Partitions**

```java
// Job 1: Data Partitioning (Illustrative)
// ... (Code for partitioning data, perhaps using a custom Partitioner) ...
FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job1, new Path("/output/partitioned"));

//Job 2: Processing Partitioned Data
Job job2 = Job.getInstance(conf, "ProcessPartitions");
job2.setJarByClass(ProcessPartitions.class);
FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job2, new Path("/output/partitioned"));
// ... (Further processing of partitioned data) ...
```

In this scenario, let's suppose the partitioning logic in `job1` has a flaw, resulting in some data partitions being missing or incomplete in the `/output/partitioned` directory.  When `job2` attempts to process this incomplete data, it might encounter errors, resulting in failure.  Thorough testing and validation of the partitioning logic in `job1` are crucial to avoid this.  Implementing robust error handling and logging within `job1` is also vital for identifying such inconsistencies.

**Example 3: Incorrect Job Configuration – Missing Jars**

```java
//Job 1: Uses custom library "mylib.jar"
Job job1 = Job.getInstance(conf, "Job1");
job1.addJar(new Path("/path/to/mylib.jar")); // Adds the necessary library

// Job 2:  Forgets to add "mylib.jar"
Job job2 = Job.getInstance(conf, "Job2");
// job2.addJar(new Path("/path/to/mylib.jar"));  //Missing! This is the crucial error

```

In this case, `job1` successfully runs because the required custom library `mylib.jar` is added. However, `job2` fails because it's missing the same library, which is likely essential for its functionality.   This underscores the importance of rigorously checking all job configurations and ensuring all necessary dependencies are included.  In a real-world setting, managing dependencies effectively, using tools like Maven or Ivy, is highly beneficial to prevent this.


**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Examine Job Logs:**  Analyze the logs for both jobs, specifically paying attention to error messages. These messages often pinpoint the exact cause of failure.  Examine the stderr output for detailed information on the error.

2. **Verify Output Paths:** Ensure that each job's output path is unique to avoid conflicts.  Use a structured directory naming convention to easily track and manage your job outputs.

3. **Inspect Input Data:** If `job2` depends on `job1`'s output, verify that the output is properly formatted and complete.   Utilize tools that can inspect and validate the data format and detect corruptions.

4. **Review Job Configurations:** Compare the configurations of both jobs. Identify differences in parameters, input/output paths, resource allocation, and libraries.

5. **Check Resource Availability:** Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are available to both jobs.  Resource contention can lead to intermittent job failures.

6. **Monitor Task Completion:** Monitor the completion status of individual tasks within each job to pinpoint specific tasks that might be failing.  This helps isolate the problems within specific stages of the job processing.

The key to resolving this type of problem lies in meticulous attention to detail, particularly concerning data handling and job configurations.  Systematic troubleshooting, leveraging the tools and information provided by Hadoop, will generally lead to identifying and rectifying the specific issue.  Proactive logging and comprehensive error handling are also vital in the development phase, significantly simplifying debugging in production.
