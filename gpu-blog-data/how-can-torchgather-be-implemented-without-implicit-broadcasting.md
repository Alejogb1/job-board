The core limitation of `torch.gather`'s implicit broadcasting lies in its handling of higher-dimensional tensors.  While convenient for many use cases, this implicit behavior can lead to unexpected results and performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex indexing schemes. My experience working on a large-scale recommendation system highlighted this issue; the inefficiency stemming from implicit broadcasting in `torch.gather` became a significant performance constraint.  This response details how to implement the functionality of `torch.gather` without relying on PyTorch's implicit broadcasting, focusing on explicit index manipulation for improved control and potential performance gains.

**1.  Understanding the Implicit Broadcasting Issue**

`torch.gather` operates by efficiently collecting elements from a source tensor based on indices provided in an index tensor. The implicit broadcasting comes into play when the dimensions of the index tensor don't perfectly align with the source tensor. PyTorch automatically expands the dimensions of the index tensor to match the source tensor, facilitating the gathering operation.  However, this automatic expansion can lead to unnecessary memory allocation and computation, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional tensors or complex indexing patterns. It masks the underlying index manipulation, making it difficult to optimize for specific hardware architectures and memory layouts.


**2. Explicit Implementation using Advanced Indexing**

The solution lies in explicitly constructing the indices needed for gathering, avoiding the automatic broadcasting mechanism. This can be achieved by leveraging PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities.  The process involves generating multi-dimensional indices that directly correspond to the desired elements in the source tensor.  This technique grants greater control over memory access patterns and enables optimizations tailored to the specific indexing logic.


**3. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the explicit implementation of `torch.gather` using advanced indexing for various scenarios:

**Example 1:  Simple 1D Gathering**

```python
import torch

# Source tensor
source = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Indices (without broadcasting)
indices = torch.tensor([0, 2, 4])

# Explicit gathering
gathered = source[indices]

print(gathered)  # Output: tensor([10, 30, 50])

# Comparison with torch.gather
gathered_gather = torch.gather(source.unsqueeze(0), 1, indices.unsqueeze(0))
print(gathered_gather.squeeze(0)) #Output: tensor([10, 30, 50])
```

This example showcases a straightforward 1D gathering.  The `indices` tensor directly selects elements from the `source` tensor.  Notice that we avoid `torch.gather` entirely using standard tensor indexing. The comparison with `torch.gather` highlights the equivalence.  The `unsqueeze` operations are necessary for compatibility with `torch.gather`'s requirements.


**Example 2: 2D Gathering with Row-wise Indices**

```python
import torch

# Source tensor (2D)
source = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Row indices
row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])

# Column indices
col_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])

# Construct multi-dimensional indices
row_indices_expanded = row_indices.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, col_indices.size(0))
col_indices_expanded = col_indices.unsqueeze(0).repeat(row_indices.size(0), 1)
multi_indices = torch.stack((row_indices_expanded, col_indices_expanded), dim = 2)

#Explicit gathering
gathered = source[tuple(torch.unbind(multi_indices, dim = 2))]

print(gathered) #Output: tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

#Comparison with torch.gather (requires reshaping and dim specification)
gathered_gather = torch.gather(source, 1, col_indices.unsqueeze(0).repeat(3,1))
print(gathered_gather) #Output: tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

```

This example demonstrates 2D gathering.  We explicitly construct multi-dimensional indices using `unsqueeze` and `repeat` to avoid implicit broadcasting.  The `torch.unbind` function is crucial for correctly indexing the 2D tensor. Note the differences in specifying the dimension in the explicit method versus the `torch.gather` method.

**Example 3:  Handling More Complex Indexing**

```python
import torch

# Source tensor (3D)
source = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)

# Indices (representing selections across multiple dimensions)
batch_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1])
channel_indices = torch.tensor([1, 0])
element_indices = torch.tensor([2, 3])


# Construct multi-dimensional indices
batch_indices_expanded = batch_indices.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(1).repeat(1,2,4)
channel_indices_expanded = channel_indices.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1,4).unsqueeze(0).repeat(2,1,1)
element_indices_expanded = element_indices.unsqueeze(0).repeat(2,1).unsqueeze(0).repeat(1,2,1)

multi_indices = torch.stack((batch_indices_expanded, channel_indices_expanded, element_indices_expanded), dim = 3)

#Explicit gathering
gathered = source[tuple(torch.unbind(multi_indices, dim=3))]

print(gathered)


# torch.gather is significantly less intuitive in this case

```

This example illustrates a more complex 3D gathering scenario. We generate multi-dimensional indices to select specific elements across all dimensions.  The code clearly demonstrates how to handle multi-dimensional indices with multiple indices per dimension, thereby highlighting the advantages of explicit control. Direct comparison with `torch.gather` becomes cumbersome due to the complexity of the indexing.  


**4. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of advanced indexing in PyTorch, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on tensor indexing and the relevant sections covering indexing with tuples and advanced indexing techniques. Additionally, a comprehensive text on linear algebra and tensor manipulation would be beneficial for grasping the underlying mathematical principles.  Finally, reviewing papers on efficient tensor operations and memory management in deep learning frameworks will provide insights into the performance implications of different indexing strategies.


**Conclusion**

While `torch.gather` provides a convenient way to perform gathering operations, understanding its implicit broadcasting behavior is critical for optimizing performance, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets or complex indexing.  By explicitly constructing multi-dimensional indices and leveraging PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities, one can achieve the same functionality without relying on implicit broadcasting, leading to better control, potential performance gains, and more predictable behavior.  This explicit approach is particularly beneficial in situations where the indexing patterns are not simple or uniform, which is frequently the case in my experience working with large-scale systems.
