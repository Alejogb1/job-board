The prevalent use of a single convolutional layer in CNN architectures for text classification, often observed in introductory examples and baseline models, stems primarily from a balance between feature extraction simplicity and computational efficiency. Having spent considerable time experimenting with diverse CNN models for NLP tasks, I’ve repeatedly noted this pattern, which isn’t necessarily an indication of superiority in all cases, but rather a pragmatic design choice for many text classification scenarios.

The core concept revolves around the nature of text itself. Unlike images, where hierarchical patterns like edges, corners, and objects are critical for understanding, text often has more immediate relevant patterns. Words or short sequences of words can often carry the primary meaning. A single convolutional layer, equipped with filters of varying sizes, is capable of capturing these *n*-gram features effectively, without necessarily needing the deep hierarchical understanding that multiple convolutional layers would provide.

The key benefit of this approach lies in its computational cost. Adding more convolutional layers increases the number of parameters, making models more complex and resource intensive to train and potentially prone to overfitting, especially when datasets are not large. Text classification datasets, while often readily available, may not always be large enough to require or fully leverage the complexities of deeper networks. A single convolutional layer offers a lightweight approach, allowing quicker training and easier experimentation, facilitating rapid prototyping and iteration, especially during the initial stages of model development.

Furthermore, a single layer’s output provides an interpretable feature representation suitable for classification. After the convolutional operation, max-pooling is generally applied. This operation reduces the dimensionality of the feature map and selects the most prominent feature within each filter's output. The final flattened and pooled output is then typically fed to one or more fully connected layers, resulting in a manageable and discriminative feature vector, suitable for classification. More complex hierarchical patterns captured by deeper models are not always required for basic text classification, such as sentiment analysis or topic categorization, and their additional computational cost and complexity may not justify the gain in performance.

Let’s consider three specific implementations using a hypothetical deep learning framework (similar to Keras/Tensorflow) for illustrative purposes:

**Example 1: Basic single-layer CNN**

```python
import deeplearningframework as dl

def build_single_layer_cnn(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_filters, filter_sizes, num_classes):
    
    input_layer = dl.Input(shape=(sequence_length,))
    embedding_layer = dl.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)
    
    conv_layers = []
    for filter_size in filter_sizes:
        conv = dl.Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=filter_size, activation='relu', padding='valid')(embedding_layer)
        pool = dl.MaxPool1D(pool_size=sequence_length-filter_size+1)(conv) # global max pooling
        conv_layers.append(pool)
    
    merged_layers = dl.concat(conv_layers)
    flattened_layer = dl.Flatten()(merged_layers)
    
    dense_layer = dl.Dense(128, activation='relu')(flattened_layer)
    output_layer = dl.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(dense_layer)
    
    model = dl.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    
    return model

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
sequence_length = 50
num_filters = 100
filter_sizes = [3, 4, 5]
num_classes = 2

model = build_single_layer_cnn(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_filters, filter_sizes, num_classes)
model.summary()
```

This code demonstrates a minimal CNN suitable for text classification. The model takes tokenized input, transforms them into embeddings, performs convolution with different filter sizes, aggregates the outputs through max-pooling, and applies a dense classification layer. The filters with sizes of 3, 4 and 5, are designed to capture trigrams, 4-grams and 5-grams respectively. This example uses 'valid' padding as we do not need to pad the sequence, however, if sequence lengths differed, the 'same' padding might be appropriate to maintain the sequence length and reduce the information loss. The global max-pooling then extracts the most relevant information from the convolved features and then uses this information in a fully connected network for classification.

**Example 2: Single-layer CNN with Dropout**

```python
import deeplearningframework as dl

def build_single_layer_cnn_dropout(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_filters, filter_sizes, num_classes, dropout_rate):
    
    input_layer = dl.Input(shape=(sequence_length,))
    embedding_layer = dl.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)
    
    conv_layers = []
    for filter_size in filter_sizes:
        conv = dl.Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=filter_size, activation='relu', padding='valid')(embedding_layer)
        pool = dl.MaxPool1D(pool_size=sequence_length-filter_size+1)(conv)
        conv_layers.append(pool)
    
    merged_layers = dl.concat(conv_layers)
    flattened_layer = dl.Flatten()(merged_layers)
    dropout_layer = dl.Dropout(dropout_rate)(flattened_layer) # Adding dropout
    
    dense_layer = dl.Dense(128, activation='relu')(dropout_layer)
    output_layer = dl.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(dense_layer)
    
    model = dl.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    
    return model

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
sequence_length = 50
num_filters = 100
filter_sizes = [3, 4, 5]
num_classes = 2
dropout_rate = 0.5


model = build_single_layer_cnn_dropout(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_filters, filter_sizes, num_classes, dropout_rate)
model.summary()
```
This example expands on the basic CNN by adding a dropout layer before the dense layer. Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. The model randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training, effectively creating an ensemble of thinned networks. This forces the network to learn more robust features. This approach works well in practice as some of the connections are randomly dropped. Adding the dropout layer helps the model to generalise better by reducing the risk of overfitting in a simpler and more computationally efficient manner compared to adding additional convolutional layers.

**Example 3: Using Pre-trained Embeddings**

```python
import deeplearningframework as dl
import numpy as np

def build_single_layer_cnn_pretrained(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_filters, filter_sizes, num_classes, embedding_matrix):

    input_layer = dl.Input(shape=(sequence_length,))
    embedding_layer = dl.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, weights=[embedding_matrix], trainable=False)(input_layer)
    
    conv_layers = []
    for filter_size in filter_sizes:
      conv = dl.Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=filter_size, activation='relu', padding='valid')(embedding_layer)
      pool = dl.MaxPool1D(pool_size=sequence_length-filter_size+1)(conv)
      conv_layers.append(pool)

    merged_layers = dl.concat(conv_layers)
    flattened_layer = dl.Flatten()(merged_layers)
    
    dense_layer = dl.Dense(128, activation='relu')(flattened_layer)
    output_layer = dl.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(dense_layer)
    
    model = dl.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    
    return model

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
sequence_length = 50
num_filters = 100
filter_sizes = [3, 4, 5]
num_classes = 2

# Hypothetical pre-trained embedding matrix
embedding_matrix = np.random.rand(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

model = build_single_layer_cnn_pretrained(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_filters, filter_sizes, num_classes, embedding_matrix)
model.summary()
```

This last example uses a pretrained embedding matrix instead of a randomly initialised one.  Pretrained embeddings, such as word2vec or GloVe, are trained on a large corpus of text. Therefore, they encode a vast amount of semantic knowledge into their embeddings, therefore using pre-trained embeddings allows the model to converge faster and reach higher accuracy, especially on smaller datasets. Setting the `trainable` parameter to `False` during instantiation means the model does not update these weights during training, preserving the learned knowledge. Often for a single layer CNN, keeping these weights fixed results in reasonable accuracy without overfitting compared to the complexity and the requirement of a larger data set needed to train more layers in the network.

For further exploration and a deeper understanding of this topic, I would recommend delving into academic papers that explore the comparative performance of shallow and deep CNNs on text classification tasks. Look into resources that cover the fundamentals of CNNs, focusing specifically on their application to NLP, including aspects such as different pooling strategies and filter sizes. Additionally, studies on regularization techniques for NLP models, such as dropout, would prove beneficial. Resources that detail practical implementations using deep learning frameworks would also be very useful. Further study on Word embedding resources such as word2vec, GloVe, FastText would help in understanding their implications and use cases in text classification problems.
