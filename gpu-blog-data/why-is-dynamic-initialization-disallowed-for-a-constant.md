In C++, the constraint against dynamic initialization for `const` variables stems from the compiler's requirement for compile-time evaluation. This principle underpins the language's performance optimization and type safety guarantees. I’ve encountered this limitation extensively while working on embedded systems, where the distinction between compile-time and runtime activities is crucial for predictability.

Let’s dissect the core issue. A `const` variable, by definition, represents a value that should not be modified after its initialization. This immutability provides strong guarantees for program correctness and allows for certain optimizations. Specifically, the compiler, when encountering a `const` variable initialized with a constant expression (e.g., `const int size = 10;`), can often replace the variable's usage with the literal value during compilation. This inlining eliminates memory accesses, leading to faster execution. However, dynamic initialization, by definition, involves operations performed during runtime. If a `const` variable were allowed to be initialized dynamically, its value would be determined only during program execution. This introduces uncertainty at compile-time, preventing the compiler from making those crucial optimizations and negating the core purpose of `const` which is compile-time guarantees.

The restriction extends beyond mere optimization. It also impacts other areas, such as the ability to use a `const` variable to define array sizes, as such sizes are required to be compile-time constant expressions for proper memory allocation. If the array size were determined dynamically during runtime, the compiler would not be able to allocate the appropriate memory space at the proper point in the program's lifecycle. Such a situation would also remove some compiler checks that depend on compile time constants, potentially allowing for more complex code and increased runtime errors. Furthermore, linking static and const variable also depends on knowing the final location and values at compile time. Allowing a dynamic initialization of such variables would make them harder to link and use in other modules.

Consider these points with respect to the following code examples:

**Example 1: Compile-Time Constant**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  const int max_value = 100; // Constant Expression initialization
  int data[max_value];      // Valid: array size determined at compile time

  for (int i = 0; i < max_value; ++i) {
    data[i] = i * 2;
  }

  std::cout << "First Element: " << data[0] << ", Last Element: " << data[max_value - 1] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this snippet, `max_value` is initialized with a literal value. The compiler knows at compile time that this variable will always be equal to 100. This allows the compiler to deduce the size of the array `data` also during compilation and to generate optimized code that uses the direct value `100`. The array's size is also a requirement to allocate the proper stack space and initialize data at runtime. This demonstrates a valid use case of compile-time constants.

**Example 2: Attempting Dynamic Initialization (Error)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
  std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(nullptr)));
  const int random_value = std::rand() % 100; // Dynamic Initialization attempt (Error)

  // Error: variable 'random_value' must be initialized with a constant expression
  // int array[random_value]; // Also illegal

  std::cout << "Random Value: " << random_value << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the intent is to initialize `random_value` with the result of a runtime function `std::rand()`. This is invalid. The C++ compiler will issue an error because it cannot ascertain the value of `random_value` at compile time. The `std::rand()` function returns a value only during program execution. Consequently, this variable cannot be declared `const`. The commented out line attempting to use this value as an array size is also a compile error, as the size of an array needs to be a compile time known constant.

**Example 3: Workaround using `constexpr` (C++11 and later) or `enum` (older versions)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

constexpr int getRandomNumber() {
  // Not truly dynamic, but resolved at compile time
  return 42; // Example of a compile time known value (Could also be calculated from other compile time constants)
}

int main() {
  constexpr int compileTimeRand = getRandomNumber();
  const int constRand = compileTimeRand; // Valid, since compileTimeRand is a compile time constant
  int data[constRand];
    for (int i = 0; i < constRand; ++i) {
        data[i] = i * 3;
    }

    std::cout << "First element: " << data[0] << " Last Element: " << data[constRand -1] << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This example illustrates a more advanced approach with `constexpr`. Although it may appear to execute like a function at first, when dealing with constants like numbers and literals,  `constexpr`  forces the compiler to perform the calculation at compile-time. `constexpr` functions have the restriction to not perform runtime operations, or if they do, they are only evaluated at runtime in non constant expressions. When used in constant expressions though, like in the example above, it will ensure that the value of `compileTimeRand` is calculated at compile-time. This mechanism allows `constRand` to be valid, as its initializer is known at compile-time. It does not work if `getRandomNumber` reads a value that isn't known at compile time (e.g. a user input), as the compiler won't be able to evaluate this function in that case.  `enum` can achieve similar behavior for integer constants in older C++ versions. This demonstrates how we can initialize compile time const, which can then be used for other const declarations.

In summary, the prohibition on dynamic initialization for `const` variables serves as a core design principle in C++. It strengthens type safety and enables performance optimizations by ensuring that these variables are compile-time constants. Without this restriction, the efficiency of C++ programs would be compromised, and the reliability of `const` guarantees would be undermined. Instead, we have to use language features like `constexpr` which offer an option to still define a compile time constant using what may appear to be a function, yet the compiler will use that function in the compile time process, resulting in a valid use of const in combination with the use of functions.

For further study, I’d recommend focusing on the following:

1.  **"Effective C++" by Scott Meyers**: This provides invaluable insights into C++'s design and principles, including effective use of const correctness and const vs constexpr.
2.  **The C++ Standard Document:** Accessing the official standard documentation directly can clarify nuanced aspects of the language, such as the precise definition of constant expressions.
3.  **"C++ Templates: The Complete Guide" by David Vandevoorde, Nicolai M. Josuttis, and Douglas Gregor:** It addresses the connection between compile time calculation and templates, allowing more complex compile time calculations.

Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind C++ design choices will help you to write more efficient, safer, and more robust applications. This principle of compile-time guarantees for `const` variables is one of the fundamental cornerstones.
