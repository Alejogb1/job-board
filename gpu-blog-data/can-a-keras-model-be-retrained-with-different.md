Yes, a Keras model can be retrained with different target data, provided certain conditions are met.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects at a previous firm underscored the importance of understanding the implications of such retraining, particularly regarding model architecture and the compatibility of new target data with the existing feature extraction capabilities.  The key lies in understanding that retraining fundamentally modifies the model's learned mappings between input features and outputs.  Simply changing the target data without careful consideration can lead to suboptimal performance, or even catastrophic forgetting.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Retraining with Different Target Data:**

Retraining involves adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss function calculated on the new target data.  This process leverages the pre-existing architecture, initialized weights, and potentially some degree of learned feature representations from the original training.  However, the extent to which these pre-existing elements contribute depends critically on several factors:

* **Similarity between original and new target data:** If the new target data represents a closely related task (e.g., classifying slightly different subcategories within the same overarching category), transfer learning effects can be significant, leading to faster convergence and potentially better generalization.  Conversely, substantial differences might necessitate more extensive retraining, potentially requiring adjustments to the model architecture or hyperparameters.

* **Model Architecture:**  Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in image classification, exhibit a hierarchical structure.  Early layers often learn general features (edges, textures), while later layers learn more specific features related to the original task. Retraining with drastically different target data might necessitate modifying the architecture, especially the output layer. This is because the number of output neurons needs to correspond to the number of classes in the new target data.  Adding or removing layers might also be necessary depending on the complexity of the new task.

* **Training parameters:** The choice of optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques significantly influences the retraining process.  Often, a lower learning rate than the initial training is preferred to fine-tune the existing weights rather than drastically altering them.  This prevents catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets the knowledge learned from the previous task.

* **Data preprocessing:** Consistency in preprocessing between the original and new datasets is crucial. Any discrepancies in scaling, normalization, or augmentation techniques can adversely affect retraining performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize the `Sequential` model in Keras for simplicity.  Adapting them to more complex architectures like `Model` subclasses is straightforward, demanding only changes to the model definition and potentially the layer-specific training configurations.


**Example 1:  Simple Retraining with Similar Target Data (Binary Classification)**

This example demonstrates retraining a model initially trained to classify cats versus dogs, to now classify kittens versus puppies.  Assuming a pre-trained model `model` exists:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assuming 'model' is a pre-trained Keras Sequential model
# Compile the model with a new loss function and optimizer for retraining
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4),  # Lower learning rate
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and preprocess the new dataset (kittens and puppies)
new_train_data, new_train_labels = load_and_preprocess_data("kittens_puppies_train")
new_test_data, new_test_labels = load_and_preprocess_data("kittens_puppies_test")

# Retrain the model
model.fit(new_train_data, new_train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(new_test_data, new_test_labels))

# Evaluate the model's performance on the new data
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(new_test_data, new_test_labels)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Commentary:  A lower learning rate is used to prevent drastic changes to the weights learned during the original cat/dog classification.  The `binary_crossentropy` loss function is appropriate for the binary classification task.


**Example 2:  Retraining with Different Number of Output Classes**

This example shows how to retrain a model initially designed for multi-class image classification (e.g., classifying different types of flowers) for a new multi-class task with a different number of classes (e.g., classifying different types of fruits).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assuming 'model' is a pre-trained Keras Sequential model
# Remove the existing output layer
model = keras.models.Sequential(model.layers[:-1]) #Removes the last layer

# Add a new output layer with the appropriate number of neurons
num_fruit_classes = 5  # Example: 5 types of fruits
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(num_fruit_classes, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and preprocess the new dataset (fruits)
new_train_data, new_train_labels = load_and_preprocess_data("fruits_train")
new_test_data, new_test_labels = load_and_preprocess_data("fruits_test")


# Retrain the model
model.fit(new_train_data, new_train_labels, epochs=20, validation_data=(new_test_data, new_test_labels))

# Evaluate
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(new_test_data, new_test_labels)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Commentary: The existing output layer is removed, and a new one with the correct number of neurons is added.  `categorical_crossentropy` is suitable for multi-class classification.  A larger number of epochs might be necessary due to the significant task change.


**Example 3:  Handling Significant Architectural Changes**

For situations where the new task differs substantially from the original, more significant architectural modifications might be required. This example shows a scenario where adding a new convolutional layer proves beneficial.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assuming 'model' is a pre-trained Keras Sequential model
#Add a new convolutional layer before the existing ones
model.add(keras.layers.Conv2D(32,(3,3),activation='relu'))
model.add(keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)))


# Remove and add the output layer as in Example 2

#Compile and Retrain as in Example 2

```

Commentary: Adding a convolutional layer introduces additional capacity for feature extraction that might be necessary for a drastically different data type or task complexity. Remember to adjust the input shape if necessary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet: Offers a comprehensive introduction to Keras and deep learning concepts.
*  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:  Provides practical guidance on various machine learning techniques, including model retraining strategies.
*  Research papers on transfer learning and fine-tuning in deep learning: These offer a deeper understanding of the theoretical underpinnings.  Searching for papers on these topics in relevant academic databases will yield valuable resources.


Remember, successful retraining hinges on a thorough understanding of the model's architecture, the relationship between the old and new datasets, and a careful choice of hyperparameters.  Blindly retraining without consideration of these factors can lead to poor results.  Thorough experimentation and validation are essential.
