Profiling unit tests in Visual Studio 2012 presents a unique challenge due to the integrated nature of the testing framework and the limitations of the profiling tools available at that time.  My experience working on high-performance trading systems in that era highlighted the need for granular performance analysis even at the unit test level, as identifying bottlenecks early significantly reduced integration and debugging time.  Crucially, the approach isn't about using the built-in profiler directly on the test runner; rather, it necessitates a more indirect, instrumentation-based strategy.

The key here is to instrument your unit tests themselves to capture performance metrics.  This requires carefully crafting your tests to explicitly measure execution time of specific code segments within the units under test.  Visual Studio 2012â€™s built-in profiler is less suitable for this granular analysis of individual test methods; its focus is on application-wide performance rather than the fine-grained details needed for unit test profiling.  Directly profiling the test runner only yields aggregate performance data, obscuring performance characteristics of individual units.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The approach I've found most effective involves leveraging the `Stopwatch` class within the .NET Framework, along with careful test design.  Instead of relying on the Visual Studio profiler's aggregate data for the test runner, I embed timing mechanisms directly into each test method. This provides precise measurements for critical sections of the code within each unit test, pinpointing potential performance bottlenecks far more accurately.  Furthermore, this strategy allows for the creation of easily-extensible and reusable performance tracking within the testing suite.  The collected data can then be analyzed, compared across different test runs, or even integrated into a reporting system for ongoing monitoring of unit performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Timing of a Single Method:**

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyUnitTest
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod1()
    {
        Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();
        sw.Start();

        // Code to be profiled
        MyClass.MyMethod();

        sw.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine($"TestMethod1 Execution Time: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");
        Assert.IsTrue( /* your assertions */ );
    }
}
```

This example showcases the fundamental approach. The `Stopwatch` class accurately measures the time taken by `MyClass.MyMethod()`.  The output is written to the console, providing immediate feedback.  Remember to replace the placeholder assertion with your actual test assertions.  This method is straightforward and ideal for initial performance investigation.

**Example 2: Timing Multiple Methods Within a Test:**

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyUnitTest
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod2()
    {
        Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();

        sw.Start();
        MyClass.MethodA();
        sw.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine($"MethodA Execution Time: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

        sw.Reset();
        sw.Start();
        MyClass.MethodB();
        sw.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine($"MethodB Execution Time: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

        Assert.IsTrue( /* your assertions */ );
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates measuring multiple methods within a single test. The `Stopwatch` is reset and restarted for each method, providing individual execution times.  This is invaluable for identifying performance bottlenecks across multiple steps within a unit.  The console output allows for easy identification of performance discrepancies.

**Example 3:  More Sophisticated Logging and Data Aggregation:**

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MyUnitTest
{
    private List<Tuple<string, long>> _executionTimes = new List<Tuple<string, long>>();

    [TestMethod]
    public void TestMethod3()
    {
        TimeExecution("MethodC", () => MyClass.MethodC());
        TimeExecution("MethodD", () => MyClass.MethodD());

        //Log or further process _executionTimes
        foreach (var time in _executionTimes)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{time.Item1} Execution Time: {time.Item2} ms");
        }

        Assert.IsTrue( /* your assertions */ );
    }

    private void TimeExecution(string methodName, Action method)
    {
        Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();
        sw.Start();
        method();
        sw.Stop();
        _executionTimes.Add(new Tuple<string, long>(methodName, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds));
    }
}
```

This advanced example introduces a helper function `TimeExecution` for reusable timing of arbitrary methods. It leverages a list to aggregate timing data, enabling more sophisticated analysis beyond simple console output. This approach is scalable and adaptable for larger test suites where centralized logging or reporting is beneficial.  The use of `Action` delegates adds flexibility, allowing the timing of any method encapsulated as a delegate.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of performance analysis principles, I would recommend consulting books on software performance engineering and optimization.  Thorough familiarity with the .NET Framework's profiling API, including the `Stopwatch` class and associated performance counters, is crucial.  Understanding algorithm complexity and data structure efficiency is essential for informed performance tuning, and will greatly aid in interpreting the test results.  Finally, studying design patterns applicable to improving software performance is a valuable asset for writing more efficient code, thereby indirectly improving unit test performance.
