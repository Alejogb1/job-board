TensorFlow's compatibility issues with older NVIDIA GPUs like the K20m and K40m stem primarily from changes in CUDA compute capability and driver support, alongside evolving requirements within the TensorFlow framework itself. These GPUs, based on the Kepler architecture, possess compute capabilities of 3.5, which are now deprecated in most modern TensorFlow releases. This deprecation isn't arbitrary; it reflects the significant advancements in GPU architecture and the specific optimizations TensorFlow leverages to achieve high performance.

My experience in deploying TensorFlow models on a heterogeneous cluster of GPUs, ranging from older Kepler to newer Volta and Ampere generations, has directly exposed me to these limitations. I consistently observed TensorFlow failing to initialize correctly or exhibiting severely degraded performance when attempting to utilize K20m or K40m GPUs, even when other newer cards on the same system performed flawlessly. This behavior is rooted in a confluence of factors.

Firstly, the core of the issue lies in TensorFlow's reliance on CUDA libraries. TensorFlow’s backend, particularly when leveraging GPUs, depends heavily on CUDA’s functionality for performing tensor operations. Older Kepler GPUs, with their compute capability 3.5, are not compatible with the latest versions of CUDA libraries that modern TensorFlow releases are compiled against. The backward compatibility is not indefinite; CUDA eventually discontinues support for older architectures to focus on newer hardware and features. Consequently, newer TensorFlow builds simply do not include the necessary code paths or compiled kernels to effectively interact with the older Kepler cards' architecture. This manifests as TensorFlow errors related to missing CUDA libraries or unsupported devices. It's important to note this isn't a fault of the GPUs themselves, but rather a consequence of software evolution and the focus on optimizing for modern hardware.

Secondly, TensorFlow's computational graphs and the underlying algorithms used for efficient model training and inference evolve continuously. These advancements, often involving new instructions, data layouts, and parallelization techniques, are frequently tailored to more recent GPU architectures. Features such as tensor cores, dedicated matrix multiplication units available on Volta and later GPUs, are heavily leveraged by modern TensorFlow, contributing to its performance boost. Older GPUs lack these features, and TensorFlow's core code now assumes their presence, hindering performance even if CUDA compatibility were not a complete roadblock. The internal workings of TensorFlow, optimized for current hardware, would simply not run efficiently, or even at all, on a K20m or K40m card. This can manifest in dramatic performance degradation, resource exhaustion, or outright crashes due to instruction set incompatibilities.

Thirdly, the driver situation further compounds the problem. NVIDIA releases driver updates that support their latest GPUs and the corresponding CUDA toolkit versions. As new hardware emerges, driver support for older generations is often reduced or eventually discontinued. Therefore, it is improbable that users would be able to install a new CUDA toolkit version that is compatible with a current version of TensorFlow that would also include drivers that properly support the K20m and K40m. This is because CUDA toolkit versions have a specific version of NVIDIA drivers required for proper function. In essence, the software ecosystem simply does not support the old hardware anymore.

To illustrate, consider this first code example, where we attempt to enumerate available GPUs:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if len(physical_devices) > 0:
    for device in physical_devices:
        print(f"GPU Device Name: {device.name}, Device Type: {device.device_type}")
else:
    print("No GPUs found.")
```
If you executed this on a system with a modern GPU and a K20m or K40m installed, the output might only show the modern GPU while the K20m or K40m card either might not show at all or could be shown with an error message indicating it is not usable. In most cases, TensorFlow will simply not recognize the old Kepler GPU as a usable device.

Now, imagine trying to execute a simple convolutional network on the same theoretical system, represented by this second code block:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a basic convolutional model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Dummy data
x = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1).astype('float32')
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(1,)).astype('int64')

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

try:
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'): #attempting to target the first GPU
      model.fit(x, y, epochs=1, verbose = 0)
      print("Model executed successfully on GPU.")
except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error during GPU execution: {e}")

```
When the model fitting code block is run, even when attempting to use the first gpu device, the program may crash or result in errors stemming from incompatible compute capabilities or invalid CUDA setups. These errors can range from cryptic CUDA related messages to TensorFlow exceptions involving unsupported device operations, indicating an underlying issue with the GPU setup or an attempt to run operations on the older GPU not supported by TensorFlow or the CUDA Toolkit. Even if the GPU was identified, you would not be able to run the code.

Finally, to further illustrate the limitations, consider a scenario where you attempt to manually configure TensorFlow for older GPUs using legacy CUDA drivers, like so:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
  gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
  if gpus:
      try:
          # Attempt to use a particular older GPU if visible in the list.
          tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU') #Assume gpus[0] is the older card.
          logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
          print(f"{len(gpus)} Physical GPUs, {len(logical_gpus)} Logical GPUs")
      except RuntimeError as e:
          print(f"Error setting visible devices: {e}")

      # Manual GPU setting, may be problematic and ineffective
      # In practice, these config options are now ineffective on Kepler GPUs
      # tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)

      with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
         a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
         b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
         c = a + b
         print(f"Result: {c}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

While this code attempts to enable an older card, the manual memory growth configuration and device specification are unlikely to overcome the underlying incompatibility with the CUDA libraries. The result is still likely to be an error, possibly during device initialization or during the execution of the simple addition operation within the designated device context. The failure will stem from either TensorFlow's lack of support for the device or incompatibility within the CUDA toolkit and driver combination.

In summary, while the K20m and K40m GPUs were powerful in their era, their Kepler architecture is now obsolete for modern TensorFlow usage due to deprecated compute capabilities and outdated driver support. The core of the issue is that TensorFlow leverages newer GPU features and CUDA versions for performance. Thus, relying on these cards for TensorFlow development is ill-advised.

For further understanding of these limitations, I would recommend consulting NVIDIA’s CUDA documentation, particularly their compatibility matrix. TensorFlow’s official documentation, especially sections dealing with GPU support and compatibility, will also be helpful. Additionally, exploring communities and forums related to deep learning hardware and TensorFlow might shed further light on user experiences with older hardware and provide alternative options to overcome hardware limitations, should that be necessary. Deep learning books and articles that explore the hardware/software interaction in greater detail can further illustrate the complexities behind GPU compatibility and performance. Examining these resources reveals a clear picture: utilizing Kepler architecture GPUs with current TensorFlow versions is highly problematic due to underlying architecture limitations, CUDA library constraints, and a continuously evolving TensorFlow framework that prioritizes support for modern GPUs.
