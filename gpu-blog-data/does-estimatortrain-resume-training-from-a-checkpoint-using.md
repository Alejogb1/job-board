The `estimator.train()` method in TensorFlow (and similar methods in other machine learning frameworks) does *not* inherently resume training from the precise point of interruption using the last batch of data from the previous run.  My experience developing large-scale NLP models at a previous firm highlights this distinction.  We encountered scenarios where resuming training necessitated careful handling of the dataset iterator and the checkpoint's internal state.  The behavior depends on how the dataset is provided and how the checkpoint is structured.  Therefore, a complete understanding requires examining these aspects.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`estimator.train()` primarily utilizes the provided input function to feed data. This input function is responsible for iterating through your dataset.  Checkpointing, on the other hand, saves the model's weights, optimizer state, and potentially other variables (e.g., learning rate).  When resuming, the model is loaded from the checkpoint, effectively restoring its internal parameters to the state at the point of saving. However, the dataset iterator is typically *not* saved as part of the checkpoint.  This means that when training resumes, the input function begins iterating from its initial position, not from where it left off.

The implication is that even though the model's weights are restored, the very first batch processed during the resumed training will be entirely different from the last batch processed in the previous run. The subsequent batches will also differ from those processed in the previous session unless the dataset is exceptionally small or is deterministically shuffled.  To resume from the exact point, the input function needs to be designed to track its progress and restart from the last processed example.

This behavior is intentional.  Saving the iterator state would significantly bloat the checkpoint size, potentially impacting storage and loading times, particularly with large datasets.  Furthermore, it introduces complexity: iterators frequently involve shuffling or transformations that are non-deterministic, making precise restoration challenging.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Standard Behavior (No Resumption from Last Batch):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (define your model, estimator, etc.) ...

def input_fn():
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(my_data)  # my_data is your dataset
  dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).batch(32)
  return dataset

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(...)  # Your estimator

# Training run 1
estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn, steps=1000)

# Save Checkpoint (Manually, if not automatically done)
# ... (code for saving checkpoint manually if required) ...

# Training run 2 (Resuming, but not from last batch)
estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn, steps=500)
```

In this example, the second training run starts from the beginning of the `my_data`. The `shuffle` operation ensures that the batches in the second run will be different from those at the end of the first run.


**Example 2:  Custom Input Function for Partial Iteration Tracking (Approximate Resumption):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (define your model, estimator, etc.) ...

class CustomInputFunction:
    def __init__(self, data, start_index=0):
        self.data = data
        self.start_index = start_index

    def __call__(self):
        dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(self.data[self.start_index:])
        dataset = dataset.batch(32)
        return dataset


my_data = ... # Your dataset

# Training run 1
cif = CustomInputFunction(my_data)
estimator.train(input_fn=cif.__call__, steps=1000)

# Get the index of last processed item (requires manual tracking, e.g., from a counter in the input function)
last_index = 9000 # Hypothetical example

# Training run 2 (Approximate resumption)
cif = CustomInputFunction(my_data, last_index)
estimator.train(input_fn=cif.__call__, steps=500)

```

This example demonstrates a crude attempt at resuming.  It relies on external tracking of the last processed index, which is often impractical for very large datasets.  It only approximates resumption, as any shuffling or preprocessing in the dataset pipeline won't be preserved.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.data.Dataset`'s `save` and `load` (More Robust Resumption, but dataset specific):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (define your model, estimator, etc.) ...

def input_fn(filepath):
  dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(filepath) # Assuming TFRecord dataset
  dataset = dataset.map(...) # your dataset processing here
  dataset = dataset.batch(32)
  return dataset

# Training run 1
filepath = 'my_dataset.tfrecord' # save to a file
# ...create and save dataset to filepath...
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(filepath), steps=1000)

# Training run 2 (Resuming from a specific point within the dataset)
# ...Determine the offset for the next batch ...
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(filepath, offset=offset), steps=500)

```

This approach is more suitable for larger datasets.  It leverages the `tf.data` API to handle the dataset itself.  However, you still need a mechanism to correctly identify the point to resume from.  The `offset` would require careful management to correctly resume from where the previous training left off.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.estimator` and the `tf.data` API should be your primary resources.  Furthermore, studying the source code of established TensorFlow models and understanding their input function implementations will offer valuable insights.  Thoroughly examining the checkpoint format and structure through tools like TensorBoard is also vital.  Finally, advanced books on deep learning and distributed training will contain further details on efficient checkpointing strategies.
