When working with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow, understanding the type of an added layer is crucial for debugging, architecture design, and ensuring model compatibility. Specifically, the 'added layer' commonly refers to a layer added directly to a model using the `model.add()` method in the TensorFlow Keras API, or indirectly through the Functional API, where layers are linked sequentially. In both scenarios, the type we're discussing isn't a single data type like an integer or a string, but rather a TensorFlow Keras Layer object. This object encapsulates both the layer's configuration and its computational logic.

Let's break down what this means. A layer within TensorFlow Keras is essentially a building block for neural networks. It's a container that takes some input tensor, applies a defined transformation to it, and produces an output tensor. This transformation can be a convolution, a pooling operation, a non-linear activation, a matrix multiplication (as in a dense layer), and so on. The Layer object itself manages the weights, biases, and any other trainable parameters associated with its transformation. When you use `model.add(layer)`, you are not adding data; you're adding an instance of this Layer object to the model's computational graph.

The specific *type* of the added layer is a class, inheriting from the base class `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. Several pre-defined layer types are readily available in `tf.keras.layers` module. Some common examples include `Conv2D`, `Dense`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Dropout`, `BatchNormalization`, `Activation`, `Flatten`, and more. Each of these classes represents a different mathematical transformation. Thus, the type of an added layer is not a simple primitive type, it’s a specific subclass inheriting from tf.keras.layers.Layer, determining its computational function.

To demonstrate, consider three specific examples. In the first case, we might add a convolutional layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
model.add(conv_layer)

print(type(conv_layer))
```

In this code, `conv_layer` is an instance of `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`. Running this code would output `<class 'tensorflow.python.keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D'>`, confirming that the layer is an object, specifically an object belonging to the `Conv2D` class within the `convolutional` module of `tf.keras.layers`. The `32` specifies the number of filters, `(3, 3)` defines the kernel size, and the `relu` denotes the activation function. Importantly, `conv_layer` isn't just a set of these configurations; it's the full object capable of performing the convolutional operation during model training and inference. When added to `model` with `model.add()`, the computational steps of this layer are incorporated into the model's graph.

Next, let’s examine adding a dense layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1))) #Flatten before Dense
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
model.add(dense_layer)


print(type(dense_layer))
```

Here, `dense_layer` is an instance of `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, representing a fully connected layer with 10 units and a 'softmax' activation function. In the console, the output would be `<class 'tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense'>`. This shows that the added layer is a `Dense` object belonging to the `core` module of `tf.keras.layers`.  Notice I've added the `Flatten` layer before the `Dense` layer, as a `Dense` layer requires a 1D input tensor which is why I flattened the output of prior layer(s) to match the `Dense` layer's input expectations.

Finally, consider a pooling layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
pooling_layer = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
model.add(pooling_layer)

print(type(pooling_layer))
```

Here, `pooling_layer` is a `tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D` object with a pool size of (2, 2).  The console would output `<class 'tensorflow.python.keras.layers.pooling.MaxPooling2D'>`. This is another type of layer, specific to the `pooling` module within `tf.keras.layers`. This example shows that the added layers represent the logic of max-pooling. It is not just the parameters associated with the layer.

In summary, the “type” of an added layer is not a simple scalar value or a string. Instead, it's a specific Keras Layer object instance; it is not a variable holding data, rather, it is a class with a particular transformation function.  This layer object encapsulates the layer’s configuration and methods needed to perform the defined computational function. Knowing the exact type, such as `Conv2D`, `Dense`, or `MaxPooling2D`, allows you to understand its intended operation within the model's architecture and how to configure the input shape requirements of subsequent layers. Moreover, it helps in recognizing which parameters are associated with each step of the forward and backward pass through a neural network.

For further learning and practical understanding of Keras Layers, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow Keras documentation. Tutorials on convolutional neural networks, dense layers, and pooling layers would provide a clearer understanding of their practical application. Books that specifically cover practical deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras also prove beneficial. Additionally, inspecting the implementation and structure of various layer classes found in the TensorFlow source code is highly valuable for a complete understanding.
