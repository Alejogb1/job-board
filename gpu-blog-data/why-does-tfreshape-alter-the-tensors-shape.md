The fundamental reason `tf.reshape` alters a tensor's shape in TensorFlow lies in its core function: rearranging the existing elements of a tensor into a new configuration without changing the underlying data.  It's crucial to understand that `tf.reshape` doesn't modify the tensor's data; it merely provides a new *view* of the same data organized differently.  In my experience debugging large-scale TensorFlow models, overlooking this subtle point has often led to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-trace errors.  The operation inherently reinterprets the memory layout of the tensor, presenting it with a distinct shape.

Let's clarify this with a clear explanation.  A tensor, at its heart, is a multi-dimensional array.  Its shape is a tuple describing the dimensions (e.g., `(2, 3)` represents a 2x3 matrix).  The data itself, however, is stored contiguously in memory.  `tf.reshape` takes this contiguous block of memory and interprets it according to the new shape you specify.  If the new shape is compatible with the total number of elements in the original tensor, the operation succeeds. Otherwise, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating an incompatibility between the original size and the target shape.  This compatibility check is critical and forms the basis of `tf.reshape`'s behavior.

In essence, the apparent "alteration" is not a modification of the data itself but a change in how that data is accessed and presented. This is different from operations that modify the tensor's values, such as element-wise addition or matrix multiplication. These alter the underlying data; `tf.reshape` only changes the perspective.  This distinction is important for understanding memory management and potential performance implications.


Now, let's illustrate this with code examples.  I've encountered scenarios similar to these numerous times while building recommender systems and processing image data.

**Example 1: Simple Reshaping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [3, 2])

print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)
print("Reshaped tensor:\n", reshaped_tensor)
```

This example shows a simple reshaping of a 2x3 matrix into a 3x2 matrix. The data (1 to 6) remains the same; only the arrangement changes.  Observe that the elements are rearranged in row-major order (C-style ordering, which is TensorFlow's default).  The underlying data in memory is unchanged; only the interpretation is altered.


**Example 2: Reshaping with -1**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [1, -1])

print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)
print("Reshaped tensor:\n", reshaped_tensor)
```

This showcases the use of `-1` as a placeholder in the `shape` argument. `-1` indicates that TensorFlow should automatically infer that dimension based on the total number of elements and the other specified dimensions. Here, it flattens the 2x3 matrix into a 1x6 matrix.  This is extremely useful when you know the desired number of dimensions but not the exact size of one or more of them.  Using `-1` elegantly handles this scenario, reducing manual calculation.


**Example 3:  Reshape and Broadcasting Compatibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor_b = tf.constant([5, 6])

# Incorrect Reshape leading to broadcasting error
try:
    reshaped_tensor_a = tf.reshape(tensor_a, [1, 4])
    result = reshaped_tensor_a + tensor_b
    print(result)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

#Correct Reshape for Broadcasting
reshaped_tensor_a = tf.reshape(tensor_a,[2,2])
result = reshaped_tensor_a + tensor_b
print(result)

```
This example highlights a crucial point concerning broadcasting and reshape.  In the first attempt at reshaping, while the total elements match, attempting to add the reshaped `tensor_a` (shape [1,4]) to `tensor_b` (shape [2]) leads to a broadcasting error.  TensorFlow's broadcasting rules don't allow it to expand a vector with shape [2] to match [1,4]. The second attempt correctly reshapes tensor_a to [2,2], allowing successful element-wise addition with broadcasting. This illustrates how `tf.reshape` impacts compatibility with other tensor operations.

These examples demonstrate that `tf.reshape` functions by re-interpreting the existing data in memory, creating a new view without copying or altering the original data.  The potential for errors lies in ensuring the new shape is compatible with the total number of elements and understanding how reshaping interacts with other TensorFlow operations, especially those reliant on broadcasting.

To further solidify your understanding, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation's section on tensor manipulation.  Additionally, a deep dive into linear algebra fundamentals will provide valuable context regarding matrix operations and memory layouts.  Finally, practicing with various reshaping scenarios and carefully observing the output will strengthen your grasp of this fundamental operation.  Careful consideration of memory layout and broadcasting rules will make you adept at harnessing the power of `tf.reshape` effectively.
