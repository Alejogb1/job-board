No, TensorFlow does not exclusively rely on one-hot encoding for representing labels in machine learning tasks. While it’s a frequently employed technique, particularly in multi-class classification scenarios, TensorFlow provides extensive support for various label encoding methods, adapting to the specifics of the learning problem and data structure. I've encountered situations where alternative representations proved significantly more efficient or necessary, based on project demands.

One-hot encoding, in its core function, transforms categorical labels into a binary vector where only one element is '1' (hot) corresponding to the category, while all other elements are '0'. This approach is beneficial because it eliminates the ordinal relationship that could be misinterpreted by algorithms when dealing with integer-encoded categorical labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2 where these numbers might inadvertently be interpreted as a progression). TensorFlow often interfaces with these encoded labels internally via layers and functions optimized for one-hot vectors.

However, problems arise in various scenarios. Consider multi-label classification, where a single input sample can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. Applying a one-hot encoding strategy in such circumstances would require creating a one-hot vector for each label, resulting in potentially many sparse vectors. This introduces computational inefficiencies. Integer-encoded labels, or even custom-encoded labels, may be preferable, allowing you to manipulate label data efficiently in your custom processing logic. Another area is when dealing with sequential data using recurrent neural networks. Labels may represent tokens or classes in a sequence that do not necessarily lend themselves well to one-hot encoding.

Furthermore, the sheer dimensionality of one-hot encoded vectors in datasets with a high cardinality for labels can become computationally costly, leading to performance bottlenecks. Imagine a dataset of products each associated with potentially thousands of unique categories. The one-hot vectors become very long and sparse. In these cases, utilizing integer labels or alternative encoding techniques with techniques such as word embeddings or feature hashing that are more appropriate can be a significant improvement.

TensorFlow’s design embraces such variations in representation, primarily through its layers such as `tf.keras.layers.Dense` (which consumes integers), `tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` (which handles integer labels without one-hot encoding) and through functions that allow custom label processing within datasets.

Now, let's consider examples where I’ve leveraged label encodings other than one-hot in my projects:

**Example 1: Multi-Label Classification with Integer Labels**

In a project where I was tasked with classifying images into multiple overlapping categories (e.g., an image could be tagged with 'dog' and 'grass' simultaneously), one-hot encoding became computationally inefficient. I opted for a multi-label approach using integers. Suppose the number of classes is 5, and an image belongs to classes 1 and 3. I would encode it as [1, 3] (or, [0,1,0,1,0] when creating the corresponding one-hot version). The following code demonstrates training a model with integer labels and applying custom handling inside the dataset loading. This approach is optimized for scenarios like this where there can be multiple correct labels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data: each sample has multiple labels represented as a list of integers
labels = [[0, 2], [1, 3], [0], [2, 4], [1], [0,1,2,3,4]]
features = np.random.rand(len(labels), 32)

def create_label_vector(labels, num_classes=5):
  label_matrix = np.zeros((len(labels),num_classes))
  for i, current_labels in enumerate(labels):
      for label in current_labels:
          label_matrix[i][label] = 1
  return label_matrix

encoded_labels = create_label_vector(labels)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, encoded_labels))

dataset = dataset.batch(2)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='sigmoid')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

for features_batch, labels_batch in dataset:
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(features_batch)
      loss = loss_fn(labels_batch, predictions)

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

Here, `create_label_vector` transforms the integer-based multi-labels to a one-hot vector to be used in Binary Cross Entropy, although, you could write a custom loss function to avoid this. This exemplifies how, though the labels were integers, TensorFlow can use them to compute loss.

**Example 2: Sequence Labeling with Integer Labels**

In a natural language processing task involving part-of-speech tagging, I used a recurrent neural network where each word in a sequence is associated with an integer representing a particular tag. Unlike one-hot encoding each word, here, I preserved the integer encoding, leveraging an embedding layer within the network. In this case, using one-hot encoding would have required creating a long vector for each word and would be a computational waste, since an embedding layer will create a dense representation in any case.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample Data: Each sequence is a list of integers representing words, the labels also integers
sequences = [[1, 4, 2, 3, 0], [2, 0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2]]
labels = [[0, 1, 2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2]]

max_sequence_length = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)

sequences_padded = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(
    sequences, maxlen=max_sequence_length, padding='post')
labels_padded = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(
    labels, maxlen=max_sequence_length, padding='post' )

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((sequences_padded, labels_padded))
dataset = dataset.batch(2)

vocab_size = 5
embedding_dim = 16
num_tags = 3

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_sequence_length),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_tags)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

for sequences_batch, labels_batch in dataset:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(sequences_batch)
        loss = loss_fn(labels_batch, predictions)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

`tf.keras.layers.Embedding` accepts integer inputs and the `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss handles them as well, demonstrating that one-hot encoding is not a mandatory step. This example shows how integer labels can be handled by the network.

**Example 3: Custom Label Encoding for Complex Structures**

In a project where the labels represented a hierarchical classification system, one-hot encoding was unsuitable due to the complex relationships within categories. I developed custom data preprocessing that encoded label data into a structured vector reflecting the hierarchy, using integer indexes to maintain the relation. This allowed us to exploit the hierarchical nature of the classes. We created a custom data loading pipeline that processed this encoding scheme and passed it into a custom model that accounted for the encoding during training and evaluation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Define a dummy hierarchical label system (simplified)
hierarchy = {
    "A": 0,
    "A.1": 1,
    "A.2": 2,
    "B": 3,
    "B.1": 4,
    "B.2": 5
}

# Sample labels
labels = ["A", "A.1", "A.2", "B", "B.1", "B.2"]
features = np.random.rand(len(labels), 32)

def encode_hierarchy(labels, hierarchy):
  encoded_labels = []
  for label in labels:
      encoded_labels.append(hierarchy[label])
  return np.array(encoded_labels)


encoded_labels = encode_hierarchy(labels, hierarchy)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, encoded_labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(2)

num_classes = len(hierarchy)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes) # outputs logits
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

for features_batch, labels_batch in dataset:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(features_batch)
        loss = loss_fn(labels_batch, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


```

In this simplified example, `encode_hierarchy` maps the hierarchical text label to a integer encoding which can be used by TensorFlow in a typical manner. The flexibility of TensorFlow allowed us to implement a custom pre-processing scheme that handled the hierarchy naturally during training.

These examples showcase that TensorFlow does not confine itself to one-hot encoding for labels, but rather supports varied label encoding methods to cater to the diverse needs of machine learning problems. The key advantage is that TensorFlow provides tools that enable developers to efficiently represent and process data according to the constraints of the given problem.

To gain a deeper understanding of label handling in TensorFlow, I recommend exploring the following resources: the official TensorFlow documentation (particularly the API documentation for `tf.data`, `tf.keras.layers`, and `tf.keras.losses`), as well as tutorials on multi-label classification and sequence modeling. There are also many educational videos available online that are not affiliated with TensorFlow itself that discuss these concepts in a practical manner, which can be extremely helpful.
