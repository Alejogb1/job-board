Activation maps, when extracted via PyTorch hooks, often exhibit non-negativity because the intermediate feature values they represent have undergone ReLU or similar activation functions. These functions, fundamental components of deep neural network architectures, inherently introduce this constraint. I encountered this firsthand while developing a custom model introspection tool for a project involving medical image analysis. Initially, the predominantly positive activations puzzled me; it didn't seem immediately intuitive.

The core reason stems from the fundamental design of many commonly used activation functions. Consider the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), expressed mathematically as f(x) = max(0, x). Any input value *x* which is negative is truncated to zero, resulting in a zero output. Conversely, if *x* is positive, it is passed through unchanged. This means any ReLU layer within the network guarantees that the output it produces will never be negative. As deep learning models often cascade layers sequentially, the output of one ReLU layer will become the input for the next layer, where it may undergo another ReLU or similar activation. This effect propagates throughout the network, leading to a positive bias in the activations.

Hooks in PyTorch function by intercepting the forward pass of the network. Specifically, these hooks capture the outputs of layers *after* they've been processed by their respective activation functions. If the output of a layer passed through ReLU, the hook will only intercept the positive portions (or zeros). The same concept applies to other activation functions that limit negative values, such as the softplus function (a smooth approximation to ReLU). In the case of softplus, while it does output strictly positive numbers for all inputs, it still acts as an effective floor for output values, resulting in small positive values being more common than negative values would be in a linear system.

This is not an inherent limitation of hooks themselves; rather, it's a consequence of the activations that precede the hook. To see negative values, one would need to insert hooks before these nonlinearities (if the linear transformation was of interest). That's why a network built without ReLU or similar activation layers, instead relying solely on linear transformations, would not exhibit this positive bias. However, these linear-only models are generally less capable of modelling complex, non-linear functions common in real-world datasets.

To illustrate this, consider these code examples:

**Example 1: ReLU Network**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ReLUModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(20, 5)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu1(self.linear1(x))
        x = self.relu2(self.linear2(x))
        return x

model = ReLUModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
activation_map = None

def hook_fn(module, input, output):
  global activation_map
  activation_map = output.detach()

hook = model.relu2.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)

model(input_tensor)
hook.remove()
print("Minimum activation value:", torch.min(activation_map).item())
```
In this example, we create a simple neural network with two linear layers followed by two ReLU activations. We then attach a hook to the second ReLU layer and extract the activation map. The resulting output will always have a minimum value of 0, or very close to 0 (due to floating-point precision), because ReLU prevents negative outputs from being passed further through the network.

**Example 2: Linear Network (No ReLU)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LinearModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(20, 5)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = LinearModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
activation_map = None

def hook_fn(module, input, output):
  global activation_map
  activation_map = output.detach()

hook = model.linear2.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)

model(input_tensor)
hook.remove()
print("Minimum activation value:", torch.min(activation_map).item())
```
This example removes the ReLU activations. The extracted activation map from the second linear layer will now have both positive and negative values. This shows how the activation functions influence the nature of the captured feature maps, and it shows that hooks are impartial to positivity and negativity, just passively recording the output they're told to.

**Example 3: ReLU Network, Hook Before ReLU**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ReLUModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(20, 5)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu1(self.linear1(x))
        x = self.relu2(self.linear2(x))
        return x

model = ReLUModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
activation_map = None

def hook_fn(module, input, output):
  global activation_map
  activation_map = output.detach()

hook = model.linear2.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)

model(input_tensor)
hook.remove()
print("Minimum activation value:", torch.min(activation_map).item())
```
Here we have the ReLU network, but the hook is now placed on the *linear2* layer before *relu2*, showing negative values in the output. This reinforces the observation that it is not the hook itself that causes non-negativity.

Understanding this behavior is critical when employing hooks for model analysis, visualization, or debugging. When interpreting activation maps, we need to consider the upstream activation functions to understand the context of the captured values. A positively biased activation map does not necessarily indicate a lack of information or a poorly designed network, but a consequence of architectural choices.

For further exploration of this topic, I would recommend delving into literature on activation functions and their impact on network behavior. Specifically, resources detailing the theoretical underpinnings of ReLU, leaky ReLU, ELU, and other common activation functions are extremely beneficial. Researching topics such as gradient vanishing or exploding gradient can also further illuminate why these functions were developed and their particular qualities, which in turn affects the final activation maps. Furthermore, detailed study of practical examples demonstrating different hook strategies, particularly placing hooks before and after non-linear layers in several different architectures, aids in the holistic understanding of these concepts. Understanding the internal processes of deep learning frameworks is fundamental to becoming a proficient practitioner.
