The discrepancy between a custom TensorFlow gradient and a Jacobian-based automatic differentiation implementation often stems from subtle differences in how the underlying computation graphs are represented and traversed during the backpropagation process.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale neural network training pipelines reveals that this is frequently caused by implicit assumptions about numerical stability and the handling of non-differentiable points.  While TensorFlow's automatic differentiation generally leverages efficient Jacobian-vector products, a custom gradient might introduce approximations or explicit branching logic that deviates from this streamlined approach.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` utilizes automatic differentiation, primarily relying on reverse-mode differentiation (backpropagation).  For elementary operations, it uses pre-defined gradients.  For more complex operations, including custom functions, it requires the user to provide a `gradient` function.  The Jacobian, a matrix of all partial derivatives of a vector-valued function, represents the complete derivative information.  However, directly computing and using the entire Jacobian is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional spaces.

Instead, TensorFlow's automatic differentiation cleverly exploits the fact that we generally only need the Jacobian-vector product (Jvp), where the vector is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the custom operation. This Jvp can be computed more efficiently through a process that effectively reverses the forward pass, calculating gradients as it goes.  A custom gradient, on the other hand, might calculate the gradient differently.  This could be due to several reasons:

* **Approximation:** The custom gradient might employ numerical approximations, particularly when dealing with non-differentiable or numerically unstable functions.  For instance, a custom gradient might use finite differences, which introduces inherent error.  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation, in contrast, aims for a more exact calculation where possible.
* **Explicit Handling of Branching:** If the custom operation contains control flow statements (conditional logic, loops), the custom gradient needs to explicitly account for the branching behavior during backpropagation.  Automatic differentiation handles this implicitly but might choose a more numerically stable path.
* **Ignoring Higher-Order Derivatives:**  A custom gradient might simplify the calculation by neglecting higher-order derivative terms, especially if the function is assumed to be locally linear or the impact of higher-order terms is deemed negligible.  This simplification, however, can lead to discrepancies with the more comprehensive approach of automatic differentiation.
* **Inconsistent Data Types or Shapes:**  A mismatch in data types (e.g., floating-point precision) or tensor shapes between the forward and backward passes of a custom gradient can lead to unexpected behavior and deviations from the Jacobian-based approach.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Custom Gradient with Approximation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_op(x):
  y = tf.math.sin(x)
  def grad(dy):
    # Approximates derivative using finite differences
    dx = (tf.math.sin(x + 0.001) - tf.math.sin(x)) / 0.001
    return dy * dx
  return y, grad

x = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float64)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = my_op(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Custom Gradient: {dy_dx.numpy()}") #Approximation
print(f"Analytical Gradient (Cosine): {tf.cos(x).numpy()}") #True value

```
This example demonstrates a custom gradient that uses finite differences to approximate the derivative of `sin(x)`. The resulting gradient will be close to the analytical derivative (cosine) but will contain approximation error.

**Example 2: Custom Gradient with Explicit Branching**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def branched_op(x):
  y = tf.cond(x > 0, lambda: x**2, lambda: x) #Branching behaviour

  def grad(dy):
    return tf.cond(x > 0, lambda: 2 * x * dy, lambda: dy) #Explicit gradient calculation for branches

  return y, grad

x = tf.constant(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = branched_op(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Custom Gradient: {dy_dx.numpy()}") # Correct gradient for the branch.
x = tf.constant(-2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = branched_op(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y,x)
print(f"Custom Gradient: {dy_dx.numpy()}") # Correct gradient for the branch.
```
This example highlights the need for explicit gradient calculation in the presence of branching.  The custom gradient correctly handles both branches of the conditional statement.  Omitting the `grad` function would lead to an error as TensorFlow cannot automatically compute the gradient in this situation.

**Example 3:  Inconsistent Data Types**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def type_mismatch_op(x):
  y = tf.cast(x, dtype=tf.float32) * 2.0  # Cast to float32

  def grad(dy):
    return tf.cast(dy, dtype=tf.float64) * 2.0 # Gradient calculation in float64

  return y, grad

x = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float64)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = type_mismatch_op(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Custom Gradient: {dy_dx.numpy()}") # Potential numerical error due to type mismatch
```

This demonstrates a potential source of error. The forward pass casts `x` to `tf.float32`, but the gradient calculation is in `tf.float64`, leading to potential numerical inconsistencies and discrepancies from the Jacobian-based result.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow documentation on automatic differentiation and custom gradients.
* A comprehensive textbook on numerical optimization and automatic differentiation.
* Research papers on efficient Jacobian-vector product computations.


In conclusion, the divergence between a custom TensorFlow gradient and the Jacobian-based automatic differentiation usually arises from approximations, explicit handling of control flow, higher-order derivative simplification, or inconsistencies in data types or shapes within the custom gradient function.  Carefully analyzing these aspects during the design and implementation of custom gradients is crucial for ensuring accuracy and numerical stability in TensorFlow-based models.  Rigorous testing and comparison against the results of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation are essential for verifying the correctness of custom gradients.
