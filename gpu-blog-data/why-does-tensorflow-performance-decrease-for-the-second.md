The performance degradation observed in TensorFlow's second calculation often stems from a failure to adequately manage computational graph execution and resource allocation.  My experience optimizing large-scale TensorFlow models has shown that while the first run often benefits from just-in-time compilation and eager execution optimizations, subsequent runs can suffer if these optimizations aren't properly maintained or if resource contention becomes a significant bottleneck.  This isn't inherently a bug in TensorFlow; rather, it's a consequence of its design and the implicit assumptions made during execution.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow, especially in its graph mode (less prevalent now with the rise of eager execution, but still relevant in certain production scenarios), constructs a computational graph before execution.  The first run necessitates the construction of this graph, the compilation of operations into optimized kernels, and the allocation of necessary resources (GPU memory, CPU threads, etc.). This initial overhead contributes significantly to the execution time.  However, subsequent runs ideally benefit from this pre-built graph. The execution time should decrease, or at least remain relatively consistent.

However, several factors can lead to performance degradation:

* **Resource Fragmentation:**  Repeated execution, especially with dynamically sized tensors, can lead to memory fragmentation on the GPU.  This means available memory becomes scattered, hindering efficient allocation for subsequent operations.  The GPU scheduler may become less efficient in placing tasks, leading to increased latency.

* **Caching Inefficiencies:**  TensorFlow's caching mechanisms, while highly optimized, aren't perfect.  If the input data or the model's internal state changes subtly between runs, even if seemingly insignificant, the cache might miss, leading to recomputation and slower execution.

* **Operator Fusion Limitations:**  TensorFlow's graph optimization processes attempt to fuse multiple operations into single, more efficient kernels. However, this fusion may not always be possible due to the structure of the graph or the specific operations involved. A change in the input data, however minor, could disrupt optimized fusion patterns, resulting in a less efficient execution graph.

* **Session Management:** In graph mode, proper session management is crucial.  Failure to close a TensorFlow session after each run can lead to resource leaks and impede performance in subsequent runs.

* **Eager Execution Overhead:** Even with eager execution, the repeated construction and execution of small computational subgraphs can accumulate overhead, especially if the code isn't written with performance in mind.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate scenarios where performance degradation can occur and how to mitigate them.

**Example 1: Resource Fragmentation (Graph Mode)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1000]) # Dynamic size causes fragmentation
    b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1000, 1000])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    a_data = tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])
    b_data = tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])

    start_time = time.time()
    sess.run(c, feed_dict={a: a_data, b: b_data})
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"First run time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

    a_data = tf.random.normal([2000, 1000]) #Different size
    start_time = time.time()
    sess.run(c, feed_dict={a: a_data, b: b_data})
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Second run time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
    sess.close() # crucial for resource cleanup
```
**Commentary:** The dynamic shape of placeholder `a` contributes to memory fragmentation. The second run, with a different input size, might experience slower execution because of the need to reallocate and potentially reorganize GPU memory.


**Example 2:  Caching Inefficiencies (Eager Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import numpy as np

a = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)

start_time = time.time()
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
c.numpy() # Force computation and caching
end_time = time.time()
print(f"First run time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")


a.assign(np.random.rand(1000,1000)) # Subtle change, cache miss potential
start_time = time.time()
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
c.numpy()
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Second run time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

**Commentary:** Even with eager execution, subtle changes in `a` can impact caching. While TensorFlow's eager execution optimizes many operations, it doesn't eliminate caching considerations entirely. A slight modification to the input data might invalidate cached computations.


**Example 3: Session Management (Graph Mode)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)

sess = tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) # Note: Using legacy session for demonstration
start_time = time.time()
sess.run(c)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"First run time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

start_time = time.time()
sess.run(c)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Second run time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
# sess.close() # deliberately omitted to demonstrate the problem
```
**Commentary:**  The second run may not exhibit significant performance degradation, but leaving the session open consumes resources.  In a larger application, this resource leak could lead to performance issues over time, impacting subsequent unrelated operations.  Remember to always close your sessions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on performance optimization, particularly sections on graph optimization, memory management, and GPU utilization.  Further, explore resources detailing  strategies for efficient tensor manipulation and efficient data pre-processing, which plays a key role in reducing overhead.  Understanding the intricacies of the TensorFlow execution engine is also vital. Finally, consult advanced guides on profiling TensorFlow applications to identify performance bottlenecks precisely.
