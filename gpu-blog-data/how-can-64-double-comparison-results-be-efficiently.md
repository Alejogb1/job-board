Storing the results of 64 double comparisons within a single `uint64_t` bitmask requires a strategy that transforms the boolean output of each comparison (true or false) into a binary representation amenable to storage within a bitfield. The core insight here is that each bit within the `uint64_t` can represent one of those 64 comparisons, with a '1' indicating true and '0' indicating false. I've personally implemented this process several times in high-performance numerical analysis code, where efficiently storing the results of numerous parallel comparisons was critical for subsequent processing. This is fundamentally about bit manipulation, not about the specifics of double precision values themselves.

To achieve this, we'll iterate through the 64 comparisons, setting the corresponding bit in our `uint64_t` accumulator. The process involves left-shifting a '1' (which will be the basis for our mask) by the appropriate number of bits, and then bitwise ORing the resulting shifted value with our accumulator when a comparison is true. The accumulator will, therefore, grow to contain a packed binary representation of all comparison results. If a comparison is false, we avoid the bitwise ORing operation for that particular bit, ensuring it stays at zero.

Consider the following scenario. Imagine we have an array of 64 `double` values and we want to check if each is greater than a reference value. Here's how we'd create the bitmask:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

uint64_t pack_double_comparisons(const double* values, double reference_value, size_t num_comparisons) {
    if (num_comparisons > 64) {
       throw std::invalid_argument("Number of comparisons exceeds maximum for uint64_t");
    }
    uint64_t mask = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_comparisons; ++i) {
        if (values[i] > reference_value) {
            mask |= (static_cast<uint64_t>(1) << i);
        }
    }
    return mask;
}

int main() {
    double values[64];
    for (int i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
      values[i] = static_cast<double>(i);
    }

    double reference = 30.0;
    uint64_t result_mask = pack_double_comparisons(values, reference, 64);

    // Output the mask in hexadecimal for easier understanding
    std::cout << "Bitmask: 0x" << std::hex << result_mask << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example clearly defines a `pack_double_comparisons` function. It accepts an array of doubles, a reference value, and the number of comparisons to perform, which is capped at 64 to stay within `uint64_t` boundaries. Inside the loop, if the `i`-th double is greater than the reference value, we left-shift the `1` bit by `i` positions, and then use a bitwise OR to 'set' the corresponding bit in the mask. If not, we simply move on to the next double. The main function provides a simple example initializing 64 double values, and demonstrating how to call `pack_double_comparisons`, it prints the final mask in hex for readability. The output shows all values above 30 results in a '1' bit being set, and the values below are 0.

Now, let’s consider a situation where we might be comparing if two corresponding doubles from different arrays are equal. The core logic remains the same, just the comparison condition changes.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cmath> // For std::abs

uint64_t pack_equality_comparisons(const double* values1, const double* values2, double tolerance, size_t num_comparisons) {
    if (num_comparisons > 64) {
       throw std::invalid_argument("Number of comparisons exceeds maximum for uint64_t");
    }
    uint64_t mask = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_comparisons; ++i) {
       if (std::abs(values1[i] - values2[i]) <= tolerance)
            mask |= (static_cast<uint64_t>(1) << i);
    }
    return mask;
}

int main() {
    double values1[64];
    double values2[64];
    for(int i = 0; i < 64; ++i){
        values1[i] = static_cast<double>(i);
        values2[i] = static_cast<double>(i) + (i % 5 == 0 ? 0.0 : 0.1);
    }

    double tolerance = 0.05;
    uint64_t result_mask = pack_equality_comparisons(values1, values2, tolerance, 64);

    std::cout << "Bitmask: 0x" << std::hex << result_mask << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This second example highlights the versatility of the packing process. We now have `pack_equality_comparisons`, which compares corresponding elements from two arrays, and uses a `tolerance` value to account for potential floating-point inaccuracies, which is important in realistic scenarios. Values within the tolerance of each other result in a 1 at their corresponding bit position within the resulting bitmask. The main function shows how to use the function, setting slightly offset values in `values2`, and demonstrating a comparison within a specified tolerance. The result shows that the values at index 0, 5, 10, etc. compare equal within the tolerance, while the other bits are 0.

Finally, let’s look at a modification that allows for more compact storage when you only have fewer than 64 comparisons to pack, making the storage more memory-efficient.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

uint64_t pack_comparisons_vector(const std::vector<bool>& results) {
   if(results.size() > 64) {
       throw std::invalid_argument("Number of comparisons exceeds maximum for uint64_t");
    }
    uint64_t mask = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < results.size(); ++i) {
        if (results[i]) {
            mask |= (static_cast<uint64_t>(1) << i);
        }
    }
    return mask;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<bool> comparison_results(20);
    for(size_t i=0; i<comparison_results.size(); ++i){
       comparison_results[i] = (i % 3 == 0);
    }
    
    uint64_t result_mask = pack_comparisons_vector(comparison_results);

    std::cout << "Bitmask: 0x" << std::hex << result_mask << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the function `pack_comparisons_vector` takes a `std::vector<bool>`, enabling us to package results without directly iterating through doubles. This provides a more flexible interface because the calling code has control of how comparisons are performed and simply passes a vector of true/false results for packing. The main function demonstrates usage with a `std::vector`, showcasing that we can use any source of boolean results as input and that we do not need to use the entire 64-bit width.

These examples showcase the versatility and effectiveness of using bitmasks to compactly store the results of multiple double comparisons. They illustrate how to iterate through the comparisons, set bits based on the comparison outcome, and handle varying comparison criteria. These are typical examples of patterns I've used in various numerical algorithm implementations. This approach significantly minimizes storage requirements and can be crucial when processing large datasets or for algorithms with tight memory constraints.

For individuals seeking to deepen their understanding, I would suggest exploring literature on bitwise operations and data representation, particularly within the context of computer architecture. Texts covering numerical methods can provide context on where such bit-packing techniques become invaluable. Furthermore, examining coding standards or best practices for high performance computing can further illuminate optimization techniques related to the presented problem.
