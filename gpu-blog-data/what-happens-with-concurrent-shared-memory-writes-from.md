The fundamental behavior of concurrent shared memory writes from multiple GPU threads within the same warp is dictated by the hardware's conflict resolution mechanism.  Specifically, it’s not a truly concurrent operation in the sense of simultaneous execution; instead, it’s serialized at the hardware level, leading to a deterministic, albeit potentially non-intuitive, outcome.  My experience optimizing CUDA kernels for high-performance computing extensively involved grappling with this precise issue, leading to a deep understanding of its implications.

**1.  Explanation of Shared Memory Write Conflict Resolution**

Shared memory, a fast on-chip memory accessible by all threads within a warp, presents a unique challenge when multiple threads attempt simultaneous writes to the same memory location.  Unlike global memory, which offers atomics for controlled concurrent access, shared memory in most GPU architectures employs a prioritized write mechanism.  This mechanism isn’t explicitly documented as a specific algorithm in all cases (vendors may vary slightly), but the consistent observable effect is that the result is a single write, not an undefined behavior or data corruption.   The outcome depends on the thread's execution order within the warp,  specifically the order in which the threads reach the write instruction.

In essence, the hardware resolves the conflict by selecting one of the competing writes, discarding the rest.  The selection isn't random; it's determined by the warp scheduler and the execution order of threads.  Usually, the thread with the lowest thread ID within the warp "wins" the write conflict. This behavior is consistent across various NVIDIA architectures I've worked with, although it's crucial to always validate this assumption for the specific hardware being targeted. Reliance on this behavior without verification can lead to portability issues.

This deterministic, yet potentially unpredictable, behavior necessitates careful synchronization mechanisms for shared memory access. If several threads require mutual exclusive access to a specific memory address within shared memory, explicit synchronization primitives are absolutely necessary. Relying solely on the hardware's implicit conflict resolution mechanism for concurrent writes is highly discouraged, as it directly undermines code correctness and predictability.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different scenarios of concurrent shared memory writes and their outcomes. I've used CUDA C/C++ for consistency, but the core principles apply to other GPU programming paradigms.


**Example 1: Deterministic Write with Implicit Conflict Resolution**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryWriteTest1() {
  __shared__ int sharedVar;

  int threadIdx = threadIdx.x;

  if (threadIdx == 0) {
    sharedVar = 10;
  } else if (threadIdx == 1) {
    sharedVar = 20;
  }

  __syncthreads(); // Ensures all threads in the warp have finished writing

  if (threadIdx == 0) {
    printf("sharedVar: %d\n", sharedVar);
  }
}
```

In this example, threads 0 and 1 attempt to write to `sharedVar`.  Because thread 0 has a lower thread ID, its write (10) will prevail. The `__syncthreads()` call is crucial; it ensures all threads complete their writes before any thread reads the value. Without it, the output would be unpredictable, depending on the hardware's scheduling specifics.


**Example 2: Demonstrating the Importance of Synchronization**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryWriteTest2() {
  __shared__ int sharedArr[32];

  int threadIdx = threadIdx.x;

  sharedArr[threadIdx] = threadIdx * 2;

  __syncthreads();

  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
    sum += sharedArr[i];
  }

  if (threadIdx == 0) {
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates correct usage of shared memory. Each thread writes its unique value to a different element of the array. `__syncthreads()` ensures all writes complete before the summation, guaranteeing a correct outcome.  Note that even though there are no explicit write conflicts within the same memory location here,  `__syncthreads()` remains critical for correct execution.  It maintains the order of operations as a barrier for all threads within the warp.


**Example 3: Incorrect Handling Leading to Unpredictable Results**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryWriteTest3() {
  __shared__ int sharedVar;
  int threadIdx = threadIdx.x;

  if (threadIdx < 32){
    sharedVar = threadIdx;
  }

  //No __syncthreads() here!

  if (threadIdx == 0) {
    printf("sharedVar: %d\n", sharedVar);
  }
}
```

Here, multiple threads attempt to write to `sharedVar` without synchronization. The final value of `sharedVar` is unpredictable.  The output will vary depending on the warp scheduler, potentially leading to different values each time the kernel is launched.  This underscores the absolute necessity of proper synchronization when multiple threads access shared memory concurrently, even with the apparently predictable nature of the prioritization.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of shared memory and concurrent programming on GPUs, I strongly recommend consulting the official programming guides for your specific hardware architecture (e.g., CUDA Programming Guide for NVIDIA GPUs).  Furthermore, exploring detailed architectural documentation for your target GPU will clarify the intricacies of its warp scheduling and memory access mechanisms.  A thorough study of concurrent programming principles (e.g., mutexes, semaphores, atomic operations) is also invaluable.  Finally,  investing time in profiling and benchmarking your code will reveal performance bottlenecks and highlight areas requiring optimization related to shared memory usage.  These steps are essential for robust and efficient GPU programming.
