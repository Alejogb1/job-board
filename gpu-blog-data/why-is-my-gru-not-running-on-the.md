The core issue hindering GPU utilization with GRUs in TensorFlow often stems from a mismatch between the model's construction and the available hardware resources, specifically concerning data tensor shapes and the `tf.config` settings.  In my experience debugging numerous recurrent neural networks, particularly GRUs, this oversight frequently goes unnoticed.  The problem isn't necessarily inherent to the GRU architecture itself, but rather a consequence of TensorFlow's inherent flexibility and the resulting need for explicit configuration.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's ability to dynamically allocate resources necessitates precise specification of data types and shapes.  If your GRU layer isn't explicitly instructed to use the GPU, or if the input data isn't formatted correctly for optimal GPU processing, the computation defaults to the CPU.  This is especially critical with sequences.  The GRU cell's internal operations, involving matrix multiplications and non-linearities, are highly parallelizable and benefit significantly from GPU acceleration. However, if the input sequence length varies significantly across batches,  padding becomes crucial, and inefficient padding strategies can negate the benefits of GPU usage.  Additionally,  incorrectly sized input tensors can lead to unexpected behavior, often resulting in computation on the CPU.  Finally,  ensure your TensorFlow installation has been correctly configured to utilize CUDA and cuDNN libraries appropriate for your GPU.  Failure in any of these aspects results in CPU-bound GRU training.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct GPU Utilization with Fixed-Length Sequences:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Verify GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Ensure GPU is set as primary device
tf.config.set_visible_devices(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0], 'GPU')

# Define the GRU model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.GRU(64, return_sequences=False, input_shape=(100, 50)), # Fixed sequence length of 100, 50 features
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate sample data with consistent sequence length.  This is crucial.
x_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 100, 50))
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(tf.random.uniform((1000,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), num_classes=10)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases proper GPU utilization.  The code first verifies GPU availability and sets it as the primary device. A GRU layer is created with a fixed input shape `(100, 50)`, representing a sequence length of 100 and 50 features. This consistent sequence length is critical for efficient GPU processing.  Sample data is generated to match the specified input shape, avoiding padding issues.  The `fit` method will then leverage the GPU for training.


**Example 2: Handling Variable-Length Sequences with Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (GPU verification and selection from Example 1) ...

# Define the GRU model with masking
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Masking(mask_value=0.), # Handles padded sequences
    tf.keras.layers.GRU(64, return_sequences=False),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate sample data with variable lengths, then pad
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post', value=0)
# ... (Convert to TensorFlow tensors and create corresponding y_train) ...

# Train the model
model.fit(padded_sequences, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** This addresses variable-length sequences, a common challenge in sequence processing.  The `Masking` layer is crucial; it ignores padded values (0.0 in this example), preventing them from influencing the GRU's computations.  Proper padding using `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences` is essential for efficient GPU utilization in this scenario. Remember that choosing an appropriate padding strategy ('post' or 'pre') significantly influences performance.


**Example 3:  Addressing Potential Shape Mismatches:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (GPU verification and selection from Example 1) ...

# Define the GRU model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.GRU(64, return_sequences=False, input_shape=(None, 50)), # Note the 'None' for variable sequence length
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate sample data with variable sequence lengths
num_samples = 1000
max_len = 100
num_features = 50
x_train = np.zeros((num_samples, max_len, num_features))
for i in range(num_samples):
  seq_len = np.random.randint(1, max_len + 1)
  x_train[i, :seq_len, :] = np.random.rand(seq_len, num_features)
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(tf.random.uniform((num_samples,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), num_classes=10)


# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates handling variable sequence length without explicit padding in the data preprocessing step. The `input_shape` parameter in the GRU layer now uses `None` for the time dimension, allowing sequences of varying lengths. The crucial aspect here is creating and properly shaping the `x_train` data to reflect this variable length,  ensuring consistency between data and the model definition.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on GPU support,  the TensorFlow guide on recurrent neural networks,  and a comprehensive guide on TensorFlow performance optimization.  Furthermore, studying publications on efficient GRU implementations and sequence padding techniques is beneficial for advanced scenarios.  Finally, thorough familiarity with CUDA and cuDNN programming is helpful in advanced debugging situations.
