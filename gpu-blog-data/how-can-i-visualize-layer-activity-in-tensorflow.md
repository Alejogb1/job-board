TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution paradigm fundamentally differs from the graph-based approach of TensorFlow 1.x, creating a challenge when trying to visualize layer activations in a 2.x model using tools designed for 1.x backends. Specifically, tools like TensorBoard's activation histograms, which rely on TF1's graph structure and session executions, don't directly translate. The core problem lies in the absence of explicit session management in TF2's default mode. I've faced this exact issue while retrofitting a TF2 style autoencoder to use an existing TF1-based server for deployment, forcing a visualization solution outside of typical TF2 best practices. The fundamental strategy revolves around manually extracting layer outputs during inference and then utilizing custom routines to format and log these values for visualization with external tools.

The primary difficulty stems from how activations are calculated and stored in TF2’s eager execution. In TF1, layers, once built within a graph, produced symbolic tensors. During a session run, these symbolic tensors’ values could be readily accessed and logged to TensorBoard via specific tensor operations and summary writers. In contrast, TF2, in its default eager execution, calculates layer output values immediately; these values are not readily available as symbolic tensors within a graph suitable for TensorBoard’s usual summarization mechanisms. The visualization strategy, therefore, requires us to adopt an approach where specific layers’ output tensors are captured using techniques that either utilize TF1 functions embedded into a TF2 workflow or work outside the main computational graph execution. To effectively visualize this activity, we need to selectively extract the activations using specific techniques during inference and manually log them for subsequent analysis. This means modifying the model to store these intermediate values and building an auxiliary logging system for the captured activations.

To illustrate these concepts, I'll present three distinct approaches, progressively refining the methodology. The first involves leveraging a TF1 session within a TF2 workflow for logging. It isn’t ideal, due to session management complexity, but serves to show how we can integrate TF1 graph and summaries in specific cases. Here’s an example focusing on capturing the output of a single hidden layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple TF2 model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 784)) # Dummy input

# Using TF1 graph and session to capture activation
tf1_graph = tf.Graph()
with tf1_graph.as_default():
    tf1_input = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 784), name='input')
    tf1_model_output = model(tf1_input)
    tf1_dense1_output = model.dense1(tf1_input)  # Intermediate layer

    # Create a TF1-style histogram summary
    tf1_hist_summary = tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram('dense1_activation', tf1_dense1_output)
    tf1_merged_summary = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()

    # Setup TF1 session and summary writer
    tf1_session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    tf1_summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('tf1_logs', tf1_graph)
    tf1_session.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())


# Run inference and get summary
with tf1_session.as_default():
  tf1_summ_result = tf1_session.run(tf1_merged_summary, feed_dict={tf1_input: input_data})
  tf1_summary_writer.add_summary(tf1_summ_result, 0)


tf1_summary_writer.close()
tf1_session.close()
```

In this code, I explicitly created a TF1 graph and session. I then rebuilt the model’s layer calls using TF1 placeholders to capture the intermediate output of `dense1` for a histogram summary. The summary is then written to a log directory that can be visualized using the TF1 version of TensorBoard. This approach is useful for quick prototyping to see some data using TensorBoard, but requires careful management of TF1 sessions and graph context which becomes cumbersome in a larger codebase.

My second approach avoids direct TF1 session use but captures the outputs as tensors directly during inference. This is a more TF2-centric approach where we define an additional `get_activations` function in the model. This method will log intermediate tensors for analysis, not directly use summaries.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple TF2 model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x

    def get_activations(self, inputs):
      activations = []
      x = self.dense1(inputs)
      activations.append(x)
      x = self.dense2(x)
      activations.append(x)
      return activations


model = SimpleModel()
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 784)) # Dummy input

#Capture activations using the new function
activations = model.get_activations(input_data)

# Process/Log activations
for i, activation in enumerate(activations):
    print(f"Layer {i}: {activation.shape}")
    # Here you would log these activations, e.g. storing the data to disk
    # using libraries like numpy to save, or using logging for small-scale analysis

```

Here, I added a `get_activations` function to the model. This function simply calls the layers, capturing their outputs into a list. The example iterates through the list, printing the shape of each activation. For practical logging, one would serialize each activation using `numpy.save` or similar for later analysis. This removes the direct dependency on TF1 sessions and allows a more flexible form of data capture, making it easier to integrate with other monitoring systems beyond TensorBoard. The core concept is to capture data directly from tensors in the TF2 eager environment.

The final example expands on the second approach by adding the ability to log activations for different parts of the model based on given layer names. This makes it possible to focus on particular layers of concern. The logging part is abstracted into a simple function. This is often the most suitable when the model is complex.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
import time

# Define a simple TF2 model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name='dense1')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense2')

    def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.dense1(inputs)
      x = self.dense2(x)
      return x

    def get_activations(self, inputs, layer_names):
      activation_dict = {}
      x = inputs
      for layer in self.layers:
          x = layer(x)
          if layer.name in layer_names:
            activation_dict[layer.name] = x
      return activation_dict

def log_activations(activations, log_dir):
    timestamp = int(time.time())
    for layer_name, activation in activations.items():
      filename = os.path.join(log_dir, f"{layer_name}_{timestamp}.npy")
      np.save(filename, activation.numpy())

model = SimpleModel()
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 784)) # Dummy input

# Select layers of interest
layers_to_monitor = ["dense1", "dense2"]

activations = model.get_activations(input_data, layers_to_monitor)

log_dir = "activations_log"
os.makedirs(log_dir, exist_ok=True)
log_activations(activations, log_dir)
```
This code allows you to select the specific layers to monitor, improving control over resource usage and making the captured activations more manageable. The captured numpy arrays can then be processed by external tools and visualization libraries like matplotlib.

In conclusion, visualizing TF2 layer activations when constrained to a TF1 backend requires careful manual extraction of layer outputs. Using a pure TF1 session for summaries can be initially useful for small projects, but capturing tensors directly is the most practical approach for larger scale projects, leading to data logged as files that can later be processed for custom visualizations. There are several alternatives to this. For example, one could perform online analysis by sending the extracted activation data to a monitoring system such as Grafana.

For continued learning, the following resources are recommended: the official TensorFlow documentation provides valuable insights into TF2 eager execution and model subclassing. For those needing a stronger foundation with TF1 graphs, resources related to TF1 graph structure and sessions should be examined. Furthermore, investigation into numerical analysis libraries like numpy will assist in properly managing the outputted activation data. Finally, delving into data visualization libraries like matplotlib or seaborn are crucial when developing suitable custom visualizations.
