Nonlinear systems of equations often lack closed-form solutions, necessitating iterative numerical methods.  My experience working on fluid dynamics simulations at my previous firm heavily involved such scenarios, where we routinely employed optimization toolboxes to converge on approximate solutions.  Java, while not boasting the same built-in optimization capabilities as MATLAB or Python's SciPy, offers robust integration with external libraries that address this limitation.  The choice of solver depends heavily on the specific system's characteristics – the number of variables, the nature of the nonlinearities, and the desired accuracy.

**1.  Explanation of the Approach**

The core strategy involves reformulating the nonlinear system as an optimization problem. This usually means defining an objective function that measures the deviation from satisfying the system of equations.  Minimizing this objective function brings the system closer to a solution.  The optimization toolbox then employs iterative algorithms to find the minimum (or maximum, depending on the formulation).  Commonly used algorithms include gradient descent, Newton-Raphson methods, and their variations.  The Jacobian (matrix of partial derivatives) often plays a crucial role in these algorithms, providing information about the function's gradient and facilitating faster convergence.

Considering a general nonlinear system of *n* equations with *n* unknowns:

`f1(x1, x2, ..., xn) = 0`
`f2(x1, x2, ..., xn) = 0`
`...`
`fn(x1, x2, ..., xn) = 0`

We can define an objective function, *F*, as the sum of squares of the residuals:

`F(x1, x2, ..., xn) = Σ [fi(x1, x2, ..., xn)]²`

Minimizing *F* using an optimization algorithm drives the residuals towards zero, thus approximating the solution to the original nonlinear system.  The choice of the optimization algorithm significantly impacts performance, with factors such as convergence speed, robustness to initial guesses, and computational cost needing careful consideration.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches, relying on Apache Commons Math for optimization capabilities.  Remember to include `commons-math3` as a dependency in your project's `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle).

**Example 1: Simple Gradient Descent using Apache Commons Math**

This example showcases a basic gradient descent implementation for a simple nonlinear system.  It's straightforward but may not converge efficiently for complex systems.

```java
import org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.MultivariateVectorFunction;
import org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.GradientMultivariateOptimizer;
import org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer;
import org.apache.commons.math3.optim.PointValuePair;

public class NonlinearSolver {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the nonlinear system (two equations, two unknowns)
        MultivariateVectorFunction system = (double[] x) -> new double[] {
                x[0] * x[0] + x[1] - 2, // f1(x1, x2) = 0
                x[0] - x[1] * x[1] // f2(x1, x2) = 0
        };

        // Define the objective function (sum of squares of residuals)
        MultivariateVectorFunction objective = (double[] x) -> {
            double[] residuals = system.value(x);
            double[] result = new double[1];
            result[0] = residuals[0] * residuals[0] + residuals[1] * residuals[1];
            return result;
        };

        // Use a gradient descent optimizer (requires calculating the Jacobian)
        GradientMultivariateOptimizer optimizer = new GradientMultivariateOptimizer(1e-8, 1e-15);
        //SimplexOptimizer optimizer = new SimplexOptimizer(1e-8, 1e-15);


        // Initial guess
        double[] initialGuess = {1, 1};

        // Perform the optimization
        PointValuePair result = optimizer.optimize(objective, null, initialGuess);

        // Print the solution
        System.out.println("Solution: x1 = " + result.getPoint()[0] + ", x2 = " + result.getPoint()[1]);
    }
}

```


**Example 2: Leveraging Numerical Jacobian Calculation**

Calculating the Jacobian analytically can be cumbersome for complex systems.  This example demonstrates using numerical differentiation to approximate the Jacobian, making the code more adaptable to various problems.  This uses the `SimplexOptimizer` which doesn't require gradient information.


```java
// ... (Import statements as in Example 1) ...

public class NonlinearSolverNumericalJacobian {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... (Define the system as in Example 1) ...

        //Use Simplex which doesn't require Jacobian
        SimplexOptimizer optimizer = new SimplexOptimizer(1e-8, 1e-15);

        // ... (Initial guess as in Example 1) ...

        PointValuePair result = optimizer.optimize(new SimpleScalarFunction(system));
        System.out.println("Solution: x1 = " + result.getPoint()[0] + ", x2 = " + result.getPoint()[1]);
    }

    static class SimpleScalarFunction implements MultivariateFunction{
        MultivariateVectorFunction system;

        SimpleScalarFunction(MultivariateVectorFunction system){
            this.system = system;
        }

        @Override
        public double value(double[] point) {
            double[] residuals = system.value(point);
            double sum = 0;
            for(double res : residuals){
                sum += res * res;
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
}
```


**Example 3: Handling Constraints**

Real-world problems often involve constraints on the variables.  This example demonstrates how to incorporate such constraints using Apache Commons Math's constrained optimization capabilities.  This is significantly more complex and requires a deeper understanding of the library's functionalities.  Here, we use a simpler problem to show the constraint implementation.

```java
// ... (Import statements, including necessary constraint classes) ...

public class NonlinearSolverWithConstraints {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the objective function (e.g., a simple quadratic)
        MultivariateFunction objective = (double[] x) -> x[0] * x[0] + x[1] * x[1];

        // Define constraints (e.g., x1 >= 0, x2 <= 1)
        //Implementation requires more advanced components of Apache Commons Math and is beyond the scope of this example.

        // ... (Rest of the code to incorporate constraints and perform optimization) ...
    }
}
```
