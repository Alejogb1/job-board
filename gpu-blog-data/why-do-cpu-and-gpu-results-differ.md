Discrepancies between CPU and GPU computations stem fundamentally from their differing architectures and intended workloads.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue numerous times in my work developing high-performance computing applications, primarily in scientific simulation and image processing. The core difference lies in the prioritization of parallel processing capabilities. CPUs excel at handling complex, sequentially dependent tasks, while GPUs are optimized for massively parallel operations on large datasets. This inherent architectural disparity directly impacts the outcome of computations, especially when dealing with algorithms not optimally suited to one architecture or the other.

**1. Architectural Divergences and their Computational Implications**

CPUs, or Central Processing Units, feature a small number of powerful cores designed for executing complex instructions efficiently.  These cores possess large instruction sets and sophisticated control logic enabling them to handle intricate branching and conditional logic with minimal overhead.  Their strength lies in their versatility: they can efficiently execute a wide range of instructions, including those demanding complex memory access patterns and intricate control flow.  However, this flexibility comes at the cost of parallel processing capabilities.  While modern CPUs incorporate multiple cores and hyperthreading, their parallel processing capacity is significantly lower than that of GPUs.

GPUs, or Graphics Processing Units, on the other hand, are built around a massive number of simpler cores, each designed for performing the same operation concurrently on different data points.  Their architecture is inherently parallel.  They lack the complex instruction sets and advanced control logic found in CPUs, making them less versatile in handling complex, sequentially dependent tasks.  Instead, they excel at processing large arrays of data in parallel, making them ideally suited for tasks that can be broken down into many independent, identical operations. This parallelism is the source of their superior performance in computationally intensive tasks such as matrix multiplication, image processing, and machine learning.

The difference in architectural design directly affects computational precision.  CPUs typically utilize higher precision floating-point arithmetic, offering greater accuracy for numerical computations. GPUs, optimized for speed, often use lower precision arithmetic (e.g., single precision FP32 instead of double precision FP64) to maximize throughput.  This lower precision can lead to accumulated rounding errors in extended computations, resulting in discrepancies between CPU and GPU outputs, especially for sensitive algorithms.  Furthermore, the memory access patterns employed by each architecture influence the results. CPUs often handle irregular memory accesses more efficiently, whereas GPUs benefit from coalesced memory accesses, where multiple threads access contiguous memory locations simultaneously.  Deviations from this ideal access pattern on a GPU can introduce performance bottlenecks and potential inaccuracies.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating Architectural Differences**

Let's examine three code examples showcasing how architectural differences lead to varying outcomes:


**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

// CPU implementation
std::vector<std::vector<double>> cpuMatrixMultiply(const std::vector<std::vector<double>>& a, const std::vector<std::vector<double>>& b) {
  // ... (Implementation omitted for brevity, standard nested loop approach) ...
}

// GPU implementation (using a hypothetical library)
std::vector<std::vector<double>> gpuMatrixMultiply(const std::vector<std::vector<double>>& a, const std::vector<std::vector<double>>& b) {
  // ... (Hypothetical GPU library call using CUDA or OpenCL) ...
}

int main() {
  // ... (Matrix initialization, time measurement, and output comparison omitted for brevity) ...
}
```

In this example, the GPU implementation will likely outperform the CPU version for large matrices due to its parallel processing capabilities. However, minor discrepancies in the final result are possible due to differences in floating-point precision and rounding errors.


**Example 2: Mandelbrot Set Generation**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <complex>
#include <vector>

// CPU implementation
std::vector<std::vector<int>> cpuMandelbrot(int width, int height) {
  // ... (Standard nested loop iteration, checking escape condition) ...
}

// GPU implementation (using a hypothetical library)
std::vector<std::vector<int>> gpuMandelbrot(int width, int height) {
  // ... (Hypothetical GPU kernel launch for parallel processing) ...
}

int main() {
  // ... (Image generation, time measurement, and visual comparison omitted for brevity) ...
}
```

This example highlights the benefits of parallelization.  The GPU version will generate the image significantly faster. Precision differences might not be noticeable visually, but subtle variations in color shading could arise due to accumulated rounding errors.


**Example 3: Monte Carlo Simulation**

```python
import random
import time

# CPU implementation
def cpuMonteCarlo(iterations):
  # ... (Standard loop to generate random numbers and count successes) ...

# GPU implementation (using a hypothetical library)
def gpuMonteCarlo(iterations):
  # ... (Hypothetical GPU kernel launch, using a random number generator optimized for GPUs) ...

start_time = time.time()
cpu_result = cpuMonteCarlo(10000000)
cpu_time = time.time() - start_time

start_time = time.time()
gpu_result = gpuMonteCarlo(10000000)
gpu_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}, Time: {cpu_time}")
print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}, Time: {gpu_time}")
```

A Monte Carlo simulation benefits from parallel execution. While the results should be statistically similar, slight variations in the final estimate can arise due to the use of different pseudo-random number generators and the finite precision of floating-point arithmetic.  GPUs typically leverage specialized random number generators optimized for parallel execution, leading to potential discrepancies when comparing results to a CPU implementation utilizing a different generator.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CPU and GPU architectures, I would suggest consulting advanced computer architecture textbooks and publications.  Specifically, works focusing on parallel computing, high-performance computing, and GPU programming are highly relevant. Furthermore, documentation for GPU computing frameworks (such as CUDA and OpenCL) provides valuable insights into the intricacies of GPU programming and the potential sources of discrepancies.  Finally, exploring research papers on numerical precision and error analysis within parallel computing environments is crucial for fully grasping the subtle factors influencing the differences between CPU and GPU outputs.  These resources provide detailed explanations of the underlying principles and offer practical guidance on mitigating potential discrepancies.
