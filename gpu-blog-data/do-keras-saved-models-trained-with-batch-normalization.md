Reproducibility in deep learning, particularly across distributed training environments, is a persistent challenge.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects at a major research institution has underscored this fact repeatedly.  The short answer regarding Keras saved models trained with batch normalization (BN) on multiple GPUs versus a single-GPU equivalent is: no, they will not produce *identical* results, although they should be very close.  The discrepancy stems from the inherent stochasticity introduced by BN and the non-deterministic nature of parallel processing.


**1.  Explanation:**

Batch normalization operates by normalizing activations within each batch.  The mean and variance calculated for this normalization are specific to each batch and are crucial to the model's internal representation.  When training on a single GPU, the order of data presentation is fixed, thus leading to a deterministic sequence of batch statistics.  However, data parallelism across multiple GPUs shuffles the data differently, leading to a different sequence of mini-batches processed by each GPU. This means each GPU computes different batch statistics, resulting in subtly different weight updates.  Even if the aggregate data processed across all GPUs is the same, the pathway to convergence varies.

Further complicating this, different backends (TensorFlow, Theano) and even versions of these backends can introduce minor variations in their implementation of BN and parallel processing.  These minor discrepancies can cumulatively affect the final model weights and predictions.  The random seed setting impacts the initial weight initialization and data shuffling, further influencing reproducibility.  Therefore, while the models might perform similarly in terms of overall accuracy and loss, bit-for-bit identical weights and predictions are generally unattainable.

Furthermore, the communication overhead inherent in multi-GPU training can introduce non-determinism. The precise timing of data transfer between GPUs can impact the order of operations, which further affects BN statistics and, consequently, the training process.

The saving of a Keras model, even using the `save_weights` function, doesn't completely alleviate this issue. While the weights themselves are saved, the internal state related to the BN layers (running means and variances)  may not be precisely replicable if the training process is non-deterministic.  These running statistics are typically updated cumulatively during training, and discrepancies in the training process inevitably lead to differences in these accumulated statistics.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how to train a model with BN on multiple GPUs using Keras and TensorFlow, highlighting the potential sources of non-determinism.  These examples are simplified for clarity.


**Example 1: Single GPU Training:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, BatchNormalization

# Assuming 'X_train', 'y_train' are your training data
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
model.save_weights('single_gpu_model.h5')
```

This serves as the baseline for comparison.  The training process, though involving stochastic gradient descent, is confined to a single GPU, leading to greater determinism compared to multi-GPU training.


**Example 2: Multi-GPU Training using `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, BatchNormalization

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        BatchNormalization(),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
    model.save_weights('multi_gpu_model.h5')
```

This utilizes TensorFlow's MirroredStrategy for data parallelism.  The data is split across available GPUs, leading to the different batch statistics discussed earlier.  The degree of non-determinism is amplified here.


**Example 3:  Highlighting Random Seed Importance:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, BatchNormalization
import numpy as np

tf.random.set_seed(42)  # Setting seed for reproducibility attempt
np.random.seed(42)

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    # ... (Rest of the model definition as in Example 2) ...

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
    model.save_weights('multi_gpu_model_seeded.h5')
```

This example explicitly sets the random seeds for both TensorFlow and NumPy.  While this reduces randomness, it may not entirely eliminate it due to the inherent non-determinism of multi-GPU training and the underlying hardware/software.  Different hardware configurations may still yield slightly different results even with identical seeds.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of distributed training in TensorFlow/Keras, consult the official TensorFlow documentation on distributed strategies and performance optimization.  A thorough grasp of the mathematics behind batch normalization and its implications for training dynamics is also crucial.  Advanced texts on deep learning, especially those covering the practical aspects of large-scale training, will provide valuable context.  Furthermore, review research papers discussing techniques for improving reproducibility in deep learning to better understand the limitations and challenges involved.
