The `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` option directly influences the run-time search path for dynamic libraries linked into executables and shared libraries produced during a CMake-based build process, specifically impacting how PyTorch, built from source, locates its own dependencies at runtime. This setting, when enabled, embeds the installation-time `rpath` directly into the generated binaries. My practical experience, spanning multiple large-scale Python project deployments utilizing custom-built PyTorch installations, reveals the nuances and potential complications arising from its usage.

Disabling `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` typically results in executables and shared libraries relying on the system's default dynamic library search paths â€“ those defined by environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux, or analogous mechanisms on other operating systems. This implies that if the dynamic libraries required by PyTorch are not found in these default paths, the application will fail to load them during execution. The primary benefit of this approach is that it avoids the potentially problematic practice of embedding hardcoded paths in compiled binaries. However, this also necessitates meticulous configuration of the runtime environment to ensure library locations are correctly specified. Conversely, enabling `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` changes the dynamic library search strategy, embedding the full path to the installed libraries during the build.

With `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` enabled (set to `ON`), CMake will capture the directory structure where libraries are being placed during the installation phase and then record those paths directly within the `rpath` sections of executable files and shared libraries. These embedded paths will be the first place the dynamic linker searches for necessary libraries, overriding system defaults. This makes the resulting binaries more portable within a similar environment where the installation directory is consistent, but introduces complexities when deploying to environments with disparate directory structures. This approach removes the need for external environment configuration for the specific location of the installed PyTorch libraries.

Let's illustrate this with concrete examples based on hypothetical scenarios while building PyTorch from source. Assume I'm working on a Linux system, targeting a hypothetical installation directory located at `/opt/pytorch-custom` with a CMake build folder `/home/user/pytorch-build`.

**Example 1: `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=OFF`**

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt fragment (simplified for illustration)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(PyTorchCustomBuild)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_subdirectory(torch) # Assumes 'torch' is a subdir for the PyTorch codebase

install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/torch/lib DESTINATION lib)

# Assumes 'torch' builds libtorch.so

# ... Other project-specific configurations and targets ...
```

```bash
# Terminal commands
cd /home/user/pytorch-build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pytorch-custom -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=OFF
make -j 8
make install

# Executing a test program: Assume 'test_program' relies on libtorch.so
/opt/pytorch-custom/bin/test_program

# Failure scenario (likely): The test_program will probably fail
# because LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set and the OS cannot locate libtorch.so
```
Here, with `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` disabled, `test_program`, hypothetically built to use libtorch.so, won't directly know where to locate the library. Execution will fail unless `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or its equivalent) is configured to include `/opt/pytorch-custom/lib` or the system-wide library path includes it. This scenario emphasizes the dependency on runtime environment configuration for a successful execution.

**Example 2: `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON`**

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt fragment (simplified for illustration)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(PyTorchCustomBuild)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_subdirectory(torch)

install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/torch/lib DESTINATION lib)

# ... Other project-specific configurations and targets ...
```

```bash
# Terminal commands
cd /home/user/pytorch-build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pytorch-custom -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON
make -j 8
make install

# Executing a test program
/opt/pytorch-custom/bin/test_program

# Success scenario (likely): The test_program should find libtorch.so
# due to embedded rpath information, without LD_LIBRARY_PATH being set.
```
In this scenario, with `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON`, the generated `test_program` would have its `rpath` entries set to `/opt/pytorch-custom/lib`. Thus, the program is able to find the required shared libraries without the need to set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

**Example 3: Impact of changing installation location with RPATH enabled**

```bash
# Build with install prefix /opt/pytorch-custom
cd /home/user/pytorch-build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pytorch-custom -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON
make -j 8
make install

# Move the installation to a different location
mv /opt/pytorch-custom /opt/pytorch-custom-moved

# Executing the test program after the install move
/opt/pytorch-custom-moved/bin/test_program

# Failure scenario: The test_program will now fail because the
# embedded RPATH still points to the original install location (/opt/pytorch-custom)
```
This example highlights the portability constraint introduced by `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`. While embedding the path simplifies initial execution, subsequent moves or duplications of the installed directory can cause the execution to fail, due to the hardcoded, and now invalid, paths embedded in the binaries.

Selecting between enabling and disabling `CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` is a trade-off between ease of initial deployment and long-term flexibility. When building custom PyTorch binaries intended for use within a tightly controlled environment with standardized installation paths, enabling this option can simplify initial setup. However, this choice limits future deployment flexibility and complicates debugging when discrepancies arise between the install directory and the environment. Disabling it demands more attention to environment variables and path configurations, but promotes flexibility and portability of the resulting binaries.

For further information on dynamic library loading, explore documentation on `ld.so` on Linux, and equivalent mechanisms on other platforms.  Detailed CMake documentation related to `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` and associated variables such as `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` are also invaluable resources. Furthermore, researching general topics on dynamic linking and shared libraries will solidify understanding on this subject.
