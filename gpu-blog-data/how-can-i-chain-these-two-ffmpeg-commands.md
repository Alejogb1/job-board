The core challenge in chaining FFmpeg commands lies in efficient data stream management.  Directly concatenating commands often results in redundant encoding and decoding operations, leading to significant performance bottlenecks, especially with larger files.  My experience working on high-throughput video processing pipelines taught me the crucial role of intermediate formats and pipe manipulation for optimal chaining.  Effective chaining avoids disk I/O whenever possible, leveraging FFmpeg's ability to handle streams directly between processes.


**1. Explanation:**

The most straightforward method for chaining FFmpeg commands involves using the pipe operator (`|`).  This allows the output of one command to become the input of the next, minimizing disk access. However, this approach has limitations.  It's primarily suitable for operations where the intermediate stream's format remains consistent, eliminating the need for re-encoding.  When format conversion or complex filtering is necessary between stages, a more sophisticated approach, using temporary files or the `concat` demuxer, is recommended.

The efficiency of chaining heavily depends on the specific operations.  If both commands perform similar tasks (e.g., both involve H.264 encoding),  direct piping might suffice.  If, however, the first command outputs a raw video stream and the second needs a specific codec (like H.265), re-encoding becomes unavoidable.  Choosing the appropriate strategy significantly impacts processing time and resource consumption.  Furthermore, handling metadata and preserving timestamps throughout the chain requires meticulous attention.

I've encountered situations where a seemingly simple chain resulted in substantial time increases due to an oversight in the codec selection or the failure to handle audio streams consistently across commands. In these cases, carefully analyzing the output format of each command and matching it to the input requirements of the subsequent command is crucial.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Piping for Format Conversion:**

This example converts an MP4 file to a WebM file using a direct pipe.  No re-encoding is necessary as the video stream is passed directly. The audio stream is passed through the same pipeline if the codecs are compatible.  Otherwise, more complex processing is required.

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -f webm pipe:1 | ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -c copy output.webm
```

* **`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -f webm pipe:1`**: This command reads `input.mp4`, copies streams without re-encoding (`-c copy`), and outputs the result as a WebM stream (`-f webm`) to the standard output (`pipe:1`).
* **`ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -c copy output.webm`**: This command reads from the standard input (`pipe:0`), copies streams again without re-encoding, and writes the result to `output.webm`.  This approach is efficient as it avoids redundant encoding.


**Example 2:  Using Concat Demuxer for Multiple Files:**

This example demonstrates concatenating two MP4 files. This technique avoids re-encoding but requires creating a text file listing the input files.  It's superior to simple piping when dealing with multiple input files.

```bash
# Create a text file listing the input files
echo "file 'input1.mp4'" > input.txt
echo "file 'input2.mp4'" >> input.txt

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4
```

* **`echo "file 'input1.mp4'" > input.txt`**: Creates a text file containing the path to the first input file.
* **`echo "file 'input2.mp4'" >> input.txt`**: Appends the path to the second input file.
* **`ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4`**: This utilizes the `concat` demuxer (`-f concat`) to read the list of files from `input.txt`, copies streams without re-encoding (`-c copy`), and outputs the concatenated result to `output.mp4`. The `-safe 0` option is crucial when dealing with relative file paths within the text file.


**Example 3:  Complex Chain with Encoding and Filtering:**

This example demonstrates a more complex scenario involving resizing, watermarking, and encoding.  It uses temporary files for intermediate results for increased clarity and control.  The complexity here necessitates using temporary files; direct piping would be far less manageable.

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=640:-1,watermark=watermark.png" -c:v libx264 -preset medium temp.mp4
ffmpeg -i temp.mp4 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4
rm temp.mp4
```

* **`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=640:-1,watermark=watermark.png" -c:v libx264 -preset medium temp.mp4`**: This command resizes the video (`scale=640:-1`), adds a watermark (`watermark=watermark.png`), encodes it using libx264 with a medium preset (`-c:v libx264 -preset medium`), and saves the result to a temporary file (`temp.mp4`).
* **`ffmpeg -i temp.mp4 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4`**: This command encodes the audio from `temp.mp4` using AAC codec with a bitrate of 128kbps (`-c:a aac -b:a 128k`) and saves the final result to `output.mp4`.
* **`rm temp.mp4`**: This removes the temporary file.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official FFmpeg documentation provides comprehensive information on all commands, options, and codecs.  A thorough understanding of video and audio codecs, container formats, and stream manipulation is crucial.  Exploring advanced filtering options within FFmpeg will enhance capabilities considerably.  Consult dedicated video processing and encoding guides for best practices and optimization techniques.   Finally, proficiency in shell scripting or a comparable language greatly simplifies complex pipeline management.
