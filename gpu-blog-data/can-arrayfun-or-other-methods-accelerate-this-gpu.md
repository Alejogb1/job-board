The inherent limitation of `arrayfun()` in MATLAB, and analogous functions in other environments, lies in its fundamentally serial nature.  While it offers a convenient syntax for element-wise operations, it fails to leverage the parallel processing power of GPUs effectively.  This contrasts sharply with the highly parallel architecture of GPUs, designed for simultaneous computations across numerous data points.  My experience in high-performance computing, specifically optimizing large-scale simulations involving geophysical data, has consistently highlighted this bottleneck.  Accelerating GPU array calculations necessitates a shift towards explicitly parallel approaches.


The problem stems from the interpreter overhead. `arrayfun()`, at its core, iterates through each element, calling the specified function individually. This serial execution negates the potential speedup offered by massively parallel architectures like GPUs.  True acceleration requires vectorization or explicit parallelization strategies.


**1.  Explanation:**

Optimizing GPU array calculations necessitates exploiting the inherent parallelism of the GPU architecture.  This involves expressing the computation as a series of operations that can be performed independently on multiple data elements simultaneously.  This contrasts with serial approaches where operations are performed sequentially, one after another.

Vectorization is the most straightforward approach for many common array operations.  Vectorized code operates on entire arrays at once, rather than individual elements.  The GPU's many cores can then process different parts of the array concurrently, resulting in significant speed improvements.

For more complex calculations not easily amenable to vectorization, explicit parallelization using frameworks like CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or OpenCL (for a wider range of GPUs) provides a more powerful, albeit more complex, solution.  These frameworks allow for the explicit control of thread execution on the GPU, offering fine-grained optimization possibilities.  However, this requires a deeper understanding of parallel programming concepts and GPU architecture.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Vectorization**

Let's consider a simple calculation: squaring each element of an array.  A naive approach using `arrayfun()` would be inefficient:

```matlab
A = rand(10000, 1);
tic;
B = arrayfun(@(x) x^2, A);
toc;
```

This suffers from the serial bottleneck. A vectorized version is dramatically faster:

```matlab
A = rand(10000, 1);
tic;
B = A.^2;
toc;
```

The element-wise power operator (`.^`) performs the squaring operation on the entire array simultaneously, leveraging the GPU's parallel capabilities if the array resides in GPU memory.  The timing difference between these two approaches, especially for larger arrays, would be substantial.

**Example 2:  Explicit Parallelization with CUDA (Illustrative)**

For more complex scenarios where vectorization is not feasible, CUDA offers explicit control. This example is simplified for illustrative purposes and assumes a basic understanding of CUDA programming:

```cuda
__global__ void squareArray(float *input, float *output, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    output[i] = input[i] * input[i];
  }
}

// Host code (MATLAB or C++) to manage data transfer and kernel launch
// ... (Details omitted for brevity) ...
```

This CUDA kernel `squareArray` divides the array amongst numerous threads, each handling a portion of the computation. This approach, though requiring more code, allows for optimal control over parallel execution. Note that effective CUDA programming involves careful consideration of thread organization (blocks and threads) for optimal performance.  Incorrectly sized blocks or threads can negate performance gains.  My experience has shown that profiling is crucial in this stage.


**Example 3:  MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox**

MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox provides a higher-level abstraction for parallel processing, potentially simplifying the development process compared to directly using CUDA or OpenCL.  Consider a more complex operation, say, calculating the inverse of each element of a matrix:

```matlab
A = rand(1000);
tic;
% Serial approach (inefficient)
for i=1:size(A,1)
    for j=1:size(A,2)
        B(i,j) = 1/A(i,j);
    end
end
toc;


tic;
% Parallel approach (using parfor)
parfor i=1:size(A,1)
    for j=1:size(A,2)
        B(i,j) = 1/A(i,j);
    end
end
toc;
```

The `parfor` loop distributes iterations across available workers, potentially including GPUs if configured correctly.  However, the inner loop remains serial.  Further optimization might involve restructuring the calculation to better exploit parallel capabilities if the matrix operations allow for it.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of GPU computing and parallel programming:

*   A comprehensive textbook on parallel algorithms and architectures.
*   Documentation for CUDA or OpenCL programming, including best practices and optimization techniques.
*   MATLAB's official documentation on the Parallel Computing Toolbox and GPU acceleration.  Pay close attention to the sections on performance analysis and profiling.

My experience consistently demonstrates that while `arrayfun()` offers a convenient interface, its inherent serial nature limits performance when dealing with large-scale GPU array calculations.  Employing vectorization or exploring explicit parallelization through frameworks like CUDA or OpenCL (or higher-level abstractions like MATLAB's parallel computing tools) is essential for achieving significant speedups.  Profiling and careful consideration of parallel programming principles are crucial for optimizing code to effectively utilize the parallel processing power of GPUs. The choice of approach depends on the complexity of the calculation and the level of control desired.
