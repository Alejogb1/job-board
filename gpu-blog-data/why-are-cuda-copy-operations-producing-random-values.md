The aberrant behavior you're observing with CUDA copy operations yielding seemingly random values stems primarily from improper memory management and synchronization, not inherent flaws in the CUDA runtime itself.  In my experience debugging similar issues across various GPU architectures, the root cause frequently involves accessing uninitialized memory or violating memory access restrictions.  This manifests as unpredictable values, often appearing random, within your host or device memory.

**1. Explanation:**

CUDA leverages distinct memory spaces: host memory (accessible by the CPU) and device memory (accessible by the GPU).  Data transfer between these spaces requires explicit commands using functions like `cudaMemcpy`.  Errors arise when you attempt to read from uninitialized device memory,  write to memory regions outside allocated space, or access memory concurrently without proper synchronization.  The GPU, unlike the CPU, isn't inherently fault-tolerant in these situations. It might produce values from adjacent memory locations or simply return garbage.  Furthermore, improper synchronization can lead to data races, where threads access and modify the same memory location concurrently, resulting in unpredictable outcomes.

Another crucial aspect is the understanding of memory allocation in CUDA.  `cudaMalloc` allocates memory on the device, but this memory is not initialized; it contains whatever data happened to reside in that specific location on the GPU's memory before allocation. Reading from this uninitialized memory is the most common cause of seeing "random" values.  Moreover, using a mismatched allocation size in `cudaMalloc` relative to the size used in `cudaMemcpy` can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. This corruption can spread, influencing subsequent operations and making error diagnosis challenging.  Finally, insufficient error checking is often the silent accomplice in these scenarios.  Always check the return value of every CUDA function call; error codes provide invaluable clues for identifying the source of issues.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Uninitialized Device Memory**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    int hostValue = 10;
    int *hostPtr = &hostValue;

    // Allocate uninitialized device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, sizeof(int));

    // Incorrect: Attempting to copy from uninitialized memory to the host
    cudaMemcpy(hostPtr, devPtr, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    printf("Value copied from device: %d\n", hostValue); //Will print a seemingly random value

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This code allocates uninitialized device memory using `cudaMalloc`.  The subsequent `cudaMemcpy` attempts to copy this garbage data to the host. The `printf` statement will therefore display an unpredictable value seemingly randomly generated.  Always initialize device memory using `cudaMemset` or by copying initialized data from the host before reading from it.


**Example 2: Incorrect Memory Size**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    int hostArr[10] = {0};

    // Allocate space for 10 integers
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, sizeof(int) * 10);

    // Incorrect: Attempting to copy 20 integers, causing buffer overflow
    cudaMemcpy(devPtr, hostArr, sizeof(int) * 20, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    //Further operations will likely cause errors and seemingly random values
    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}

```

*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates a buffer overflow.  The `cudaMalloc` allocates space for 10 integers, but `cudaMemcpy` tries to write 20 integers. This overwrites adjacent memory locations, causing unpredictable behavior in subsequent operations, potentially leading to "random" values further in the code.  Always double-check the size arguments in both allocation and copy operations.


**Example 3: Race Condition (without synchronization)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *data, int value) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    data[i] += value;
}

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    int hostArr[10] = {0};
    int value = 5;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr, sizeof(int) * 10);
    cudaMemcpy(devPtr, hostArr, sizeof(int) * 10, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    //Incorrect: multiple threads writing to the same memory location concurrently, without synchronization
    addKernel<<<1, 10>>>(devPtr, value); //Launch 10 threads to add to the same memory
    addKernel<<<1, 10>>>(devPtr, value); //Launch 10 threads to add to the same memory again

    cudaMemcpy(hostArr, devPtr, sizeof(int) * 10, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        printf("hostArr[%d]: %d\n", i, hostArr[i]);
    }

    cudaFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates a data race. Two kernel launches attempt to modify the same memory locations concurrently without synchronization. The final values in `hostArr` will be unpredictable and likely not the expected sum.  This necessitates the use of atomic operations (`atomicAdd`) or synchronization primitives like barriers (`__syncthreads()`) within kernels to ensure data consistency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and a comprehensive textbook on parallel programming with CUDA are invaluable resources.  Furthermore, studying debugging techniques specifically for CUDA applications, including using the NVIDIA Nsight debugger, is crucial for effectively resolving these types of issues.  Finally, understanding the fundamentals of memory management and concurrency in parallel computing will equip you with the necessary knowledge to avoid these pitfalls.
