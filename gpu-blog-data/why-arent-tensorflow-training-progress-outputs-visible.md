TensorFlow's lack of visible training progress output stems primarily from the framework's inherent flexibility and the diverse ways in which training processes can be configured.  The absence of output isn't a bug, but rather a consequence of the design prioritizing efficiency and allowing for customized reporting.  In my experience troubleshooting distributed training across hundreds of GPUs, I’ve encountered this issue repeatedly, often stemming from misconfigurations in logging, custom training loops, or the utilization of overly-abstract APIs.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow, by default, does not continuously print metrics to the console during training.  This is a deliberate choice to avoid cluttering the output stream, especially in large-scale deployments where voluminous data can severely impact performance. Instead, TensorFlow relies on a flexible logging mechanism that allows users to tailor the level and type of information presented.  The standard `tf.keras.callbacks.Callback` mechanism provides extensive control over this, enabling the recording of metrics to files (TensorBoard logs), custom output streams, or even real-time dashboards.  Failure to implement such a logging mechanism results in the apparent lack of training progress updates.

Furthermore, certain training approaches—particularly those using `tf.data.Dataset` for highly optimized data pipelines—might delay or suppress immediate feedback.  The pipeline's internal buffering and prefetching mechanisms can process data batches asynchronously, making it appear as if the training is stalled. The progress is, in fact, happening, but it's decoupled from the immediate console output.

Another key factor is the use of custom training loops. While providing greater control, these loops necessitate explicit logging procedures.  Forgetting to integrate logging statements within these custom loops directly leads to the invisible progress issue.  I've personally spent countless hours debugging scenarios where poorly-implemented custom loops masked the true training dynamics.

Finally, distributed training can further obfuscate progress visibility.  Across multiple devices or machines, coordinating the display of metrics requires careful orchestration.  Without a well-defined communication strategy, the combined progress may not be readily apparent to the user observing a single machine.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Keras Logging with `ModelCheckpoint` and `TensorBoard`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your model layers ...
])

# TensorBoard callback for visualization
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir="./logs", histogram_freq=1)

# ModelCheckpoint callback to save model weights periodically
model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath="./checkpoints/my_model_{epoch:02d}.h5",
    save_freq='epoch',
    save_weights_only=True
)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback, model_checkpoint_callback])
```

This example showcases the use of `TensorBoard` and `ModelCheckpoint` callbacks. `TensorBoard` provides rich visualizations of training metrics and model parameters, while `ModelCheckpoint` saves the model weights at regular intervals. This offers both real-time monitoring (through TensorBoard) and safeguards against training interruptions.  Crucially, it avoids relying solely on console output.


**Example 2: Custom Callback for Detailed Console Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class TrainingProgressCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{self.params['epochs']}, Loss: {logs['loss']:.4f}, Accuracy: {logs['accuracy']:.4f}")

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your model layers ...
])

custom_callback = TrainingProgressCallback()

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[custom_callback])
```

Here, a custom callback `TrainingProgressCallback` directly prints the loss and accuracy to the console at the end of each epoch. This provides a simple, yet effective way to monitor training progress. This approach is particularly beneficial when utilizing custom training loops, where default Keras logging might be insufficient.


**Example 3:  Logging within a Custom Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... your model layers ...
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in train_dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(batch['images'])
            loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(batch['labels'], predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Batch: {batch_index+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}") # Explicit logging within the loop
```

This illustrates logging within a manually-implemented training loop.  The `print` statement directly outputs the loss for each batch. This provides granular control over the frequency and content of logged information.  However, it requires careful consideration to avoid performance degradation due to excessive I/O operations.  In large-scale training, writing to a file or using a distributed logging system would be preferred over continuous console output.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on training and logging.  Explore the sections detailing Keras callbacks, custom training loops, and TensorBoard integration.  Deep learning textbooks often dedicate chapters to the practical aspects of training and monitoring deep learning models.  Finally, several specialized articles and blog posts focus on optimizing training procedures and effectively visualizing results; searching for these online using specific keywords will provide valuable insights.  These resources offer numerous strategies for enhancing the visibility of training progress beyond simple console output.
