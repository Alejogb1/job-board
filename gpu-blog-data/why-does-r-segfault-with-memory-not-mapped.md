The "memory not mapped" segmentation fault encountered when calling Fortran from R often stems from a mismatch in data types or memory allocation between the two languages.  My experience debugging similar issues over the past decade, primarily working on high-performance computing projects involving complex statistical models and numerical simulations, points to this core problem.  The underlying cause frequently involves incorrect interface specifications, leading to attempts to access memory regions that are not properly allocated or visible to both R and the called Fortran subroutine.

**1. Explanation:**

R and Fortran manage memory differently. R uses a garbage-collected heap, dynamically allocating and deallocating memory as needed.  Fortran, particularly when using older, less sophisticated compilers, often relies more heavily on static or explicitly managed memory.  This divergence creates several potential points of failure when interfacing them.  The most common reasons for a "memory not mapped" segfault include:

* **Incorrect Data Type Mapping:**  Passing data between R and Fortran requires careful consideration of data types.  A mismatch in the size or representation of a data type (e.g., passing a single-precision floating-point number from R to a Fortran subroutine expecting a double-precision number) can lead to memory alignment errors.  This is exacerbated if the Fortran code assumes a specific memory layout or padding scheme not followed by R.

* **Memory Allocation Discrepancies:**  If R allocates memory for an array and passes its address to a Fortran subroutine, the Fortran code must not attempt to resize or deallocate that memory using its own mechanisms.  Fortran's memory management routines may not interact correctly with R's garbage collector, leading to the memory region becoming inaccessible or being prematurely deallocated.

* **Array Indexing Differences:**  R uses one-based indexing, while Fortran traditionally employs zero-based or one-based indexing depending on the compiler and code style.  An off-by-one error in index translation between R and Fortran can easily result in access to invalid memory addresses.

* **Interface Definition Issues:**  Using the incorrect interface definition (e.g., .Fortran or .C) for calling Fortran functions from R can lead to incorrect data type conversions and memory management errors. The specifics of how arguments are passed and returned must be meticulously defined to avoid conflicts.

* **Compiler-Specific Optimizations:**  Compiler optimizations, particularly those related to memory management and vectorization, can sometimes create subtle incompatibilities between R and Fortran.  Debugging with optimization disabled can help isolate such issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type Mapping**

```fortran
      subroutine fortran_func(x, y)
        implicit none
        real(4) :: x
        real(8) :: y
        y = x * 2.0d0
      end subroutine fortran_func
```

```r
dyn.load("fortran_func.so") # Assuming compilation already done

x <- 1.0
y <- numeric(1)
.Fortran("fortran_func", x, y)
print(y)
```

This example demonstrates a mismatch. The Fortran subroutine `fortran_func` expects a double-precision (`real(8)`) input, while R passes a single-precision (`numeric` maps to single precision in most cases).  This size mismatch can lead to a "memory not mapped" error, or seemingly unpredictable results. The correction would involve ensuring consistent data types.


**Example 2: Memory Allocation Discrepancy**

```fortran
      subroutine fortran_func(x, n)
        implicit none
        integer :: n
        real(8), dimension(*) :: x
        integer :: i
        do i = 1, n
          x(i) = x(i) * 2.0d0
        end do
      end subroutine fortran_func
```

```r
dyn.load("fortran_func.so")

x <- rnorm(10)
n <- length(x)
.Fortran("fortran_func", as.double(x), as.integer(n))
print(x)
```

Here, while the data types match, the memory is allocated in R.  The Fortran subroutine should not attempt to allocate or deallocate `x`.  The R garbage collector manages `x`'s memory. Problems might appear if the Fortran code attempts memory allocation, reallocation, or deallocation internal to the subroutine.


**Example 3: Array Indexing Error**

```fortran
      subroutine fortran_func(x, n)
        implicit none
        integer :: n
        real(8), dimension(n) :: x
        integer :: i
        do i = 1, n
          x(i) = x(i) * 2.0d0
        end do
      end subroutine fortran_func
```

```r
dyn.load("fortran_func.so")
x <- rnorm(10)
n <- length(x)
.Fortran("fortran_func", as.double(x), as.integer(n))
print(x)
```

This example (assuming a compiler using one-based indexing in Fortran), is safer than Example 2 as it uses the array length passed from R to define the Fortran array size.  However, if the Fortran code inadvertently used zero-based indexing, it would attempt to access `x(0)`, resulting in a segfault.  Careful attention to indexing conventions is crucial.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of interfacing R and Fortran, I would recommend consulting the official R documentation on foreign function interfaces.  Furthermore, a detailed guide on Fortran programming, emphasizing memory management and array handling, is essential. Finally, a good textbook on numerical computation will provide a solid foundation in the principles of numerical algorithms and their efficient implementation, which often informs how to avoid memory issues in this context.  These resources will equip you with the theoretical and practical knowledge to effectively debug and prevent "memory not mapped" errors during R and Fortran integration.  Always prioritize rigorous testing and careful attention to detail.  Remember to compile your Fortran code with appropriate flags and link it correctly against the R libraries.  Using debugging tools to step through the code execution in both R and Fortran can prove invaluable in pinpointing the exact location of the memory access error.
