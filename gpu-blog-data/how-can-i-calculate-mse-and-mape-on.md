The accurate evaluation of machine learning models necessitates robust metrics beyond simple accuracy, specifically Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for regression tasks. Applying these to TensorFlow test data requires understanding data handling within TensorFlow's ecosystem and utilizing appropriate functions for the calculation. I've encountered this frequently in my work on time-series forecasting, where both the magnitude of error (MSE) and its proportional size (MAPE) are crucial.

MSE, formally defined as the average of the squares of the errors, penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones. This is advantageous when significant deviations from the true values are especially undesirable. MAPE, on the other hand, expresses error as a percentage of the true values. It provides a more intuitive understanding of error magnitude, particularly when dealing with diverse data scales. Both are essential for a complete picture of model performance.

To begin, consider the fundamental setup within TensorFlow. We assume we have a trained TensorFlow model, test data loaded into a `tf.data.Dataset` object, and corresponding true values. The core process involves: making predictions on the test data, calculating the difference between predictions and true values (errors), and subsequently computing the MSE and MAPE.

Let's unpack a scenario. Imagine we are working with a model predicting daily stock prices. Our test dataset contains a batch of 32 examples, each consisting of a sequence of historical prices, and we have corresponding true future prices (the targets). The model outputs predicted future prices, also a single value per example. The following code snippet demonstrates how to compute MSE in this situation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def calculate_mse(model, test_dataset):
    """
    Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a TensorFlow test dataset.

    Args:
      model: A trained TensorFlow model.
      test_dataset: A tf.data.Dataset object containing test data (features, targets).

    Returns:
      The calculated MSE as a float.
    """
    total_error_squared = 0.0
    num_samples = 0

    for features, targets in test_dataset:
        predictions = model(features)
        squared_errors = tf.square(predictions - targets) # Calculate the square of the differences
        total_error_squared += tf.reduce_sum(squared_errors) # Sum the squared errors for the batch
        num_samples += tf.size(targets) # Keep track of the number of samples

    mse = total_error_squared / tf.cast(num_samples, tf.float32) # Average of the squared errors
    return mse

# Example Usage
# Assume `my_model` is a trained TensorFlow model and `test_dataset_example` is your test dataset.
# mse_value = calculate_mse(my_model, test_dataset_example)
# print(f"MSE: {mse_value.numpy()}")
```

This function, `calculate_mse`, iterates through the test dataset. For each batch of data, it generates predictions, calculates the squared difference between predictions and actual values, sums these squared differences, and accumulates the number of samples. Finally, it divides the total squared error by the total number of samples to compute the average, thus giving the MSE. The use of `tf.reduce_sum` allows batch wise aggregation before averaging the error. Type casting `num_samples` to float is necessary for correct division.

Now, let's move to the computation of MAPE. MAPE is more nuanced as it involves a division by true values. The presence of true values being zero presents an undefined state, requiring careful handling. A common approach is to add a small positive constant (epsilon) to avoid division-by-zero issues. Below, I illustrate the calculation of MAPE, incorporating a standard practice to handle zero target values, specifically handling edge cases where target values are very small.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def calculate_mape(model, test_dataset, epsilon=1e-6):
    """
    Calculates the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) on a TensorFlow test dataset.

    Args:
      model: A trained TensorFlow model.
      test_dataset: A tf.data.Dataset object containing test data (features, targets).
      epsilon: A small constant to prevent division by zero.

    Returns:
      The calculated MAPE as a float.
    """
    total_percentage_error = 0.0
    num_samples = 0

    for features, targets in test_dataset:
        predictions = model(features)
        abs_error = tf.abs(predictions - targets)
        percentage_error = abs_error / (tf.abs(targets) + epsilon) # Prevent division by 0
        total_percentage_error += tf.reduce_sum(percentage_error) # Sum the percentage errors for the batch
        num_samples += tf.size(targets)

    mape = (total_percentage_error / tf.cast(num_samples, tf.float32)) * 100 # Calculate average and convert to percent
    return mape

# Example Usage
# Assume `my_model` is a trained TensorFlow model and `test_dataset_example` is your test dataset.
# mape_value = calculate_mape(my_model, test_dataset_example)
# print(f"MAPE: {mape_value.numpy()}%")
```

Here, `calculate_mape` calculates the absolute difference between predictions and targets, divides this absolute difference by (the absolute value of targets + epsilon), sums these percentages across each batch, and averages the sum of percentage errors. Multiplying the result by 100 expresses the error as a percentage, resulting in the MAPE. I've opted for adding an epsilon rather than explicitly ignoring zero values, since for some real world data zero target values are still significant data points. The addition of a small epsilon is an accepted and robust approach.

A critical consideration is the choice of the `epsilon` value. The value `1e-6` is a common choice, but its optimality depends on the scale and distribution of the target values. For instance, if your target values are generally on the order of `1e-9`, a larger epsilon, such as `1e-10` might be necessary. Conversely, if the target values are generally large integers, then a larger epsilon will have negligible effect.

Lastly, consider a more robust implementation leveraging the TensorFlow APIs directly to streamline the process.  This example does not loop through the test dataset; instead it leverages the full datasets at once, reducing boilerplate code.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics_tf(model, test_dataset, epsilon=1e-6):
    """
    Calculates MSE and MAPE using TensorFlow operations directly.

    Args:
        model: A trained TensorFlow model.
        test_dataset: A tf.data.Dataset object containing test data (features, targets).
        epsilon: A small constant to prevent division by zero in MAPE.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing (mse, mape).
    """

    all_predictions = []
    all_targets = []

    for features, targets in test_dataset:
        predictions = model(features)
        all_predictions.append(predictions)
        all_targets.append(targets)

    all_predictions = tf.concat(all_predictions, axis=0)
    all_targets = tf.concat(all_targets, axis=0)

    squared_errors = tf.square(all_predictions - all_targets)
    mse = tf.reduce_mean(squared_errors)

    abs_error = tf.abs(all_predictions - all_targets)
    percentage_error = abs_error / (tf.abs(all_targets) + epsilon)
    mape = tf.reduce_mean(percentage_error) * 100

    return mse, mape

# Example Usage:
# Assume `my_model` is a trained TensorFlow model, and `test_dataset_example` is your test data.
# mse_value, mape_value = calculate_metrics_tf(my_model, test_dataset_example)
# print(f"MSE: {mse_value.numpy()}, MAPE: {mape_value.numpy()}%")

```

This approach aggregates all predictions and targets using `tf.concat` into single tensors. Then it uses native tensor operations directly for calculating `mse` and `mape`. This can sometimes be more efficient, especially for larger datasets where there is no need to iterate through it. The main caveat is that all the data must fit into memory. While this example doesn't incorporate `tf.function` decorator for optimal graph execution, one can use it for improved performance.

For continued study, I recommend exploring resources focused on model evaluation metrics for regression, specifically with regards to statistical learning, which can provide a more theoretical understanding of these concepts. Textbooks covering applied statistical modeling and those focusing on deep learning in general frequently provide details on various evaluation metrics and their interpretations. Articles from reputable sources on machine learning and data science often explore specific practical applications. Investigating TensorFlow's official documentation and tutorials regarding model evaluation practices would also prove fruitful. The key is to develop a thorough understanding of both the mathematical underpinnings of MSE and MAPE, and also their specific implementations within TensorFlow. Each of these avenues of learning will provide valuable insight.
