The issue of Keras seemingly ignoring the `batch_size` parameter and attempting to load the entire dataset into GPU memory typically stems from a misunderstanding of how data loading and model training interact within the Keras framework, specifically concerning the use of `fit` with datasets that haven't been properly configured for batch processing.  In my experience resolving similar performance bottlenecks across various deep learning projects, this is almost always the root cause, especially when working with large datasets.  The key lies in the distinction between how data is *presented* to the model versus how it's *processed* internally.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras' `fit` method expects data in a format suitable for efficient batch processing.  If you provide it with a NumPy array representing the entire dataset at once, regardless of your specified `batch_size`, it will attempt to allocate sufficient GPU memory for the entire array. This is because Keras, by default, assumes you've intentionally provided the entire dataset for a single training step if it receives a single, large tensor or array.  The `batch_size` parameter in this scenario is effectively ignored because the data structure itself precludes batching.  The underlying TensorFlow or Theano backend (depending on your Keras configuration) then attempts to handle this monolithic data structure, often resulting in an out-of-memory error.

Correct batch processing requires the data to be iteratively yielded in batches. This is typically achieved using either a `tf.data.Dataset` object (for TensorFlow backend) or a custom generator function. These mechanisms provide data to the model in smaller, manageable chunks, respecting the specified `batch_size`.

The critical point is that `batch_size` controls the *number of samples processed per training step*, not the memory allocation strategy.  Memory allocation is dictated by how you supply the training data to the `fit` method.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Handling (leading to OOM):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Assume X_train and y_train are large NumPy arrays representing the entire dataset
model = keras.Sequential([Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)), Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Incorrect: Passing entire dataset at once. batch_size is ignored.
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10) # OOM likely here
```

In this example, `X_train` and `y_train` are provided as complete arrays.  Despite the `batch_size` being set to 32, Keras interprets this as a single batch containing the entire dataset. This leads to a massive memory allocation attempt.

**Example 2: Correct Data Handling using `tf.data.Dataset`:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Assume X_train and y_train are large NumPy arrays representing the entire dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_train, y_train))
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10000).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

model = keras.Sequential([Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)), Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Correct: Using tf.data.Dataset for efficient batching
model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)
```

This example leverages `tf.data.Dataset`.  `from_tensor_slices` creates a dataset from the NumPy arrays.  `shuffle` randomizes the data, `batch` divides it into batches of size 32, and `prefetch` improves performance by pre-fetching data in the background.  This ensures that the model receives data in manageable batches, efficiently using GPU memory.

**Example 3: Correct Data Handling using a Generator:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Assume X_train and y_train are large NumPy arrays representing the entire dataset

def data_generator(X, y, batch_size):
    while True:
        for i in range(0, len(X), batch_size):
            yield X[i:i+batch_size], y[i:i+batch_size]

model = keras.Sequential([Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)), Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Correct: Using a custom generator for batching
model.fit(data_generator(X_train, y_train, 32), steps_per_epoch=len(X_train)//32, epochs=10)
```

This approach utilizes a custom generator function, `data_generator`.  The generator yields data in batches of size 32.  Crucially, `steps_per_epoch` is explicitly set to the number of batches in the dataset. This informs Keras how many batches to expect from the generator, preventing unexpected behavior.  This is often preferred for exceptionally large datasets where creating a `tf.data.Dataset` in memory might still present challenges.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation,  the Keras documentation, and specialized deep learning textbooks focusing on practical implementation details and efficient data handling strategies are invaluable resources.  Pay close attention to sections covering data preprocessing, dataset management, and model training optimization within these materials.  Furthermore,  thorough understanding of Python generators and the intricacies of memory management in Python and the chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow or Theano) are essential for avoiding such issues.  Familiarity with profiling tools for memory usage can further aid in debugging and optimization.
