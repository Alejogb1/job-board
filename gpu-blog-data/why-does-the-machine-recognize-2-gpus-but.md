The observed behavior—a system recognizing two GPUs but exclusively utilizing CPU 0 for computation—typically stems from a misconfiguration within the software stack responsible for resource allocation.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across diverse high-performance computing environments, including large-scale simulations and deep learning clusters, points to several potential root causes, primarily involving driver conflicts, incorrect environment variables, and flawed application code.  Let's systematically examine these possibilities.

**1. Driver Conflicts and Installation Issues:**

The most frequent culprit is inadequate or conflicting GPU driver installations.  Even seemingly minor version mismatches between drivers and CUDA toolkit versions can lead to the system defaulting to CPU computation. The operating system may recognize the GPUs, reflecting their presence in the hardware inventory, but the necessary software interfaces to access their computational capabilities might be missing or corrupted.  I recall a project involving a heterogeneous cluster where a poorly managed driver update led to precisely this issue.  After painstakingly verifying every node’s driver installation against a validated baseline configuration, the problem was resolved by reinstalling the drivers on all nodes using a consistent, verified package.

**2. Environment Variable Conflicts and Missing Dependencies:**

Many high-performance computing libraries and frameworks, particularly those dealing with parallel processing, rely heavily on environment variables to determine resource allocation. Variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, and `PATH` significantly influence how applications access GPUs and CPUs. Incorrect settings or missing entries can prevent the application from identifying or utilizing the available GPUs, causing it to fall back to the CPU. For example, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` controls which GPUs CUDA-enabled applications can see. If this variable is unset or set to an empty string, or if it points to a non-existent GPU, the application will default to the CPU.  I've personally encountered numerous situations where a simple oversight in setting this variable, especially during deployment across various systems, resulted in unwanted CPU-only execution.  It's crucial to verify these environment variables at the shell level before running the application to avoid such issues.

**3. Application Code Limitations and API Usage:**

The application code itself might be the source of the problem. It’s possible the program explicitly instructs the runtime environment to use only the CPU or lacks the necessary code to handle multiple GPUs.  This is particularly common in cases of legacy code or when integrating libraries that haven’t been properly adapted for multi-GPU environments.  In one instance, I was tasked with optimizing a legacy weather simulation application.  The code, written prior to the widespread adoption of multi-GPU computing, only utilized OpenMP for parallelization, confining processing to the CPU despite the presence of high-end GPUs.  Refactoring the code to use CUDA or OpenCL libraries and modifying the parallelization strategy to leverage multiple GPUs required a substantial effort, but substantially improved performance.

Let's illustrate with code examples:

**Example 1:  Incorrect CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES setting (Bash Script)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Incorrect setting - only CPU will be used
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""

# Run the application
./my_application
```

**Commentary:**  This script demonstrates how setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to an empty string effectively disables GPU access for CUDA-enabled applications.  The application will solely use the CPU, even if multiple GPUs are present and recognized by the system.  The correct setting would be to specify the GPU IDs, for example `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1"` to utilize GPUs 0 and 1.


**Example 2:  Python code with incomplete GPU usage (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Data initialization
data = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)

# Computation - CPU-bound
result = np.sum(data)

print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Commentary:** This Python snippet performs a simple sum operation on a NumPy array. While NumPy can utilize multiple cores of a CPU through parallelization strategies within its implementation, it doesn't inherently utilize GPUs. To leverage GPU capabilities, one would need to use libraries like CuPy, which provide GPU-accelerated equivalents of NumPy functions. The absence of GPU-specific libraries prevents GPU utilization, forcing the computation onto the CPU.


**Example 3:  Illustrative C++ code with explicit CPU selection (C++)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
  // Explicitly sets the number of threads to 1 (single CPU core)
  omp_set_num_threads(1);

  #pragma omp parallel
  {
    int id = omp_get_thread_num();
    std::cout << "Hello from thread " << id << " on CPU\n";
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This C++ example uses OpenMP for parallelization. However, `omp_set_num_threads(1)` explicitly limits the number of threads to one, effectively confining the computation to a single CPU core. Even if multiple CPUs or GPUs were available, this code would deliberately avoid using them.  Removing this line or setting it to a higher value (e.g., `omp_get_max_threads()`) would allow OpenMP to utilize multiple CPU cores, but still wouldn't leverage GPU resources.  For GPU acceleration, one would need to integrate CUDA or OpenCL calls into the code.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the documentation for your specific GPU vendor (Nvidia, AMD, etc.), reviewing the manuals for relevant libraries (CUDA, OpenCL, ROCm), and thoroughly examining the documentation for your operating system's parallel processing capabilities.  Familiarizing yourself with performance monitoring tools will be invaluable for pinpointing bottlenecks and verifying resource utilization.  Moreover, exploring advanced topics in parallel programming and high-performance computing will solidify your understanding of the underlying principles.  Finally, engaging with online communities focused on HPC and GPU programming provides access to collective knowledge and expert advice.
