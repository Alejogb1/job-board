The sudden emergence of NaN (Not a Number) values in the weights of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network during training typically indicates a numerical instability stemming from the interaction of the algorithm's loss function and the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic. I've encountered this issue multiple times in my experience implementing reinforcement learning agents, and the root cause is often more nuanced than a single isolated error.

The core issue revolves around the PPO algorithm's update mechanism. PPO is designed to prevent drastic policy changes by imposing a clipping constraint on the ratio of new to old action probabilities. While this clipping is intended to stabilize learning, it can inadvertently exacerbate existing numerical issues if the input probabilities become extremely small or large. When this happens during updates based on these probabilities, the gradients generated can explode.

Specifically, the PPO objective function includes a ratio term, which is defined as `new_prob / old_prob`. If the `old_prob` approaches zero, this ratio can quickly become a large number. Furthermore, the surrogate loss term, which is constructed from the clipped and unclipped ratios multiplied by the advantage, can become very large. Multiplying this large number by gradients during backpropagation can result in gradients that are too large to be handled effectively using finite precision floating point representation, causing the loss to go to NaN. The subsequent weight updates will then be undefined, propagating NaNs throughout the network.

Several factors can contribute to the accumulation of these problematic probabilities. Firstly, the output layer of the actor network, which usually provides probabilities through a softmax or sigmoid function, is prone to producing very small values. Small, often initial, weight values can lead to outputs where one element of the probability vector is close to 1, while others are close to 0. During an exploration phase, when random actions are chosen, these low probability actions are taken, and that update may result in an NaN when that very low probability goes to the denominator.

Secondly, advantages, calculated as rewards minus a baseline, are also pivotal in this context. If the magnitude of advantages is unconstrained or not normalized and if they become too large, they can further amplify the already high values present in the loss function, pushing the gradients to extremes. Furthermore, numerical precision is often an issue with large advantage values during updates. It is very important to scale these advantages to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Finally, while less common, initialization of weights with large values can also lead to an exploding gradient problem and hence the NaN. It's generally recommended to initialize weights using methods like Xavier or He initialization to avoid this. Incorrect coding in the advantage calculation will also lead to extremely high advantage values causing instability.

Here are three code examples illustrating situations where this issue might arise, along with the appropriate analysis:

**Example 1: Unstable Probability Calculation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ActorNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(ActorNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.softmax(x, dim=-1)  # Unstable: Can yield near-zero probs

input_size = 10
output_size = 4
actor = ActorNetwork(input_size, output_size)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size)
probs = actor(input_tensor)
print(probs)

# Suppose old_probs were also small.
old_probs = probs * 0.1
ratio = probs / old_probs
print(ratio)
advantage = torch.tensor(1000.0)  # large advantage
surrogate1 = ratio * advantage
print (surrogate1)

clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 0.8, 1.2)
surrogate2 = clipped_ratio * advantage
print (surrogate2)
loss = -torch.min(surrogate1,surrogate2)
print(loss)
loss.backward()

# In the above case, the ratio value will be quite large and multiplied by
#  advantage that is also quite large. This will result in a very large
#  loss value and associated gradients.
```
In this code, the final probabilities are calculated by the `softmax` function. If the outputs of `self.fc2` are such that one of them is significantly larger than the others, then the resulting probabilities might be small values. Subsequent operations, particularly division and multiplication by large advantages, increase the likelihood of numerical instability. As seen, the loss goes to NaN after the backpropagation and the gradients will also be NaNs.

**Example 2: Unbounded Advantages**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

class SimpleNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size):
        super(SimpleNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

input_size = 5
model = SimpleNetwork(input_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for i in range (10):
    state = torch.randn(1, input_size)
    action = np.random.rand()

    value = model(state)
    old_value = value * 0.5
    reward = 1000.0 * np.random.rand()
    
    
    advantage = reward - old_value
    loss = (value - reward)**2
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    for param in model.parameters():
        if torch.isnan(param).any():
            print("NaN found")
```
Here, the advantage is calculated as a simple difference between the reward and the old value outputted by the network, without any normalization. A large reward directly translates to a large advantage. During updates, this can create large gradients and NaN's. This example shows how using the advantage without normalization can lead to NaN's in the gradients.

**Example 3: Incorrect Ratio Calculation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Actor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(Actor, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.softmax(x, dim=-1)

input_size = 10
output_size = 4
actor = Actor(input_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(actor.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for i in range (10):
    state = torch.randn(1, input_size)
    old_action_prob = actor(state).detach()
    action_prob = actor(state)
    action = np.random.choice(range(output_size), p=action_prob.squeeze().detach().numpy())
    advantage = 1000 * np.random.rand()

    ratio = action_prob[:,action] / old_action_prob[:,action]
    clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 0.8, 1.2)
    surrogate = torch.min(ratio*advantage,clipped_ratio*advantage)
    
    loss = -surrogate
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    for param in actor.parameters():
        if torch.isnan(param).any():
            print("NaN found")

```

This example exhibits an error where the ratio is calculated by dividing probabilities that might be small. Also, large advantages are used, hence increasing the chances of NaN during loss calculation and propagation.

To mitigate these issues, Iâ€™d suggest the following best practices, based on my experience. Firstly, consider adding a small constant (epsilon) to the denominator while calculating the probability ratio `(new_prob / (old_prob + epsilon))`. This will prevent division by zero or very small numbers, stabilizing the calculations. I recommend setting the value of `epsilon` between 1e-8 to 1e-5. Secondly, normalize advantages before using them to update the policy. This can be achieved by subtracting the mean advantage and dividing by the standard deviation. Furthermore, careful initialization of weights using Xavier or He initialization can prevent large weights from occurring, thus minimizing instabilities. Also, consider gradient clipping to ensure the gradients are not too high. Finally, during debugging, examine the values of the ratios, advantages, and the loss function itself as these values often hold clues to any underlying numerical instabilities.

For further reading and theoretical background I would recommend checking resources such as the original PPO paper by Schulman et al., textbooks on reinforcement learning that discuss numerical stability concerns, and online tutorials and documentation on popular reinforcement learning frameworks. Implementations of PPO found in these frameworks also provide examples that demonstrate these recommendations for improved stability. These additional resources can enhance understanding of the underlying mechanisms and lead to more robust solutions.
