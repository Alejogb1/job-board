The crucial element in employing custom loss functions with placeholders in Keras lies in understanding the underlying TensorFlow (or Theano, depending on your Keras backend) graph construction.  Placeholders aren't directly integrated into the loss function's computation; instead, they serve as input tensors during the `fit` or `train_on_batch` methods.  The loss function itself remains a callable object that receives tensors as arguments.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale image classification projects highlighted this critical distinction.  Misunderstanding this leads to common errors involving `TypeError` exceptions related to incompatible tensor shapes or types.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Keras custom loss function is essentially a Python function that takes two primary arguments: `y_true` (the ground truth labels) and `y_pred` (the model's predictions). These are TensorFlow/Theano tensors, not NumPy arrays.  The function should compute a scalar value representing the loss for a single batch.  Crucially, any placeholder values you intend to use within the loss calculation need to be fed as `feed_dict` arguments (if using TensorFlow backend) during the training process, not directly incorporated into the loss function's definition. They are essentially external parameters influencing the loss calculation rather than integral parts of the loss function's structure.

The Keras `fit` method offers mechanisms (via `feed_dict` in the underlying TensorFlow session or equivalent in Theano) to supply these placeholder values at each training step. This approach allows for dynamic adjustments to the loss function's behavior depending on external factors or hyperparameters, adding substantial flexibility to model training.  Incorrectly attempting to embed placeholders directly into the loss function definition will usually result in the placeholders being treated as constants during graph construction, hindering the desired dynamic behavior.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Weighted Loss with a Placeholder for Weight Adjustment:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Placeholder for weight adjustment
weight_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=())

def weighted_mse(y_true, y_pred):
    weighted_loss = K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true) * weight_placeholder)
    return weighted_loss

# Model definition (example)
input_layer = Input(shape=(10,))
dense_layer = Dense(1, activation='linear')(input_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=weighted_mse)

# Training data
x_train = ... # Your training data
y_train = ... # Your training labels

# Training loop with placeholder feeding
with tf.Session() as sess:
    K.set_session(sess)
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(10):
        weight = 1.0 + epoch * 0.1  # Dynamic weight adjustment
        loss = model.train_on_batch(x_train, y_train, feed_dict={weight_placeholder: weight})
        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss}, Weight: {weight}")

```

This example demonstrates a simple mean squared error (MSE) loss function with a dynamically adjusted weight. The weight is controlled by a placeholder, `weight_placeholder`, and is fed to the TensorFlow session during each training batch.  Note that the placeholder is *outside* the `weighted_mse` function.  The `train_on_batch` method facilitates the feeding of the placeholder value.

**Example 2:  Loss Function with a Threshold Placeholder:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

threshold_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=())

def threshold_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  diff = K.abs(y_true - y_pred)
  loss = K.mean(K.switch(diff > threshold_placeholder, diff * 10.0, diff)) # Penalize large differences more
  return loss

# ... (Model definition remains similar to Example 1) ...

#Training loop
with tf.Session() as sess:
    K.set_session(sess)
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(10):
        threshold = 0.5 + epoch * 0.05 # Dynamic threshold adjustment
        loss = model.train_on_batch(x_train, y_train, feed_dict={threshold_placeholder: threshold})
        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss}, Threshold: {threshold}")

```

This showcases a loss function where the penalty applied to prediction errors is influenced by a dynamically changing threshold, defined by `threshold_placeholder`.  Large deviations exceeding the threshold are penalized more heavily. This strategy is commonly used in robust regression techniques. Again, the placeholder is separate from the loss function itself.

**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Placeholders:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

weight1_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=())
weight2_placeholder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=())

def multi_weighted_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  loss = K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true) * (weight1_placeholder + weight2_placeholder))
  return loss

# ... (Model definition similar to previous examples) ...

# Training loop
with tf.Session() as sess:
    K.set_session(sess)
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(10):
        weight1 = 0.5 + epoch * 0.025
        weight2 = 1.0 - epoch * 0.05
        loss = model.train_on_batch(x_train, y_train, feed_dict={weight1_placeholder: weight1, weight2_placeholder: weight2})
        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss}, Weight1: {weight1}, Weight2: {weight2}")

```

This example extends the concept to incorporate two placeholders, allowing for even more complex control over the loss function's behavior. The `feed_dict` argument now handles both placeholders concurrently.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation, TensorFlow documentation (especially sections on graph execution and placeholders), and relevant academic papers on loss functions for specific applications (e.g., robust regression, focal loss for imbalanced datasets) offer further insights.  Consider exploring textbooks on deep learning and machine learning for a more fundamental understanding of loss functions and optimization.  Consult specialized literature focusing on TensorFlow/Theano backend specifics if encountering intricate integration challenges.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and calculus is vital for understanding and creating effective custom loss functions.
