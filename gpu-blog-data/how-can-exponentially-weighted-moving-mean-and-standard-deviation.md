Working with high-frequency financial data, I've frequently encountered the challenge of needing robust statistical measures that adapt quickly to changing market conditions, while also appropriately handling irregular time intervals. The standard moving average, equally weighting each data point within a window, falls short in such situations.  Exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) and its corresponding standard deviation offer a powerful solution, but adapting them to both weighted and irregularly spaced time series requires careful consideration. The core principle lies in adapting the typical decay factor to account for the varying time gaps between observations and potentially differing data weights. Here's how this can be accomplished:

**Understanding the Core Concepts**

The traditional EWMA assigns a greater weight to recent data, diminishing the influence of older data exponentially. This is governed by a smoothing factor, often represented as 'alpha' (α) or 'lambda' (λ).  For a regular time series with a decay factor λ, the EWMA at time *t* ( *ewma<sub>t</sub>*) is calculated as:

*ewma<sub>t</sub>*  = λ * *x<sub>t</sub>*  + (1 - λ) * *ewma<sub>t-1</sub>*

where *x<sub>t</sub>* is the data point at time *t*.

The challenge arises when the time series is irregular.  The time between observations, Δ*t*,  varies, and we need to scale the decay factor appropriately to account for this. If Δ*t* is large, we should discount the previous EWMA more heavily as it becomes less representative of current conditions. We introduce a time-decay adjustment to the 'lambda', leading to an *effective_lambda* at time *t*. The data weights also play a crucial role, scaling the contribution of each data point to the calculation.

For the standard deviation, we leverage the fact that variance is closely tied to the expected value of the square of deviations from the mean. By tracking a second EWMA of squared deviations, we can estimate the variance and subsequently the standard deviation. This also needs to be adjusted by the effective decay factor.

**Implementation Details**

The core idea is to calculate, for each new data point, the *effective_lambda* based on the time difference since the last observation and the chosen lambda. Let's use the symbol τ for our decay parameter, which we will adjust to be *effective_τ* based on the actual time difference *Δt*. The effective decay parameter (*effective_τ*), where τ is set a priori, will be adjusted based on the formula:

*effective_τ*<sub>t</sub> = exp(-Δ*t* / τ)

This scales the decay rate by the elapsed time between observations. A smaller time difference results in a larger effective lambda and vice versa. The same principle applies to the weighted component, multiplying the data point value by its weight.  We can use *w<sub>t</sub>* to denote the weight of the data point at time *t*.

The EWMA update rule becomes:

*ewma<sub>t</sub>*  = *effective_τ*<sub>t</sub> * *w<sub>t</sub>* * *x<sub>t</sub>*  + (1 - *effective_τ*<sub>t</sub>) * *ewma<sub>t-1</sub>*

The variance calculation then becomes a variation of this, tracking the moving mean of the squared deviations from the mean:

*variance<sub>t</sub>* = *effective_τ*<sub>t</sub> * ( *w<sub>t</sub>* *  *x<sub>t</sub>* - *ewma<sub>t</sub>*)<sup>2</sup> + (1-*effective_τ*<sub>t</sub>) * *variance<sub>t-1</sub>*

and standard deviation:

*std<sub>t</sub>* = sqrt(*variance<sub>t</sub>*)

This two step computation provides a robust and adaptable method for handling our described data type. The choice of the initial decay parameter (τ) is critical as it determines the memory of the EWMA, with smaller values resulting in faster adjustments to changes in the data.

**Code Examples**

Let’s explore some code examples. I prefer using Python due to its flexibility and excellent numerical libraries.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_weighted_ewma(times, values, weights, decay_parameter):
    """
    Calculates the weighted exponentially-weighted moving average for an
    irregularly-spaced time series.

    Args:
        times:  A list of timestamps representing the observation times.
        values: A list of values corresponding to each timestamp.
        weights: A list of weights corresponding to each value.
        decay_parameter: The time decay parameter (tau).

    Returns:
        A list of exponentially-weighted moving averages.
    """
    ewma_values = []
    last_ewma = 0  # Initial value for EWMA

    for i in range(len(times)):
        if i == 0:
          # Handle first element edge case
          effective_lambda = 0
        else:
          delta_t = times[i] - times[i-1]
          effective_lambda = np.exp(-delta_t / decay_parameter)

        weighted_value = values[i] * weights[i] # Apply weight to the data
        if i == 0:
          ewma_values.append(weighted_value)
        else:
          ewma = effective_lambda * weighted_value + (1 - effective_lambda) * last_ewma
          ewma_values.append(ewma)
          last_ewma = ewma

    return ewma_values

#Example Usage:
times = [0, 1, 3, 4.5, 8, 9.2]
values = [10, 12, 15, 13, 18, 20]
weights = [0.8, 1.0, 0.9, 1.1, 0.7, 1.2]
decay_parameter = 2

ewmas = calculate_weighted_ewma(times, values, weights, decay_parameter)
print("Weighted EWMA:", ewmas)
```

This function calculates the weighted EWMA. It iterates through the time series, calculates the *effective_lambda*, and applies the EWMA formula. It handles the initial value by using the weighted value of the first data point.

```python
def calculate_weighted_ewmstd(times, values, weights, decay_parameter):
    """

    an irregularly-spaced time series.

        weights: A list of weights corresponding to each value.
        decay_parameter: The time decay parameter (tau).

    Returns:

    """
    ewma_values = []
    ewmvar_values = []
    ewmstd_values = []
    last_ewma = 0
    last_ewmvar = 0


    for i in range(len(times)):
        if i == 0:
          effective_lambda = 0
        else:
          delta_t = times[i] - times[i-1]
          effective_lambda = np.exp(-delta_t / decay_parameter)

        weighted_value = values[i] * weights[i] # Apply weight to the data
        if i == 0:
          ewma = weighted_value
          ewmvar = 0  #Initial variance is 0.
        else:
          ewma = effective_lambda * weighted_value + (1 - effective_lambda) * last_ewma
          ewmvar = effective_lambda * (weighted_value - ewma)**2 + (1 - effective_lambda) * last_ewmvar

        ewma_values.append(ewma)
        ewmvar_values.append(ewmvar)
        ewmstd_values.append(np.sqrt(ewmvar))
        last_ewma = ewma
        last_ewmvar = ewmvar

    return ewmstd_values

#Example Usage:
times = [0, 1, 3, 4.5, 8, 9.2]
values = [10, 12, 15, 13, 18, 20]
weights = [0.8, 1.0, 0.9, 1.1, 0.7, 1.2]
decay_parameter = 2

ewmstd = calculate_weighted_ewmstd(times, values, weights, decay_parameter)
print("Weighted EWM STD:", ewmstd)
```

This second example calculates the weighted, time-adjusted, exponentially-weighted standard deviation.  It extends the first function by calculating both the moving average and the moving variance at each step.

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_weighted_ewma_pandas(df, time_col, value_col, weight_col, decay_parameter):
   """
   Calculates the weighted exponentially-weighted moving average using pandas.

   Args:
       df: A pandas DataFrame containing the time series data.
       time_col: The name of the column containing timestamps.
       value_col: The name of the column containing the values.
       weight_col: The name of the column containing the weights.
       decay_parameter: The time decay parameter (tau).

   Returns:
        A pandas Series containing the EWMA values.
   """
   df = df.sort_values(time_col)
   df['delta_t'] = df[time_col].diff().fillna(0)
   df['effective_lambda'] = np.exp(-df['delta_t'] / decay_parameter)
   df['weighted_value'] = df[value_col] * df[weight_col]
   ewma = df['weighted_value'].ewm(alpha = lambda index, : df['effective_lambda'].iloc[index]).mean()
   return ewma

# Example Usage
data = {
    'time': [0, 1, 3, 4.5, 8, 9.2],
    'value': [10, 12, 15, 13, 18, 20],
    'weight': [0.8, 1.0, 0.9, 1.1, 0.7, 1.2]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
decay_parameter = 2
ewma_series = calculate_weighted_ewma_pandas(df, 'time', 'value', 'weight', decay_parameter)
print("Weighted EWMA (Pandas):", ewma_series.values)
```

This last example showcases how to implement it using pandas.  This leverages pandas' built in exponential weighted moving average function, applying our derived effective lambda at each time step. This can be more concise and performant for larger datasets.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper theoretical understanding, I suggest referring to textbooks focused on time series analysis and stochastic processes, specifically those that discuss volatility modeling. Material on signal processing can be useful, particularly on filter theory. For practical implementations, libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and SciPy offer valuable functions for numeric calculations and data manipulation. Finally, research papers focused on statistical applications in finance, particularly those related to high-frequency data, provide real-world context and advanced techniques. I would also recommend practicing by simulating datasets with varying degrees of time irregularity and implementing these calculations from scratch. This builds fundamental skills and allows for deeper optimization.
