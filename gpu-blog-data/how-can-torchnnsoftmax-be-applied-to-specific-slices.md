The core challenge in applying `torch.nn.softmax` to specific slices of a tensor within a PyTorch network lies in effectively leveraging advanced indexing techniques to isolate the relevant portions of the tensor before applying the softmax function.  My experience in developing large-scale natural language processing models frequently necessitates this level of granular control over activation normalization.  Failing to do so can lead to incorrect normalization, potentially impacting model performance and training stability.  This necessitates a precise understanding of PyTorch's tensor manipulation capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The `torch.nn.softmax` function, by default, operates on the entire input tensor along a specified dimension.  However, situations often arise where softmax needs to be applied independently to different segments of a tensor.  Consider a scenario where your tensor represents a sequence of word embeddings, and you want to normalize the embeddings for each word individually.  Applying softmax to the entire tensor would be incorrect, as it would normalize across words instead of within each word's embedding.

To achieve slice-wise softmax, you must first identify and extract the relevant tensor slices.  This is usually accomplished through advanced indexing techniques using NumPy-style slicing or boolean masking.  Once the slices are extracted, `torch.nn.softmax` can be applied independently to each slice.  Finally, these processed slices are reassembled into the original tensor structure.

Efficiently accomplishing this requires careful consideration of tensor dimensions and the desired softmax application axis.  Misaligned dimensions during slicing and reassembly will lead to shape mismatches and runtime errors.  Furthermore, the choice between using loops for iterative processing of slices or employing more advanced PyTorch functions such as `torch.chunk` or `torch.split` for parallel processing significantly affects computational efficiency, especially with large tensors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Slice-wise softmax using loops**

This example demonstrates a straightforward approach using explicit loops.  It is suitable for smaller tensors or situations where readability is prioritized over maximum performance.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def slicewise_softmax_loop(input_tensor, slice_size):
    """Applies softmax to slices of a tensor using a loop.

    Args:
        input_tensor: The input tensor.  Assumed to be 2D or higher.
        slice_size: The size of each slice along the first dimension.

    Returns:
        The tensor with slice-wise softmax applied.
    """
    num_slices = input_tensor.shape[0] // slice_size
    output_tensor = torch.empty_like(input_tensor)
    for i in range(num_slices):
        start = i * slice_size
        end = (i + 1) * slice_size
        slice = input_tensor[start:end]
        output_tensor[start:end] = F.softmax(slice, dim=-1) #Softmax applied along the last dimension
    return output_tensor

# Example usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(6, 5)  #6 slices of 5 elements each
slice_size = 2
result = slicewise_softmax_loop(input_tensor, slice_size)
print(result)
```

This code iterates through the tensor, extracts slices of `slice_size`, applies `F.softmax` to each slice along the last dimension (adaptable based on needs), and reassembles the result.  The `empty_like` function ensures efficient memory allocation for the output.


**Example 2: Slice-wise softmax using `torch.chunk`**

This approach uses `torch.chunk` for parallel processing, enhancing efficiency for larger tensors.  It is less readable but significantly faster.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def slicewise_softmax_chunk(input_tensor, num_chunks):
    """Applies softmax to slices of a tensor using torch.chunk.

    Args:
        input_tensor: The input tensor.
        num_chunks: The number of slices to split the tensor into.

    Returns:
        The tensor with slice-wise softmax applied.  Returns None if chunking fails.
    """
    try:
      slices = torch.chunk(input_tensor, num_chunks, dim=0) #Chunk along the first dimension
      processed_slices = [F.softmax(slice, dim=-1) for slice in slices]
      return torch.cat(processed_slices, dim=0)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error during chunking: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(6, 5)
num_chunks = 3
result = slicewise_softmax_chunk(input_tensor, num_chunks)
print(result)
```

Here, `torch.chunk` divides the tensor into the specified number of chunks,  `F.softmax` is applied to each chunk in parallel (using a list comprehension for conciseness), and `torch.cat` reassembles the result.  Error handling is included to address potential issues with uneven chunking.


**Example 3: Slice-wise softmax using boolean masking and advanced indexing**

This example demonstrates a more flexible approach using boolean masking, particularly useful for irregular slice selection.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def slicewise_softmax_mask(input_tensor, mask):
    """Applies softmax to slices of a tensor using boolean masking.

    Args:
        input_tensor: The input tensor.
        mask: A boolean tensor of the same shape as input_tensor indicating slices.

    Returns:
        The tensor with slice-wise softmax applied. Returns None if masking fails
    """
    try:
        output_tensor = torch.empty_like(input_tensor)
        unique_mask_values = torch.unique(mask)
        for value in unique_mask_values:
            slice_indices = torch.where(mask == value)[0]
            slice = input_tensor[slice_indices]
            output_tensor[slice_indices] = F.softmax(slice, dim=-1)
        return output_tensor
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error during masking: {e}")
        return None


# Example usage: Applying softmax to every other row
input_tensor = torch.randn(6, 5)
mask = torch.arange(6) % 2 == 0 #Mask selects even-indexed rows
result = slicewise_softmax_mask(input_tensor, mask)
print(result)
```

This method utilizes a boolean mask to select the slices.  The code iterates through unique mask values, extracts slices based on the mask, and applies `F.softmax`.  This approach is especially versatile when you need to apply softmax to non-contiguous or irregularly shaped portions of the tensor.  Error handling is included to manage potential issues.
