Trained TensorFlow models represent a learned mapping from input features to desired outputs, and utilizing them for prediction on new, unseen data involves a consistent process of preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing. My experience building several image classification and time-series forecasting systems highlights the criticality of adhering to these steps for reliable predictions.

The initial step, crucial for successful inference, is preparing the new data so it matches the format and transformations applied to the training data. A TensorFlow model does not inherently know how to handle raw data; it expects input in a specific tensor shape, numerical type, and potentially scaled or normalized values. This preprocessing stage often involves several sub-tasks: data loading, transformation, and conversion to tensor objects.

First, load the new input data. If the model was trained with image data, this involves reading the image from the file path and decoding it. For tabular data, I use libraries like `pandas` to read CSV or other formatted files. The specific loading procedure will naturally vary depending on the input data’s format. It is important that the loading routine mirrors the one employed during the training phase. Inconsistent formats are a frequent cause of prediction errors.

Following loading, data transformation is paramount. If images were resized, rescaled, or augmented during training, the same transformations need to be applied during inference. Resizing ensures consistency of input dimensions, which the model expects. Rescaling or normalization using the training data's means and standard deviations avoids input distributions that differ significantly from what the model is optimized for. Any missing value imputation, one-hot encoding, or any other data specific transformations must be repeated precisely. The model will interpret these features in the context of the training process so these steps are not optional.

Finally, the transformed data must be converted into a TensorFlow tensor. This involves specifying the tensor’s data type to match the model’s input layer and arranging data in the correct shape (e.g., batch size, number of channels, height, and width). Often a `tf.constant` or `tf.convert_to_tensor` function is used to perform this conversion. When processing a single prediction, a batch dimension must still be included for use in the `model.predict()` function.

Once the new input data is prepared, using it to generate predictions from the trained TensorFlow model is straightforward. The `model.predict()` method is the core function used for inference. This function accepts the preprocessed input tensor and returns the model’s output, which itself is in the form of a tensor object. The output tensor's structure will depend upon the model’s architecture and the final layer. Classification problems typically yield a vector of probabilities, while regression problems output scalar or vector-valued predictions. For models involving multiple outputs, such as object detectors, the output structure will become more complex, potentially involving multiple tensors.

The final stage involves processing the model’s raw output to extract meaningful predictions. This postprocessing depends heavily on the specific task the model was trained for. For example, in classification problems, it is common to convert the probability vector into predicted class labels by selecting the class with the highest probability. Regression tasks may require no further processing, though sometimes an inverse scaling operation is needed to revert from a normalized domain. When working with object detection models, this stage includes the parsing of bounding box coordinates and classification labels.

The following code samples illustrate these stages for a common image classification task and a regression task.

**Code Example 1: Image Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

#Assume model is loaded
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_image_classifier.h5")

def predict_image(image_path, image_size=(224, 224)):
    # 1. Load image
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    image = image.convert('RGB') # Ensure RGB format if necessary
    # 2. Resize image to expected model input size.
    image = image.resize(image_size)

    # 3. Convert to numpy array, then expand dimension for batching
    image = np.array(image)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)

    # 4. Normalize values. Assume mean and std were stored previously.
    mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
    std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    image = (image / 255.0 - mean) / std

    # 5. Convert to Tensor and predict.
    image_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image, dtype=tf.float32)
    predictions = model.predict(image_tensor)

    # 6. Post-process. Find class with highest probability.
    predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions)

    return predicted_class

# Example usage
image_path = "new_image.jpg"
predicted_label = predict_image(image_path)
print("Predicted Class:", predicted_label)

```

This example demonstrates the common steps of loading a new image using Pillow, resizing it to fit the model's required input shape, converting to a NumPy array, adding a batch dimension, and normalizing using a pre-defined mean and standard deviation. The normalized image is converted to a tensor and fed into the model. The predicted class is determined through `argmax` to identify the index of the highest probability. The normalization parameters (`mean`, `std`) must match those used during training.

**Code Example 2: Tabular Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Assuming a linear regression model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_regression_model.h5")

def predict_tabular(data_path):
    # 1. Load data with pandas.
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # 2. Select features used for training.
    feature_cols = ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']
    data = df[feature_cols].values

    # 3. Scale features. Assumes scaler data is known from training.
    feature_means = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    feature_stds = np.array([0.5, 1.0, 0.75])

    data = (data - feature_means) / feature_stds

    # 4. Convert to tensor and predict. Add batch dimension
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(data.reshape(1,-1), dtype=tf.float32)
    predictions = model.predict(input_tensor)
    # 5. No further post-processing is shown, this may include unscaling.

    return predictions[0][0]  #Return first (and only) prediction.

# Example usage.
data_path = "new_data.csv"
predicted_value = predict_tabular(data_path)
print("Predicted Value:", predicted_value)
```

This example illustrates data loading from a CSV file using pandas and feature scaling using pre-calculated means and standard deviations. The scaled data is reshaped to introduce a batch dimension, converted to a TensorFlow tensor, and finally fed into the model. The output represents a single scalar value, without any postprocessing which might be required for other models. This demonstrates that models for a different task require task specific data preprocessing.

**Code Example 3: Time Series Forecasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a time series model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_time_series_model.h5")

def predict_timeseries(input_sequence, lookback_window = 10):
    # 1. input_sequence is a numpy array
    input_sequence = np.array(input_sequence)
    # 2. Scale, if this was done during training, ensure to use the same parameters.
    mean_val = 0.5
    std_val = 0.2
    input_sequence = (input_sequence - mean_val) / std_val

    # 3. Reshape data to fit model's input shape: [batch_size, time_steps, feature_dim]
    input_sequence = np.reshape(input_sequence, (1, lookback_window, 1))  #Assuming 1D feature data

    # 4. Convert to Tensor
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_sequence, dtype=tf.float32)

    # 5. Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(input_tensor)
    return predictions #Return all predictions (may require postprocessing)

# Example Usage (assume last 10 values are given for lookback window)
input_data = [1.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 0.7, 0.4, 0.8, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1]
lookback_window = 10
prediction = predict_timeseries(input_data, lookback_window)
print("Predicted Values:", prediction)
```
This example demonstrates usage for a time series forecasting model. The crucial point here is transforming the input sequence to the correct shape [batch_size, time_steps, feature_dim] that the model was trained with. Scaling is performed, and the reshaped and scaled data is transformed to a tensor for use in the predict function. These examples highlight common patterns that often require task specific implementation.

For further resources, I recommend examining TensorFlow documentation on data loading and preprocessing, specifically within the `tf.data` module and the Keras API. Additional texts on numerical computation can be useful for understanding the theoretical basis for preprocessing steps, like normalization and scaling. The Keras documentation itself is a good source for understanding layer inputs and outputs for differing types of models and use cases. These resources will provide a strong foundation for anyone using TensorFlow models for inference.
