The question of GPU sharing hinges on a critical distinction: shared *between processes* versus shared *within a process*.  My experience optimizing high-throughput image processing pipelines has underscored this fundamental difference. While GPUs aren't directly shared in the sense of multiple processes simultaneously accessing the same memory locations concurrently without explicit synchronization mechanisms, significant sharing occurs at the operating system and driver level, mediated through virtualization and context switching.  The implications for performance and programming strategies are substantial.

**1.  Explanation of Shared GPU Access**

A GPU, unlike CPU cores, doesn't inherently support the same level of fine-grained process-level sharing that a multi-core CPU does.  Each process running on a system with a discrete GPU typically has its own dedicated section of GPU memory (VRAM) allocated by the driver.  Direct, unsynchronized access to another process's VRAM is disallowed for security and stability reasons. This prevents one rogue process from corrupting the memory of another.

However, the illusion of sharing is achieved through the operating system and GPU driver.  The driver manages the allocation and switching between different process contexts on the GPU.  When one process relinquishes control, the driver saves its state, loads the state of another process, and that process gains access to the GPU.  This context switching happens rapidly, creating the appearance of concurrent execution, but it's not true simultaneous execution in the same way multiple threads might run concurrently on a multi-core CPU.  The switching overhead can be significant, impacting performance if not carefully managed.  This also extends to virtualized environments where a single physical GPU may be presented as multiple virtual GPUs to different virtual machines.  Each VM's GPU access is then managed and isolated by the hypervisor.

The concept of shared memory *within* a process, however, is entirely different.  Within a single process, multiple threads can access shared GPU memory (through CUDA or OpenCL) using proper synchronization primitives like mutexes or atomic operations. This is crucial for efficient parallelization of tasks within a single application.  Failure to utilize these mechanisms correctly will lead to data races and unpredictable results.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of GPU access and sharing, focusing on the nuances of CUDA programming.  Note that analogous principles apply to other GPU programming frameworks like OpenCL.

**Example 1:  Illustrating exclusive GPU access within a single process**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *dev_ptr;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr, 1024); // Allocate memory on the GPU

    // Perform computations on dev_ptr...

    cudaFree(dev_ptr); // Free GPU memory
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates exclusive GPU memory allocation within a single process. The `cudaMalloc` function allocates a block of memory on the GPU, solely accessible by the current process. This memory is not shared with other processes. The cleanup is handled by `cudaFree`.  This is the typical scenario for most single-threaded GPU applications.

**Example 2: Shared memory within a process using CUDA threads**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    int *a, *b, *c;
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // Allocate host memory
    a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    b = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    c = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize host memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = i;
        b[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // Copy host memory to device memory
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    // Copy device memory to host memory
    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Verify results
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (c[i] != a[i] + b[i]) {
            printf("Error at index %d\n", i);
            return 1;
        }
    }

    // Free memory
    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(c);
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);

    return 0;
}
```

This example illustrates shared memory *within* a single process using CUDA threads. The kernel (`addKernel`) operates on data residing in GPU memory (`d_a`, `d_b`, `d_c`), allowing concurrent processing across multiple threads.  Proper synchronization isn't explicitly shown here (for simplicity), but is crucial in more complex scenarios to prevent data corruption.  Each thread has its own private registers and accesses shared memory, but using the same memory location simultaneously without synchronization will lead to race conditions.


**Example 3:  Illustrating CUDA streams for overlapping operations**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

    // Allocate memory and copy data to GPU (using stream1)
    // ...

    // Kernel launch 1 (using stream1)
    // ...

    // Kernel launch 2 (using stream2)
    // ...

    // Copy results back to host (using stream1 or stream2)
    // ...

    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
    return 0;
}
```

This illustrates the use of CUDA streams to overlap operations.  Streams enable concurrent execution of kernels and memory transfers. While still within a single process, this approach improves performance by hiding latency.  Even though it's a single process, efficient utilization of the GPU involves careful consideration of resource allocation and scheduling.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of GPU architecture and programming, I recommend consulting the official CUDA documentation and programming guides.  Thorough study of parallel programming concepts and algorithms is essential. Textbooks on high-performance computing and parallel algorithms are valuable resources.  Familiarity with operating system internals, specifically the interaction between the OS and the GPU driver, is beneficial for advanced topics.  Finally, researching the specifics of your target GPU architecture and its capabilities is always a good practice.
