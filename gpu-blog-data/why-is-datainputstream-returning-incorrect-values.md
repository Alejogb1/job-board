DataInputStream in Java, designed to read primitive data types from an underlying input stream, can return incorrect values primarily when the bytes being read do not match the expected format. This mismatch arises from discrepancies between the structure of the data written to the stream and the structure assumed by the reading process. My experience working on a distributed logging system, where data integrity was paramount, highlighted this issue repeatedly. A seemingly trivial formatting oversight could propagate incorrect values across the entire network, causing significant headaches during analysis and debugging.

The core problem stems from the fact that `DataInputStream` interprets the incoming byte stream based on the specific read method being called. If you write an integer using `DataOutputStream.writeInt()` (which writes 4 bytes representing an integer in big-endian order), and then attempt to read it using `DataInputStream.readByte()`, you will not retrieve the original integer. Instead, you will obtain a single byte, typically the most significant byte of the integer, converted to a `byte` data type. Similarly, if you have saved a floating-point number using `DataOutputStream.writeFloat()`, reading it as an integer using `DataInputStream.readInt()` will yield a meaningless, truncated value based on interpreting the 4 byte float representation as an integer. This issue is not a flaw in `DataInputStream` itself, but rather a symptom of inconsistent interpretation of data, a challenge prevalent in serialized byte stream contexts.

The data type being used to write to the stream must match the data type being read, and must maintain consistent endianness. Endianness, the ordering of bytes in multi-byte data types, is crucial.  Big-endian (most significant byte first) is commonly used by network protocols, and little-endian (least significant byte first) is prevalent in architectures such as x86. The `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream` in Java use big-endian byte order by default. If the data is written with little-endian conventions, the interpretation will be incorrect unless a custom byte-swapping routine is used.

Let's consider three scenarios to exemplify this.

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type Reading**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataStreamExample1 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Writing an integer to a file
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("data.bin");
            DataOutputStream dataOut = new DataOutputStream(fileOut);
            int originalValue = 12345;
            dataOut.writeInt(originalValue);
            dataOut.close();

            // Attempting to read as a byte
            FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("data.bin");
            DataInputStream dataIn = new DataInputStream(fileIn);
            byte incorrectValue = dataIn.readByte();
            dataIn.close();

           System.out.println("Original Value: " + originalValue);
           System.out.println("Incorrect Value (read as byte): " + incorrectValue);


        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, an integer, 12345, is written to a file using `DataOutputStream.writeInt()`. The `writeInt()` method writes four bytes to the stream, using big-endian ordering. Subsequently, the `DataInputStream.readByte()` attempts to read only a single byte from the same stream, resulting in incorrect value being extracted. The output will not be 12345. Instead the `incorrectValue` will likely correspond to the most significant byte of the integer representation, converted to a byte. In big-endian, this would be 0x00 in this case (assuming an integer representation of 0x00003039), which when cast to byte is `0`. This illustrates a failure to align reading and writing data types.

**Example 2: Endianness Misalignment**

This example requires us to manually convert between big-endian and little-endian. This could be facilitated by a helper method, but for simplicity we will include it inline. This highlights how even with correct datatypes, endianness can present problems

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.ByteOrder;

public class DataStreamExample2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Writing an integer in little-endian order to a file
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("little_endian_data.bin");
            DataOutputStream dataOut = new DataOutputStream(fileOut);
            int originalValue = 65537;

            byte[] littleEndianBytes = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN).putInt(originalValue).array();
            dataOut.write(littleEndianBytes);
            dataOut.close();



            //Attempting to read as big-endian
            FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("little_endian_data.bin");
            DataInputStream dataIn = new DataInputStream(fileIn);
            int incorrectValue = dataIn.readInt();
            dataIn.close();


            System.out.println("Original Value: " + originalValue);
            System.out.println("Incorrect Value (read as big-endian): " + incorrectValue);

            //Correctly reading the little-endian
            fileIn = new FileInputStream("little_endian_data.bin");
            byte[] buffer = new byte[4];
            fileIn.read(buffer);
            fileIn.close();
            int correctlyRead = ByteBuffer.wrap(buffer).order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN).getInt();


            System.out.println("Correct Value (read as little-endian): " + correctlyRead);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the integer 65537 is written in little-endian format. The `DataOutputStream` is used to write the data to the file. In this case however, we first convert the integer into a little-endian byte array, and use `dataOut.write()` which writes raw bytes to the file. The standard `DataInputStream.readInt()` method assumes big-endian data, leading to an incorrect value. Manually reading the data into a byte array and using `ByteBuffer` to read as a little-endian integer demonstrates the correct retrieval of data based on correct endianness.  If the raw bytes were written in big-endian order, then `readInt()` would return the correct value.

**Example 3: Inconsistent Data Stream Structure**

This example highlights the importance of a consistent data stream structure. Imagine we are writing data for three users.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataStreamExample3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Writing data for three users
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("user_data.bin");
            DataOutputStream dataOut = new DataOutputStream(fileOut);
            String[] userNames = {"UserA", "UserB", "UserC"};
            int[] ages = {25, 30, 28};

            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
               dataOut.writeUTF(userNames[i]);
               dataOut.writeInt(ages[i]);
             }
             dataOut.close();


            //Attempting to read in incorrect order
            FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("user_data.bin");
            DataInputStream dataIn = new DataInputStream(fileIn);

           for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
              int age = dataIn.readInt();
              String name = dataIn.readUTF();
              System.out.println("Name: " + name);
              System.out.println("Age: " + age);
            }


           dataIn.close();



           //Reading in the correct order
           fileIn = new FileInputStream("user_data.bin");
           dataIn = new DataInputStream(fileIn);

           for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
              String name = dataIn.readUTF();
              int age = dataIn.readInt();
              System.out.println("Name: " + name);
              System.out.println("Age: " + age);
             }
             dataIn.close();




        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the names of users are written using `writeUTF()` and their ages using `writeInt()`. This is a consistent sequence of string and integer information. If the reading process were to reverse this order and attempt to read an integer first using `readInt()` when a UTF string was written, the results will be garbled. This can be observed from the output. If a string is expected and an integer read is attempted, an exception will occur as the bytes do not conform to a UTF format.  In the second read block, the order is consistent and the data is correctly parsed.  This highlights the need to follow a predefined structure, or use delimiters within the stream itself when reading data.

To mitigate these issues, careful planning of the data serialization format is paramount. Data types used for writing and reading must be identical.  Endians should be consistent. The order in which data elements are written to the stream should be rigorously maintained when reading. Custom error checking and validation should be incorporated if data stream integrity is crucial. When encountering `DataInputStream` returning incorrect values, debugging should focus on identifying discrepancies between writing and reading datatypes, endianness, and the overall stream structure.

For further study, I recommend reviewing resources focused on Java I/O streams, especially `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream` documentation. In addition, resources describing byte ordering conventions (endianness) would be beneficial. Detailed explanations and practical examples can also be found in texts on network programming and data serialization within Java. While specific book titles and URLs are omitted, focus on the fundamentals of stream processing and the specifics of these Java classes.
