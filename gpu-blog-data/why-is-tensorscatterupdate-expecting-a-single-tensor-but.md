The core issue stems from a misunderstanding of how TensorFlow's `tf.tensor_scatter_update` operation is designed to function, specifically its contract with regard to updates. I’ve encountered this exact error multiple times while developing custom graph operations, most recently while implementing a dynamic attention mechanism. The function expects a single tensor of updates that aligns with the indices provided, not a list of tensors, even when those tensors might appear logically as discrete components of an update. This distinction is crucial because `tf.tensor_scatter_update` operates on the assumption of a vectorized update, not independent sub-tensor updates.

The purpose of `tf.tensor_scatter_update` is to apply updates at specific locations, indicated by an `indices` tensor, within a larger target tensor, identified as `tensor`. The `updates` argument is then used to specify the new values to be written at those locations. The crux of the problem lies in the way TensorFlow interprets the dimensionality and structure of the `updates` tensor. Consider that the `indices` tensor typically has a shape of `[N, M]`, where `N` is the number of update locations and `M` the rank of the target tensor being updated. The `updates` tensor must, therefore, have a shape compatible with `[N, X, Y, Z...]`, where `X, Y, Z,...` corresponds to the dimensions of the target tensor after the first `M` dimensions. It's not about passing in individual tensors for each individual index location but rather providing all the new values in a consolidated tensor.

When encountering the "expecting a single tensor but receiving a list of tensors" error, the underlying cause is typically that the user is attempting to construct an update operation piecemeal. Instead of assembling the values to be updated into a single cohesive tensor that matches the shape dictated by the indices, one is trying to pass a Python list of tensors, where each element in the list might represent an intended update at a single index. TensorFlow’s graph execution model, specifically the way it resolves shape and type information during graph construction, expects a single tensor object, not a Python list.

To illustrate, imagine we want to update values within a 3x3 matrix at index locations `[[0, 0], [2, 2]]`. The correct approach involves crafting an updates tensor that encompasses both of these update operations. The error arises if we attempt to pass two separate 1x1 tensors, one for each location, thinking this will be equivalent.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct usage:
target_tensor = tf.zeros((3, 3), dtype=tf.float32)
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [2, 2]], dtype=tf.int32)
updates = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32)
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_update(target_tensor, indices, updates)

print("Correct Update:")
print(updated_tensor.numpy())

# Incorrect usage (producing the error):
updates_list = [tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32), tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)]
# The following line will produce a TypeError: expected a tensor but got a <class 'list'>
# updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_update(target_tensor, indices, updates_list)

```

In the first example, the `updates` tensor directly contains the values to be inserted into the `target_tensor` at the specified `indices`. The shape of `updates` is compatible with the `indices` tensor, enabling the operation to correctly perform the update. Specifically, the shape of `indices` is `[2, 2]` meaning we have two updates to apply. Since we are updating scalar values within our target tensor, our `updates` tensor has shape `[2]` which maps to the update locations identified in `indices`. The second example, which is commented out because it will produce the error, demonstrates how passing a Python list (`updates_list`) instead of a single tensor will cause the reported problem.

Let’s consider a case with multi-dimensional updates. Assume we're updating parts of a 3x3x2 tensor:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Target 3x3x2 tensor
target_tensor = tf.zeros((3, 3, 2), dtype=tf.float32)

# Indices for update:
#    - [0, 1, :] will be updated to [[1, 2]]
#    - [2, 0, :] will be updated to [[3, 4]]
indices = tf.constant([[0, 1], [2, 0]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Correct update tensor: shape must be [2, 2], the first dimension matching length of indices
updates = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0]], [[3.0, 4.0]]], dtype=tf.float32)

updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_update(target_tensor, indices, updates)
print("Multidimensional Updates:")
print(updated_tensor.numpy())

#Incorrect usage (conceptually what is incorrect even if this compiles due to tf.stack)
# Note: This will compile and run *but it is not what tf.tensor_scatter_update expects* 
incorrect_updates_list = [tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]], dtype=tf.float32), tf.constant([[3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)]
incorrect_updates_tensor = tf.stack(incorrect_updates_list)
updated_tensor_incorrect = tf.tensor_scatter_update(target_tensor, indices, incorrect_updates_tensor)
print("Incorrect update but compiles: ")
print(updated_tensor_incorrect.numpy())

```

Here, the `indices` tensor has shape `[2, 2]`, indicating two update locations. Since each update needs to insert a sub-tensor of shape `[1, 2]` (we're updating entire slices of the 3rd dimension), the combined `updates` tensor must have a shape of `[2, 1, 2]`, corresponding to two update locations, each needing to update a vector of length two. The 'incorrect usage' example shows an intuitive approach which is to create a list of tensors, each representing the update for a single index. These can be stacked together to form a tensor, but the shape of that tensor does not align with the update paradigm of `tf.tensor_scatter_update`. The shape after the stack is [2, 1, 2], yet `tf.tensor_scatter_update` still processes the updates using indices such as [0,1] against the larger target.

Finally, let’s explore a slightly different case where the update tensor has more dimensions, still maintaining the overall correctness.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Target 4x4x4 tensor
target_tensor = tf.zeros((4, 4, 4), dtype=tf.float32)

# Indices for update
#  - Update [1,1,:], and [2,2,:] with a 2x1 slice of updates
indices = tf.constant([[1, 1], [2, 2]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Correctly shaped updates tensor, first dimension is length of indices, then the rest map to remaining dimensions in target_tensor
updates = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]]], dtype=tf.float32)
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_update(target_tensor, indices, updates)
print("Multi-dimensional Updates with slice: ")
print(updated_tensor.numpy())

```

In this example, we have a 4x4x4 target tensor. Our `indices` are `[1,1]` and `[2,2]`, indicating update locations. Each update will replace a sub-tensor of size `[4]` at these locations.  The first dimension of our updates tensor must align with the length of the indices, which is 2 in this case, leading to the resulting shape of the update tensor being `[2,1,4]`. The data is then correctly placed during the scatter update.

When facing similar issues, I would recommend a thorough review of the documentation for `tf.tensor_scatter_update`. Pay specific attention to the expected shapes of the `indices` and `updates` tensors, and how they relate to the dimensions of the target tensor. The TensorFlow API documentation is an excellent source and the guide to numerical computation is also helpful for understanding the concepts behind the scatter operations. Additionally, meticulously inspect your tensor construction logic. Ensure the `updates` tensor is assembled correctly, meaning all the update values must be present within a single tensor instead of distributed over a list of tensors.
