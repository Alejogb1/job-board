The root cause of an empty COBOL file often stems from a mismatch between file definition and program logic, specifically concerning the file status indicators and the actual file processing within the `OPEN`, `READ`, `WRITE`, and `CLOSE` statements.  In my two decades working with legacy COBOL systems, I've encountered this issue countless times, tracing it back to seemingly innocuous errors in file handling.  Let's examine the common culprits and explore solutions through code examples.


**1. Incorrect File Status Handling:**

COBOL uses file status codes to indicate the success or failure of file operations. A common oversight is neglecting to check these status codes after crucial file I/O operations, leading to silent failures.  An empty file may result if a `WRITE` statement fails due to a full disk, I/O errors, or other issues, yet the program continues without acknowledging the error.  The `FILE-STATUS` clause associated with the `FD` entry should be consistently checked after each `OPEN`, `READ`, `WRITE`, and `CLOSE`.  A `00` status typically indicates success; otherwise, an error has occurred.  Failing to handle these non-zero statuses is the primary reason for unexpected empty files, especially when dealing with large datasets or external file systems.


**2.  Problems with the `OPEN` Statement:**

The `OPEN` statement's `INPUT` or `OUTPUT` clause must accurately reflect the intended file operation.  Attempting to `WRITE` to a file opened in `INPUT` mode, or conversely, reading from a file opened in `OUTPUT` mode, will obviously result in an empty file (in the case of the output file, it might not even be created).  Similarly, attempting to open a non-existent file in `INPUT` mode without appropriate error handling will cause the file to remain empty. The program execution might proceed without explicit errors, but the file operations will fail silently.  Furthermore, specifying the incorrect file organization (sequential, indexed, relative) in the `OPEN` statement will lead to errors and an empty output file.


**3.  Logic Errors in `READ` and `WRITE` Statements:**

Incorrect file access logic can also lead to empty files.  For instance, incorrect record lengths defined within the file description (`FD`) entry compared to the actual records written can lead to truncation or corrupted data, essentially producing an empty file if no valid records are successfully written.  This often involves neglecting the `RECORD CONTAINS` clause in the `FD` section, assuming the compiler handles record length implicitly which, depending on the compiler and its settings, is a dangerous assumption.

Another common error is an infinite loop in a `READ` statement coupled with a missing or flawed end-of-file condition check.  This prevents the program from completing its intended actions and potentially from even writing any records.  Similarly, a `WRITE` statement nested within a loop that never executes will naturally result in an empty file.  Moreover, incorrect usage of `REWRITE` statements can overwrite data improperly.


**4.  Insufficient File Permissions:**

While less directly related to COBOL code, inadequate file access permissions can silently prevent file creation or writing.  The user running the COBOL program needs appropriate write permissions to the directory where the file should be created.  Even with correctly written COBOL code, a lack of permissions will lead to the same empty file problem.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Correct File Status Handling:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. FILE-PROCESS.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
           SELECT OUTPUT-FILE ASSIGN TO "output.txt"
               ORGANIZATION IS LINE SEQUENTIAL
               FILE STATUS IS WS-FILE-STATUS.
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       FD  OUTPUT-FILE.
           01  OUTPUT-RECORD PIC X(80).
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           01  WS-FILE-STATUS PIC 99.
           01  WS-COUNTER PIC 99 VALUE 1.
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       BEGIN.
           OPEN OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE
           IF WS-FILE-STATUS = 00
              DISPLAY "File opened successfully"
           ELSE
              DISPLAY "File open error: " WS-FILE-STATUS
              STOP RUN
           END-IF
           PERFORM UNTIL WS-COUNTER > 10
               MOVE WS-COUNTER TO OUTPUT-RECORD
               WRITE OUTPUT-RECORD
               IF WS-FILE-STATUS NOT = 00
                  DISPLAY "Write error: " WS-FILE-STATUS
                  STOP RUN
               END-IF
               ADD 1 TO WS-COUNTER
           END-PERFORM
           CLOSE OUTPUT-FILE
           IF WS-FILE-STATUS = 00
              DISPLAY "File closed successfully"
           ELSE
              DISPLAY "File close error: " WS-FILE-STATUS
           END-IF
           STOP RUN.
       END PROGRAM FILE-PROCESS.
```

This example demonstrates comprehensive file status checks after every major file operation.  Any non-zero status triggers error handling and program termination.

**Example 2: Incorrect `OPEN` Mode:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. INCORRECT-OPEN.
       * ... (ENVIRONMENT and DATA divisions as before) ...
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       BEGIN.
           OPEN INPUT OUTPUT-FILE  *> Incorrect open mode
           * ... (rest of the code attempts to write) ...
       ```

Opening the file in `INPUT` mode when intending to write will cause the `WRITE` to fail silently, leading to an empty file.


**Example 3:  Logic Error in `WRITE` loop:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. WRITE-LOOP-ERROR.
       * ... (ENVIRONMENT and DATA divisions as before) ...
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       BEGIN.
           OPEN OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE
           PERFORM VARYING WS-COUNTER FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL WS-COUNTER > 0  *>Infinite loop
               *> WRITE statement never executes
           END-PERFORM
           CLOSE OUTPUT-FILE
           STOP RUN.
       END PROGRAM WRITE-LOOP-ERROR.
```

The infinite loop prevents the `WRITE` statement from ever executing, resulting in an empty output file.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Consult your COBOL compiler's documentation, particularly sections on file handling and error codes.  Review the COBOL programming language standard for detailed specifications on file processing.  Examine existing COBOL codebases for best practices in file I/O and error management.  Utilize a debugger to step through your code and inspect file status values at various points during execution.  Thorough testing with various scenarios and data sizes is crucial to catch subtle errors before deployment.
