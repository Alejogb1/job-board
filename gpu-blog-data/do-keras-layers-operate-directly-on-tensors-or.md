Keras layers fundamentally operate on tensors, but the *manner* of that operation is crucial to understanding their behavior.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for high-throughput scenarios has repeatedly highlighted that a layer does not directly access the raw input tensor of the model; instead, it interacts with the tensor resulting from the previous layer's computations. This distinction is critical for grasping the computational flow and efficiently debugging model architectures.

The core concept is data dependency. Each layer accepts a tensor as input, processes it according to its defined functionality, and produces a new tensor as output.  This output then serves as the input to the subsequent layer.  While the underlying computations involve tensor manipulations—element-wise operations, matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc.—the layer's interface is abstracted away from the raw model input.  This structured approach ensures modularity and maintainability, allowing for the construction of complex architectures from simpler building blocks.  The internal tensor manipulations are handled seamlessly by the backend (TensorFlow or Theano, primarily in my experience), ensuring optimal performance.

Consider a simple sequential model.  The input tensor is fed into the first layer. This layer transforms the tensor, and *this transformed tensor*, not the original input, is passed to the second layer.  This chained dependency continues through the entire network. Attempting to directly manipulate the input tensor within a later layer would violate this fundamental principle and generally lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The framework explicitly handles the data flow, preventing direct access to intermediary tensors unless specific mechanisms are used (like custom layers or model inspection tools).

Let's illustrate this with three code examples demonstrating this sequential processing:

**Example 1: A Simple Dense Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),  #First Layer
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')                   #Second Layer
])

# Sample input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 784))

# Layer 1 output
layer1_output = model.layers[0](input_tensor)

# Layer 2 output (using Layer 1's output)
layer2_output = model.layers[1](layer1_output)

print(f"Input Tensor Shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Layer 1 Output Shape: {layer1_output.shape}")
print(f"Layer 2 Output Shape: {layer2_output.shape}")

```

This example shows how each layer operates on the previous layer's output.  The `model.layers[i](tensor)` syntax explicitly shows the layer operating on a tensor that is *not* the original model input. The `input_shape` parameter in the first layer only defines the expected input tensor dimensions for the entire model; subsequent layers inherit the shape from the previous layer's output.  Direct access to `input_tensor` within `model.layers[1]` is not possible and isn't intended.

**Example 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))
conv_output = model.layers[0](input_tensor)
pool_output = model.layers[1](conv_output)
flatten_output = model.layers[2](pool_output)
dense_output = model.layers[3](flatten_output)

print(f"Input Tensor Shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Conv Output Shape: {conv_output.shape}")
print(f"Pool Output Shape: {pool_output.shape}")
print(f"Flatten Output Shape: {flatten_output.shape}")
print(f"Dense Output Shape: {dense_output.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates the data flow in a CNN. The convolutional layer (`Conv2D`) produces an output tensor that is then processed by the max-pooling layer (`MaxPooling2D`).  The flattened tensor from `MaxPooling2D` is then the input for the fully connected layer (`Dense`).  Again, each layer operates exclusively on the output of the preceding layer.  The shape transformations clearly indicate the data flow.


**Example 3: Custom Layer Illustrating Tensor Manipulation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.square(inputs)  #Direct tensor operation, but within the layer context

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    MyCustomLayer(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 784))
layer1_output = model.layers[0](input_tensor)
custom_output = model.layers[1](layer1_output)
layer3_output = model.layers[2](custom_output)

print(f"Layer 1 Output Shape: {layer1_output.shape}")
print(f"Custom Layer Output Shape: {custom_output.shape}")
print(f"Layer 3 Output Shape: {layer3_output.shape}")
```

While a custom layer allows for direct tensor manipulation within the `call` method, it still operates on the output of the preceding layer.  The `inputs` argument represents the output from `Dense(64)`.  This example underscores that even with direct manipulation, the layer's input is always the previous layer's output, reinforcing the layered architecture.


In summary, although Keras layers inherently manipulate tensors, their interaction is strictly defined by the sequential, data-dependent flow. Each layer processes the output of its predecessor, forming a chain of tensor transformations. This design ensures the framework’s stability and facilitates the construction of complex and scalable deep learning models.  Understanding this distinction is fundamental for model building, debugging, and optimization.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation provides comprehensive details on layer functionality.  A solid understanding of linear algebra and tensor operations is essential.  Exploring the TensorFlow documentation for detailed information on backend operations would further enhance your knowledge.  Finally, a textbook covering deep learning fundamentals is highly beneficial for conceptual clarity.
