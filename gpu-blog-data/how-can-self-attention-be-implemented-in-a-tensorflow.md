The crucial challenge in implementing self-attention with multiple inputs in TensorFlow lies not in the attention mechanism itself, but in the careful management of input tensors and the subsequent aggregation of attention-weighted representations.  My experience developing sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing, specifically machine translation, has highlighted the need for a structured approach to handle diverse input modalities.  Simply concatenating inputs prior to attention application often proves inadequate, failing to capture the nuanced relationships between different input streams.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Self-attention, at its core, computes relationships between elements within a single input sequence.  When dealing with multiple inputs (e.g., text and image embeddings), a straightforward approach isn't to simply concatenate and apply standard self-attention.  The reason is that such an approach treats all inputs uniformly, failing to acknowledge potential differences in their relevance and contribution to the final representation. Instead, a more sophisticated approach employs separate self-attention layers for each input stream, followed by a mechanism to combine their outputs.

The process can be broken down into these stages:

* **Individual Input Embeddings:** Each input type (e.g., text, image) is embedded into a suitable representation.  This might involve pre-trained embedding layers (Word2Vec, GloVe for text; ResNet features for images) or learned embeddings within the model.

* **Separate Self-Attention Layers:**  A separate self-attention layer is applied to each input's embedding. This layer generates attention weights that capture the relationships between elements within that specific input.  The standard scaled dot-product attention formula applies within each layer.

* **Multi-Head Attention (Optional):** Incorporating multi-head attention within each individual input's self-attention layer significantly enhances the model's ability to capture diverse relationships.  Multiple attention heads learn different aspects of the input.

* **Aggregation of Attention Outputs:**  After processing each input with its respective self-attention layer(s), their outputs need to be combined.  This can be accomplished through various strategies:

    * **Concatenation:**  Simply concatenating the output tensors from each self-attention layer creates a larger feature vector. This approach is straightforward but might not optimally leverage the relationships between different input types.

    * **Weighted Summation:**  Each self-attention output is weighted based on its predicted importance.  These weights could be learned parameters or determined through a separate attention mechanism that operates on the self-attention outputs themselves.

    * **Gated Fusion:**  A gated mechanism, using a sigmoid function, learns to selectively combine information from different input streams.  This allows the model to dynamically decide which input contributes more significantly at each step.


* **Further Processing:** The aggregated representation is then passed through subsequent layers (e.g., feedforward networks, recurrent layers) to perform the desired task.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples focus on the core self-attention and aggregation aspects, omitting embedding layers and subsequent processing for brevity.  Assume `tf` refers to TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def self_attention(inputs, num_heads):
  # ... (Standard scaled dot-product self-attention implementation) ...
  return attention_output # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim)


input1 = tf.random.normal((16, 20, 512))  # Batch of 16 sequences, 20 timesteps, 512-dim embedding
input2 = tf.random.normal((16, 10, 256))  # Batch of 16 sequences, 10 timesteps, 256-dim embedding

attention_output1 = self_attention(input1, 8)
attention_output2 = self_attention(input2, 4)

# Concatenation
combined_output = tf.concat([attention_output1, attention_output2], axis=-1) # Shape: (16, 20, 768)

# Further processing...
```

This example shows straightforward concatenation.  Note the potential dimensionality mismatch that requires careful consideration during subsequent processing.


**Example 2: Weighted Summation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (self_attention function from Example 1) ...

input1 = tf.random.normal((16, 20, 512))
input2 = tf.random.normal((16, 10, 256))

attention_output1 = self_attention(input1, 8)
attention_output2 = self_attention(input2, 4)

# Learn weights
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2,))) #Two weights for two inputs

# Weighted summation
combined_output = weights[0] * attention_output1 + weights[1] * attention_output2

# Further processing...
```

This demonstrates weighted summation, learning weights directly.  More sophisticated weighting schemes could utilize additional neural network layers.


**Example 3: Gated Fusion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (self_attention function from Example 1) ...

input1 = tf.random.normal((16, 20, 512))
input2 = tf.random.normal((16, 10, 256))

attention_output1 = self_attention(input1, 8)
attention_output2 = self_attention(input2, 4)

# Pad shorter sequence to match length for element-wise operations
attention_output2 = tf.pad(attention_output2, [[0, 0], [0, 10], [0, 0]]) #Pad to match len 20


# Gated fusion
combined = tf.concat([attention_output1, attention_output2], axis=-1)
gate = tf.keras.layers.Dense(768, activation='sigmoid')(combined) # Assuming 768 combined dimensions
combined_output = gate * attention_output1 + (1 - gate) * attention_output2

# Further processing...
```

This uses a gated mechanism to control the contribution of each input stream dynamically.  Padding ensures element-wise operations are possible.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   "Attention is All You Need" paper:  The seminal paper introducing the transformer architecture and self-attention.  Carefully studying its details is crucial.

*   TensorFlow documentation:  The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on various layers and functionalities relevant to implementing self-attention.

*   "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet:  A valuable resource for understanding the fundamentals of deep learning architectures, including attention mechanisms.


These resources will provide a solid foundation for understanding and implementing self-attention within your TensorFlow models, especially when dealing with scenarios involving multiple inputs.  Remember that the specific implementation will heavily depend on the nature of your inputs and the task at hand. The key lies in carefully choosing the appropriate aggregation method to effectively combine information from diverse sources.
