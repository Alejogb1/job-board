The core shift in TensorFlow 2.x, away from the static computational graph paradigm of earlier versions, necessitates a fundamental change in how variables and input data are handled.  `tf.placeholder()` and `tf.get_variable()`, central to TensorFlow 1.x, are replaced by mechanisms that integrate more seamlessly with eager execution and the Keras API.  My experience migrating large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x highlighted the importance of understanding this transition, particularly in managing model variables and data pipelines.


**1.  Explanation of Replacement Mechanisms:**

The elimination of `tf.placeholder()` reflects the move towards eager execution, where operations are evaluated immediately.  Instead of defining placeholders to feed data during session execution, TensorFlow 2.x leverages `tf.data` for efficient data input pipelines, and direct tensor creation for immediate computation.  Data is handled dynamically, obviating the need for pre-defined placeholder shapes and types.

`tf.get_variable()`, used to create and manage variables within a graph, is largely subsumed by the Keras `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class and the more general `tf.Variable`.  The Keras `Layer` class provides a structured approach to managing variables within layers, handling variable creation, initialization, and weight updates during training. This approach offers better encapsulation and simplifies the management of model architectures compared to the manual variable management required by `tf.get_variable()`. Using `tf.Variable` directly provides a more basic way to manage variables outside of the Keras API, though its use is less frequent when building models using Keras layers.

This shift emphasizes a more declarative approach to model building.  Instead of explicitly defining the computational graph and feeding data through placeholders, the model structure is defined using Keras layers, and data is fed directly through the `fit()` method. This streamlined workflow significantly simplifies model development and debugging, aligning TensorFlow 2.x more closely with other modern deep learning frameworks.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Replacing `tf.placeholder()` with `tf.data`:**

This example demonstrates creating a simple data pipeline using `tf.data.Dataset` to feed data to a model, replacing the need for `tf.placeholder()`.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x equivalent:
# x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])
# y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent:
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((
    tf.random.normal((100, 1)),
    tf.random.normal((100, 1))
)).batch(32)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)
```

This code snippet replaces manual placeholder creation with a `tf.data.Dataset`.  The dataset is created from random tensors, but in a real-world scenario, this would be populated with your actual data using methods like `from_tensor_slices`, `from_generator`, or by reading from files. The `batch()` method prepares the data in batches suitable for training.  The model then directly consumes this dataset during training using `model.fit()`.


**Example 2: Replacing `tf.get_variable()` with `tf.keras.layers.Layer`:**

This illustrates creating a custom layer with embedded trainable variables using `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units=32):
    super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True, name='kernel')
    self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True, name='bias')

  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  MyCustomLayer(units=64),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# TensorFlow 1.x might have involved:
# w = tf.get_variable("w", [10, 32], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())
# b = tf.get_variable("b", [32], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())

model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
# ...rest of training
```

This demonstrates how `tf.keras.layers.Layer` manages weights (`self.w`, `self.b`). The `add_weight()` method handles variable creation, initialization, and tracking during training, eliminating the manual management associated with `tf.get_variable()`.


**Example 3: Using `tf.Variable` outside of Keras:**

This shows a basic usage of `tf.Variable` for a simple calculation.  While less common in modern Keras workflows, it retains relevance for situations outside the structured layer API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x:
# w = tf.get_variable("weight", initializer=tf.constant([1.0]))

# TensorFlow 2.x:
w = tf.Variable([1.0])

x = tf.constant([2.0])
y = w * x

print(y.numpy()) # Access the value using .numpy() in eager execution

w.assign_add(1.0) # Update the variable value

y = w * x
print(y.numpy())
```

This example illustrates the basic usage of `tf.Variable`.  The variable `w` is created and updated using `assign_add()`. Note the use of `.numpy()` to access the tensor value outside of a computational graph context, as is typical with eager execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable.   Deep learning textbooks focusing on TensorFlow 2.x provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Explore resources that specifically address the migration from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x; these frequently detail the changes in variable and data handling.  Finally, review the Keras API documentation thoroughly, as it's now the recommended way to build and manage models in TensorFlow 2.x.
