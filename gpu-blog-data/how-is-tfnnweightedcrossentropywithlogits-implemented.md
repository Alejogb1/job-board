TensorFlow's `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits` function, unlike its unweighted counterpart, introduces a class-specific weight to each example's loss calculation. This modification is crucial for handling imbalanced datasets where certain classes may have significantly fewer examples than others. The function doesn't simply multiply the final cross-entropy by a weight; instead, it alters the loss calculation within the logarithmic space to correctly incorporate these class weights before computing the mean. This distinction is paramount for maintaining the gradient’s integrity during backpropagation, thus allowing the model to learn more effectively from minority classes.

The core logic revolves around combining the principles of the standard cross-entropy loss with a weighted component. Given logits (raw predictions) and labels (ground truths), the function first computes the sigmoid cross entropy for each sample, much like `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`. Then, it applies the weight to the *positive* class loss term, effectively scaling the contribution of true positive predictions to the total loss. The negative class loss remains unchanged unless a different weight is explicitly provided for it. This selective weighting ensures that the model pays more attention to correctly classifying underrepresented classes.

The detailed implementation can be visualized through a breakdown into its mathematical operations. Let 'z' represent the logits, 'y' the labels (0 or 1), and 'w' the per-example weight assigned to the positive class. The weighted cross-entropy for a single example is calculated as follows:

`loss = -w * y * log(sigmoid(z)) - (1 - y) * log(sigmoid(-z))`

Here, `sigmoid(z)` represents the probability of the positive class, and `sigmoid(-z)` represents the probability of the negative class (which is `1-sigmoid(z)`). The weight 'w' only applies to the term related to positive class examples (where `y=1`). The overall loss, often averaged across the batch, is then used for model training.

The computational graph constructed by TensorFlow handles the necessary numerical stability to avoid issues such as vanishing gradients, often employing techniques like the log-sum-exp trick within its internal logic. This numerical stability is essential for consistent and accurate training, especially with deep learning models where the backpropagation of gradients through many layers can be sensitive to such subtleties.

Now, let’s examine concrete code examples to illustrate different usage patterns:

**Example 1: Basic Weighted Cross-Entropy with a Single Weight:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def basic_weighted_cross_entropy(logits, labels, weight):
    """Applies a single weight to the positive class.

    Args:
        logits: Tensor of raw predictions (shape [batch_size, num_classes]).
        labels: Tensor of binary labels (shape [batch_size, num_classes]).
        weight: Scalar weight for the positive class.

    Returns:
        Weighted cross-entropy loss (scalar).
    """
    loss = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=tf.cast(labels, tf.float32), logits=logits, pos_weight=weight
    )
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)


# Example Usage:
logits = tf.constant([[1.2, -0.5], [-0.8, 0.6], [0.3, -1.5]], dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant([[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=tf.int32)
weight_pos = 2.0
loss = basic_weighted_cross_entropy(logits, labels, weight_pos)
print(f"Basic weighted cross-entropy loss: {loss}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a straightforward use case where we have binary labels and apply a single weight (`weight_pos`) to the positive class instances across all samples. `tf.cast(labels, tf.float32)` explicitly converts the integer labels to the float type required by the TensorFlow API. `tf.reduce_mean` averages the loss across all samples in the batch. In this case, the loss is higher for the positive samples, effectively forcing the network to prioritize them.

**Example 2: Weighted Cross-Entropy with Multiple Classes and Weights:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def multi_class_weighted_cross_entropy(logits, labels, weights):
    """Applies class-specific weights to the positive classes.

    Args:
        logits: Tensor of raw predictions (shape [batch_size, num_classes]).
        labels: Tensor of binary labels (shape [batch_size, num_classes]).
        weights: Tensor of class weights (shape [num_classes]).

    Returns:
        Weighted cross-entropy loss (scalar).
    """
    loss = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=tf.cast(labels, tf.float32), logits=logits, pos_weight=weights
    )
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)


# Example Usage:
logits = tf.constant(
    [[1.2, -0.5, 0.2], [-0.8, 0.6, -0.9], [0.3, -1.5, 0.8]], dtype=tf.float32
)
labels = tf.constant([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]], dtype=tf.int32)
class_weights = tf.constant([2.0, 3.0, 1.5], dtype=tf.float32)
loss = multi_class_weighted_cross_entropy(logits, labels, class_weights)
print(f"Multi-class weighted cross-entropy loss: {loss}")

```

*Commentary:* This example showcases how to apply class-specific weights when dealing with multiple classes. The `weights` tensor now has a shape that matches the number of classes in the dataset. Each element of the weights tensor is used as the `pos_weight` for the corresponding class. The loss for each positive class is scaled using this corresponding weight. The `loss` is averaged across samples. This is the more common approach when handling imbalances across several categories.

**Example 3: Dynamic Weights based on Batch Labels**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_weighted_cross_entropy(logits, labels):
    """Applies dynamic weights based on the frequency of each class in the batch.

    Args:
        logits: Tensor of raw predictions (shape [batch_size, num_classes]).
        labels: Tensor of binary labels (shape [batch_size, num_classes]).

    Returns:
        Weighted cross-entropy loss (scalar).
    """
    labels_float = tf.cast(labels, tf.float32)
    pos_counts = tf.reduce_sum(labels_float, axis=0)
    neg_counts = tf.reduce_sum(1 - labels_float, axis=0)
    total_counts = pos_counts + neg_counts
    # Avoid division by zero
    pos_weights = total_counts / (pos_counts + 1e-6)
    loss = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=labels_float, logits=logits, pos_weight=pos_weights
    )
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)

# Example Usage:
logits = tf.constant(
    [[1.2, -0.5, 0.2], [-0.8, 0.6, -0.9], [0.3, -1.5, 0.8], [0.5, 0.1, 1.1]], dtype=tf.float32
)
labels = tf.constant([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]], dtype=tf.int32)
loss = dynamic_weighted_cross_entropy(logits, labels)
print(f"Dynamic weighted cross-entropy loss: {loss}")

```

*Commentary:* This advanced example dynamically calculates weights based on the actual class frequencies within the current batch.  This technique addresses potential shifts in class distribution between different batches, which are common during training. The weights are computed as the ratio of total samples to positive samples for each class; thereby, less frequent classes receive a larger weight. A small constant (1e-6) is added to the denominator to prevent division by zero.

For further study, I would recommend researching "Handling Imbalanced Datasets in Machine Learning," which covers common strategies, including loss weighting, sampling techniques, and data augmentation. Explore TensorFlow’s documentation for detailed explanations and advanced applications of `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits` and related loss functions. Consider textbooks focusing on deep learning with practical coding examples. Finally, academic papers detailing techniques for loss re-weighting and methods to address imbalanced data scenarios in machine learning applications are great resources for additional insight.
