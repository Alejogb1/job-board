The impact of the order of linear decoders and average pooling layers in sequence models is non-trivial and depends heavily on the specific architecture and the nature of the sequence data.  My experience working on speech recognition models at [Fictional Company Name] revealed that while a simple swap might seem inconsequential, the resulting changes in information flow can significantly influence performance metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) or character-level accuracy.  The key determinant is the interplay between the spatial information preserved by average pooling and the feature extraction performed by the linear decoder.

**1. Explanation:**

Average pooling, by its nature, performs a form of dimensionality reduction by averaging feature vectors across a defined window or across the entire temporal dimension.  This results in a loss of spatial information; fine-grained details within the sequence are summarized into a single value.  A linear decoder, on the other hand, operates on the input features, mapping them to a higher-level representation. This mapping often learns complex relationships between features.

If the average pooling layer precedes the linear decoder, the decoder receives a compressed representation of the input sequence. This compression can lead to a loss of relevant information crucial for the downstream task, especially if the spatial relationships within the sequence are critical. For instance, in time-series analysis, losing the temporal order through premature averaging could obscure important patterns.

Conversely, placing the linear decoder before average pooling allows the decoder to operate on the full feature set before dimensionality reduction.  The linear layer can learn intricate relationships between the raw features, and only then is this richer representation subjected to averaging.  This often results in a more informative compressed feature vector for subsequent layers.  The preservation of detailed feature relationships, before aggregation, can be critical for tasks sensitive to fine-grained details.

However, this is not a universally applicable rule.  If the input sequence is highly redundant or noisy, the initial average pooling might act as a beneficial filter, removing irrelevant information before the linear decoder processes it.  The optimal order depends heavily on the specific characteristics of the input data and the overall architecture of the model.  Furthermore, the size of the pooling window or the type of pooling (e.g., max pooling) also has a substantial influence on the final outcome.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the two possible configurations within a PyTorch framework.  For simplification, I'm omitting hyperparameter tuning and other crucial details for brevity.  These examples focus purely on the relative positioning of the average pooling and linear layer.

**Example 1: Average Pooling before Linear Decoder**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(Model1, self).__init__()
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1) #Adaptive for variable sequence lengths
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.avgpool(x) #Average pooling first
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = torch.relu(self.linear(x))
        x = self.output(x)
        return x

#Example Usage
model = Model1(input_size=128, hidden_size=64, output_size=10)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 128, 100) #Batch size 32, input size 128, sequence length 100
output = model(input_tensor)
```

This code demonstrates a model where average pooling is applied before the linear layer.  The `AdaptiveAvgPool1d` layer performs average pooling to a size of 1 along the temporal dimension (dimension 2), reducing the sequence to a single feature vector per input sample.  The flattened result is then fed into the linear layers.


**Example 2: Linear Decoder before Average Pooling**


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(Model2, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x) #Linear layer first
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.output(x)
        return x

#Example Usage
model = Model2(input_size=128, hidden_size=64, output_size=10)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 128, 100)
output = model(input_tensor)
```

Here, the linear layer processes the input sequence first, allowing the model to learn complex relationships between features before dimensionality reduction via average pooling.  The ReLU activation function is included to introduce non-linearity.


**Example 3:  Global Average Pooling (GAP) for Comparison**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model3(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(Model3, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.GAP = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1) #Global Average Pooling
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.GAP(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.output(x)
        return x

#Example Usage
model = Model3(input_size=128, hidden_size=64, output_size=10)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 128, 100)
output = model(input_tensor)

```

This illustrates Global Average Pooling (GAP), a common technique in convolutional neural networks, often used as a replacement for fully connected layers.  Here it's used after the linear transformation,  providing a different perspective on dimensionality reduction compared to the previous examples.  Note that GAP doesn't require flattening as it already produces a feature vector.

These examples highlight the different ways average pooling can be incorporated into a sequential model.  Experimental evaluation is crucial to determining the optimal placement for a specific task and dataset.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing standard machine learning textbooks focusing on deep learning architectures, specifically chapters dedicated to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), as both frequently utilize pooling layers.  In addition, research papers focusing on sequence modeling techniques for specific tasks like speech recognition or natural language processing will offer valuable insights into the practical application and considerations of these layers.  Finally, exploring the source code of established deep learning libraries will provide further understanding of the implementation details of these layers.
