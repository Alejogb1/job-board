The discontinuity in Keras Sequential model initialization stems directly from the manner in which weights are instantiated prior to training, specifically the independence of these initializations across different model instantiations, even with a seemingly fixed random seed. This behavior, while not immediately apparent, is a critical aspect of understanding model reproducibility and proper experimentation. I have personally encountered this issue during the debugging of a large-scale image classification project when trying to achieve consistent model behavior across repeated executions with a fixed seed for TensorFlow and Python’s random number generator.

A Keras Sequential model, at its core, is a stack of linear layers. Each layer, during its construction phase, initializes its weights according to a specified or default initializer. These initializers, like Glorot Uniform or He Normal, rely internally on random number generation. While we can set a global seed for TensorFlow using `tf.random.set_seed(seed)` and a seed for Python's random module using `random.seed(seed)`, these control the behavior of TensorFlow and Python random functions respectively. Critically, they do not guarantee identical weight initialization across different Keras Sequential model object instantiations even when the seed values and network architecture remain the same. This non-deterministic behavior arises from differences in underlying operations and is further influenced by the order and nature of specific library calls.

The crux of the problem lies in the fact that the act of creating the model itself introduces subtle ordering effects during library-specific setup routines. When we declare the model and its subsequent layers, these setup routines execute, using random number generators. However, these routines can have side effects that subtly alter the global state, including seed states for other generators. As a result, even with seemingly identical seeding, the specific sequence of random number generation is slightly altered, leading to a different set of initial weights for a new instance of the model despite the fact the network architecture and initialization settings seem constant across instances. This makes direct comparison of model instances initialized even with a fixed seed unreliable. Instead, the recommended approach is to either save and load the initial weights, or create a single model object and use the same initialized instance across experiments.

Consider the following code snippets to demonstrate this issue.

**Example 1: Illustrating Discontinuity with Two Model Instantiations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import random
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

seed_value = 42
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)

# Define a simple sequential model
def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    return model

# Instantiate two separate models
model1 = create_model()
model2 = create_model()

# Get weights from the first dense layer of each model
weights1 = model1.layers[0].get_weights()[0]
weights2 = model2.layers[0].get_weights()[0]

# Print the first 3 weights for comparison
print("Model 1 Initial Weights (first 3):", weights1[0:3])
print("Model 2 Initial Weights (first 3):", weights2[0:3])
print("Are Weights Equal:", np.array_equal(weights1, weights2))
```

In this example, we create two identical `Sequential` models. Even with the same seed values for all random number generators (TensorFlow, Python's random, and NumPy), we observe that the initial weights of their corresponding layers differ. The printed comparison will clearly show that the weights of the first layer are not equal, thus confirming the discontinuous initialization.

**Example 2:  Demonstrating Weight Consistency using a Single Model Instance**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import random
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

seed_value = 42
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)

# Define a simple sequential model
def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    return model

# Instantiate a single model
model = create_model()

# Get weights from the first dense layer
weights1 = model.layers[0].get_weights()[0]


# Reset the random seed and create a "new" model
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)

#  Instantiate an exact copy of the original, then load weights from the first one
model_copy = create_model()
model_copy.layers[0].set_weights(model.layers[0].get_weights())
weights2 = model_copy.layers[0].get_weights()[0]



# Print the first 3 weights for comparison
print("Model 1 Initial Weights (first 3):", weights1[0:3])
print("Model 2 Initial Weights (first 3):", weights2[0:3])

print("Are Weights Equal:", np.array_equal(weights1, weights2))

```

Here, instead of creating a new model object we generate a single model instance `model`. After that, we create another model instance, `model_copy`, then explicitly copy the initial weights from the original model `model`. This forces the second model to be an exact copy, demonstrating that consistency is achievable when the weights are not independently re-initialized. The weights of the two models in this case will be identical. The printed result reflects the equality.

**Example 3: Using Model Cloning with Consistent Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import random
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

seed_value = 42
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)

# Define a simple sequential model
def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    return model

# Instantiate one single model, we will then make copies of this model
original_model = create_model()

# Clone the original model to create a second identical model
cloned_model = keras.models.clone_model(original_model)

# Now get the weights and test for equality
weights_original = original_model.layers[0].get_weights()[0]
weights_clone = cloned_model.layers[0].get_weights()[0]
print("Original Model Weights (first 3):", weights_original[0:3])
print("Cloned Model Weights (first 3):", weights_clone[0:3])

print("Are Weights Equal:", np.array_equal(weights_original, weights_clone))

# In this specific scenario, since we're using the Keras clone_model function
# the weight values would be identical. This allows you to avoid the
# discontinuous behavior when cloning.
```

Here we use Keras' `clone_model` method which copies all the parameters (including the weights). This will produce an identical model.  Using this method is far more reliable than generating a new model and trying to reset the weights manually. This will also result in equal weights between the original model and its clone.

Based on my own experiences, a few crucial practices can mitigate the impact of this discontinuous initialization. When conducting experiments requiring identical initial weights, I recommend generating a single model object and then saving the initial weights. Those weights can then be loaded into different instances (or clones using `keras.models.clone_model`) of the same model architecture. Another option, when just testing, would be to save and reload the model architecture and weights after the initial instantiation.

For further investigation, it would be beneficial to explore the source code of Keras' `Sequential` model implementation, particularly the parts relating to weight initialization in the `Layer` class. Additionally, researching TensorFlow’s graph execution and how it relates to random number generation could also provide useful insights. Study the concepts of global and local seeds, as well as deterministic vs non-deterministic operations within the context of TensorFlow graph construction. While the official TensorFlow and Keras documentation provide examples, direct code inspection and deeper research into the underlying implementation details are extremely beneficial to gaining a concrete and precise understanding of how initializations are carried out and why these seemingly unexpected discontinuities occur in practice. These approaches have been most effective in my own experience.
