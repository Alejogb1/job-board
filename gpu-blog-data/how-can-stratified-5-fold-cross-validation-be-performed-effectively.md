The challenge of a single-member minority class during stratified k-fold cross-validation arises from the fundamental requirement of stratification: preserving the class distribution within each fold. With a single instance of a class, strict application of stratification will invariably lead to either a fold lacking that class altogether or a fold containing only that single instance, rendering that fold unrepresentative of the overall dataset and impacting model evaluation. This situation, often encountered in highly imbalanced datasets, necessitates a modified approach to cross-validation. I’ve personally wrestled with this issue in several projects, notably a fraud detection model where a specific type of fraudulent activity was exceedingly rare, represented by a solitary data point.

Standard stratified k-fold cross-validation algorithms assume each class has sufficient representation to distribute instances across folds. The core principle involves calculating the proportion of each class within the entire dataset and aiming to replicate that proportion in each fold. When a class contains only one element, this is mathematically impossible to achieve accurately. Creating a fold solely with the single minority instance biases evaluation as any model trained without the influence of that instance will inevitably have reduced performance when evaluated against it. Conversely, excluding the single minority instance means that there's an entire fold where the class is not represented, impacting the generalization of results.

The first approach to address this issue is to consider a form of 'near-stratification.' Instead of enforcing perfect stratification, we allow for slight deviations, ensuring each fold has *at least one* instance of the single-member minority class whenever possible. This typically involves preprocessing where we first group the data by target variable, then distribute most classes using traditional stratified techniques but handle single-member groups separately. It usually comes down to systematically placing the single instance into a designated fold, which can be achieved randomly or systematically, aiming for even distribution across the folds during multiple rounds of cross-validation. However, this method introduces some degree of randomness or slight skew during model evaluation as the exact representation of the single member class will vary fold to fold. This approach does not produce absolutely "stratified" folds but can be a practical compromise when the situation warrants it.

Another strategy that might be viable is data augmentation, but this is highly dependent on the nature of your problem. If you have the ability to create synthetic data based on your existing single instance, then you can then perform standard stratification on your new dataset. Note that augmentation techniques, especially in contexts involving rare events, must be approached very cautiously. Arbitrary or naive augmentation can introduce significant bias. One must ensure that the augmentation method maintains core properties of the original data and does not generate data that is unrealistic or out of distribution.

A third strategy is to reduce the value of k. In very extreme cases, one might have to abandon the idea of cross-validation with multiple folds altogether. While a single train/test split can reduce the stability of the error estimates and is generally discouraged, in situations with exceedingly rare classes, the approach might be unavoidable. If k=2, we're left with one train and one test split, this would involve ensuring that, at the very least, the rare class is present in the training split. In this scenario, rather than being cross-validated, we’d simply be evaluating on one independent testing set which can provide some assessment of the models. In cases with very limited data, sometimes a single validation holdout set is a more practical strategy than attempting cross-validation with insufficient data.

Here are some code examples using Python with `scikit-learn` to demonstrate these principles, acknowledging the inherent limitations of attempting to programmatically address such an edge case:

**Example 1: Near Stratification**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from collections import defaultdict

def near_stratified_kfold(X, y, n_splits=5, random_state=None):
    """
    Performs near-stratified k-fold cross-validation, handling single-member minority classes.
    """
    skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=random_state)
    folds = []
    class_indices = defaultdict(list)
    for idx, label in enumerate(y):
      class_indices[label].append(idx)

    single_member_indices = [idx[0] for idx in class_indices.values() if len(idx) == 1]
    
    # Generate stratified folds on the other instances
    other_indices = [idx for idx, _ in enumerate(y) if idx not in single_member_indices]
    other_y = y[other_indices]

    for train_index, test_index in skf.split(np.zeros(len(other_y)), other_y):
      full_train_index = other_indices[train_index]
      full_test_index = other_indices[test_index]

      # Add the single member class index into the test set in a round robin fashion
      for i, single_member in enumerate(single_member_indices):
        fold_number = i % n_splits
        if fold_number == len(folds):
          folds.append((list(full_train_index), list(full_test_index) + [single_member]))
        else:
          folds[fold_number] = (folds[fold_number][0], folds[fold_number][1] + [single_member])
    return folds

# Sample Data
X = np.array(range(20)).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7])
folds = near_stratified_kfold(X, y, n_splits = 5, random_state = 42)

for train_index, test_index in folds:
  print(f"Train: {train_index}, Test: {test_index}")
```

This code demonstrates the near-stratification principle. The single member classes have indices 17, 18 and 19. These are distributed amongst the 5 test folds. The other data is stratified as usual. This example avoids creating folds where there is only a single instance.

**Example 2: Augmentation for Validation (Conceptual)**

```python
def augment_minority_class(X, y, minority_class_label, n_copies=4, random_seed=None):
  """
    Creates synthetic data via some basic techniques to balance the number of samples in a minority class. This approach is purely conceptual and its feasibility depends on a particular problem
  """
  rng = np.random.default_rng(random_seed)
  minority_indices = np.where(y == minority_class_label)[0]

  if len(minority_indices) != 1:
    raise ValueError("This function is designed for single-member minority classes")

  minority_instance_idx = minority_indices[0]
  minority_instance = X[minority_instance_idx]
  
  augmented_X = [minority_instance + rng.normal(0, 0.1, minority_instance.shape) for _ in range(n_copies)]
  augmented_y = [minority_class_label for _ in range(n_copies)]

  return np.vstack((X, augmented_X)), np.concatenate((y, augmented_y))


# Sample Data: Using same sample data as example 1
X_augmented, y_augmented = augment_minority_class(X, y, minority_class_label=7, n_copies = 4, random_seed=42)


skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

for train_index, test_index in skf.split(np.zeros(len(y_augmented)), y_augmented):
  print(f"Train: {train_index}, Test: {test_index}")
```
This example is *highly* conceptual and assumes that simple Gaussian noise added to the original feature vector is a valid approach to augmentation. This is not always true and can introduce severe bias. It does demonstrate how data augmentation techniques can be employed to produce more statistically viable folds.

**Example 3: Single Validation Split**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def single_split_with_minority_presence(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=None):
  """
    Ensures that a single minority instance is present in at least one of train/test sets
    when k-fold cross-validation is not feasible.
    """
  rng = np.random.default_rng(random_state)

  class_indices = defaultdict(list)
  for idx, label in enumerate(y):
      class_indices[label].append(idx)

  single_member_indices = [idx[0] for idx in class_indices.values() if len(idx) == 1]
  
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = test_size, random_state=random_state, stratify=y)

  # Guarantee at least one instance of each single member class within train or test data
  for idx in single_member_indices:
    # Check if the member is present in either the training or testing sets.
    if idx not in np.concatenate((np.argwhere(X == X[idx])[:,0] if len(X) > 0 else [], np.argwhere(X_test == X[idx])[:,0] if len(X_test) > 0 else [])):
      # Add the class instance to the training set if it's not in the dataset at all.
      X_train = np.vstack((X_train, X[idx]))
      y_train = np.concatenate((y_train, [y[idx]]))

  return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Sample Data: Using same sample data as example 1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = single_split_with_minority_presence(X, y, random_state = 42)
print(f"Train data indices: {np.argwhere(np.isin(X, X_train))[:, 0]}")
print(f"Test data indices: {np.argwhere(np.isin(X, X_test))[:, 0]}")
```
This approach uses a `train_test_split` to split the data into a training and testing set. The single member indices are then checked to see if they are present in either set. If one of the instances is not present, it’s added to the training set.

Regarding resource recommendations, I’d advise consulting books focused on statistical machine learning and model evaluation techniques. Books emphasizing imbalanced datasets often touch upon cross-validation nuances. Look for sections about resampling methods, and pay particular attention to discussions about the bias and variance implications of different approaches. While code libraries often provide convenient implementations of cross-validation procedures, deeper insight into the statistical underpinnings of each technique will be invaluable in navigating situations like these. Scientific papers are also an excellent source of detailed explanations of various methods in data analysis and model evaluation. When consulting any resources, critically evaluate the contexts in which they apply, recognizing that any one recommendation might need to be tailored to the specific nature of your data and task.
