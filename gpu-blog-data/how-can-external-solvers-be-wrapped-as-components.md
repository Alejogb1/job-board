OpenMDAO's strength lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate diverse analysis tools.  My experience working on aerospace optimization problems highlighted the crucial need for efficient external solver integration.  Directly coupling solvers written in Fortran, C++, or other languages requires careful handling of data transfer and type conversion, especially when defining Python objects as outputs. This response details the process, emphasizing the critical role of the `ExecComp` component and appropriate data marshalling techniques.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

OpenMDAO's architecture facilitates the inclusion of external solvers through the `ExecComp` component.  This component executes arbitrary code, allowing for the encapsulation of external solver calls.  The key to successful integration lies in structuring the input and output data to match the solver's requirements and OpenMDAO's expectations.  This involves careful consideration of data types.  OpenMDAO primarily works with NumPy arrays. Therefore, any data exchanged with the external solver must be converted to and from this format.  For Python object outputs, careful serialization is essential. This can be achieved using standard Python libraries such as `pickle` or specialized libraries tailored for specific data structures.  The process broadly involves three steps:

* **Pre-processing:**  Preparing input data in a NumPy array format suitable for the external solver. This might involve reshaping arrays, converting data types, or splitting complex structures into smaller, manageable units.
* **External Solver Execution:**  Calling the external solver, passing the pre-processed data.  This typically involves using the `subprocess` module or similar mechanisms for inter-process communication.  Error handling is crucial at this stage to manage potential failures gracefully.
* **Post-processing:**  Receiving results from the solver and converting them into a format digestible by OpenMDAO. This includes converting raw solver outputs to NumPy arrays and potentially reconstructing more complex Python objects from serialized data.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Scalar Output**

This example demonstrates integrating a hypothetical Fortran solver (`my_fortran_solver`) that calculates a single scalar value based on two inputs.

```python
import numpy as np
import subprocess
from openmdao.api import Component, IndepVarComp, Problem, ExecComp

class FortranSolverWrapper(Component):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_input('x', val=1.0)
        self.add_input('y', val=2.0)
        self.add_output('z', val=0.0)

    def compute(self, inputs, outputs):
        # Execute Fortran solver
        process = subprocess.run(['./my_fortran_solver', str(inputs['x']), str(inputs['y'])], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        outputs['z'] = float(process.stdout)


prob = Problem()
model = prob.model

model.add_subsystem('inputs', IndepVarComp('x', 1.0), promotes=['x', 'y'])
model.add_subsystem('fortran_solver', FortranSolverWrapper(), promotes=['x', 'y', 'z'])
model.set_input_defaults('y', 2.0) # Example of setting a default input value
prob.setup()
prob.run_model()
print(f"Result from Fortran solver: {prob['z']}")
```

**Commentary:** This uses `subprocess` to execute the external solver. The `check=True` argument ensures an exception is raised if the solver fails.  Error handling could be further improved by checking the solver's return code or inspecting the `stderr` output.  The output `z` is directly assigned the result of the Fortran solver.


**Example 2:  Array Output with Pickle Serialization**

This example integrates a hypothetical C++ solver returning a more complex data structure which we serialize with `pickle`.

```python
import numpy as np
import subprocess
import pickle
from openmdao.api import Component, IndepVarComp, Problem, ExecComp

class CppSolverWrapper(Component):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_input('data_in', val=np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
        self.add_output('data_out', val=np.zeros(3))

    def compute(self, inputs, outputs):
        # Execute C++ solver, capturing output in a temporary file
        with open('temp_output.pkl', 'wb') as f:
            process = subprocess.run(['./my_cpp_solver'], input=pickle.dumps(inputs['data_in']), capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
            f.write(process.stdout)


        with open('temp_output.pkl', 'rb') as f:
            outputs['data_out'] = pickle.load(f)

prob = Problem()
model = prob.model
model.add_subsystem('inputs', IndepVarComp('data_in', np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])), promotes=['data_in'])
model.add_subsystem('cpp_solver', CppSolverWrapper(), promotes=['data_in', 'data_out'])
prob.setup()
prob.run_model()
print(f"Result from C++ solver: {prob['data_out']}")
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases the use of `pickle` for serialization of the input and output. The solver is assumed to write pickled data to a temporary file. This file is then loaded into `data_out` using `pickle.load()`.  Robust error handling and file management are essential for production-ready code.


**Example 3:  Using ExecComp for Direct Code Integration (Simplified)**

In certain cases, particularly for simpler solvers or when performance is critical, integrating directly into Python using `ExecComp` offers better efficiency, avoiding the overhead of inter-process communication.


```python
import numpy as np
from openmdao.api import Component, IndepVarComp, Problem, ExecComp

class SimpleSolver(Component):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_input('a', val=1.0)
        self.add_input('b', val=2.0)
        self.add_output('c', val=0.0)

    def compute(self, inputs, outputs):
        outputs['c'] = inputs['a'] * inputs['b']

class MyExecComp(ExecComp):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_input('x', val=1.0)
        self.add_input('y', val=2.0)
        self.add_output('result', val=0.0)
        self.add_output('result_obj', val={'val':0.0})
        self.options['inputs'] = ['x','y']
        self.options['outputs'] = ['result','result_obj']
        self.options['func'] = lambda x,y: (x+y, {'val': x*y})


prob = Problem()
model = prob.model
model.add_subsystem('inputs', IndepVarComp('x', 1.0), promotes=['x', 'y'])
model.add_subsystem('my_exec', MyExecComp(), promotes=['x', 'y', 'result', 'result_obj'])
prob.setup()
prob.run_model()
print(f"Result from ExecComp: {prob['result']}")
print(f"Object Result from ExecComp: {prob['result_obj']}")
```

**Commentary:** This uses `ExecComp` to define a lambda function. The lambda function directly calculates the outputs, avoiding external solver calls.  It demonstrates how to return both a scalar and a Python dictionary in an effective way. This is a much more efficient approach if the solver's logic can be encapsulated in Python.
