The apparent counter-intuitive scenario of Java potentially outperforming C in manual integer array sorting, specifically with algorithms like insertion, selection, and radix, stems primarily from modern hardware architecture and how each language interacts with it, rather than from fundamental language speed differences. While C is generally lauded for its low-level control and performance, several factors can lead Java to exhibit unexpectedly competitive, and sometimes superior, speeds in these controlled sorting contexts.

**Explanation: JIT Compilation and Memory Management**

The core reason behind this performance phenomenon is the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation strategy employed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Unlike C, which compiles directly to machine code before execution, Java bytecode is first interpreted, and then selectively compiled at runtime into optimized machine code by the JIT compiler. This allows the JIT to tailor the generated machine code to the specific processor architecture and execution patterns observed during runtime. For repetitive, predictable operations such as array manipulation within sorting algorithms, the JIT can often produce highly optimized native code that surpasses what a generic C compiler produces ahead-of-time.

The JIT compiler leverages runtime profiling information to identify "hotspots," portions of code that are executed frequently. These hotspots, such as the inner loops of sorting algorithms, are the targets for aggressive optimization. Techniques include loop unrolling, instruction reordering, and common subexpression elimination. This dynamism is not possible for C, whose performance is fixed by compile-time decisions and linked libraries. Moreover, JVMs, especially those from Oracle’s HotSpot implementation, continually improve their JIT capabilities, often incorporating research into advanced optimization strategies.

Another aspect is Java’s sophisticated automatic memory management, or garbage collection (GC). While often seen as overhead, modern GCs, especially generational collectors, can be surprisingly efficient. The key benefit for sorting is its handling of array allocations and deallocations. In C, manually managing these operations using `malloc` and `free` can introduce performance bottlenecks due to fragmentation and overhead in the system’s memory allocator. Java avoids these issues entirely by delegating memory management to the GC. Although GC pauses can occur, the overall impact of Java’s memory management on operations like array sorting is often less than the cost of manual memory management when done incorrectly or inefficiently, especially in realistic scenarios involving many small array allocations.

Furthermore, Java’s array access utilizes bounds checks. Although these checks add an overhead, the JVM can often elide them using runtime profiling. When the JVM recognizes that array access will always be within bounds, the checks can be removed during JIT compilation, resulting in code that is just as efficient as bounds-check-free C code.

Finally, inherent differences in the available standard library can influence relative performance. C’s `qsort` function is often generic, whereas Java’s standard library doesn't contain generic sorting implementations directly on integer arrays. Java relies on manually coded sorting algorithm for integer arrays, providing more control over data access pattern, whereas C's stdlib `qsort` could introduce unpredictable performance. While this is not directly a language performance, it highlights different design philosophies of the standard libraries and how that could impact real-world comparisons in manual integer sorting.

**Code Examples**

**Example 1: Insertion Sort**

```java
public class InsertionSort {
    public static void sort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i - 1;

            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6};
        sort(arr);
        for(int num : arr) System.out.print(num + " "); // Output: 5 6 11 12 13
    }
}
```

*Commentary:* This Java implementation of insertion sort uses a classic nested loop structure. The key operations are comparisons (`arr[j] > key`) and element swaps/shifts within the `while` loop. JVM’s JIT is capable of aggressively optimizing this type of structured code, leading to efficient native code execution. Also note lack of manual memory management, compared to the next example.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
  int i, key, j;
  for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    key = arr[i];
    j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j = j - 1;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = key;
  }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    insertionSort(arr, n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) printf("%d ", arr[i]); // Output: 5 6 11 12 13
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This C version is functionally equivalent to the Java version. While C has direct access to memory, it lacks the JIT’s ability to profile and optimize the code during execution. Compile-time optimizations might not be as effective for dynamic cases, thus potentially making Java competitive.

**Example 2: Radix Sort**

```java
public class RadixSort {
    static int getMax(int arr[], int n) {
        int mx = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) if (arr[i] > mx) mx = arr[i];
        return mx;
    }
    static void countSort(int arr[], int n, int exp) {
        int output[] = new int[n];
        int i;
        int count[] = new int[10];

        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) count[ (arr[i]/exp)%10 ]++;

        for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) count[i] += count[i - 1];

        for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output[count[ (arr[i]/exp)%10 ] - 1] = arr[i];
            count[ (arr[i]/exp)%10 ]--;
        }
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) arr[i] = output[i];
    }

    public static void sort(int arr[], int n) {
        int m = getMax(arr, n);
        for (int exp = 1; m / exp > 0; exp *= 10) countSort(arr, n, exp);
    }

     public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arr[] = { 170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66 };
        int n = arr.length;
        sort(arr, n);
        for(int num : arr) System.out.print(num + " "); // Output: 2 24 45 66 75 90 170 802
    }
}
```

*Commentary:* This Java radix sort implementation showcases operations on integer arrays. The `countSort` method performs counting based on digits. JIT optimizations can benefit heavily from the repeated modulo and division operations, potentially exceeding C's performance on modern hardware with its pipelined instruction execution. The advantage of memory management without manual allocation also applies here.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int getMax(int arr[], int n) {
    int mx = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) if (arr[i] > mx) mx = arr[i];
    return mx;
}

void countSort(int arr[], int n, int exp) {
    int output[n];
    int i;
    int count[10] = {0};

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) count[ (arr[i]/exp)%10 ]++;

    for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) count[i] += count[i - 1];

    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        output[count[ (arr[i]/exp)%10 ] - 1] = arr[i];
        count[ (arr[i]/exp)%10 ]--;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) arr[i] = output[i];
}

void radixSort(int arr[], int n) {
    int m = getMax(arr, n);
    for (int exp = 1; m / exp > 0; exp *= 10) countSort(arr, n, exp);
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = { 170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66 };
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    radixSort(arr, n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) printf("%d ", arr[i]); // Output: 2 24 45 66 75 90 170 802
    return 0;
}

```

*Commentary:* This C radix sort mirrors the Java structure, again illustrating direct access to memory through stack allocation. The core logic is nearly identical to the Java version. The crucial difference remains in the JIT's runtime optimization vs. C's ahead-of-time optimization, and the advantage of Java's automatic memory management.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of JVM internals and JIT compilation, research documentation relating to Oracle’s HotSpot VM. Exploring papers and articles on advanced JIT optimization techniques will be beneficial. For performance analysis, studying methodologies for benchmarking and profiling Java applications provides valuable insight. General books on compiler construction and computer architecture, focusing on out-of-order and pipelined execution, are highly recommended. Finally, resources on memory management and garbage collection will improve understanding of how Java handles memory in contrast to manual techniques used in C. Understanding the architecture of modern CPUs also helps in understanding the performance benefits of Java's JIT compilation and optimization techniques.
