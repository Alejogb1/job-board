TensorFlow GPU object detection models, particularly those trained using older APIs like the Object Detection API in TensorFlow 1.x or earlier versions, often exhibit a limitation where inference works correctly on the initial frame of a video or image sequence, but then fails or produces erratic results on subsequent frames. This behavior stems from how these models and their associated inference pipelines manage resources, specifically GPU memory, during initial setup.

The root of the problem typically isn't the model itself but rather the TensorFlow graph initialization and resource allocation processes. When a model is loaded, TensorFlow builds an execution graph in memory and allocates GPU resources based on the initial input dimensions it encounters. For video, the first frame establishes these dimensions, and the graph is optimized for them. When subsequent frames, particularly from a live video feed, differ significantly in size, the graph is not reconfigured to handle these new dimensions, leading to memory errors, incorrect output, or crashes. This is not an inherent flaw in the model but a characteristic of how the graph is constructed and initially configured in older TensorFlow APIs, where dynamic reshaping is not natively handled efficiently.

Several contributing factors exacerbate this issue. First, the Object Detection API, particularly in its earlier iterations, heavily relied on placeholders to define input tensor dimensions. While flexible, using placeholders means that during graph construction, the dimensions must be provided, and if not explicitly set to be flexible, become fixed. The first frame’s dimensions are used to finalize these placeholder definitions. Second, GPU memory management within TensorFlow 1.x and similar versions had limitations. Memory was often allocated in a static manner when the graph was first created. Dynamically re-allocating memory on the GPU, which would be required for varying input dimensions, wasn't efficiently built into the older pipelines. Third, the pre and post processing steps included in the object detection pipeline are sometimes not designed to adapt to varying input sizes, and may make assumptions about the size of the tensors.

To demonstrate how this manifests, consider a basic inference loop. Here's a simplified representation using TensorFlow 1.x semantics:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_graph(model_path):
    detection_graph = tf.Graph()
    with detection_graph.as_default():
        od_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        with tf.gfile.GFile(model_path, 'rb') as fid:
            serialized_graph = fid.read()
            od_graph_def.ParseFromString(serialized_graph)
            tf.import_graph_def(od_graph_def, name='')
    return detection_graph


def run_inference(image, sess, input_tensor, output_tensors):
    # Assume image is a numpy array
    image_expanded = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    output_dict = sess.run(output_tensors, feed_dict={input_tensor: image_expanded})
    return output_dict

# Example usage (assuming you have a frozen model and an image source)
model_path = 'path/to/frozen_inference_graph.pb'
detection_graph = load_graph(model_path)

with detection_graph.as_default():
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # Define Input and Output tensors based on node names from the frozen graph
        input_tensor = detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('image_tensor:0') # Placeholder
        output_tensors = [detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_boxes:0'),
                          detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_scores:0'),
                          detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_classes:0'),
                          detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('num_detections:0')]

        # Simulate video feed using dummy images (assume first frame size is 640x480)
        image_sizes = [(640, 480), (320, 240), (720, 576)]
        for size in image_sizes:
            dummy_image = np.random.rand(size[1], size[0], 3).astype(np.float32)
            output_data = run_inference(dummy_image, sess, input_tensor, output_tensors)
            print("Inference completed. Image shape:", dummy_image.shape)

```

In this example, the first image (640x480) dictates the graph’s initial input dimensions. The subsequent images of different sizes may or may not result in a successful inference. In many cases, this will produce an error due to the input placeholder receiving an array with dimensions that do not match that expected.

To correct this, especially when using older TensorFlow APIs, several strategies can be employed. One approach is to reshape the input tensor, but this isn't readily handled by placeholders. Instead, dynamically creating and initializing a new graph every time a different frame size is encountered can be used. This provides a robust solution but it incurs an expensive reinitialization cost.

Here is an example showing how to dynamically handle different input dimensions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def build_and_run(model_path, image):
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
        od_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        with tf.gfile.GFile(model_path, 'rb') as fid:
            serialized_graph = fid.read()
            od_graph_def.ParseFromString(serialized_graph)
            tf.import_graph_def(od_graph_def, name='')

        with tf.Session() as sess:
            input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name('image_tensor:0') # Placeholder
            output_tensors = [graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_boxes:0'),
                              graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_scores:0'),
                              graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_classes:0'),
                              graph.get_tensor_by_name('num_detections:0')]

            image_expanded = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
            output_dict = sess.run(output_tensors, feed_dict={input_tensor: image_expanded})
            return output_dict

# Example usage
model_path = 'path/to/frozen_inference_graph.pb'
image_sizes = [(640, 480), (320, 240), (720, 576)]

for size in image_sizes:
    dummy_image = np.random.rand(size[1], size[0], 3).astype(np.float32)
    output = build_and_run(model_path, dummy_image)
    print("Inference completed. Image shape:", dummy_image.shape)
```

Here, we rebuild the graph and create a session for every single frame, which eliminates the problem at the cost of computational expense. This is not the best approach for real-time performance but demonstrates the principle.

Alternatively, using `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` and setting `allow_growth=True`, one can mitigate the static memory allocation issue. This allows TensorFlow to gradually allocate GPU memory as needed during runtime, rather than all at once initially. This is only partially effective if tensor shapes are fixed in the graph, but does allow the first initialization to consume less GPU memory initially.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_graph(model_path):
    detection_graph = tf.Graph()
    with detection_graph.as_default():
        od_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
        with tf.gfile.GFile(model_path, 'rb') as fid:
            serialized_graph = fid.read()
            od_graph_def.ParseFromString(serialized_graph)
            tf.import_graph_def(od_graph_def, name='')
    return detection_graph


def run_inference(image, sess, input_tensor, output_tensors):
    # Assume image is a numpy array
    image_expanded = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    output_dict = sess.run(output_tensors, feed_dict={input_tensor: image_expanded})
    return output_dict


model_path = 'path/to/frozen_inference_graph.pb'
detection_graph = load_graph(model_path)
gpu_options = tf.compat.v1.GPUOptions(allow_growth=True)
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options)


with detection_graph.as_default():
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config) as sess:
        input_tensor = detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('image_tensor:0')
        output_tensors = [detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_boxes:0'),
                          detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_scores:0'),
                          detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('detection_classes:0'),
                          detection_graph.get_tensor_by_name('num_detections:0')]
        # Simulate video feed
        image_sizes = [(640, 480), (320, 240), (720, 576)]
        for size in image_sizes:
            dummy_image = np.random.rand(size[1], size[0], 3).astype(np.float32)
            output_data = run_inference(dummy_image, sess, input_tensor, output_tensors)
            print("Inference completed. Image shape:", dummy_image.shape)
```

This allows the session to allocate memory as needed. However, it does not fundamentally address the problem of using fixed sized input placeholders in the graph.

For modern applications, the best solution involves migrating to TensorFlow 2.x and utilizing the Keras-based object detection models. These models are designed with dynamic input shapes and benefit from improved resource management built into the newer TensorFlow versions. Furthermore, the inclusion of `tf.function` and `AutoGraph` can help to optimize graph execution, leading to more consistent performance across varying input dimensions.

For learning more about specific techniques to overcome this problem in older TensorFlow versions, I would recommend exploring documentation on the TensorFlow Object Detection API (prior to TensorFlow 2.0), particularly the graph loading and inference sections, alongside the TensorFlow 1.x GPU memory management documentation. Resources focused on TensorFlow session management and GraphDefs are also useful. Understanding how fixed sized placeholders interact with the `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` is also beneficial. Further knowledge on optimizing TF graphs for performance would also prove advantageous.
