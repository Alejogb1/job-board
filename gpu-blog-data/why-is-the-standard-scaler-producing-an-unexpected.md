The behavior of a standard scaler when applied to a single column, particularly if the resulting transformed data does not appear to conform to the expected normal distribution centered around zero with a standard deviation of one, often stems from several nuanced aspects related to the scaler’s inherent calculations and the input data characteristics.  I've encountered this frequently when working on time-series anomaly detection using scikit-learn, and the seemingly simple transformation can mask underlying issues if not carefully examined.

The core of the standard scaler, mathematically, is quite straightforward. For a given feature (column), it calculates the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) based on the training data. Then, for each data point (x) within that feature, it applies the transformation: z = (x - μ) / σ.  The expectation, and generally the result when applied across multiple features, is that the transformed data *z* will approximate a standard normal distribution. However, this expectation can be violated in several specific single-column scenarios.

One fundamental source of unexpected results lies in the nature of the input data itself. If the data in the column is nearly constant, exhibiting minimal variation, the calculated standard deviation will be exceptionally small. When the division by a very small standard deviation occurs within the transformation, the resulting *z* values can become exceedingly large in magnitude, even for minor deviations from the mean. This amplification effect produces a distribution that is far from resembling a standard normal one. Imagine a scenario with temperature readings that fluctuate only within a single degree; applying standard scaling will exaggerate these small variations and generate large, potentially misleading, scaled values.

Another common culprit is the presence of outliers or extreme values.  A single extremely large or small value, especially when the sample size is relatively modest, can significantly skew the calculated mean and standard deviation, and thus, the transformation. The scaler is influenced by these extremes; they pull the mean towards them, and they inflate the standard deviation. Consequently, the bulk of the data, which may otherwise have formed a more normal shape, gets compressed into a much smaller range near zero, whilst the outliers get scaled dramatically away from the center. The transformed data might not only appear non-normal; it may also make other data processing steps more difficult.

Lastly, the scaling issue could surface if there is a mismatch between the data utilized for training the scaler and the data being transformed. The `fit` method of the `StandardScaler` computes the mean and standard deviation. These are then applied during the `transform` operation. If, for instance, the scaler is trained on a dataset that does not include the range of values present in the data subsequently transformed,  the scaler might operate with a mean and standard deviation that do not accurately reflect the characteristics of the data being scaled. A common error I have seen is when data is sliced or segmented, and scaling is applied to segments without consideration of scaling parameters from the full, pre-segmented dataset. This leads to variations in the meaning of scaled values across datasets.

Let’s examine this with some practical examples:

**Example 1: Minimal Variance Data**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

data = np.array([[10.001], [10.002], [10.0015], [10.0025], [10.0018]])
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

print("Original Data:\n", data)
print("\nScaled Data:\n", scaled_data)
print("\nMean:", scaler.mean_)
print("Standard Deviation:", scaler.scale_)

```

Here, the `data` has minimal variation around 10. Although technically transformed, observe how small the computed standard deviation is (`scaler.scale_`). This forces the scaled data to expand outside the expected -1 to 1 range. The resulting scaled values are far from a standard normal distribution as they are spread across a large range.  This amplification is a direct result of the tiny denominator in the scaler transformation equation.

**Example 2: Impact of Outliers**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

data = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [100]])
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

print("Original Data:\n", data)
print("\nScaled Data:\n", scaled_data)
print("\nMean:", scaler.mean_)
print("Standard Deviation:", scaler.scale_)

```
In this scenario, the presence of the outlier, 100, drastically affects the calculated mean and standard deviation. The standard deviation `scaler.scale_`  is larger due to the outlier.  Most of the values in the original data set become negative in the scaled data, compressed near zero and, furthermore, the outlier itself becomes significantly distant (almost 4) from the rest of the scaled values. This distortion makes the resulting distribution very non-normal and obscures the relationships among the non-outlier data points.

**Example 3: Train-Transform Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

train_data = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
test_data  = np.array([[6], [7], [8], [9], [10]])

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(train_data)
scaled_test_data = scaler.transform(test_data)

print("Training Data:\n", train_data)
print("\nTest Data:\n", test_data)
print("\nScaled Test Data:\n", scaled_test_data)
print("\nMean:", scaler.mean_)
print("Standard Deviation:", scaler.scale_)

```

Here, the scaler is trained on `train_data`, and then applied to `test_data`.  The mean and standard deviation computed during training are based entirely on the range of 1-5. When transforming the test set, the transformed values are outside the range typically associated with a standard normal, and a shifted and scaled version of the underlying test data. This emphasizes the importance of scaling new data using parameters derived from a training dataset that includes the range of values seen in the transformed dataset. If a test set's range is markedly different from the training set, it can be essential to add a portion of the new dataset into a refit stage, if the model is tolerant to a change in scaling.

To address these challenges, a careful examination of the data distribution before scaling is crucial.  Consider alternative preprocessing techniques if the data does not appear to conform to expectations of standardization or exhibits characteristics such as those shown. Winsorization or transformations such as log or power transforms may mitigate the issues related to outliers or skewness before standardization, improving scaler performance. Also, consider using other scalers. The RobustScaler, for instance, is less sensitive to outliers because it leverages median and interquartile range (IQR) in the transformation, making it useful in situations where extreme values are likely to be present.

Further exploration of data transformation can be found in numerous resources, including scikit-learn's documentation. Books on practical machine learning, such as "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow," provide in-depth coverage of data preprocessing. In terms of data visualization, resources on statistical graphics, such as those from Edward Tufte, offer insights into how to best depict data distributions, including those encountered after scaling. These resources, among others, can provide deeper theoretical and practical understanding of how to address and troubleshoot similar situations with data. They also explain when standard scaling is best and what alternative options exist. The choice of scaler and preprocessing technique will have a significant impact on model performance.
