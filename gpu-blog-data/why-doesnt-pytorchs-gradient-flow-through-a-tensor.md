The core reason why PyTorch gradients do not propagate through tensor clones stems from the fundamental design of its computational graph and its treatment of cloning as a non-differentiable operation. During my work on a large-scale reinforcement learning project several years ago, I encountered this issue directly while attempting to implement a more complex actor-critic architecture. The initial implementation involved using tensor clones for some input transformations. To my surprise, I observed that the backward pass failed to update weights connected to those parts of the graph where the clone was used. This initiated a deep dive to understand the underlying mechanics.

To grasp the behavior, consider PyTorch’s automatic differentiation system. It meticulously constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG), commonly called the computational graph, to track operations performed on tensors that require gradients. When a tensor is created using `requires_grad=True`, the system starts monitoring all operations that transform this tensor. Each node in the graph represents an operation, and each edge represents data flow. The backward pass, which computes gradients, relies on traversing this graph in reverse order. During backpropagation, the derivative of a final loss is propagated backwards through the graph, chain-ruling each operation to update tensor parameters and to compute gradients for input tensors.

A standard tensor clone in PyTorch, such as `tensor.clone()`, does not preserve the computational history of the original tensor. It creates a completely new tensor, essentially a copy of the data, without any knowledge of its origin or associated gradient information. This new tensor is by default not connected to the computation graph; hence, when `backward()` is invoked, gradients won’t propagate through the cloned tensor to the original tensor. This behavior is deliberately implemented, as it aligns with the typical notion of cloning in data structures - it's meant to be a pure data replication, not an operation that alters or influences the gradient calculation. The lack of a connection to the computational graph via the clone ensures that backpropagation cannot 'backtrack' through the clone operation. If the clone was recorded in the computational graph, it would also introduce a potentially large memory footprint due to the need to store the computational history of the clone.

Let's solidify this understanding with examples.

**Example 1: Simple Clone Scenario**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.clone()
w = z * 3
loss = w.sum()
loss.backward()

print(x.grad)  # Output: None
print(y.grad)  # Output: None
print(z.grad) # Output: None
```
In this basic example, `x` requires gradients and is involved in the multiplication operation, producing `y`. Subsequently, `z` is a clone of `y`, and `w` is then calculated. Despite the fact that `x` is specified as requiring gradients, `x.grad` is `None`. This is because the `clone()` operation breaks the gradient chain. The backpropagation process, triggered by `loss.backward()`, only goes back until `z` but then stalls, since `z` doesn't hold history about its origin; consequently, no gradient can be accumulated to `y`, and, further down the line, to `x`. Both `y.grad` and `z.grad` are also `None`, illustrating that gradients don't backpropagate through the clone.

**Example 2: Detaching for Modification**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.detach()
z_modified = z * 3
z_modified.requires_grad_(True)  # Set requires_grad for further operations
w = z_modified * 5
loss = w.sum()
loss.backward()

print(x.grad) #Output: None
print(y.grad) #Output: None
print(z.grad) #Output: None
print(z_modified.grad) # Output: tensor([15.])

```

Here, I'm leveraging the `detach()` operation, which returns a tensor that is detached from the computation graph, allowing for manipulation without tracking gradients. Crucially, this detached tensor can be modified and even be re-introduced into the computation graph by setting `requires_grad_`. This is a common technique to perform operations or transformations, without modifying the original graph. `z.grad` will be `None`, as `z` is not part of the computational graph. However, after setting the requires\_grad, gradients are accumulated on `z_modified`. Still, despite its relationship to the original computation, the gradients are not propagated to `x` or `y`.  This illustrates that while `detach()` enables manipulation, it doesn't fix the issue with gradient flow back to `x`.

**Example 3: Preserving Gradient Flow Through `detach().clone().requires_grad_(True)`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.detach().clone().requires_grad_(True)
w = z * 3
loss = w.sum()
loss.backward()

print(x.grad) #Output: tensor([6.])
print(y.grad) #Output: None
print(z.grad) # Output: tensor([3.])
```

The above example combines `detach()`, `clone()` and `requires_grad_(True)` to ensure the gradient flows correctly for `x`. The initial `detach()` breaks the computational graph link, so the clone has no history with the original computation. The subsequent call to `requires_grad_(True)` registers the clone as part of a computational graph again. `z` now becomes part of the computational graph, enabling the backpropagation of the loss. During the backpropagation, gradients are computed for z and then propagated backward to `x`, resulting in `x.grad` being calculated correctly. The gradient of `y`, on the other hand, is not calculated because the link between `y` and `z` was initially severed by the `detach` operation. This scenario is frequently encountered in deep learning, when intermediate manipulations are required without influencing the gradient of earlier layers.

In summary, PyTorch’s gradient flow stops at a `clone()` call because clones represent a new tensor, not an operation in the graph. This behavior is by design to ensure clear separation of data and computation. To maintain gradient flow while effectively performing a copy, a `detach()` call followed by `clone()` and `requires_grad_(True)` is required. It's important to be aware of the specific context and implications of each operation while building computational graphs in PyTorch. Failing to take the above into account can lead to unexpected or silent failures during the training process.

For individuals interested in delving deeper, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation for autograd mechanisms and the broader documentation on tensor operations. The book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann, offers an in-depth explanation of these concepts as well. Additionally, articles focusing on advanced automatic differentiation concepts would be helpful for understanding more intricate use cases.
