The core challenge in leveraging multiple GPUs for collaborating models lies not simply in distributing computational load, but in efficiently managing inter-GPU communication overhead.  My experience working on large-scale climate modeling simulations highlighted this acutely; naive parallelization often resulted in communication bottlenecks outweighing the benefits of distributed computation.  Effective strategies necessitate careful consideration of model architecture, data partitioning, and the selection of appropriate communication primitives.

**1.  Architectural Considerations:**

The most effective approach hinges on the inherent architecture of the collaborating models.  If the models are independent – meaning their outputs don't directly influence each other's computations until a final aggregation step – data parallelism is typically sufficient.  In contrast, if models iteratively exchange intermediate results, model parallelism, or a hybrid approach, becomes necessary.

Data parallelism replicates the entire model across multiple GPUs, distributing the input data. Each GPU processes a subset of the data independently, then results are aggregated. This works best for models where the data can be readily partitioned and the computational cost of processing each partition is roughly equal.

Model parallelism, on the other hand, divides the model itself across GPUs. Different parts of the model reside on different GPUs, with data flowing between them. This is more suitable for models with clearly separable components or those with significant inter-dependency throughout their execution. A hybrid approach combines aspects of both, potentially partitioning both the data and the model for optimal efficiency depending on the specifics of the models and data.


**2. Communication Strategies:**

Efficient inter-GPU communication is paramount.  Direct peer-to-peer communication, where GPUs exchange data directly without involving the CPU as an intermediary, minimizes latency.  However, this often necessitates careful management of memory allocation and requires specific support from the underlying hardware and software frameworks.  Collectives, like all-reduce operations, are also highly effective for efficient aggregation of results from multiple GPUs.  The choice between these strategies depends on the communication pattern inherent in the model collaboration.  In scenarios involving frequent and intricate data exchange, carefully designed communication schedules may be required to prevent deadlocks or performance degradation.  My experience with implementing a distributed Bayesian inference system demonstrated the importance of meticulously optimizing these communication patterns; inefficient choices led to a significant performance drop, despite the inherent parallelism.


**3. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches using PyTorch and its distributed data parallel capabilities.  They are simplified representations and would require significant adaptation for real-world applications depending on the specific model architectures.

**Example 1: Data Parallelism (Independent Models)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def run_model(rank, world_size, model, data_subset):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    model.to(rank)
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    for epoch in range(10):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data_subset)
        loss = calculate_loss(output) # Placeholder loss function
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    # Aggregate results (e.g., using dist.all_gather)
    dist.destroy_process_group()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    mp.spawn(run_model, args=(world_size, model, data_subsets), nprocs=world_size, join=True)

```

This example distributes a simple model across multiple GPUs, each processing a different subset (`data_subset`) of the input data. The `dist.all_gather` collective operation (not shown explicitly) is crucial for aggregating the outputs from all GPUs at the end of training.  The `nccl` backend is chosen for its efficiency in GPU-to-GPU communication.  Note that this assumes the models are independent;  the only interaction happens during the final aggregation step.


**Example 2: Model Parallelism (Simple Chain)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist

# Assume model is composed of two parts
class ModelPart1(nn.Module):
    # ... definition of model part 1 ...
class ModelPart2(nn.Module):
    # ... definition of model part 2 ...

model_part1 = ModelPart1().to(0)
model_part2 = ModelPart2().to(1)

input_data = torch.randn(100, 10).to(0)

output_part1 = model_part1(input_data)
# Send output from GPU 0 to GPU 1
dist.send(output_part1, 1)

output_part2 = model_part2(dist.recv(1)) # Receiving from GPU 0

# ... further processing of output_part2 ...

```

Here, we explicitly distribute different parts of a model across two GPUs (0 and 1). `dist.send` and `dist.recv` facilitate point-to-point communication between the GPUs.  This example demonstrates a simple chain; more complex model architectures would require more sophisticated communication patterns.


**Example 3: Hybrid Approach (Simplified)**

```python
# ... (Similar setup as Example 1 and 2, using both data and model parallelism) ...

# Distribute data across GPUs
# Then, within each GPU, execute parts of the model sequentially
for i in range(num_gpus):
    model_part1.to(i)
    model_part2.to(i)
    output_part1 = model_part1(data_subset[i])
    output_part2 = model_part2(output_part1)
    # Aggregate partial results from each GPU (e.g., using dist.all_gather)
```

This example combines the approaches from previous examples:  The data is initially partitioned across GPUs (data parallelism), and then, on each GPU, parts of the model are executed sequentially (a simplified form of model parallelism).  This allows for a more flexible approach to model distribution, catering to more complex scenarios.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For successful implementation of multi-GPU model collaboration, a deep understanding of distributed computing frameworks (like PyTorch's `torch.distributed`) and GPU communication primitives (like NCCL) is essential.  Furthermore, proficiency in performance profiling tools for identifying and resolving bottlenecks is crucial.  Thorough testing and experimentation with different data partitioning and communication strategies are necessary to optimize performance for specific model architectures and datasets.  Finally, familiarity with low-level GPU programming concepts can be beneficial for advanced optimization.
