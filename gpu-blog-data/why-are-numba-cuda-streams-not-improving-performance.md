The perceived lack of performance improvement when using Numba CUDA streams often stems from a misunderstanding of their role within the CUDA execution model and the inherent limitations of asynchronous operations.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, specifically involving large-scale simulations requiring GPU acceleration, has highlighted this point repeatedly.  Simply launching kernels in separate streams does not automatically equate to linear speedup.  Instead, careful consideration of data dependencies, memory management, and kernel design is crucial for realizing the intended performance benefits.

**1.  Understanding CUDA Streams and Their Limitations**

CUDA streams provide a mechanism for overlapping kernel execution and data transfers.  Ideally, launching multiple kernels in different streams allows the GPU to execute them concurrently, hiding latency associated with memory operations or computationally intensive portions of individual kernels. However, this overlap is not guaranteed.  Several factors can limit the effectiveness of streams:

* **Data Dependencies:** If one kernel depends on the output of another, the second kernel cannot begin execution until the first is complete, regardless of whether they are in different streams.  This serialization negates the potential for concurrent execution.  Similarly, if multiple kernels access the same memory regions concurrently, synchronization primitives (like CUDA events or atomic operations) become necessary, reducing potential concurrency.

* **Resource Contention:**  CUDA kernels compete for various resources on the GPU, including Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), registers, shared memory, and memory bandwidth.  Even with separate streams, resource contention can prevent kernels from executing concurrently, leading to underutilization of the GPU's capabilities.  A highly optimized kernel that fully utilizes the available resources on a single SM can actually outperform multiple less-optimized kernels running in separate streams.

* **Memory Bandwidth Limitations:**  The speed of memory access often bottlenecks GPU performance.  If kernels in different streams access the same memory locations frequently, the limited memory bandwidth can negate the benefits of using multiple streams.  Memory access patterns, therefore, become highly critical for stream efficiency.

* **Kernel Design and Optimization:**  A poorly designed kernel, regardless of the number of streams it is launched on, will fail to utilize the GPU's resources efficiently.  Factors such as loop unrolling, memory coalescing, and register usage significantly affect kernel performance.  Focusing solely on streams without optimizing the kernels themselves is counterproductive.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate common scenarios where the use of CUDA streams might not yield the anticipated performance gains. I'll focus on illustrating the critical elements and potential pitfalls, not on creating fully-functional, production-ready code.

**Example 1: Data Dependency Bottleneck**

```python
import numba
from numba import cuda

@cuda.jit
def kernel1(x, y):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    y[i] = x[i] * 2

@cuda.jit
def kernel2(y, z):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    z[i] = y[i] + 1

# ... Data allocation and initialization ...

stream1 = cuda.stream()
stream2 = cuda.stream()

kernel1[1024, 1](x, y, stream=stream1)  # Launch kernel 1 in stream 1
kernel2[1024, 1](y, z, stream=stream2)  # Launch kernel 2 in stream 2

# ... Synchronization and result handling ...
```

In this example, `kernel2` depends on the output of `kernel1`.  Even though they are launched in different streams, `kernel2` will wait for `kernel1` to complete before it can start.  The streams offer no performance advantage here.

**Example 2: Insufficient Kernel Optimization**

```python
import numba
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def slow_kernel(x, y):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    for j in range(1000): # Inefficient inner loop
        y[i] += x[i] * j

# ... Data allocation and initialization ...

stream1 = cuda.stream()
stream2 = cuda.stream()

slow_kernel[1024, 1](x, y, stream=stream1)
slow_kernel[1024, 1](x, y, stream=stream2) # Another slow kernel in a separate stream
```

Here, two instances of `slow_kernel` are launched in different streams.  However, the kernel itself is inefficient due to the nested loop.  The performance bottleneck lies within the kernel, not the stream management.  Optimizing the kernel by vectorizing or using a more efficient algorithm would be far more beneficial than adding streams.  Streams are only a beneficial layer when applied to efficient and parallel tasks.

**Example 3: Effective Stream Usage (Illustrative)**

```python
import numba
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def matrix_mult_part(A, B, C, start_row, end_row):
    i, j = cuda.grid(2)
    if i >= start_row and i < end_row and j < C.shape[1]:
        for k in range(A.shape[1]):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]

# ... Data allocation and initialization ...

stream1 = cuda.stream()
stream2 = cuda.stream()

threadsperblock = (16, 16)
blockspergrid = ((A.shape[0] + threadsperblock[0] - 1) // threadsperblock[0], (A.shape[1] + threadsperblock[1] -1) // threadsperblock[1])

matrix_mult_part[blockspergrid, threadsperblock, stream1](A, B, C_half1, 0, A.shape[0]//2) #Half the matrix multiplication done on stream1
matrix_mult_part[blockspergrid, threadsperblock, stream2](A, B, C_half2, A.shape[0]//2, A.shape[0]) # The other half done on stream2

#Combine results
C = np.concatenate((C_half1, C_half2))
```

This example demonstrates a situation where streams might be beneficial. The matrix multiplication is split into two parts, each executed in a separate stream.  This allows some degree of parallelism, assuming sufficient GPU resources. However, even here, effective memory management and data locality are crucial for avoiding bottlenecks. The example uses only half of the matrix on each stream, and the results are combined after. This is only an illustrative example, and more optimization techniques may be necessary for realistic applications.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA programming and stream management, I recommend exploring the official CUDA documentation, particularly the sections on concurrency and stream programming.  Thorough study of memory management within CUDA, and techniques for optimizing memory access patterns, is also vital.  Finally, a solid grasp of parallel programming concepts and algorithms will enable you to design kernels that fully utilize the GPU's capabilities and benefit from the use of streams.  Consulting CUDA C++ examples and studying well-established performance optimization techniques will substantially improve the chances of a successful implementation.
