The "index 2, 120 out of bounds" error in Keras typically arises from attempting to access elements beyond the legitimate range of a tensor's dimensions.  This frequently stems from a mismatch between the expected shape of a tensor and the indices used to access its elements, often occurring during data preprocessing or model construction.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image classification projects consistently points towards errors in slicing, reshaping, or batch processing.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, being a high-level API built on TensorFlow or Theano, relies on NumPy-style array manipulation.  NumPy arrays and Keras tensors are fundamentally multi-dimensional arrays with defined shapes.  An array of shape (x, y, z) possesses x rows, y columns, and z depth elements.  Attempting to access an element using indices that exceed these bounds – for example, trying to access the element at index (x+1, y, z) – will trigger an "index out of bounds" exception.

Several scenarios contribute to this problem:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:**  If your input data isn't correctly preprocessed to match the expected input shape of your Keras model, this error frequently occurs.  For instance, if your model expects images of shape (28, 28, 1) but your input images are (28, 28, 3), or if you have inconsistent image dimensions within your dataset, attempting to feed the data to the model directly might trigger the error.
* **Improper Reshaping:** Keras models often require specific input shapes.  Reshaping operations (using `numpy.reshape()` or Keras' `tf.reshape()`) are crucial for aligning the data with the model's expectations. Incorrect reshaping can lead to indices that fall outside the legitimate tensor boundaries.
* **Batch Processing Issues:** When processing data in batches, errors often arise if the batch size is incorrectly calculated or if the input data isn't correctly partitioned into batches. For instance, if you have 121 samples and use a batch size of 10, the last batch will only contain 1 sample.  Any operation assuming a consistent batch size of 10 in the last batch would then be out of bounds.
* **Layer Output Misunderstanding:**  The output shape of a layer might be different from what you anticipate.  Failing to consider padding, strides, or pooling operations in convolutional layers can lead to unexpected output dimensions and subsequent indexing errors downstream.  Similarly, dense layers may produce outputs of different sizes depending on their configurations.
* **Incorrect Indexing Logic:**  Simple programming errors can lead to indices exceeding array limits.  Off-by-one errors are quite common in this context, where an index might be one unit too large or too small, causing the out-of-bounds issue.

Understanding the dimensions of all your tensors at every step is vital for avoiding this error. Employing print statements to display shapes and using debuggers to step through the code are essential debugging techniques.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Reshaping**

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(10, 10, 3)  # Example image data: 10 images, 10x10 pixels, 3 channels
# Incorrect reshaping: Attempting to reshape into 100 samples with 30 features each, assuming a 2D array
reshaped_data = np.reshape(data, (100, 30))
# The following indexing might throw the out-of-bounds error.  The reshaped data doesn't have 120 features.
try:
    print(reshaped_data[2, 120])  
except IndexError:
    print("IndexError: Index out of bounds in reshaped data.")

#Correct Reshaping to avoid the error
correct_reshape = np.reshape(data,(100,3))
print(correct_reshape[2,1])
```
This demonstrates how incorrect reshaping leads to the error. The original data has a clear structure, but a miscalculation of the new shape causes indexing problems. The corrected reshaping avoids the issue.


**Example 2: Batch Processing Error**

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(121, 28, 28, 1)  # 121 images, 28x28 pixels, 1 channel
batch_size = 10
num_batches = (len(data) + batch_size - 1) // batch_size #Correct calculation of batches

for i in range(num_batches):
    batch = data[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size]  #Correct slicing
    # Processes the batch.  If you didn't handle the last batch correctly, you might get out of bounds.
    try:
       print(batch[10,5,5,0]) # Accessing a valid element within a batch.  Incorrect index here will trigger error.
    except IndexError:
       print("IndexError: Check batch slicing and indexing.")

```

This example showcases proper batch handling, including addressing the last batch's potential size difference.  Incorrectly handling this last batch, or having erroneous indexing within the batches, could easily result in an out-of-bounds error.


**Example 3:  Layer Output Dimension Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

input_data = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
output = model.predict(input_data)

# The shape of 'output' needs to be checked before indexing.  Assuming the output shape without verification might lead to errors.
print(output.shape) #Expect a shape of (1,10), not (1,120)
try:
    print(output[0, 120]) #This will likely throw an out-of-bounds error.
except IndexError:
    print("IndexError: Incorrectly assumed output shape from the dense layer.")

```

This demonstrates the risk of assuming the output shape of a Keras layer. The output shape must be explicitly determined and verified before any indexing operations are performed. Ignoring the dimensions generated by the convolutional and pooling layers, or the `Dense` layer's shape, can easily lead to index errors.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Consult the official Keras documentation for detailed explanations of tensor manipulation, layer functionalities, and input shape requirements.
* Carefully review the NumPy documentation for array manipulation techniques, especially concerning reshaping and indexing.
* Utilize a debugger, such as pdb or IDE-integrated debuggers, to step through your code and inspect the shapes and values of your tensors at each stage.  This allows for precise identification of where the out-of-bounds access occurs.  Pay close attention to variable values during the debugging process.

By systematically checking tensor shapes, carefully crafting preprocessing steps, and employing debugging tools, the "index out of bounds" errors encountered in Keras can be effectively prevented and resolved.  Remember, meticulous attention to data structures and indexing is paramount for reliable deep learning model development.
