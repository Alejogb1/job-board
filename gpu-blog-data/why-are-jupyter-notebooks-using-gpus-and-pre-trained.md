The consistent prediction of a single class by a Jupyter Notebook utilizing a GPU and pre-trained Keras checkpoints strongly suggests a problem within the data preprocessing pipeline, the model architecture, or the inference procedure itself, rather than an inherent limitation of the GPU or the pre-trained weights.  I've encountered this issue numerous times in my work developing image classification models for medical imaging analysis, and through rigorous debugging, I've isolated several common culprits.

**1. Data Preprocessing Inconsistencies:**

This is the most frequent source of this behavior.  Pre-trained models expect specific input formats.  Deviations from these standards, particularly in scaling, normalization, and data augmentation, can severely restrict the model's ability to discriminate between classes.  For instance, if your input images are not properly normalized to a range between 0 and 1, or if they have different dimensions than the data used to train the pre-trained model, the model's internal representations will be distorted, leading to consistently incorrect predictions. The model might simply "learn" to map all inputs to the most frequent class in the training data it was exposed to initially (during pre-training) because the input it receives in the inference phase differs significantly. Furthermore, if you’re applying augmentations inconsistently during testing or prediction, this can lead to unpredictable and biased outputs.

**2. Model Architecture Limitations:**

While a pre-trained model provides a strong foundation, the architecture itself might be unsuitable for the target task.  If the pre-trained model was trained on a significantly different dataset than yours, the learned features might not be transferable.  For example, a model pre-trained on ImageNet might struggle with medical images, requiring further fine-tuning or even a complete architectural redesign. Similarly, freezing too many layers during fine-tuning can limit the model's capacity to learn task-specific features, resulting in the observed behavior. Even a single misconfigured layer, like an incorrectly initialized weight matrix or an inadvertently deactivated activation function, can lead to such degenerate behavior.  I once spent a day debugging a model where a single line of code setting the dropout rate to 1.0 effectively deactivated a critical layer, resulting in constant predictions.

**3. Inference Procedure Errors:**

The prediction process itself can introduce errors.  Incorrect loading of the pre-trained weights, failure to utilize the GPU effectively, or subtle bugs in the prediction loop are all potential sources of the problem. In my experience, a seemingly minor oversight, such as forgetting to set the model to `eval()` mode in PyTorch or its Keras equivalent, can significantly impact the output. Similarly, if you're using a batch size of 1 during inference, it's possible your model will lack the necessary context to perform properly and predictably output the same class.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Image Preprocessing:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained model
model = keras.models.load_model('my_pretrained_model.h5')

# Incorrect preprocessing: No normalization
img = Image.open('image.jpg').resize((224, 224))
img_array = np.array(img)
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0))


# Correct preprocessing: Normalization to [0, 1]
img = Image.open('image.jpg').resize((224, 224))
img_array = np.array(img) / 255.0 # Normalize pixel values
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0))
```

This example highlights the crucial role of normalization.  Failure to normalize pixel values to the range [0,1] can lead to drastically different model behavior, potentially resulting in the observed consistent prediction. The commented-out section shows the error, while the corrected section illustrates the proper preprocessing step.


**Example 2: Freezing Too Many Layers During Fine-tuning:**

```python
#Load pre-trained model
base_model = keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
# Incorrect: Freezing too many layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

#Correct: Unfreezing some layers for fine-tuning
for layer in base_model.layers[:-5]: #Unfreeze the last 5 layers
    layer.trainable = False


x = base_model.output
x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

model = keras.models.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
```

This demonstrates the importance of appropriately fine-tuning a pre-trained model.  Freezing too many layers prevents the model from adapting to the new dataset, potentially leading to consistently inaccurate predictions. The corrected version shows a more nuanced approach, unfreezing a select number of layers to allow for adaptation.


**Example 3:  Inference Mode Check:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Incorrect: Model not in inference mode
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): #Assuming GPU availability
    prediction = model.predict(test_data) #Model might be in training mode

#Correct: Ensure model is in inference mode
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.evaluate(test_data)
    prediction = model.predict(test_data) #Inference mode is implicitly set when using 'predict' after compilation
```

This highlights a potential issue during inference.  Failing to ensure the model is in inference mode can lead to inconsistent behavior due to, for instance, the application of dropout or batch normalization in a manner inconsistent with testing.  The corrected code implicitly sets the model to inference mode when using the `predict` method after compilation.  Explicitly setting the mode using functions like `model.eval()` in PyTorch or equivalent methods in other frameworks can be vital.

**Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet; "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop.  Thorough understanding of these resources and careful debugging, in conjunction with a clear understanding of your data, will help resolve the issue.  Consider also reviewing the Keras documentation specific to model loading, prediction, and GPU usage.  Finally, systematically reviewing each stage of your pipeline, from data loading to prediction, with a focus on data consistency and model configuration, is crucial for accurate and reliable results.
