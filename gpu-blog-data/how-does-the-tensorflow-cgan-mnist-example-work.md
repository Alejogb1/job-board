The core innovation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) lies in its ability to generate data conditioned on a specific input, unlike standard GANs that generate samples from a latent distribution without explicit control. The MNIST CGAN example leverages this, allowing us to not only generate digit images but to direct the generation toward a specific digit (e.g., generating only '7's when desired).

**Explanation of the CGAN Architecture and Training Process**

The standard GAN architecture comprises two primary neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator’s goal is to transform random noise into realistic-looking images, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real images and those created by the generator. In a CGAN, both networks receive an additional input, a condition. In the MNIST example, this condition is a one-hot encoded vector representing the desired digit.

The generator network takes two inputs: a random noise vector drawn from a prior distribution (typically Gaussian) and the one-hot encoded digit label. These inputs are concatenated and fed into a series of transposed convolutional layers (often called deconvolutional layers) to upscale the latent space into an image. The final layer outputs an image with dimensions matching the target (28x28 for MNIST).  Crucially, the generator learns to manipulate the noise vector based on the conditioned digit input, generating samples that not only look like MNIST digits, but match the particular label.

The discriminator, conversely, receives an image as input (either a real image from the MNIST dataset or a generated image) along with the corresponding one-hot encoded digit label. Again, these inputs are often concatenated. The discriminator employs convolutional layers to downsample the input and learns to classify whether the provided image is real or generated. In addition, it evaluates if the image corresponds to the input label. This implies that the discriminator’s task is two-fold. The discriminator must identify counterfeit images, but also evaluate the quality of the conditioned generation, forcing the generator to produce images that are not just realistic, but also correctly labeled. The loss function for the discriminator will now include an evaluation of the predicted versus expected label. 

Training proceeds iteratively, similar to standard GANs, in an adversarial manner. In each iteration, the discriminator is first trained on a batch of real images and corresponding labels alongside a batch of generated images and their condition. The discriminator's loss, computed separately for real and generated samples, guides its learning to improve its ability to distinguish real from generated and authentic labels from non-authentic. After training the discriminator, the generator’s weights are updated to minimize the discriminator’s ability to detect the fake images. The generator’s loss is calculated solely using the discriminator’s output, evaluating how well its generated images fooled the discriminator, with the inclusion of the predicted versus expected label evaluation. This alternating process, where discriminator tries to become better at detecting fakes and generator tries to improve its fakes, ultimately leads to the generator creating more realistic images matching the specified labels.

**Code Examples**

These code segments are simplified to highlight core concepts. They represent parts of a complete CGAN model.

**Example 1: Generator Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def build_generator(latent_dim, num_classes):
    label_input = keras.Input(shape=(num_classes,))
    noise_input = keras.Input(shape=(latent_dim,))

    x = layers.concatenate([label_input, noise_input])
    x = layers.Dense(7 * 7 * 256, use_bias=False)(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.LeakyReLU()(x)
    x = layers.Reshape((7, 7, 256))(x)

    x = layers.Conv2DTranspose(128, (5, 5), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.LeakyReLU()(x)

    x = layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.LeakyReLU()(x)

    x = layers.Conv2DTranspose(1, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same', use_bias=False, activation='tanh')(x)

    model = keras.Model([label_input, noise_input], x)
    return model


generator = build_generator(100, 10) #Example instantiation of generator, with a latent dimension of 100, and 10 classes
```

This code defines the generator, taking two inputs: a noise vector of size `latent_dim` and a one-hot encoded label of `num_classes` (10 in the case of MNIST). The model concatenates the inputs and uses a series of dense and transposed convolutional layers to upscale to the image size. Batch normalization and LeakyReLU activations are common practices that help stabilize training and achieve better results. Note the final convolution using `tanh` as the activation, ensuring the output image pixel values are between -1 and 1.

**Example 2: Discriminator Network**

```python
def build_discriminator(num_classes):
  label_input = keras.Input(shape=(num_classes,))
  image_input = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

  x = layers.concatenate([layers.Flatten()(image_input), label_input])

  x = layers.Dense(7 * 7 * 128)(x)
  x = layers.LeakyReLU()(x)
  x = layers.Reshape((7, 7, 128))(x)

  x = layers.Conv2D(64, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same')(x)
  x = layers.LeakyReLU()(x)

  x = layers.Conv2D(128, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same')(x)
  x = layers.LeakyReLU()(x)

  x = layers.Flatten()(x)
  x = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

  model = keras.Model([image_input, label_input], x)
  return model

discriminator = build_discriminator(10) #Example instantiation of discriminator with 10 classes
```

The discriminator network takes the generated image and the condition (one-hot encoded digit label) as inputs. The image input is flattened and concatenated with label input. Several convolutional layers are used to downsample the data, with LeakyReLU activations. The output of the discriminator is a single sigmoid activated neuron predicting if the input sample is real (1) or generated (0). The discriminator learns to determine the authenticity of the image and label pair, which pushes the generator to improve its ability to generate realistically labeled samples.

**Example 3: Training Loop (Simplified)**

```python
import numpy as np

def train_step(generator, discriminator, generator_optimizer, discriminator_optimizer, real_images, labels, batch_size, latent_dim, num_classes):
  noise = tf.random.normal([batch_size, latent_dim])

  with tf.GradientTape() as gen_tape, tf.GradientTape() as disc_tape:
      generated_images = generator([labels, noise], training=True)

      real_output = discriminator([real_images, labels], training=True)
      fake_output = discriminator([generated_images, labels], training=True)

      disc_loss =  tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()(tf.ones_like(real_output), real_output) + tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()(tf.zeros_like(fake_output), fake_output)
      gen_loss = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()(tf.ones_like(fake_output), fake_output)

  discriminator_gradients = disc_tape.gradient(disc_loss, discriminator.trainable_variables)
  generator_gradients = gen_tape.gradient(gen_loss, generator.trainable_variables)

  discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(discriminator_gradients, discriminator.trainable_variables))
  generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(generator_gradients, generator.trainable_variables))

#Example usage, assuming a data set is loaded and optimizers are defined
#train_step(generator, discriminator, generator_optimizer, discriminator_optimizer, real_images, labels, batch_size, latent_dim, num_classes)
```

This code represents the core training logic. For each step, noise and a batch of labels is sampled. The generator produces generated images conditioned on the random noise and sampled labels.  The loss functions are defined using binary crossentropy. The `tf.GradientTape` keeps track of all operations within the scope and computes the gradients of the loss with respect to trainable variables of both generator and discriminator. Finally, the computed gradients are applied to update the weights via the optimizers.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding, I would recommend reviewing the original Generative Adversarial Networks paper by Goodfellow et al. which outlines the foundations.  For more applied examples, focus on tutorials and examples from the TensorFlow documentation.  The Keras API documentation can further assist with learning the specific layer definitions and implementations. Additionally, studies pertaining to conditional GANs and their use in image generation are beneficial to review.
