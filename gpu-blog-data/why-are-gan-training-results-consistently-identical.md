Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are notoriously sensitive to hyperparameter settings and initialization.  Identical training results, far from indicating a correct or stable model, almost always signify a lack of sufficient exploration in the parameter space and a potential degeneracy in the training process.  In my experience troubleshooting GAN implementations across numerous projects, including a recent endeavor involving high-resolution image generation for medical visualization, this issue stems primarily from a combination of poor initialization, insufficient regularization, and the use of suboptimal optimization strategies.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the interplay between the generator and discriminator.  Both networks are typically initialized with weights drawn from a specific distribution (e.g., normal or uniform). If these initializations are consistently identical across runs,  both networks will begin from precisely the same starting point, leading to the same gradient updates during training.  Furthermore, the optimization algorithms, most commonly variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), employ learning rates and momentum that influence the trajectory of the network weights.  If these hyperparameters are not appropriately tuned or randomized, the optimization will follow a highly predictable path, irrespective of the inherent stochasticity of the training data.  This results in a deterministic outcome, even though the training process involves stochasticity from mini-batch selection.

Another contributing factor is the lack of sufficient regularization.  GANs are susceptible to mode collapse, where the generator produces only a limited variety of samples, all very similar.  Without adequate regularization techniques, such as weight decay or dropout, the generator might converge prematurely to a local optimum, failing to explore the full data manifold. This mode collapse often manifests as identical or near-identical generated samples across different training runs.  Finally, the choice of activation functions can impact the network's expressiveness.  If the activation functions are not sufficiently diverse, the network might be unable to learn complex data distributions, again leading to repetitive outputs.

The key to breaking this deterministic behavior is to introduce variability into the training process. This includes: careful selection and randomization of initial weights, utilizing a wider range of hyperparameter values, employing robust regularization techniques, and selecting diverse activation functions.  The proper balance of these factors is crucial.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Random Weight Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def initialize_weights(shape, name):
  # Utilizing Glorot/Xavier initialization for better weight scaling.
  initializer = tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform() 
  return tf.Variable(initializer(shape=shape), name=name, trainable=True)

# ...rest of the GAN model definition...

generator = tf.keras.Sequential([
    #...layers...
])

discriminator = tf.keras.Sequential([
    #...layers...
])

#  Note the use of a seeded random number generator for reproducibility 
#  only within each run, ensuring different initializations between runs.
seed = 1234  #This seed is different per experiment run for different intialization

tf.random.set_seed(seed)
# Initialize weights of the generator and discriminator
# ... weight initialization using initialize_weights() function for each layer ...
```

This example demonstrates the use of Glorot uniform initialization, a method designed to mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients, and seed-based randomization to ensure variability across different training runs while allowing for reproducibility within each run.


**Example 2:  Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from tensorflow.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def create_gan(learning_rate=0.0001, beta_1=0.5, beta_2=0.999):
  # ... GAN model definition, dependent on learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2 parameters ...
  optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate, beta_1=beta_1, beta_2=beta_2)
  # ...rest of the GAN model compilation using the optimizer ...
  return model


model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_gan, epochs=100, batch_size=64, verbose=0)

param_dist = {
    'learning_rate': np.logspace(-5, -3, 10),
    'beta_1': np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 10),
    'beta_2': np.linspace(0.9, 0.999, 10)
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(model, param_distributions=param_dist, n_iter=10, cv=2, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1, random_state=42)
random_search_result = random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Best: %f using %s" % (random_search_result.best_score_, random_search_result.best_params_))

```

Here,  `RandomizedSearchCV` explores a range of hyperparameter values for the Adam optimizer, introducing variability and increasing the chance of finding an optimal configuration that avoids convergence to a degenerate solution.  The use of a random state in `RandomizedSearchCV` ensures repeatability of the search, but the best parameters discovered will still be different from run to run when the random state is changed or removed.


**Example 3: Incorporating Dropout Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

generator = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... layers ...
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2), # Dropout layer added for regularization
    # ... layers ...
])

discriminator = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... layers ...
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3), # Dropout layer added for regularization
    # ... layers ...
])

```

The addition of dropout layers in both the generator and discriminator networks introduces randomness during training by randomly dropping out neurons, acting as a form of regularization to prevent overfitting and encourage the model to learn more robust features, reducing the likelihood of mode collapse and identical results. The different dropout rates (0.2 and 0.3) add further variability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., "Generative Adversarial Networks" by Goodfellow,  "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop.  These texts cover the fundamental concepts of deep learning, GANs, and statistical machine learning relevant to understanding and addressing the issues of GAN training stability and reproducibility.  A thorough understanding of optimization algorithms and regularization techniques is also crucial. Consulting research papers focusing on improvements and variants of GAN architectures and training strategies would greatly enhance troubleshooting abilities.
