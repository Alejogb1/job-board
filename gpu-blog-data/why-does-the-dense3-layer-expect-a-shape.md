The discrepancy between the expected input shape (1,) and the received shape (86,) for a `dense_3` layer stems fundamentally from a mismatch in the dimensionality of the preceding layer's output and the `dense_3` layer's input expectations.  This is a common issue I've encountered during my years building and debugging neural networks, often tracing back to an incorrect understanding of data flow and layer configurations within the model architecture.  The (86,) shape indicates a vector of length 86, implying the preceding layer outputs a collection of 86 features, while the `dense_3` layer anticipates a single scalar value (a vector of length 1).

This problem arises primarily from one of three scenarios:

1. **Incorrect dimensionality reduction:** The layer preceding `dense_3` is not adequately reducing the dimensionality of its output.  This might be due to an overly complex preceding layer or a missing dimensionality reduction step (e.g., flattening, global pooling, or an additional dense layer with a single neuron).

2. **Unintended feature concatenation or stacking:** Features from multiple branches of the network may be concatenated or stacked inappropriately, resulting in a higher-dimensional output than anticipated by `dense_3`.  This is particularly prevalent in multi-branch architectures where feature aggregation isn't handled meticulously.

3. **Misinterpretation of data flow:**  The data passed to the model might have a different structure than expected.  This could be due to incorrect data preprocessing steps, an unintended change in the data's shape during model training or inference, or a misunderstanding of the data's inherent dimensionality.


Let's illustrate these scenarios with code examples using Keras, a framework I've extensively used in my past projects:


**Example 1: Incorrect Dimensionality Reduction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(100,)), # Example input layer
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(86, activation='relu'), # Outputting 86 features
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # dense_3 layer expecting (1,)
])

# This will work correctly because the final Dense layer reduces the dimensionality to (1,)
```

In this example, the problem is resolved by ensuring the penultimate layer outputs a single feature via `keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')`.  The previous layer, `keras.layers.Dense(86, activation='relu')`, while producing an (86,) shaped output, is appropriately followed by a layer that reduces this dimensionality.  During my work on a sentiment analysis project, I encountered a very similar issue that was resolved by adding an extra dense layer with a single output neuron.


**Example 2: Unintended Feature Concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_a = keras.layers.Input(shape=(50,))
input_b = keras.layers.Input(shape=(36,))

dense_a = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation='relu')(input_a)
dense_b = keras.layers.Dense(56, activation='relu')(input_b)

merged = keras.layers.concatenate([dense_a, dense_b]) # Concatenates, resulting in (86,)

dense_3 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=dense_3)

#This would throw the error because the concatenate layer produces (86,)
```

Here, the concatenation of `dense_a` and `dense_b` produces an output of shape (86,), directly feeding into `dense_3`, which expects a scalar.  In a project involving multi-modal data fusion, I encountered a similar situation. The solution involved using a `keras.layers.Flatten()` layer after concatenation if a fully connected layer is required, or employing a global pooling layer like `keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()` or `keras.layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D()`, depending on the data's nature, before feeding to `dense_3`.


**Example 3: Misinterpretation of Data Flow and Preprocessing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Incorrect Data Shape
data = np.random.rand(100, 86) # 100 samples, each with 86 features

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(86,)),  #input layer now matches the shape
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # dense_3 layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Attempting to fit with this incorrect shape would raise a similar error if the intended
# input should be a single feature instead of 86
model.fit(data, np.random.randint(0, 2, 100), epochs=10)

```

This example highlights how incorrect data preprocessing can lead to shape mismatches.  The input data `data` is already of shape (100, 86) while the model expects a single feature for each sample. The solution here involves either reshaping the input data to (100,1) if a single feature is desired, or modifying the model architecture to handle the 86 features appropriately, as shown in Example 1. In a past project involving time series data, I faced a similar issue, eventually tracking it to an incorrect `reshape` operation during data loading.


To further investigate and resolve such shape discrepancies, I recommend consulting the Keras documentation, reviewing the model summary (`model.summary()`) to understand layer outputs, and using debugging tools such as print statements to inspect the shapes of intermediate tensors at various stages of the model's forward pass.  Thorough examination of data preprocessing steps and a clear understanding of the desired data flow within the network are crucial for preventing these common errors.  Understanding tensor operations and how they affect shapes is fundamental for successful deep learning implementation.  Furthermore, visualizing the model architecture can aid in identifying potential bottlenecks or mismatches in dimensionality.
