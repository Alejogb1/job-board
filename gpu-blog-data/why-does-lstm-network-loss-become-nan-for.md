The core reason an LSTM network’s loss can become NaN (Not a Number) when batch sizes exceed one, particularly during early training, often stems from internal gradient explosion within the recurrent computations rather than solely batch-related issues. While the act of batching, in itself, isn’t the culprit, it exacerbates existing vulnerabilities present within the LSTM’s forward and backward pass when operating with multiple sequences concurrently. My experience deploying sequence-to-sequence models has shown that small, easily overlooked numerical instabilities propagate rapidly, especially when these computations are parallelized.

Specifically, LSTMs iteratively compute hidden states and cell states through a series of matrix multiplications and element-wise non-linear activations. These operations are inherently susceptible to numerical overflow or underflow, especially when the weight matrices have large values or when the activations lead to excessively large or small values in the cell and hidden states. With a batch size of one, these issues are often self-contained within a single sequence’s processing path, and the gradients, while still subject to the same mathematical properties, might remain within a numerically stable range. The single sequence’s state information at a given time step isn’t directly interacting or amplifying issues with that of another sequence.

However, batching alters this. All sequences within a batch are processed simultaneously. If, within this batch, one or more sequences produce large values (in hidden states, cell states, or gradients) in an intermediate step, that instability isn't confined. When the subsequent backward propagation calculates gradients, these large values can lead to exponentially growing derivatives. The problem isn't necessarily that the *average* state value across the batch is extreme. It's that the worst-case scenario *within* the batch gets magnified. The backpropagation algorithm computes gradients for all batch elements simultaneously, meaning large gradients within a single element’s processing will directly contribute to the updates across the entire batch. This effect is more pronounced as the batch size increases, as the probability of encountering such a problematic state also increases.

When this gradient explosion occurs, the result can be excessively large or infinite values for gradients and parameters, quickly producing NaN losses. The gradients become undefined, and thus subsequent loss computations generate these 'not a number' values. This is distinct from the issue of unstable gradients due to bad weight initialization (although that can certainly contribute to the underlying numerical instability that causes this issue). The batching process highlights, and then exacerbates, an instability that is inherent to the architecture, rather than the batch itself creating a brand new error.

To illustrate this better, consider the following code examples. The first uses standard initialization that does not focus on gradient control.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class BadLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(BadLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])  # Take the last timestep's output
        return out

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 256
model = BadLSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

batch_size = 16  # try changing this to 1 for stability
seq_length = 30
data = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, input_size)
target = torch.randn(batch_size, 1)

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

In this example, the `BadLSTM` model uses standard parameter initialization. When running with a batch size of 16, it's highly likely that you’ll quickly see the loss diverge to NaN. Reducing `batch_size` to 1 generally alleviates this because the gradients are not amplified across multiple sequences.

Next, consider a model where we implement gradient clipping, which is a commonly used technique to control these exploding gradients.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class ClippedLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(ClippedLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 256
model = ClippedLSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

batch_size = 16
seq_length = 30
data = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, input_size)
target = torch.randn(batch_size, 1)

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```
This example introduces `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`, which limits the norm of the gradients. By setting a `max_norm` parameter, such as 1.0, we prevent gradients from exploding by scaling the parameters down before they update. This mitigation often allows stable training even with larger batch sizes.

Finally, a more advanced strategy is to carefully initialize the LSTM’s weights using orthogonal initialization. This, combined with gradient clipping, can further improve stability.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class InitializedLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(InitializedLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

        # Initialize LSTM weights with orthogonal initialization
        for name, param in self.lstm.named_parameters():
            if 'weight' in name:
                nn.init.orthogonal_(param)


    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out


input_size = 10
hidden_size = 256
model = InitializedLSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

batch_size = 16
seq_length = 30
data = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, input_size)
target = torch.randn(batch_size, 1)

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Here, we add orthogonal initialization by iterating through the parameters of the LSTM layer and applying `nn.init.orthogonal_` to the 'weight' parameters.  This initialization can significantly reduce the likelihood of initial large gradients compared to the default uniform weight initialization which exacerbates the issue.

In summary, the issue isn’t batching itself, but how batching magnifies an LSTM’s inherent vulnerability to gradient explosions stemming from numerical instabilities in its recurrent computation. While a batch size of 1 can mask this issue by isolating the computation, batch sizes greater than one amplify these existing instabilities and produce undefined gradient values and, subsequently, NaN losses.  Strategies to mitigate this include gradient clipping and careful weight initialization. Other techniques include weight regularization, lower learning rates, and careful adjustment of activation functions. For further study, consult material on recurrent neural network training stability and numerical stability in deep learning. Research papers investigating gradient descent algorithms and architectural modifications for LSTMs can further clarify the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, focus on resources that delve into gradient clipping and orthogonal initialization, along with analysis of activation functions and their impact on numerical stability within recurrent networks.
