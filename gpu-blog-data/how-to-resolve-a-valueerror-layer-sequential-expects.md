The core issue stems from a mismatch between the input dimensionality expected by a `tf.keras.Sequential` model used within a federated learning context and the actual input provided during the model update process within federated averaging. I’ve encountered this situation several times, especially when customizing aggregation logic beyond basic federated averaging and it's often due to how input data is being prepared for the client-side model updates. When you encounter `ValueError: Layer sequential expects 1 input, but it received 3 input tensors`, it’s telling you that your model, designed to ingest a single data batch (tensor), is receiving three tensors at a time, often arising from improper structuring of the federated dataset or client model aggregation during federated training. Let’s look at why this happens and how to resolve it.

A typical federated averaging process involves several key stages. First, client datasets are prepared, usually as `tf.data.Dataset` objects. Second, a model, often a `tf.keras.Sequential` model is defined and initialized. Third, in each federated round, the global model parameters are distributed to each participating client. Fourth, each client then updates its local model based on its own data. Finally, these updated models are aggregated, usually by averaging, and form the basis of the next global model. The error occurs during the fourth stage, specifically during the client-side model update. `tf.keras.Sequential` models, by default, expect a single batch of data as an input tensor. In a correctly set up federated learning environment, the data should be passed to the model through functions that take batch objects, like `model.train_step` (although it's often abstracted through a training loop). This error indicates that the data is not being properly passed as a single batch to the `train_step` or the underlying Keras call.

The three likely causes are 1) the `tf.function` decorated training procedure expects a `tf.Tensor` when passed multiple batches, 2) a custom aggregation process incorrectly transforms model inputs, or 3) the dataset is not being properly batched and split before being passed into the client update loop, and each client dataset is thus being passed in whole instead of in single batches. Let me demonstrate these issues through code examples and how I’ve handled them.

**Example 1: Improper `tf.function` decoration**

In my earlier projects, I’ve seen that when a custom training procedure is decorated with `@tf.function` and that procedure expects a single input and the batch training operation does not unbatch the data the training will fail. Consider this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

def create_keras_model():
  return tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])

def client_update(model, dataset):
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

  @tf.function
  def train_step(batch):
    x = batch['feature'] # Assume batch keys are 'feature' and 'label'
    y = batch['label']
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      y_pred = model(x)
      loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss
  
  loss = 0.0
  num_batches = 0
  for batch in dataset:
      loss += train_step(batch)
      num_batches += 1
  return loss/ num_batches

# Assume data creation and TFF building code is elsewhere...
```

Here, the `train_step` function is decorated with `@tf.function`. While this can provide significant performance gains, it requires care. If the input dataset consists of multiple batches combined, this decorated function sees each element of the combined input, not a single batch, causing the expected 1 input to become multiple (in this case three). The solution is to ensure that the batch structure remains when passed into train_step, which is something that is often accomplished by the tff abstractions.

**Example 2: Incorrect Input Transformation**

Another common pitfall occurs when we inadvertently reshape or transform the input data before passing it to the model within client_update during a custom federated process. Here's an example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

def create_keras_model():
  return tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])

def client_update(model, dataset):
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

  for batch in dataset:
      x = batch['feature'] # Assume batch keys are 'feature' and 'label'
      y = batch['label']

      # Incorrect Reshaping (example - this is not present in all scenarios, can be any transformation)
      x = tf.reshape(x, (-1, 1))  # Intent is to reshape the batch if it has multiple examples

      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          y_pred = model(x)
          loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  
  return loss

# Assume data creation and TFF building code is elsewhere...
```

Here, I've reshaped `x` in an attempt to ensure all batches conform to a specific shape in my custom learning process. This operation might be based on a misconception about how the data is being structured or an incorrect attempt to handle batches of varying sizes. However, if the batch size is already handled during the dataset construction, this introduces an extra dimension, turning a (batch_size, 1) input expected by the model into a (batch_size, batch_size, 1), or similar causing a mismatch. If the batch is correct and the input data is not, you will still receive the error. Ensure that you are using correctly batched and reshaped data to prevent this type of error. Removing or correcting this transformation will fix the issue.

**Example 3: Improper Dataset Batching**

Sometimes, the problem isn't in the client-side model update logic, but rather in the way the federated dataset is being prepared on a client. If datasets aren't correctly batched, each client could be receiving an unbatched dataset which leads to a similar error when the data is fed into the `model()` call.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

def create_keras_model():
  return tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])

def client_update(model, dataset):
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
  for batch in dataset:
    x = batch['feature'] # Assume batch keys are 'feature' and 'label'
    y = batch['label']
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Assume the following incorrect data preparation:
# Example of incorrect batching
# clients = [
#   tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices({'feature': [[1],[2],[3]], 'label': [[1],[2],[3]]})
# ]

def create_federated_datasets(clients):
    return tff.simulation.datasets.TestClientData(clients)

# Instead of:
clients = [
  tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices({'feature': [[1],[2],[3]], 'label': [[1],[2],[3]]}).batch(2)
]
federated_dataset = create_federated_datasets(clients) #Correct data input

# Assume TFF building code is elsewhere...

```

Here, you may find that if the client datasets are not batched, or if the batch operation occurs after the transformation in which data is added to datasets, then the model receives the entire client's dataset at once which could be large and lead to a tensor dimensionality mismatch. The solution here is to ensure batching occurs appropriately such that the client updates occur on single batches of the data.

**Resolutions**

To resolve the `ValueError`, first ensure that your model definition's `input_shape` matches the actual data dimensionality of your prepared batches (often determined during preprocessing). You should verify that all the `feature` and `label` keys are in your data and that there is a consistent structure. You should always inspect the structure and shape of each batch that will be used by the `train_step` operation, especially during client updates. If the client datasets are not correctly batched, make sure the batch operation is done on each dataset before the federation of those datasets is performed.  When using a custom aggregation, closely examine how the inputs are being modified before reaching the `model()` function, and ensure that any transformation does not change the expected batching. Finally, using `tf.function` can have unexpected results, so examine whether it is being used correctly. Using `tf.data.Dataset` batching as a method of managing batched training is the recommended method of avoiding this type of error.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further investigation into this topic, I recommend referring to the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on Keras models, custom training loops, and the `tf.data` API. Also, the TensorFlow Federated documentation provides in-depth explanations of federated learning workflows including tutorials and code examples.  The TensorFlow source code, especially the federated examples, is another invaluable resource, as well as books on distributed machine learning. These resources will provide a more thorough understanding of the concepts involved and aid in debugging similar errors in the future.
