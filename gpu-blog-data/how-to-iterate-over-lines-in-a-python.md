The core issue lies in the misconception that reading a file in Python inherently modifies the file itself.  This is incorrect. File reading operations, by their nature, are non-destructive to the file's contents. The problem stems from how one handles the *representation* of the file's contents in memory, not the file's physical state on the disk.  My experience working with large log files and configuration management scripts has highlighted the importance of this distinction; improperly managing in-memory representations can lead to significant performance bottlenecks and unintended side effects.  Efficient iteration requires understanding this fundamental aspect.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

Python's built-in `open()` function, when used with the appropriate mode ('r' for reading), provides a file object that acts as an iterator.  Iterating directly over this file object offers the most efficient and memory-friendly approach to processing lines without creating a separate copy of the entire file's content in memory.  This is particularly crucial when dealing with extremely large files; loading the entire file into a list would consume excessive RAM, potentially causing memory errors or significant performance degradation.

The common mistake lies in reading the entire file into a list using methods like `readlines()`.  This creates an in-memory copy, consuming potentially significant memory resources.  Consequently, any subsequent modifications to this list do not affect the original file on the disk. The solution is straightforward: iterate directly over the file object.  The file object itself is an iterator, yielding one line at a time, minimizing memory usage.

The `for` loop mechanism in Python inherently leverages the iterator protocol.  Therefore, a simple loop directly using the file object is the most efficient method for line-by-line processing without modifying the original file.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Iteration**

```python
def process_file_basic(filepath):
    """Processes each line of a file without creating a copy."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                # Process each line here.  For instance:
                processed_line = line.strip().upper()
                print(processed_line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")

# Example Usage
process_file_basic("my_file.txt")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the simplest and most efficient method. The `with open(...)` construct ensures the file is automatically closed, even if exceptions occur.  The `for` loop directly iterates over the file object, yielding each line successively.  The `strip()` method removes leading/trailing whitespace, and `.upper()` converts the line to uppercase. This showcases a processing step; replace this with your desired logic.  Error handling is included for robustness.


**Example 2:  Line Numbering**

```python
def process_file_numbered(filepath):
    """Processes each line with line numbers."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            for line_number, line in enumerate(file, 1): # Start numbering from 1
                processed_line = f"{line_number}: {line.strip()}"
                print(processed_line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")

# Example Usage
process_file_numbered("my_file.txt")
```

*Commentary:*  This example utilizes `enumerate()` to add line numbers to each line during processing.  The `enumerate()` function takes the iterable (the file object) and an optional starting value for the counter (here, 1). This adds functionality while maintaining the non-destructive nature of the iteration.


**Example 3: Selective Processing Based on Condition**

```python
def process_file_conditional(filepath, keyword):
    """Processes lines containing a specific keyword."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                if keyword in line:
                    processed_line = line.strip()
                    print(processed_line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")

# Example Usage
process_file_conditional("my_file.txt", "example")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates conditional processing. Only lines containing the specified `keyword` are processed. This showcases how to incorporate logic for selective line handling without altering the original file. The efficiency remains high because it still iterates through the file object without creating a full in-memory copy.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a more in-depth understanding of file handling in Python, consult the official Python documentation on file I/O.  The documentation thoroughly explains the different file modes, methods available for file objects, and best practices for efficient file manipulation.  A good introductory Python textbook covering file operations would also prove beneficial.  Additionally, resources focusing on memory management in Python can help optimize larger projects involving file processing.  These resources provide a solid foundation for more advanced techniques like memory mapping for extremely large files, which are beyond the scope of this direct response but represent a natural extension of the principles discussed here.
