CUDA kernel execution, fundamentally, always occurs on the device—the GPU—and never directly on the host CPU. However, the nuanced question of *whether* your kernel code is *actually* executing on the device or is somehow being held up or running incorrectly often arises when debugging complex applications. I've spent years wrestling with this, from simple parallel matrix multiplications to complex volumetric fluid simulations, and the subtle variations in how errors manifest can be misleading. The initial hurdle is always knowing definitively if the kernel code *reached* the device and if it's running as intended.

The core concept to grasp is that CUDA programming involves distinct host and device code. The host code, typically written in C/C++, orchestrates the data transfer, memory management, and kernel launching, all managed by the CUDA runtime API. The kernel code, marked by the `__global__` qualifier in CUDA C/C++, is compiled for the GPU and subsequently dispatched to the device for execution. Therefore, the *intent* is always for the device to execute the kernel. Errors arise not from the kernel running on the host but when the kernel does not *reach* the device correctly, or when it executes incorrectly on the device.

Here are a few common scenarios I've encountered where the execution appears to fail and the debugging process requires careful attention:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Kernel Launch Configuration**

The host code needs to properly specify the number of thread blocks and threads per block when launching a kernel. If these parameters are incorrect, the kernel may be launched with insufficient resources, leading to either a crash or improper device-side computation.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void addArrays(float *a, float *b, float *c, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int bytes = size * sizeof(float);

    float *h_a = new float[size];
    float *h_b = new float[size];
    float *h_c = new float[size];

    for (int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
        h_a[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
        h_b[i] = static_cast<float>(i*2);
    }

    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, bytes);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, bytes);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, bytes);

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Incorrect launch configuration: only 1 thread per block!
    int threadsPerBlock = 1;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    addArrays<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Crucial

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        std::cout << "h_c[" << i << "] = " << h_c[i] << std::endl;
    }


    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    delete[] h_a;
    delete[] h_b;
    delete[] h_c;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `threadsPerBlock` is set to 1. This will result in only one thread operating on each block. While the kernel executes on the device, it will not perform the addition correctly for all the elements because each block is handling one element, and we have more elements than blocks.  The critical problem isn't that the device isn't executing it, but that the work performed by the kernel doesn't cover the intended dataset. This highlights the importance of properly planning the grid and block dimensions relative to your problem's domain. The `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` line is also important; it forces the host to wait for the device to finish all operations, including memory copies, before continuing.

**Scenario 2: Device Memory Errors**

If the device memory allocations are incorrect or if a kernel attempts to access memory outside of the allocated bounds, the kernel might crash silently or cause undefined behavior. It can sometimes appear as if no execution occurred.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void accessInvalidMemory(float *data, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        // Invalid access if `size` exceeds allocation
        data[i * 2] = 1.0f; 
    }
}


int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int bytes = size * sizeof(float);
    float *h_data = new float[size];

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
      h_data[i] = 0.0f;
    }

    float *d_data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, bytes);
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Correct launch configuration.
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    accessInvalidMemory<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, size);

    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();


    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        std::cout << "h_data[" << i << "] = " << h_data[i] << std::endl;
    }

    cudaFree(d_data);
    delete[] h_data;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, even though the kernel *is* executing on the device, the `data[i * 2]` access can cause a device memory out-of-bounds write, depending on the `size` and the memory allocation. Again, the kernel runs, but the effects are not what we expect, and might be completely silent with no error message. This often manifests as corrupted memory values or silent failures. Proper error checking, using `cudaGetLastError()` after device operations, is crucial in such cases.

**Scenario 3: Synchronization Issues and Errors**

CUDA is asynchronous; the host code does not automatically wait for the device to finish its work unless explicitly synchronized. If you read from device memory on the host before the kernel is done writing, you get invalid data. As previously mentioned, the call to `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is essential after device operations, specifically memory copies back to the host after a kernel launch, in order to guarantee device writes are visible to the host. If errors are occurring on the device, then this may not be enough to see what is going on; and we'll need to specifically check CUDA error codes to pinpoint device-specific errors.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void errorKernel(float *data) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    // Intentional error to force a device side error.
    data[i] = data[i] / 0.0f;
}


int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int bytes = size * sizeof(float);
    float *h_data = new float[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        h_data[i] = 1.0f;
    }
    float *d_data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, bytes);
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    errorKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data);

    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cout << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    }

    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      std::cout << "h_data[" << i << "] = " << h_data[i] << std::endl;
    }
    cudaFree(d_data);
    delete[] h_data;
    return 0;
}
```
Here, I've intentionally created a division by zero inside the kernel.  While the kernel will execute, it will result in a device error that we can catch by checking `cudaGetLastError()` after the launch. Had we not checked, we might have thought the kernel did not execute due to seeing default data from the memory copy back to the host. This demonstrates the importance of error checking routines after *every* CUDA operation.

In summary, while the CUDA kernel *always* executes on the device, the complexities of launch configurations, memory management, and asynchronous execution can lead to situations where the desired computations do not occur as planned. Therefore, rather than asking “Is it running on the device?”, a better question is "Is it running *correctly* on the device?" The key to this distinction lies in careful debugging involving correctly sizing your grid and block dimensions, verifying memory allocation sizes and access patterns, ensuring proper synchronization after device calls, and checking for CUDA errors. I recommend these resources: The official CUDA documentation and programming guide, textbooks focusing on parallel programming with GPUs, and online forums dedicated to CUDA development. These provide detailed explanations and troubleshooting strategies.
