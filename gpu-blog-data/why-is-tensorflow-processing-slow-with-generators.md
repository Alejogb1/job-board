TensorFlow's performance degradation when used with generators stems primarily from the inherent difference in data handling between eager execution and graph execution, coupled with the generator's lazy evaluation strategy.  My experience optimizing large-scale image classification models highlighted this issue repeatedly.  While generators offer memory efficiency, their asynchronous nature clashes with TensorFlow's optimization strategies, particularly when graph-based execution is employed.  Eager execution mitigates this, but at the cost of computational overhead.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow, in its earlier versions, heavily relied on static computation graphs.  A graph represents the entire computation before execution.  This allows for various optimizations, including kernel fusion and parallel processing.  Generators, however, produce data on demand.  This means TensorFlow doesn't have the complete dataset available to build an optimal execution graph. Instead, it receives data in small batches, forcing it to repeatedly rebuild or partially execute the graph, negating many of the performance gains achievable with static graph optimization.

This problem is exacerbated by the overhead associated with repeatedly fetching data from the generator.  Each batch request incurs a context switch, potentially involving I/O operations if the data is sourced from disk or a network. This overhead significantly increases the overall processing time, especially when dealing with large datasets.  Furthermore, the lack of a complete dataset view prevents efficient prefetching and pipelining of data, which are critical for optimizing throughput.

More recent versions of TensorFlow, with increased emphasis on eager execution, alleviate this issue somewhat. Eager execution executes operations immediately, eliminating the need for a pre-built graph. However, even in eager mode, the repetitive fetching from the generator still incurs overhead, though potentially less than in graph mode.  The underlying issue remains: generators inherently introduce asynchronous behavior that doesn't perfectly align with TensorFlow's optimization strategies, regardless of execution mode.  Optimal performance necessitates a balance between memory efficiency (favored by generators) and efficient data pre-fetching and batching.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Generator Usage (Graph Mode)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def inefficient_generator():
    for i in range(1000):
        yield tf.constant([i])

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(inefficient_generator, output_types=tf.int32)
dataset = dataset.batch(32)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    for batch in dataset:
        # Computation here
        result = tf.reduce_sum(batch)
        sess.run(result)
```

This example showcases inefficient use of a generator within a TensorFlow graph. The generator `inefficient_generator` yields data one element at a time.  This results in substantial overhead as TensorFlow processes each batch independently, without benefiting from graph optimizations.

**Example 2: Improved Generator with Prefetching (Eager Mode)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def improved_generator():
    for i in range(1000):
        yield tf.constant([i])

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(improved_generator, output_types=tf.int32)
dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

for batch in dataset:
    # Computation here
    result = tf.reduce_sum(batch)
    result.numpy() #force eager execution
```

This example leverages `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` for prefetching.  This allows TensorFlow to asynchronously fetch data in the background while processing the current batch, reducing I/O bottlenecks.  The use of eager execution minimizes graph construction overhead. However, the generator still introduces some overhead compared to loading the entire dataset directly into memory.

**Example 3:  Using `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` for optimal performance**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

data = np.arange(1000)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

for batch in dataset:
    # Computation here
    result = tf.reduce_sum(batch)
    result.numpy()
```

This example demonstrates the most efficient approach for numerical data.  Instead of using a generator, the entire dataset is loaded into a NumPy array and passed to `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`. This eliminates the overhead associated with lazy evaluation and provides TensorFlow with a complete dataset view for optimized graph construction and execution.  This method is generally preferred unless memory constraints necessitate the use of generators.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation.  Pay close attention to sections on `tf.data` and dataset optimization.
*   Textbooks and online courses covering TensorFlow's internal workings and optimization strategies. Focus on understanding graph optimization techniques and the interplay between data loading mechanisms and TensorFlow's execution model.
*   Research papers on large-scale machine learning and data processing pipelines.  Explore studies comparing different data loading approaches and their impact on training efficiency.  Look for papers that delve into the performance implications of generators in TensorFlow-based systems.  Consider the tradeoffs between memory usage and performance carefully.
