Index-only scans, while seemingly efficient, can unexpectedly degrade PostgreSQL performance under specific circumstances. My experience troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in large-scale data warehousing projects has revealed that the perceived slowness isn't inherent to the index-only scan mechanism itself, but rather stems from several factors related to index structure, data distribution, and query characteristics.  The key fact to understand is that while an index-only scan avoids accessing the heap, it still involves significant overhead in navigating the index structure and potentially performing operations on the index data itself.

**1. Index Structure and Complexity:**

The efficiency of an index-only scan is directly proportional to the index's structure and the size of the index entries.  A B-tree index, for instance, which is the default index type in PostgreSQL, requires traversal of multiple levels to locate relevant entries.  If the index is highly fragmented or poorly maintained (due to frequent updates or insufficient vacuuming), the search time increases dramatically, negating any performance benefit.  Furthermore, large index entries, especially those including multiple columns, require more processing time during the scan.  In my experience working with geospatial data, using GiST indexes with complex spatial objects often resulted in longer-than-expected index-only scan times.  The cost of comparing and filtering complex geometric data within the index outweighs the benefit of avoiding heap access.  This is especially true when dealing with many candidate index entries.  Consider that even a highly optimized index needs to locate the specific entries fitting the WHERE clause, and these need to be processed individually, regardless of whether the heap data is touched.

**2. Data Distribution and Selectivity:**

The effectiveness of an index-only scan is also contingent on the selectivity of the query's WHERE clause.  High selectivity, where the WHERE clause filters out a significant portion of the table data, leads to fewer index entries needing processing. This benefits an index-only scan, which avoids the cost of heap access for discarded rows.  Conversely, low selectivity, where the WHERE clause matches a large fraction of the table, can lead to the index-only scan processing a substantial subset of the index, resulting in performance degradation. In one project involving customer transaction history, a query with a low selectivity WHERE clause (e.g., `WHERE transaction_date > '2022-01-01'`) ended up processing nearly the entire index, resulting in slow query execution.  The cost of processing many index entries, even without heap access, became considerable.

**3. Query Plan and Optimizer Choices:**

PostgreSQL's query planner plays a critical role in determining whether an index-only scan is used and its effectiveness.   The planner estimates the cost of various execution plans, including an index-only scan, a sequential scan, and index scans followed by heap accesses.  If the planner incorrectly estimates the cost of an index-only scan, it may choose this plan even when it's less efficient.  This often occurs when the statistics of the index and the underlying table are outdated or inaccurate.  Regular `ANALYZE` commands are crucial to ensure accurate statistics and guide the optimizer toward efficient query plans.  Additionally, the specific columns included in the index can influence the optimizer's choice.  If the query needs columns not present in the index, an index-only scan is impossible, leading the optimizer to choose a less optimal plan.


**Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Beneficial Index-Only Scan**

```sql
-- Table with an index on (product_id, price)
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name TEXT,
    price NUMERIC,
    description TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products (product_id, price);

-- Query benefiting from index-only scan; all needed columns are in the index.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT product_id, price FROM products WHERE product_id = 123;
```

This query benefits from an index-only scan because all columns selected (`product_id`, `price`) are present in the index `idx_products_price`. The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement would show an index-only scan as the chosen plan, demonstrating improved efficiency.


**Example 2: Inefficient Index-Only Scan Due to Low Selectivity**

```sql
--Query with low selectivity, potentially leading to inefficient index-only scan.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT product_id, price, description FROM products WHERE price < 1000;
```

While an index exists on `(product_id, price)`, this query might still experience slow performance if many products have a price under 1000.  Even though the `product_id` and `price` are indexed, the `description` column necessitates a heap fetch, negating the potential advantage.  The planner might still choose an index-only scan for `product_id` and `price`, but the subsequent heap accesses for `description` for numerous rows will dominate the execution time.  The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output will be critical in revealing this behavior.


**Example 3:  Inefficient Index-Only Scan Due to Index Structure**

```sql
-- Table with a poorly-maintained index
CREATE TABLE large_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX idx_large_table_data ON large_table USING btree (data);
-- Simulate frequent updates causing index fragmentation
INSERT INTO large_table (data) SELECT 'a' || generate_series(1,1000000);
UPDATE large_table SET data = 'b' || data WHERE id%2 = 0;


--Query demonstrating potential slowdowns due to index fragmentation
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT id, data FROM large_table WHERE data LIKE 'a%';
```

This example demonstrates how index fragmentation, resulting from frequent updates without adequate vacuuming, can impact an index-only scan.  The `LIKE` clause might seem suitable for an index scan, but the fragmented nature of `idx_large_table_data` means the index itself will be slow to traverse, even if heap access is avoided.  The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output should highlight high index-traversal costs.  Regular `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` operations are crucial in mitigating this issue.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The PostgreSQL documentation, specifically the sections on indexing and query planning, are invaluable resources.  Understanding the concepts of B-trees, index types, statistics, and query optimization is critical.  Books on database internals and performance tuning are also highly beneficial.  Finally, tools like `pgAdmin` and dedicated performance monitoring applications offer insights into query execution plans and resource usage, allowing for detailed analysis and optimization.
