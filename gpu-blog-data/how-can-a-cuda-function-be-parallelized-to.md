The inherent challenge in parallelizing a CUDA function to operate on each element of a matrix lies in efficiently managing data access and minimizing thread divergence.  My experience optimizing large-scale computational fluid dynamics simulations highlighted this precisely; naive parallelization often led to significant performance bottlenecks.  Effective strategies hinge on understanding CUDA's thread hierarchy and employing appropriate memory access patterns.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core principle involves mapping matrix elements to CUDA threads.  Each thread executes the CUDA function on a single element.  To achieve this, we leverage CUDA's grid and block structure.  A grid comprises multiple blocks, and each block contains numerous threads.  The dimensions of the grid and block are carefully chosen to optimize workload distribution across the available multiprocessors.  Careful consideration must be given to the size of the matrix and the number of available CUDA cores.  Over-subscription (too many threads for available cores) can result in context switching overhead, negating performance gains.  Conversely, under-subscription leaves resources idle.

Efficient parallelization demands effective memory access.  Global memory access is comparatively slow.  Therefore, shared memory, a faster, on-chip memory accessible by threads within the same block, is crucial for performance enhancement.  Shared memory is typically used to cache portions of the matrix, allowing threads to access frequently used data more rapidly.  The strategy for data transfer to and from shared memory directly influences the overall efficiency.  Coalesced memory access, where multiple threads access contiguous memory locations simultaneously, is paramount.  Non-coalesced access generates significant latency and slows execution.

Careful consideration must also be given to potential thread divergence.  If different threads within a block execute different code paths within the CUDA function, it can severely impact performance.  This is because the GPU's SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) architecture is optimized for threads executing the same instructions.  Divergence forces the GPU to serialize execution, effectively negating the parallel processing advantage.  Careful function design and data structuring can minimize divergence.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Element-wise Operation (Addition)**

This example demonstrates a simple element-wise addition of two matrices.  It emphasizes straightforward thread mapping and efficient shared memory usage.

```c++
__global__ void matrixAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int width, int height) {
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        c[y * width + x] = a[y * width + x] + b[y * width + x];
    }
}

// Host code (simplified)
int width = 1024;
int height = 1024;
int threadsPerBlock = 16;
dim3 blockDim(threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock);
dim3 gridDim((width + threadsPerBlock -1) / threadsPerBlock, (height + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock);

matrixAdd<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, width, height);
```

This code uses a 2D grid and block structure to efficiently map threads to matrix elements. The `if` condition handles boundary cases.  This approach provides a good balance between simplicity and efficiency.

**Example 2: Incorporating Shared Memory**

This example refines the previous example by incorporating shared memory to reduce global memory access.

```c++
__global__ void matrixAddShared(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int width, int height) {
    __shared__ float sharedA[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];
    __shared__ float sharedB[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];

    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        sharedA[ty][tx] = a[y * width + x];
        sharedB[ty][tx] = b[y * width + x];
        __syncthreads(); // Synchronize before accessing shared memory
        c[y * width + x] = sharedA[ty][tx] + sharedB[ty][tx];
    }
}
```

Here, `TILE_WIDTH` defines the size of the shared memory tile.  `__syncthreads()` ensures all threads in a block have loaded their data before performing the addition.  This significantly reduces global memory transactions.  The choice of `TILE_WIDTH` is crucial and depends on the available shared memory per block.

**Example 3:  More Complex Element-wise Operation (Square Root)**

This example illustrates parallelization for a more computationally intensive element-wise operation â€“ calculating the square root of each matrix element.

```c++
__global__ void matrixSqrt(const float *a, float *b, int width, int height) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < width * height) {
        b[i] = sqrtf(a[i]);
    }
}
```

This example is simpler due to the inherent independence of the square root operation for each element.  Shared memory is not strictly necessary for such independent operations, though it could offer benefits for larger matrices through optimized memory access. The choice to use a 1D thread indexing simplifies the code.
