Exporting a PyTorch submodule with extra state to ONNX requires careful handling of the state's serialization and subsequent reconstruction within the ONNX runtime environment.  My experience working on large-scale deployment pipelines for natural language processing models has highlighted the crucial role of meticulous state management during this process.  Simply exporting the submodule directly often fails due to the inability of ONNX to inherently manage arbitrary Python objects residing outside the standard PyTorch tensor structure.

The core challenge lies in translating the custom state into a format ONNX understands.  ONNX primarily deals with computational graphs represented by nodes and tensors.  External state, such as model-specific buffers or learned embeddings stored outside the main weight parameters, needs to be encoded into tensors or attributes within the ONNX graph itself, or handled through an external mechanism like initializing the state during the ONNX runtime inference.  Failing to do so results in a runtime error indicating missing or uninitialized parameters.


**1.  Explanation of the process:**

The method involves three key steps:  (a) encapsulating extra state within the submodule; (b) modifying the submodule's `forward` method to appropriately use this state; and (c) utilizing the PyTorch `torch.onnx.export` function with the correct parameters to capture this modified behavior within the ONNX graph.

Encapsulation involves creating attributes within the submodule class to hold the extra state. These attributes should be PyTorch tensors, as these are readily serializable into ONNX.  Avoid using Python lists, dictionaries, or other non-tensor objects directly; these will not be exported correctly.  The `forward` method should then access and modify these tensors as required during the computation.  The crucial aspect is that the operations on this internal state should be reflected in the computational graph constructed by PyTorch during the export process.  This ensures that the state is not merely a static element but rather participates dynamically in the model's computations, as intended.

During export, using the `dynamic_axes` parameter in `torch.onnx.export` is often beneficial, especially when dealing with variable-length sequences. This ensures that the ONNX model correctly handles inputs of varying dimensions.  Additionally, specifying the `opset_version` is important to ensure compatibility with the ONNX runtime you intend to use.  Higher opset versions offer more features but might not be supported by all runtimes.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple State Embedding:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx

class EmbeddingSubmodule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, num_embeddings):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)
        self.state = torch.randn(1, embedding_dim) #Extra state: Initial embedding

    def forward(self, indices):
        embedded = self.embedding(indices)
        self.state = torch.add(self.state, embedded) #Modifying the state
        return self.state

model = EmbeddingSubmodule(embedding_dim=10, num_embeddings=100)
dummy_input = torch.randint(0, 100, (1,))

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "embedding_submodule.onnx",
                  input_names=['indices'], output_names=['output'],
                  opset_version=13)
```

This example shows a simple embedding submodule with an extra state tensor, initialized randomly. The `forward` method adds the input embedding to the state.  The ONNX export includes this state update within the graph.

**Example 2:  Buffer for running average:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx

class RunningAverageSubmodule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_buffer('running_avg', torch.zeros(dim))
        self.count = 0

    def forward(self, input):
        self.count += 1
        self.running_avg = (self.running_avg * (self.count - 1) + input) / self.count
        return self.running_avg

model = RunningAverageSubmodule(dim=5)
dummy_input = torch.randn(5)

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "running_average.onnx",
                  input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'],
                  opset_version=13)
```

This example uses `register_buffer` to add a running average buffer.  This buffer is correctly exported as part of the ONNX graph, enabling persistent state across inferences.


**Example 3:  Handling variable-length sequences with dynamic axes:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx

class LSTMSubmodule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.hidden = None

    def forward(self, input):
        output, self.hidden = self.lstm(input, self.hidden)
        return output

model = LSTMSubmodule(input_size=10, hidden_size=20)
dummy_input = torch.randn(5, 10) # Variable sequence length
model(dummy_input) #Initialize hidden state

dynamic_axes = {'input': {0: 'seq_len'}, 'output': {0: 'seq_len'}}

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "lstm_submodule.onnx",
                  input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'],
                  dynamic_axes=dynamic_axes, opset_version=13)
```

Here, an LSTM submodule is exported with dynamic axes to handle sequences of varying lengths.  The `hidden` state is implicitly managed by the LSTM layer, and the dynamic axes definition ensures the ONNX model correctly handles different input sequence lengths.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on ONNX export is essential.   A comprehensive understanding of ONNX operators and their limitations is crucial for successful deployment.  Thorough testing of the exported ONNX model with various input scenarios in your chosen ONNX runtime is critical to validating correctness.  Exploring existing examples and tutorials of ONNX export involving complex modules within the PyTorch community forums can provide valuable insights and solutions for more specialized scenarios.  Finally, a solid grasp of the underlying principles of computational graphs is immensely valuable.
