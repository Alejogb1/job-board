Low GPU utilization, specifically 0% when employing a Tesla T4 under CUDA 11.5 on Ubuntu 20.04, typically indicates a critical misconfiguration within the software stack, rather than an issue with the hardware itself. In my experience debugging such problems, the culprit frequently lies within the interaction between the CUDA toolkit, the installed NVIDIA drivers, and the application attempting to leverage the GPU. It’s not uncommon for the application to be inadvertently executing on the CPU, or for memory management issues to prevent successful data transfer to the GPU.

The primary reason for 0% GPU utilization is often a failure in the communication pathway between the host CPU and the GPU. This pathway relies on a correctly installed and matched set of NVIDIA drivers, the CUDA toolkit, and correctly configured application code. When discrepancies exist, the application's calls for GPU resources are effectively ignored, leading to execution on the CPU. Consider this as a multi-layered system, where each layer must be in sync for successful GPU usage.

Several root causes often contribute to this lack of utilization:

**1. Driver Mismatch:** The NVIDIA driver version must be explicitly compatible with the CUDA toolkit version. CUDA 11.5 has specific driver requirements. If the installed driver predates or postdates the required range, the CUDA runtime might fail to initialize or communicate with the GPU. This often manifests as either a silent failure where the application defaults to CPU execution or a more explicit error message indicating driver incompatibility during program initialization.

**2. Incorrect CUDA Toolkit Installation:** While a toolkit might be installed, specific path variables like `$CUDA_HOME`, `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `$PATH` must be meticulously configured to point to the correct CUDA installation directory. The system needs to know where to find the CUDA libraries and executable files for successful operation. Failure to set these environment variables correctly means the application won’t locate the necessary resources for GPU computation. It might find and run a default CPU implementation rather than utilizing the GPU.

**3. Application Configuration Errors:** The application code itself might be configured incorrectly, particularly concerning which device it is targeting for computation. If the application attempts to use a CPU device instead of a CUDA-enabled GPU device, no GPU activity would be observed. This often involves incorrect parameters in CUDA API calls or other high-level abstraction layer implementations. Similarly, resource management issues like failing to allocate GPU memory or improperly copying data can prevent the GPU from being engaged.

**4. Application Dependencies:** Some applications might have complex dependencies, where parts are designed to run on the CPU even when the intention is to use the GPU. In such cases, although the application attempts GPU execution, a CPU component could be acting as a bottleneck. Therefore, isolating the code that specifically targets the GPU is a critical step in debugging.

**5. Resource Conflicts:** In multi-GPU setups, resource allocation can be complicated. If the application requests a GPU that is unavailable, either because it's being used by another process, or incorrectly specified in code, the CUDA runtime might fall back to the CPU. This situation is particularly prevalent in server environments running multiple processes or user sessions.

Here are three examples demonstrating these issues, incorporating a simple CUDA kernel, to further clarify the challenges:

**Example 1: Driver Compatibility Issue**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}


int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);

    float *h_a = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_b = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_c = (float*)malloc(size);


    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
      h_a[i] = 1.0f;
      h_b[i] = 2.0f;
    }

    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size);


    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;


    vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);


    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    free(h_a);
    free(h_b);
    free(h_c);


    cudaError_t cudaError = cudaGetLastError();
    if (cudaError != cudaSuccess) {
       std::cerr << "CUDA Error: " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaError) << std::endl;
       return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "CUDA operation completed." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```

In this code, a basic vector addition kernel is defined, data is transferred to the GPU, the kernel is launched, and the result is copied back to the host. If the drivers are mismatched with CUDA, `cudaGetLastError()` might produce an error regarding driver compatibility, and no computation will occur on the GPU. Monitoring tools like `nvidia-smi` would still report 0% GPU usage, while the kernel will fall back to a CPU implementation or simply fail.

**Example 2: Incorrect Environment Variables**

This example uses the same code as above. The problem, however, is located with incorrect environmental variables. Compilation and execution, without properly specifying the correct `CUDA_HOME` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` will often lead to an execution on the CPU rather than the GPU, though compilation may still be successful. This is because the compiler locates generic C++ functions, rather than GPU-specific CUDA implementations. If, for example, the following environmental variables were unset, the application would typically compile and run, but would execute on the CPU:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.5
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.5/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.5/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Without them, the libraries to handle GPU computation are missing from both the build process and the runtime environment, which translates to no GPU utilization during execution.

**Example 3: Incorrect Device Selection**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);

    float *h_a = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_b = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_c = (float*)malloc(size);

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
      h_a[i] = 1.0f;
      h_b[i] = 2.0f;
    }

    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    cudaSetDevice(1); // Intentional selection of incorrect device
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size);


    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    free(h_a);
    free(h_b);
    free(h_c);

    cudaError_t cudaError = cudaGetLastError();
    if (cudaError != cudaSuccess) {
       std::cerr << "CUDA Error: " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaError) << std::endl;
       return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "CUDA operation completed." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```

Here, if the code intentionally selects a device other than the one available (e.g., device ID `1` when only a single Tesla T4 is present and ID `0`), or if the code does not properly specify which GPU is supposed to be used (e.g., using a default device index when multiple GPUs are available), no GPU activity will occur, leading to 0% utilization and potentially other errors.

To effectively troubleshoot such issues, I recommend checking the following:

**1. NVIDIA Driver Verification:** Use `nvidia-smi` to confirm the currently installed driver version. Cross-reference this against the CUDA toolkit compatibility matrix.
**2. CUDA Installation Confirmation:** Verify that the CUDA toolkit is correctly installed in the expected directory by checking `$CUDA_HOME`. Ensure that the `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables include the relevant CUDA binary and library directories.
**3. Application Logging:** Utilize logging mechanisms within your application to output the device ID being targeted. This will help verify if the application is attempting to execute on the correct device.
**4. Minimal Example Testing:** Create simplified CUDA examples, similar to the provided code, to isolate the issue. By starting with the bare minimum functionality, you can quickly confirm that the driver and CUDA toolkit environment are working correctly, before moving to the full-scale application.
**5. Hardware Diagnostic Tools:** Run memory tests to check for potential hardware faults. While less common, such issues can also contribute to program failure.

By methodically checking these aspects, it’s typically possible to pinpoint the issue causing 0% GPU utilization and correct it, thereby successfully leveraging the GPU’s computational capabilities.
