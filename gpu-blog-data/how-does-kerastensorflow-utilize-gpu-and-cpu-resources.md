The core mechanism through which Keras/TensorFlow leverages GPU and CPU resources hinges on the underlying hardware capabilities and the strategic allocation managed by TensorFlow's runtime.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for various hardware configurations, including systems with multiple GPUs and heterogeneous CPU/GPU setups, has highlighted the importance of understanding this resource management.  It's not a simple matter of automatic parallelization; effective utilization requires careful consideration of model architecture, data pipeline design, and TensorFlow's configuration options.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, the backend engine for Keras, employs a sophisticated system for resource allocation.  At the heart of this lies the concept of a computational graph, representing the operations involved in a neural network.  This graph is then optimized and executed across available devices—CPUs and GPUs—by TensorFlow's runtime.  The process involves several key steps:

* **Device Placement:**  TensorFlow determines which operations to execute on which devices.  This decision is influenced by several factors, including the operation's nature (e.g., matrix multiplications are highly parallelizable and benefit from GPUs), the availability of memory on each device, and user-specified constraints. By default, TensorFlow attempts to intelligently distribute computation across available resources, but manual device placement provides fine-grained control for optimal performance.

* **Data Transfer:** Moving data between the CPU and GPU is a significant performance bottleneck.  TensorFlow strives to minimize data transfers by placing operations strategically and leveraging techniques like asynchronous data prefetching.  However, inefficient data movement can drastically reduce the overall performance gain from using GPUs.

* **Kernel Launches:**  Once operations are assigned to specific devices, TensorFlow launches the corresponding kernels (low-level implementations of operations) on those devices.  GPUs excel at parallel execution, allowing them to handle multiple operations concurrently, unlike CPUs that typically operate sequentially.  The efficiency of this kernel execution depends on factors like GPU architecture and the optimization level of the TensorFlow build.

* **Memory Management:**  TensorFlow manages both CPU and GPU memory dynamically.  Efficient memory management is crucial to avoid out-of-memory errors and to ensure smooth execution.  TensorFlow's garbage collection mechanisms help reclaim memory when it's no longer needed.  Manual memory management through techniques like `tf.device` placement and explicit memory allocation can further improve performance in demanding scenarios.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic GPU Usage (If Available)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model (automatically uses GPU if available)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the simplest way to utilize a GPU.  TensorFlow automatically detects and utilizes available GPUs if the necessary drivers and CUDA toolkit are installed.  The `print` statement provides a straightforward check for GPU presence.  No explicit device placement is needed, enabling TensorFlow's default resource management.  If no GPU is detected, the code falls back to using the CPU.


**Example 2:  Manual Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Specify device for specific operations
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Assumes a GPU is available at index 0
  dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
  # ...rest of the model definition on the GPU

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):  # Explicitly place data preprocessing on the CPU
  processed_data = preprocess_data(x_train)

# ...model compilation and training as in Example 1
```

This illustrates manual device placement using `tf.device`.  This is particularly useful when dealing with specific operations that may benefit from being placed on particular devices due to memory constraints or performance considerations.  For instance, extensive preprocessing might be best performed on the CPU, while computationally intensive layers (like dense layers) should be on the GPU.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple GPUs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # Uses multiple GPUs if available

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...model training as in Example 1
```

This example showcases the use of `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` for efficient utilization of multiple GPUs.  The `strategy.scope()` context manager ensures that the model is replicated across all available GPUs, enabling data parallelism.  This approach significantly speeds up training by distributing the computational load.  This requires a setup with multiple GPUs and proper configuration.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's resource management, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, studying performance optimization techniques specific to TensorFlow and Keras, including profiling tools, can be invaluable.  Explore materials covering distributed training strategies, particularly focusing on data parallelism and model parallelism.  Finally, acquiring a solid grasp of linear algebra and parallel computing concepts is beneficial for effectively leveraging GPU resources.  Consider resources covering these topics to enhance your understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
