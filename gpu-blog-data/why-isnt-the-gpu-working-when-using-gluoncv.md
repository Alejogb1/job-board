The most common reason for a GPU not being utilized effectively with GluonCV and MXNet is an incorrect or missing CUDA configuration, specifically concerning the availability and visibility of the CUDA toolkit to the MXNet runtime. My experience in developing custom object detection models for embedded vision systems has made this a recurring, if nuanced, issue.

First, MXNet, and by extension GluonCV which relies on it, depends on specific NVIDIA libraries for GPU computation. Unlike some frameworks that can fall back to CPU gracefully, MXNet will often appear to run without error even when the GPU isn’t being used. This lack of explicit failure can be a major source of confusion. The core problem lies in MXNet’s inability to locate or correctly interface with the CUDA toolkit and its associated drivers. This can manifest in several ways, the most typical being: the wrong CUDA version is installed for the particular version of MXNet, the system environment variables required by MXNet to find the CUDA libraries are not set, or the CUDA drivers are not installed or are outdated. Even if `nvidia-smi` shows the GPU, the libraries required for MXNet to utilize it might still be missing or improperly configured.

A common mistake I’ve encountered is assuming that because the NVIDIA drivers are installed, the CUDA toolkit is also correctly configured. These are distinct components. The drivers enable the system to recognize and interface with the hardware. However, the CUDA toolkit provides the necessary libraries, compiler, and tools for running GPU-accelerated applications, and MXNet needs these libraries specifically. Without these correctly installed and made accessible to MXNet, all computations will default to the CPU, leading to significantly slower training times and unexpected performance. Moreover, even if both are present, a version mismatch between the installed CUDA toolkit, the driver version, and the version of MXNet built with specific CUDA support, can prevent GPU utilization. This is particularly problematic when dealing with multiple machine environments, as different installations may not have congruent configurations.

I often begin troubleshooting this issue by verifying the version of the NVIDIA driver using `nvidia-smi`. Next, I ascertain the exact version of the CUDA toolkit installed. Once both are known, I verify that they align with the requirements specified by the particular version of MXNet I am using. You can determine the CUDA version of your MXNet build using the following command within the python interpreter:

```python
import mxnet as mx
print(mx.context.current_context())
```
This will output `cpu(0)` if your GPU is not being used. If a GPU is in use this will display something similar to `gpu(0)` or `gpu(1)` depending on what is available. The '0' or '1' represents a specific GPU ID.

Next I’d check the environment variables used by MXNet. These are crucial for MXNet to dynamically locate the necessary libraries. Specifically, environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on Linux) and `PATH` (on Windows) need to include the directories where the CUDA libraries are installed. A mistake here can lead to MXNet failing to load the necessary CUDA kernels, resulting in the execution defaulting to the CPU. The following snippet demonstrates how to force GPU usage, and then verify that the GPU is in fact being used.

```python
import mxnet as mx
import numpy as np

# Attempt to force a GPU context, if available
try:
    ctx = mx.gpu()
    print(f"Using GPU: {ctx}")
except mx.base.MXNetError:
    ctx = mx.cpu()
    print("GPU not available, using CPU")

# Simple MXNet array operation on the specified context
a = mx.nd.array(np.random.rand(1000,1000), ctx=ctx)
b = mx.nd.array(np.random.rand(1000,1000), ctx=ctx)
c = mx.nd.dot(a,b)
c.wait_to_read()
print("Operation completed successfully.")

print(mx.context.current_context())
```
In this example, the code attempts to use a GPU using `mx.gpu()`. If the GPU isn't available (due to the CUDA problem discussed, or no GPU at all) a MXNetError is caught, and it falls back to the CPU using `mx.cpu()`. The code then performs a simple matrix multiplication using `mx.nd.dot`. The `c.wait_to_read()` function will block until the computation is done, and therefore confirms if the computation is being done by a GPU or the CPU. The final print verifies the current context used. This provides an example of how one would force a GPU context, and then verify that it is in fact being used, versus falling back to a CPU.

Finally, another common issue is data transfer. Even if MXNet can utilize the GPU for computations, the data needs to reside on the GPU's memory for optimal performance. Moving data between CPU RAM and GPU memory incurs significant overhead. I have found that pre-loading and ensuring that data reside in the GPU context from the start can mitigate this. Consider the following modified example which focuses on creating a model and putting it on the correct context:

```python
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet.gluon import nn

# Determine the context
try:
    ctx = mx.gpu()
    print(f"Using GPU: {ctx}")
except mx.base.MXNetError:
    ctx = mx.cpu()
    print("GPU not available, using CPU")

# Create a simple neural network
net = nn.Sequential()
net.add(nn.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
net.add(nn.Dense(10))

# Initialize parameters on the chosen context
net.initialize(init=mx.init.Xavier(), ctx=ctx)

# Simulate some data
data = mx.random.uniform(shape=(32, 100), ctx = ctx)
label = mx.random.randint(low=0, high=10, shape = (32,), ctx = ctx)

# Perform a single forward pass
output = net(data)

# Calculate a dummy loss and perform a backward pass
loss = mx.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss()
with mx.autograd.record():
    loss_val = loss(output, label)
loss_val.backward()

print("Model training operation completed successfully.")
print(mx.context.current_context())
```

This snippet shows how to define a simple neural network, initialize its parameters on the GPU (if available), and run a single forward and backward pass. It's critical that *both* the data and the model are on the correct context. Notice the context is also specified when creating the random data samples using `ctx = ctx`. This is key to avoiding unnecessary CPU-to-GPU transfers during training.

In summary, addressing the issue of a seemingly non-functional GPU with GluonCV and MXNet is primarily about meticulously confirming the CUDA toolkit version, ensuring the presence of correct NVIDIA drivers, setting the appropriate environment variables, and guaranteeing that both the data and the model are on the GPU for computations.  When beginning to debug this issue, I usually recommend checking the following references to assist with these troubleshooting steps. The NVIDIA CUDA toolkit documentation provides thorough installation guides and version compatibility matrix. The MXNet official documentation offers details on system requirements and installation specifics and finally the GluonCV documentation details it's requirements as well. Referencing all three sources can usually resolve the majority of GPU utilization issues.
