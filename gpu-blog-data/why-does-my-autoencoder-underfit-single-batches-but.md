The observed discrepancy between single-batch and multi-batch training performance in your autoencoder, specifically its propensity to underfit on single batches but not overfit on multi-sample batches of 1D data, strongly suggests a problem related to the interplay between your data's inherent structure, the autoencoder's architecture, and the optimization process.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across diverse time-series datasets (e.g., financial market data, sensor readings), this behavior often points towards insufficient representation capacity within a single batch, compounded by potential gradient instability.  Let's delve into this.


**1. Explanation:**

A single batch, particularly if it's small relative to the overall dataset size, might not adequately capture the underlying data distribution.  The autoencoder's latent space, during training on such a limited sample, may fail to learn meaningful features because it lacks sufficient statistical information. Consequently, the reconstruction error remains high, indicative of underfitting.  Think of it this way: attempting to fit a complex curve using only a few data points leads to poor generalization.

Conversely, using multiple batches effectively leverages the diversity present across different samples.  The aggregate information from various batches allows the autoencoder to construct a more robust and generalized representation in its latent space.  The averaging effect across batches helps stabilize the gradient descent process, mitigating the risk of getting trapped in suboptimal local minima that would plague single-batch training.  The increased data variability naturally improves the generalization ability, thus preventing overfitting, even with a relatively large model.  Crucially, the inherent regularity in your 1D data might only emerge when sufficient samples are considered together.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three different scenarios employing Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  In each case, we assume your 1D data is already preprocessed and normalized.


**Example 1:  A Simple Autoencoder with Underfitting on Single Batches:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple autoencoder
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)), # Assume 100 features
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(100) # Output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Training on single batches (demonstrates underfitting)
single_batch = data[0:batch_size]  #single batch from a preprocessed dataset called "data"
model.fit(single_batch, single_batch, epochs=100, batch_size=batch_size) #batch_size needs to be defined
```

This example demonstrates the core problem: training on a single batch, despite the `epochs` parameter,  doesn't allow the model to learn representative features. The low sample size leads to an extremely high chance of underfitting.  The model is too simple to capture the nuances in even a single batch, highlighting its reliance on multiple batches for a generalized understanding.


**Example 2:  Increasing Model Capacity to Mitigate Underfitting (Not Recommended without appropriate data):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# A more complex autoencoder
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(100)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training on single batches (attempts to address underfitting by increasing capacity)
single_batch = data[0:batch_size]
model.fit(single_batch, single_batch, epochs=100, batch_size=batch_size)
```

Increasing the model's capacity might seem like a solution, but it's generally not a recommended approach without carefully considering the data itself.  While it might improve the single-batch performance slightly, it can easily lead to overfitting when larger batches or the entire dataset is used. This approach only masks the core issue â€“ insufficient data within a single batch to learn a robust representation.


**Example 3:  Multi-Batch Training Demonstrating Improved Generalization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Using the simple autoencoder from Example 1
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(100)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training with multiple batches (shows better generalization)
model.fit(data, data, epochs=100, batch_size=32) #Batch size is optimized for the data
```

This example showcases the benefit of multi-batch training.  By using a suitable batch size (32 in this instance, but optimal batch size is dependent on your data), the model effectively learns from the combined information across different batches, leading to improved generalization and preventing overfitting.  The appropriate batch size is critical; too small, and you'll encounter similar problems as single-batch training; too large, and the optimization process may become inefficient.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I suggest consulting textbooks on deep learning, specifically those covering autoencoders and related architectures.  Reviewing articles on stochastic gradient descent and its variants would be highly beneficial. A thorough exploration of regularization techniques would prove valuable in fine-tuning your model's performance and preventing overfitting.  Finally, studying papers on time series analysis and feature extraction would offer further insight.
