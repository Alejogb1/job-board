Preserving the number of examples during layer concatenation in TensorFlow primarily necessitates aligning the batch dimension across all tensors involved. Batch dimension, representing the number of individual samples processed in parallel, must be identical for concatenation to proceed smoothly. Mismatches result in a broadcasting error, which occurs when TensorFlow attempts to automatically resize tensors for an incompatible operation. I've experienced such errors directly while developing image segmentation models where intermediate features of different encoding paths needed careful fusion before further decoding.

The concatenation itself is achieved using the `tf.concat` function, which requires the tensors to have identical dimensions along all axes except the axis along which concatenation is to occur. If we are concatenating along the channel dimension (axis=-1), then all tensors must have the same height, width, and batch size. The resulting tensor will have a channel dimension equal to the sum of the channel dimensions of the input tensors. The critical part of preserving the example count rests on ensuring that the batch dimension (usually axis=0) remains invariant throughout all prior operations and when feeding tensors into `tf.concat`. Any alteration to the batch size, such as those induced by improperly applied pooling or reshapes, can lead to the aforementioned concatenation errors.

Below are three illustrative code examples detailing different scenarios, including how to handle situations where layers have different output feature dimensions yet maintain the same number of examples.

**Example 1: Simple Concatenation of Two Layers with Matching Batch Size**

This first scenario demonstrates the straightforward concatenation of two layers, assuming both have the same batch size and spatial dimensions and feature dimensions. This situation is typical when combining feature maps within a given processing stage of a model. We are concatenating along the channel axis.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input with batch size 32 and an image shape of 64x64x3
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 64, 64, 3))

# Define a simple convolutional layer with 16 output channels
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Define another convolutional layer, also with batch size 32 and the same spatial dimensions, but with 32 output channels
conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Concatenate the two feature maps along the channel axis (axis=-1)
concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([conv1, conv2], axis=-1)

# Print the shape of the concatenated tensor
print(concatenated_tensor.shape) # Output: (32, 64, 64, 48)
```

The code above first creates an input tensor with a batch size of 32. Then, it applies two convolutional layers to this input. Crucially, both `conv1` and `conv2` maintain the same batch size and spatial dimensions (64x64) as the input. Because the convolutions use "same" padding, the output dimensions are identical to the input dimensions. Finally, `tf.concat` concatenates these two tensors along the channel axis. The resulting tensor has 32 examples (batch size) and 48 channels (16 + 32), while the height and width remain unchanged at 64. This exemplifies a standard use case where we want to fuse feature maps while maintaining the number of examples.

**Example 2: Handling Different Feature Dimensions before Concatenation**

This example demonstrates a slightly more complex scenario. Suppose two branches of a network produce feature maps with different numbers of output channels, but still maintain the same batch size and spatial dimensions. To enable meaningful concatenation, this requires both branches to have identical dimensions. This often necessitates a 1x1 convolution before concatenation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input with batch size 32 and an image shape of 64x64x3
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 64, 64, 3))

# First convolutional branch (16 output channels)
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Second convolutional branch (32 output channels)
conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# A 1x1 convolution to match the number of channels of the conv1 output
conv2_reduced = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (1, 1), padding='same', activation='relu')(conv2)


# Concatenate the two feature maps, making sure the number of channels matches (after the 1x1 reduction of conv2)
concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([conv1, conv2_reduced], axis=-1)


# Print the shape of the concatenated tensor
print(concatenated_tensor.shape) # Output: (32, 64, 64, 32)
```

Here, `conv1` and `conv2` output feature maps with different channel dimensions (16 and 32 respectively). To prepare for concatenation, a 1x1 convolution is applied to the output of `conv2`. This `conv2_reduced` layer reduces the channel count of conv2â€™s output from 32 to 16 while preserving the batch size and spatial dimensions. With the channel dimensions matching, the `tf.concat` operation is performed. The resulting tensor maintains the original batch size and spatial dimensions while having a channel dimension equal to the sum of the reduced channel dimensions (16 + 16 = 32). This exemplifies the necessity of dimension alignment via operations like 1x1 convolutions for successful concatenations of tensors with different channel depths.

**Example 3: Correctly concatenating after pooling or similar operations.**

When layers undergo operations like pooling which may alter the spatial dimensions, care must be taken to rescale these before concatenation if our intention is to keep the spatial dimensions aligned after concatenation. This is a common practice in model building.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define Input with batch size of 32
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 128, 128, 3))

# First Convolutional Layer
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Max Pooling Layer downsampling spatial dimensions
pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(conv1)

# Second Convolutional Layer, applied to initial input (not pooled)
conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Resizing pool1 back to original dimensions by upsampling
upsample_pool1 = tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D((2,2))(pool1)


# Concatenate the reshaped feature maps.
concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([upsample_pool1, conv2], axis=-1)

# Print the shape of the concatenated tensor
print(concatenated_tensor.shape) # Output: (32, 128, 128, 48)
```

Here, `conv1` is followed by a max-pooling layer, reducing the spatial dimensions by half. `conv2`, however, operates on the initial input, which preserves its dimensions.  To concatenate `pool1` and `conv2`, the pooled layer must be upsampled back to the original dimensions of the input using UpSampling2D. By upsampling `pool1`, its spatial dimensions align with `conv2`, thereby allowing a successful concatenation. Notice the batch size has remained constant throughout and thus we avoid any related errors. The final result produces a tensor with a batch size of 32 and height and width of 128 and a channel depth of 48 as expected. The spatial alignment prior to concatenation is crucial.

In each of these examples, preserving the number of examples involved maintaining a consistent batch size, which in all cases was equal to 32. Any deviations to the batch size will cause an error upon concatenation. While the examples use convolutional layers, the principle of maintaining consistent batch size dimensions applies across all layer types.

For further exploration, the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.concat` and the Keras Layers API (especially convolutional, pooling, and upsampling layers) provides exhaustive details on the parameters and behavior of these operations. I also recommend studying established architectures like U-Net or ResNet, which frequently use concatenation as an integral part of their designs, and therefore offer good real-world examples. The TensorFlow tutorials on image processing or natural language processing also offer valuable case studies. Finally, understanding the concepts of tensor broadcasting, shapes, and dimensions will be instrumental in avoiding similar errors in future applications.
