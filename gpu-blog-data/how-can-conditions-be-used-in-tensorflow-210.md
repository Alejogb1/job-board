TensorFlow 2.1.0 Keras, while offering a high-level API for building neural networks, lacks direct support for conditional logic within the computational graph in the same way that one might employ `if` statements in a standard Python script.  This limitation stems from the inherent nature of TensorFlow's reliance on static computation graphs â€“ operations need to be defined before execution, making runtime branching challenging. However, several techniques circumvent this limitation, effectively enabling conditional behavior.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects using this specific TensorFlow version solidified my understanding of these methods.

**1.  The tf.cond() Function:**

The most straightforward approach involves leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.cond()` function.  This function executes one of two provided branches based on a boolean condition.  Crucially, both branches must be defined as TensorFlow operations, ensuring compatibility with the graph execution model.  The condition itself must also be a TensorFlow tensor evaluating to a boolean value.

This method is best suited for relatively simple conditional logic where the branching operations are not overly complex.  For intricate conditional flows, the overhead of defining separate TensorFlow subgraphs within `tf.cond()` might become significant.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_operation(x):
  """Applies a different operation based on the value of x."""
  result = tf.cond(
      tf.greater(x, 5),  # Condition: Is x greater than 5?
      lambda: tf.add(x, 10),  # True branch: Add 10 to x
      lambda: tf.multiply(x, 2)  # False branch: Multiply x by 2
  )
  return result

# Example usage:
x = tf.constant(3)
y = conditional_operation(x)  # y will be 6 (3 * 2)
print(y)

x = tf.constant(7)
y = conditional_operation(x)  # y will be 17 (7 + 10)
print(y)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic conditional operation.  The `tf.greater()` function creates the boolean tensor for the condition.  The `lambda` functions define the operations for the true and false branches respectively. The outputs show the correct conditional application.  Note the explicit use of TensorFlow operations (`tf.add`, `tf.multiply`) within the lambda functions; using standard Python operators would result in an error.


**2.  Utilizing tf.where():**

For element-wise conditional operations on tensors, `tf.where()` presents a more efficient alternative.  This function selects elements from one of two input tensors based on a boolean mask. This approach is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets where applying `tf.cond()` for every element would be computationally expensive.  I frequently employed this method during data preprocessing stages, especially when handling missing values or outliers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def element_wise_condition(x):
  """Applies a different operation element-wise based on a condition."""
  condition = tf.greater(x, 0)  # Element-wise comparison: Is each element > 0?
  positive_values = tf.add(x, 1) # Operation for positive elements
  negative_values = tf.multiply(x, -1) # Operation for negative or zero elements
  result = tf.where(condition, positive_values, negative_values)
  return result

# Example usage:
x = tf.constant([-1, 2, -3, 4, 0])
y = element_wise_condition(x) # y will be [1, 3, 3, 5, 0]
print(y)
```

This example showcases the element-wise application.  The `condition` tensor determines which elements from `positive_values` or `negative_values` are selected for the final result. This is considerably more efficient than applying a `tf.cond()` for each element.


**3.  Custom Layers with Conditional Logic:**

For more complex scenarios where conditional logic needs to be integrated within a custom Keras layer, the creation of a custom layer is the most suitable approach.  In my work, I built custom layers for handling variable-length sequences and attention mechanisms, both requiring sophisticated conditional behavior within the layer's computation. This approach offers greater flexibility and encapsulation but requires a deeper understanding of Keras layer development.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ConditionalLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units):
    super(ConditionalLayer, self).__init__()
    self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(units)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x, condition = inputs # inputs is a tuple (tensor, boolean tensor)
    return tf.cond(
        condition,
        lambda: self.dense(x),
        lambda: x  # No operation if condition is false
    )

# Example usage
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    ConditionalLayer(5),  # Custom layer
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
condition = tf.constant([True])
output = model([x, condition])
print(output)

x = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
condition = tf.constant([False])
output = model([x, condition])
print(output)

```

This example defines a custom layer `ConditionalLayer` that applies a dense layer only if the provided `condition` tensor is true. The `call` method utilizes `tf.cond` to control the application of the dense layer.  This demonstrates how to embed conditional logic directly into the computational flow of a neural network.  The example shows the effect of the conditional application of the dense layer.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow 2.x and Keras, I recommend the official TensorFlow documentation, the Keras documentation, and several high-quality online courses dedicated to deep learning frameworks.  A strong understanding of linear algebra and calculus is highly beneficial.  Focus on sections covering custom layers, graph execution, and tensor manipulations.  Explore advanced topics such as custom training loops for maximum control over conditional logic within the training process. These resources will provide a solid foundation to tackle more complex conditional problems within TensorFlow 2.1.0 Keras.
