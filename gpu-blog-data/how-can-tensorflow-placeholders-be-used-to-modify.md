TensorFlow placeholders, while deprecated in recent versions in favor of `tf.Variable` and eager execution, served a crucial role in defining computation graphs before execution.  Their primary function wasn't direct tensor modification *during* execution, but rather providing input points for data to be fed into the graph at runtime. This distinction is key to understanding their limitations and appropriate usage.  My experience building large-scale recommendation systems heavily involved this aspect of TensorFlow 1.x, and I encountered several misconceptions regarding placeholder manipulation.  Therefore, clarifying this point is paramount.

**1. Clarification: Placeholders and In-place Modification**

It's fundamentally incorrect to view TensorFlow placeholders as variables whose values can be directly altered within the computational graph.  Placeholders are symbolic representations of tensors; they hold no inherent value until data is explicitly fed during a session's execution. Attempts to modify a placeholder's value within the graph itself will fail. The graph defines the computation, not the values themselves.  The values are supplied as inputs, and the graph operates on those inputs to produce outputs.  To achieve the effect of 'modifying' tensor values, one must re-feed modified data into the placeholder during subsequent executions of the graph.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating Placeholder Usage and Data Manipulation**

The following examples showcase how to correctly utilize placeholders and externally modify the data fed into them, simulating a 'modification' of tensor values within the context of the overall TensorFlow workflow.

**Example 1: Simple Addition with Placeholder Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define placeholder for input tensor
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])

# Define a simple addition operation
y = x + 5

# Create a TensorFlow session
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # First execution: feed initial data
    initial_data = [[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]
    result1 = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: initial_data})
    print("Result 1:", result1)

    # Second execution: feed modified data, simulating 'modification'
    modified_data = [[10.0], [20.0], [30.0]]
    result2 = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: modified_data})
    print("Result 2:", result2)

```

This example demonstrates the core principle: we don't change the placeholder itself. Instead, we provide different input data – `initial_data` and `modified_data` – to achieve the effect of altering the values processed by the graph. The addition operation `y = x + 5` remains unchanged; only the input `x` differs between executions.


**Example 2: Placeholder with Variable and Update Operation (Illustrative, Not Recommended)**

While not recommended for efficient computation, one can simulate in-place updates using TensorFlow variables and a `tf.assign` operation. This approach involves updating a variable based on the placeholder's input value.  It's important to note this is generally less efficient and less readable than the approach in Example 1.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define placeholder for input
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[1])

# Define a variable to hold the accumulated value
accumulated_value = tf.Variable(0.0, name="accumulated_value")

# Define an operation to update the variable based on the placeholder
update_op = tf.compat.v1.assign_add(accumulated_value, x)

# Initialize the variable
init_op = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()

# Create a TensorFlow session
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)

    # First execution
    sess.run(update_op, feed_dict={x: [10.0]})
    print("Accumulated Value after first update:", sess.run(accumulated_value))

    # Second execution
    sess.run(update_op, feed_dict={x: [20.0]})
    print("Accumulated Value after second update:", sess.run(accumulated_value))
```

Here, `accumulated_value` simulates a modified state, but it's crucial to remember this update happens through a separate operation and not directly within the placeholder itself. The placeholder still only provides the input value.


**Example 3:  Conditional Logic and Placeholder Input**

Placeholders can also be used in conjunction with conditional logic to modify the flow of the computation based on the input data.  This doesn't directly modify the placeholder, but it provides a more sophisticated way to handle different data scenarios.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)

# Conditional logic based on placeholder values
z = tf.cond(tf.greater(x, y), lambda: x + y, lambda: x - y)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result1 = sess.run(z, feed_dict={x: 10.0, y: 5.0})
    print("Result 1:", result1)  # Output: 15.0

    result2 = sess.run(z, feed_dict={x: 5.0, y: 10.0})
    print("Result 2:", result2)  # Output: -5.0
```


This illustrates how the computation changes dynamically based on the values fed into the placeholders, thus influencing the final output without modifying the placeholders themselves.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and data flow, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation (specifically the sections on graphs and sessions in older versions, for context on placeholders), and exploring resources on computational graphs and symbolic computation.  Books on deep learning fundamentals will also provide crucial background.  Practice working through diverse examples, especially those involving complex graph structures and data input mechanisms.  Understanding these concepts forms the foundation for tackling more advanced TensorFlow applications.  Pay close attention to the distinction between eager and graph execution to avoid confusion arising from the deprecation of placeholders in the newer versions of TensorFlow.
