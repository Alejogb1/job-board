Porting C++ code to CUDA requires a fundamental shift in thinking from a sequential, single-threaded execution model to a parallel, massively threaded execution model.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for financial modeling has shown that a naive approach, directly translating C++ code line-by-line, often leads to suboptimal or even incorrect results.  Effective CUDA code leverages the GPU's architecture, exploiting its parallel processing capabilities to achieve significant speedups. This is not simply a compiler flag; it demands a restructuring of algorithms and data structures.

**1. Understanding the CUDA Execution Model**

The core concept is the kernel. A CUDA kernel is a function executed concurrently by many threads. These threads are organized into blocks, and blocks are further grouped into a grid.  The execution configuration – the number of threads per block and the number of blocks in the grid – significantly impacts performance.  Choosing the optimal configuration requires understanding the problem size, the GPU's capabilities, and the memory bandwidth limitations.  Over-subscription of threads can lead to context switching overhead, negating the performance benefits of parallelism. Conversely, under-utilization leaves processing power idle.

Effective memory management is crucial.  CUDA provides different memory spaces with varying access speeds and lifetimes.  Global memory, accessible by all threads, is slower but has a large capacity. Shared memory, accessible only within a block, is faster but has limited size.  Register memory, the fastest, is private to each thread but has the smallest capacity.  Optimizing memory access patterns, minimizing global memory accesses, and effectively using shared memory for data reuse are key performance optimization techniques. I've observed performance improvements exceeding 10x by simply refactoring memory access patterns in large-scale matrix operations.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate the conversion process with three examples, progressing in complexity.

**Example 1: Vector Addition**

This simple example demonstrates the fundamental structure of a CUDA kernel.

```cpp
// C++ sequential code
void addVectors(const float* a, const float* b, float* c, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

// CUDA kernel
__global__ void addVectorsKernel(const float* a, const float* b, float* c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

// CUDA host code
int main() {
  // ... allocate memory on host and device ...
  int n = 1024 * 1024;
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  addVectorsKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);
  // ... copy data back to host ...
  return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates the basic structure. The `__global__` keyword designates the kernel function.  `blockIdx.x`, `blockDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x` provide the thread's index within the grid and block. The calculation of `blocksPerGrid` ensures that all elements of the vectors are processed.  Crucially, note the separate host code (in `main`) that handles memory allocation on the GPU (`d_a`, `d_b`, `d_c`), kernel launch, and data transfer.


**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication**

This example highlights the importance of data organization and shared memory.

```cpp
// CUDA kernel for matrix multiplication using shared memory
__global__ void matMulKernel(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int width) {
  __shared__ float sharedA[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];
  __shared__ float sharedB[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];

  int bx = blockIdx.x;
  int by = blockIdx.y;
  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = threadIdx.y;

  int row = by * TILE_WIDTH + ty;
  int col = bx * TILE_WIDTH + tx;

  float sum = 0.0f;
  for (int k = 0; k < width; k += TILE_WIDTH) {
    sharedA[ty][tx] = A[row * width + k + tx];
    sharedB[ty][tx] = B[(k + ty) * width + col];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block

    for (int i = 0; i < TILE_WIDTH; ++i) {
      sum += sharedA[ty][i] * sharedB[i][tx];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }
  C[row * width + col] = sum;
}
```

Here, `TILE_WIDTH` is a constant defining the size of the tile processed by each thread block in shared memory.  The use of shared memory significantly reduces global memory accesses, resulting in substantial performance gains. The `__syncthreads()` function ensures that all threads in a block have completed their shared memory access before proceeding. This example demonstrates a common optimization technique for matrix operations.


**Example 3:  Complex Algorithm with Dependencies**

Consider a more complex algorithm with inherent data dependencies, such as a recursive calculation or a graph traversal.  Direct translation is often impossible. One must redesign the algorithm to exploit parallelism.  For instance, a recursive algorithm might be restructured into an iterative form suitable for parallel processing.  A graph traversal might employ parallel breadth-first search or other parallel graph algorithms.

I encountered this in a project involving option pricing using a binomial tree.  The sequential recursive approach was impractical for large trees.  The solution involved transforming the algorithm into an iterative form using dynamic programming, enabling parallel processing of independent subtrees.  This required careful management of dependencies to ensure correct results.  This usually involved custom data structures and kernels designed to handle specific data dependencies efficiently.  Detailed explanation for this example would require more space than is appropriate here, but the central principle remains:  algorithm restructuring is vital for effective CUDA porting of complex algorithms.

In summary, converting C++ code to CUDA is not a trivial task. It necessitates a thorough understanding of the CUDA execution model, careful management of memory, and often, a significant restructuring of the algorithm to achieve optimal performance.  By paying close attention to these aspects, and by utilizing the resources mentioned above, developers can effectively harness the power of GPUs for significantly improved performance in their applications.
