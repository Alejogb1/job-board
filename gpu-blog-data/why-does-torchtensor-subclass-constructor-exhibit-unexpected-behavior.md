The observed unusual behavior in the `torch.Tensor` subclass constructor stems directly from the way PyTorch manages memory and tensor creation, particularly in combination with Python’s object initialization process. Unlike standard Python classes, `torch.Tensor` subclasses require careful attention to how their internal data is instantiated and connected to the underlying PyTorch storage. The core issue revolves around the fact that a new `torch.Tensor` instance doesn't always fully initialize by simply calling its `__init__` method during subclass instantiation. Often, a low-level constructor is invoked first, which allocates the storage, followed by the subclass’s `__init__`, which might then be operating on an already-existing, albeit potentially uninitialized, tensor. This two-stage process can lead to surprising results if not explicitly managed.

When a PyTorch `torch.Tensor` subclass is created, two initialization paths can be followed. If the class constructor is invoked with tensor data (for example, a Python list or NumPy array) or a shape specification, PyTorch initially allocates the storage and creates a base `torch.Tensor` object. This object is then, in effect, re-cast as an instance of the subclass. Critically, the subclass’s `__init__` method is called *after* this base tensor is created, with the `self` object already being partially instantiated. This differs from standard Python objects where `__init__` dictates the object's initial state. When no data is passed initially, the subclass `__init__` is generally the location where tensor storage must be created. If the `__init__` does not properly initialize underlying tensor properties or if it creates a brand new tensor assigned to `self`, then issues, particularly regarding copy versus reference semantics can arise.

This divergence from standard Python object construction becomes significant when you start performing operations that depend on particular tensor properties during the `__init__` of a subclass. The problem manifests more starkly when a `torch.Tensor` subclass does not manage its internal tensor appropriately, either by re-assigning the tensor, making copies, or failing to link its internal data with the already allocated base tensor.

**Code Example 1: Improper Tensor Initialization**

The first example shows how easily one can inadvertently create unintended tensor copies during initialization. In this case the intention is for a subclass to have its tensor data initialized to a specific value, however by using the `=` assignment, we create a new tensor rather than modify the existing base tensor.

```python
import torch

class MyBadTensor(torch.Tensor):
    def __init__(self, value):
        # PROBLEM: creates a new tensor and reassigns
        self = torch.full((1,), float(value)) 

        # This will always return 0 as the original, uninitialized tensor.
    def get_first_element(self):
         return super().__getitem__(0)


a = MyBadTensor(4)

print(a.get_first_element()) # Output will show 0 instead of 4

```

In the `MyBadTensor` class, the `__init__` method attempts to initialize a tensor with a specific value using `self = torch.full(...)`. The problem here is that it *re-assigns* the `self` variable to a newly created tensor, losing any connection with the original `torch.Tensor` object which PyTorch had already begun setting up. The `super().__getitem__(0)` now refers to the base `torch.Tensor` which was allocated first and then 're-casted' to a `MyBadTensor`, that was never modified because of the reassignment.  The subclass method accesses the data from that original object rather than the intended tensor with value 4. This is due to how Python handles variable assignment. A new object was created and re-assigned to `self`, leaving the original uninitialized.

**Code Example 2: Proper Tensor Initialization using `__torch_function__`**

The most effective way to create `torch.Tensor` subclasses is to modify the already existing tensor storage in the init via use of the `__torch_function__` mechanism. By overwriting this magic method we are given access to the already created base tensor object, we can modify the `__init__` method so it is able to modify the tensor's values.

```python
import torch

class MyGoodTensor(torch.Tensor):

    def __torch_function__(cls, func, types, args=(), kwargs=None):
        if kwargs is None:
            kwargs = {}
        if func is torch.Tensor.__new__:
            obj = super().__torch_function__(func, types, args, kwargs)
            if hasattr(obj, "_post_init"):
                obj._post_init(*args,**kwargs)
            return obj
        return super().__torch_function__(func, types, args, kwargs)


    def _post_init(self, value):
        self.fill_(float(value))  # Directly modify underlying tensor
        
    def get_first_element(self):
         return super().__getitem__(0)

b = MyGoodTensor(5)

print(b.get_first_element()) # Output 5
```
In this revised example, `MyGoodTensor` utilizes the `__torch_function__` which gives access to the `self` object after PyTorch has created the base tensor, we then call a `_post_init` method on `self` which utilizes inplace modifications to modify the underlying tensor data by using `self.fill_`. The values can now be initialized as expected because this method allows us to modify the already existing base tensor.

**Code Example 3: Subclass Initialization With Constructor Arguments**

When a subclass needs to handle initialization arguments, the `__torch_function__` method needs to handle both the case of passing and not passing arguments on instantiation, while also checking to see if the base tensor is created.

```python
import torch

class MyFancyTensor(torch.Tensor):
     def __torch_function__(cls, func, types, args=(), kwargs=None):
        if kwargs is None:
            kwargs = {}
        if func is torch.Tensor.__new__:
            obj = super().__torch_function__(func, types, args, kwargs)
            if hasattr(obj, "_post_init"):
                obj._post_init(*args,**kwargs)
            return obj
        return super().__torch_function__(func, types, args, kwargs)
    
     def _post_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
         if "data" in kwargs:
            self.copy_(torch.tensor(kwargs["data"]))
         elif len(args)>0 and isinstance(args[0], int):
             self.fill_(float(args[0]))
     def get_first_element(self):
         return super().__getitem__(0)

c = MyFancyTensor(data = [1,2,3])
d = MyFancyTensor(7)


print(c.get_first_element()) # Output 1
print(d.get_first_element()) # Output 7
```
The `MyFancyTensor` class is now capable of handling `data` keyword arguments, or an initial value being passed as a positional argument. The `_post_init` now contains the logic to either copy in new data from a passed argument, or initialize with a provided value.

**Recommended Resources**

To gain a deeper understanding of this behavior, the PyTorch documentation is the first resource to consult, particularly the sections detailing tensor creation and custom extension with `__torch_function__`. Furthermore, examining the implementation of existing PyTorch operations through the source code on GitHub will provide valuable insights into best practices. Finally, discussions and tutorials within the PyTorch community, often available on forums or blog posts, provide practical examples and perspectives on managing tensor subclasses. Understanding the mechanisms behind how `__torch_function__` works is absolutely essential for creating more advanced tensor subclasses.
