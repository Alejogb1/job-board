The core challenge in obtaining a processed dataset without tensor operations lies in managing the data transformations efficiently outside the typical deep learning framework.  My experience building large-scale data pipelines for genomics research highlighted this precisely.  While many transformations leverage the parallelism inherent in tensor libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, a significant portion of preprocessing often involves operations better handled by specialized libraries or custom logic.  The key is to recognize that a processed dataset is simply the result of applying a sequence of operations to the raw data, irrespective of whether tensors are involved.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The absence of tensor operations doesn't necessitate a departure from structured, efficient data processing. The choice of the appropriate tools depends entirely on the nature of the transformations.  If the transformations are primarily numerical or statistical (e.g., normalization, imputation, feature engineering using non-linear functions), libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas provide a highly efficient and well-established infrastructure. For more complex transformations involving string manipulation, data cleaning, or specific domain-specific logic, a combination of these libraries with potentially custom Python functions becomes necessary.  The workflow fundamentally remains the same:  load raw data, apply a sequence of transformations, and save the processed data.  The difference is in the specific tools and techniques employed during the transformation phase.  Consider scalability from the outset; if the dataset is exceptionally large, techniques like data chunking and parallel processing become essential to manage memory and processing time effectively.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Numerical Feature Scaling using NumPy and SciPy**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import zscore

# Load data (assuming data is in a NumPy array called 'raw_data')
raw_data = np.load('raw_data.npy')

# Standardize features using z-score normalization
processed_data = zscore(raw_data, axis=0) # axis=0 normalizes across columns

# Save processed data
np.save('processed_data.npy', processed_data)
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a common preprocessing step: feature scaling. NumPy's efficiency in handling numerical arrays makes it ideal for this task. SciPy provides additional statistical functions, such as `zscore`, streamlining the normalization process. The data is assumed to be loaded from a `.npy` file for efficiency; similar approaches can be used with other file formats.  Note the explicit handling of the axis parameter to ensure correct normalization.

**Example 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation with Pandas**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data (assuming data is in a CSV file)
raw_data = pd.read_csv('raw_data.csv')

# Handle missing values (imputation)
raw_data['feature_A'].fillna(raw_data['feature_A'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Apply a custom transformation
def transform_feature_B(x):
    if x > 10:
        return x * 2
    else:
        return x / 2

raw_data['feature_B'] = raw_data['feature_B'].apply(transform_feature_B)

# Save processed data
raw_data.to_csv('processed_data.csv', index=False)
```

*Commentary:*  Pandas excels in handling tabular data and provides convenient methods for data cleaning and transformation. This example showcases handling missing values through imputation and applying a custom function to transform a specific feature.  The use of `apply` allows for efficient vectorized operations even when dealing with custom logic.  The `inplace=True` argument is crucial for memory management in larger datasets, preventing unnecessary copying.

**Example 3:  Custom Transformation and Chunking for Large Datasets**

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

chunksize = 10000  # Adjust based on available memory

def process_chunk(chunk):
    # Apply a series of custom transformations to the chunk
    chunk['new_feature'] = chunk['feature_A'] + chunk['feature_B']
    # ... more transformations ...
    return chunk

output_filename = 'processed_data.csv'
if os.path.exists(output_filename):
    os.remove(output_filename)

for chunk in pd.read_csv('raw_data.csv', chunksize=chunksize):
    processed_chunk = process_chunk(chunk)
    processed_chunk.to_csv(output_filename, mode='a', header=not os.path.exists(output_filename), index=False)
```

*Commentary:*  This example explicitly addresses the challenge of processing extremely large datasets.  By reading and processing the data in chunks, memory usage is controlled.  The `os.path.exists` and `mode='a'` ensure that chunks are appended to the output file efficiently, avoiding the memory overhead of storing the entire dataset in memory at once.  The custom `process_chunk` function encapsulates all the transformations to be applied to each chunk.  Adjusting `chunksize` is critical; larger values increase processing speed but require more memory.  Smaller values increase the overhead of writing to disk but reduce memory usage.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deep understanding of data manipulation in Python, I highly recommend mastering the documentation for NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.  Familiarity with the Python standard library, particularly the `os` and `shutil` modules, is essential for file handling and management within a data pipeline.  Finally, investing time in learning about parallel processing techniques using libraries such as multiprocessing or Dask is crucial for scaling data processing to handle very large datasets efficiently.  These libraries are fundamental for building robust and efficient data pipelines, even when tensor operations are not involved.
