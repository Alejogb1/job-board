In TensorFlow 1.x, controlling the sequential execution of operations within a single `Session.run()` call requires an understanding of dependency management through the graph. Unlike imperative programming where lines execute sequentially by default, TensorFlow builds a computation graph first, and `Session.run()` evaluates the relevant parts. Operations are only executed if their outputs are needed by other operations requested in the run call, or if they are explicitly included as targets. Therefore, simply placing operations in a specific order in Python code does *not* guarantee their sequential execution in the graph. To force sequentiality, we must establish explicit dependencies between operations.

The core mechanism involves the concept of control dependencies. A control dependency asserts that one operation must complete before another one begins, regardless of whether the output of the former is required by the latter. We can add these dependencies through `tf.control_dependencies` context. Within this context, operations will only execute once the operations they depend upon have finished. However, the context itself does *not* force any operation to be executed. If, after adding control dependencies, the dependent operation is *not* requested in `Session.run()`, the dependency, and hence all precedent operations within the chain, will not be evaluated.

Consider a scenario I faced while developing a custom training loop for a generative adversarial network. I needed to update the discriminator *before* the generator, to prevent the generator from exploiting the old weights of the discriminator. These updates are separate operations in the TensorFlow graph. My initial approach without dependency control led to unexpected results, as the optimizer updates for both could execute in any order or even concurrently when possible, which is not suitable for this type of training strategy.

Let's illustrate this with a few code examples. First, we'll demonstrate a basic scenario with two operations without explicit dependency. I will assume that `x`, `y`, and `z` are already defined TensorFlow variables and that `op_a` and `op_b` are, for example, increment operations associated with those variables.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming x, y, and z are already defined tf.Variables
x = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
z = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)

op_a = x.assign_add(1)
op_b = y.assign_add(1)
op_c = z.assign_add(1) # Added for later example

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print("Initial x, y, z:",sess.run([x,y,z]))
    result = sess.run([op_b, op_a]) # Intentionally reversed for demo purposes
    print("After op_b and op_a:",sess.run([x,y,z]))

```

In this initial case, although `op_b` is placed before `op_a` in the `sess.run` call, there is no guaranteed order of execution. TensorFlow will try to evaluate them in the order that minimizes execution time or in any manner that satisfies the graph dependencies. Because `op_a` and `op_b` are independent operations, TensorFlow might schedule `op_a` before `op_b` if this is more efficient, or concurrently when devices allow. The order they appear in the `sess.run` list *does not* determine the execution order.  The `print` statement will demonstrate that both have indeed been executed.

Now, let's enforce sequentiality using `tf.control_dependencies`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
z = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
op_a = x.assign_add(1)
op_b = y.assign_add(1)
op_c = z.assign_add(1)


with tf.control_dependencies([op_a]):
    op_b_dependent = tf.identity(op_b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  print("Initial x, y, z:",sess.run([x,y,z]))
  result = sess.run([op_b_dependent])
  print("After op_b with dependency:",sess.run([x,y,z]))
```

In this example, `tf.control_dependencies([op_a])` ensures that `op_a` will be executed *before* the `op_b_dependent` operation. Since `op_b_dependent` is effectively just `op_b` but with the control dependency, the effect is that `op_a` will execute first. Crucially, this is *still* reliant on including `op_b_dependent` in the `sess.run` call, otherwise the dependency would not be evaluated, and neither would `op_a`.  Note that wrapping a dependent operation using `tf.identity` is an common practice when the dependent operation isn't a tensor output, since control dependencies only operate on tensors.

Let's consider another scenario, chaining multiple operations. We'll extend from the previous example. This demonstrates the cascade effect of control dependencies:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
z = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)
op_a = x.assign_add(1)
op_b = y.assign_add(1)
op_c = z.assign_add(1)


with tf.control_dependencies([op_a]):
  op_b_dependent = tf.identity(op_b)
with tf.control_dependencies([op_b_dependent]):
  op_c_dependent = tf.identity(op_c)


with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  print("Initial x, y, z:",sess.run([x,y,z]))
  result = sess.run([op_c_dependent])
  print("After ops with chained dependencies:",sess.run([x,y,z]))
```

Here, `op_c` is dependent on `op_b`, which is itself dependent on `op_a`. Consequently, in the `Session.run()` call, `op_a` will always execute first, followed by `op_b`, and then finally `op_c`, even if we only request `op_c_dependent`. This ensures a strict sequential flow.  The output from this segment will demonstrate the sequential execution as `x`, `y`, and `z` will each have been incremented once, and that the incrementing occurred in the required order.

It's worth noting that excessive use of control dependencies can potentially impede performance by restricting TensorFlow's ability to parallelize operations or use device-specific optimisations. It's important to only introduce control dependencies where sequentiality is explicitly required by the algorithm, as it forces operations to run on a single thread and on a specific device. For the generator/discriminator update scenario mentioned earlier, I was able to improve performance by carefully structuring the graph so that only the necessary dependency between discriminator and generator was present.

When you need to force a sequence of operations in TensorFlow within a single `Session.run()` call, understand that operations in the run list execute, along with any operations required for their output, or any operations specifically placed within the `tf.control_dependencies` context. These mechanisms permit control over the execution flow, and allow for sequential operation when this is critical.

For further learning I'd suggest exploring TensorFlow's official documentation, particularly the sections on graph building and control flow. Also, the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" (second edition) offers practical examples and insights on how to apply these concepts. Additionally, the TensorFlow GitHub repository contains many examples and tests that can provide practical ideas and solutions. Examining open source projects on GitHub that make extensive use of tensorflow can also be an invaluable learning opportunity.
