The choice of activation function for the final layer of a Keras transfer learning model is fundamentally determined by the nature of the task you’re addressing, specifically the desired output format. Having spent considerable time optimizing pre-trained models across varied projects, I’ve observed how a mismatch here dramatically impacts performance, often more so than minor architecture tweaks elsewhere. Ignoring the inherent properties of different activations often leads to unpredictable or even meaningless results.

The final layer activation’s role is to transform the model's output from a linear combination of the preceding layers into a format that directly corresponds to your target variable. For example, a raw output vector from a dense layer might have unbounded values, which is unsuitable for a probability distribution or a binary classification label. Consequently, picking the right activation is not merely an implementation detail, but a crucial step in translating the learned representations into practical predictions.

For classification tasks, where the goal is to assign an input to one or more discrete categories, the *softmax* and *sigmoid* activation functions are the primary contenders. The *softmax* function is best applied to multi-class classification problems where each input belongs to exactly one class (e.g., categorizing different types of animals). It takes a vector of real numbers as input and outputs a probability distribution, where each element in the output vector represents the probability of the input belonging to a specific class. The elements sum to 1. Computationally, *softmax* exponentiates each input value and then normalizes by dividing by the sum of the exponentiated values, ensuring probabilistic outputs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Example using softmax for multi-class classification (e.g., 10 classes)

base_model = keras.applications.VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

x = keras.layers.Flatten()(base_model.output)
x = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # 10 classes

model = keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In the provided code, `keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')` is the final layer, mapping the feature representation down to 10 outputs. The 'softmax' activation ensures these ten numbers are interpreted as probabilities. `categorical_crossentropy` is the appropriate loss function to use with `softmax`, as it measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true class.

In contrast, the *sigmoid* activation function is better suited to binary classification problems (e.g., spam detection) or multi-label classification tasks where an input can belong to multiple classes simultaneously (e.g., image tagging). *Sigmoid* squashes its input between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of a single class. If using *sigmoid* in a multi-label setting, each neuron represents the probability of a particular label being present. The use of a separate sigmoid function on each neuron allows for independent probability estimates, which is not possible with *softmax*.

```python
# Example using sigmoid for binary classification

base_model = keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

x = keras.layers.Flatten()(base_model.output)
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x) # Binary output

model = keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Here, the final layer `keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')` produces a single probability output. `binary_crossentropy` is the standard loss to use with sigmoid. This approach also extends directly to multi-label cases, with an individual sigmoid activation per class. For instance, if 5 labels were possible, the final layer would have 5 neurons each using the sigmoid activation.

Moving away from classification, if the problem involves regression – predicting a continuous numerical value – the appropriate activation is often the *linear* activation or no activation at all. This simply passes the output of the preceding layers directly to the next layer. This preserves the continuous nature of the predicted value. While this is functionally "no activation" in the sense that there's no transformation applied, Keras explicitly allows `activation=None` or `activation='linear'`. If you don’t specify an activation function, it defaults to linear.

```python
# Example using linear activation for regression

base_model = keras.applications.InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
x = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')(x) # Regression output

model = keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
```

The `keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')` here delivers a continuous prediction. Notice the corresponding change in loss to 'mse' (Mean Squared Error). This loss function is explicitly designed to minimize the average squared distance between the predicted and true continuous values. Mean Absolute Error (mae) is included as an evaluation metric.

In summary, selection hinges on the problem formulation. If you are classifying into mutually exclusive categories, use *softmax* and `categorical_crossentropy`. For binary or multi-label classification, use *sigmoid* and `binary_crossentropy`. And for regression, stick to a *linear* output, coupled with a suitable metric and loss like 'mse'. The right choice will ensure the model output is both theoretically sound and practically usable.

Further reading on activation functions and loss functions can enhance your model design expertise. Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al. provides a strong foundation for the theory behind these components. Additionally, resources such as the TensorFlow documentation and online courses frequently feature practical examples and tutorials. These resources can deepen your understanding of neural network behavior and guide the optimal deployment of transfer learning.
