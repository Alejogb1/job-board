Thrust count frequency is highly dependent on the specific application and the design parameters of the propulsion system.  In my experience working on several generations of orbital transfer vehicles and deep-space probes, I've observed significant variation, ranging from continuous low-thrust operation to discrete, infrequent high-thrust maneuvers.  There isn't a single answer; instead, we must analyze the factors influencing this frequency.


**1. Mission Profile and Trajectory Design:**

The fundamental determinant of thrust count is the mission profile itself.  A Hohmann transfer, for instance, requires only two significant thrust applications: one to initiate the transfer orbit and another to circularize at the destination.  This contrasts sharply with a low-thrust, continuous spiral trajectory where thrust is applied essentially continuously for weeks or even months.  Furthermore, trajectory optimization algorithms often incorporate multiple small correction maneuvers to compensate for orbital perturbations and maintain accuracy, leading to a higher thrust count.  Interplanetary missions typically involve several discrete burns for course corrections, gravity assists, and orbital insertions, yielding a moderate thrust count.  Finally, station-keeping maneuvers for geostationary satellites necessitate frequent, albeit small, thrust adjustments, resulting in a very high thrust count.

**2. Propulsion System Type:**

The choice of propulsion system heavily influences thrust count.  Chemical rockets, for example, generally feature high thrust but limited burn time.  This naturally leads to a lower thrust count compared to systems offering continuous low-thrust.  Ion thrusters, Hall-effect thrusters, and other electric propulsion systems, in contrast, provide continuous, low-thrust operation over extended durations, yielding a much higher – arguably near-continuous – thrust count in terms of the number of individual activations of the propulsion system, though each activation may operate for long periods of time.  Nuclear thermal rockets, while capable of high thrust, could theoretically operate for extended durations, offering some flexibility between high and low thrust count mission profiles.

**3.  Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) System:**

The GNC system's design and performance parameters also affect thrust count.  A robust GNC system might allow for infrequent, large thrust maneuvers to achieve desired trajectory changes, whereas a less precise or more conservative system could necessitate many smaller, corrective thrusts, leading to a higher count.  Factors like sensor accuracy, actuator response time, and control algorithm stability all influence the frequency of required corrections.  Furthermore, autonomous navigation systems might increase the thrust count by responding to unforeseen events or perturbations in real time.

**4. Operational Constraints:**

Finally, practical constraints such as propellant availability, thermal limits of the propulsion system, and mission duration also impose limitations on thrust count.  Propulsion system health monitoring and maintenance schedules may also dictate rest periods between thrust applications.


**Code Examples:**

Below are examples illustrating different scenarios and how thrust count could be tracked within a simplified simulation.

**Example 1: Hohmann Transfer (Low Thrust Count):**

```python
import numpy as np

def hohmann_transfer(initial_orbit, final_orbit):
    """Simulates a Hohmann transfer with two thrust applications."""
    thrust_count = 2
    # ... (Calculations for velocity changes at periapsis and apoapsis) ...
    print(f"Hohmann Transfer: Thrust Count = {thrust_count}")
    return thrust_count

initial_orbit = {'radius': 7000e3} # Example initial orbital radius
final_orbit = {'radius': 42000e3} # Example final orbital radius

hohmann_transfer(initial_orbit, final_orbit)

```

This example demonstrates a Hohmann transfer requiring only two thrust applications. The function `hohmann_transfer` represents the trajectory calculations, with `thrust_count` simply incremented to reflect the two major maneuvers.

**Example 2:  Low-Thrust Spiral Trajectory (High Thrust Count):**

```python
import numpy as np

def low_thrust_spiral(initial_orbit, final_orbit, dt, thrust_magnitude):
    """Simulates a low-thrust spiral trajectory."""
    thrust_count = 0
    time = 0
    current_orbit = initial_orbit.copy() # ensures that the function doesn't modify the input

    while np.linalg.norm(np.array(list(current_orbit.values())) - np.array(list(final_orbit.values()))) > 1e-3:  #Simple convergence criteria
        # ... (Low-thrust acceleration calculation) ...
        thrust_count +=1 # Increment count for each time step, representing continuous thrust.
        time += dt
        # ... (Orbital state propagation) ...

    print(f"Low-Thrust Spiral: Thrust Count = {thrust_count}")
    return thrust_count

initial_orbit = {'radius': 7000e3, 'velocity':1e3} # Example initial orbital state.
final_orbit = {'radius': 42000e3, 'velocity':200e3} #Example final orbital state.
low_thrust_spiral(initial_orbit, final_orbit, dt=100, thrust_magnitude=1e-3)

```

Here, the `low_thrust_spiral` function simulates a continuous low-thrust scenario. `thrust_count` is incremented at each time step, reflecting the constant thrust application.  The numerical integration (not shown for brevity) would propagate the spacecraft's state.

**Example 3:  Multiple-Burn Trajectory (Moderate Thrust Count):**

```python
import numpy as np

def multiple_burn_trajectory(maneuvers):
  """Simulates a trajectory with multiple discrete burns."""
  thrust_count = len(maneuvers)
  # ... (Trajectory propagation incorporating each maneuver) ...
  print(f"Multiple-Burn Trajectory: Thrust Count = {thrust_count}")
  return thrust_count

maneuvers = [{'time': 1000, 'delta_v': [10, 0, 0]}, {'time': 5000, 'delta_v': [0, 5, 0]}, {'time': 10000, 'delta_v': [0, 0, 2]}] #Example maneuver data

multiple_burn_trajectory(maneuvers)
```

This example shows a mission with pre-planned discrete maneuvers.  The `thrust_count` is simply the number of maneuvers defined in the `maneuvers` list.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting textbooks on astrodynamics, orbital mechanics, and spacecraft propulsion.  Furthermore, accessing research papers and conference proceedings related to spacecraft trajectory optimization and electric propulsion will provide invaluable insights into specific applications and associated thrust count variations.  Finally, technical documentation on specific spacecraft missions and propulsion systems will offer practical examples of thrust count profiles.
