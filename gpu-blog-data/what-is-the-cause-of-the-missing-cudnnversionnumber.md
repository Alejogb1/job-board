The absence of the `cudnn_version_number` attribute within TensorFlow's `build_info` module almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the TensorFlow installation and the CUDA/cuDNN environment.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, from high-throughput image processing pipelines to complex reinforcement learning agents, points to this as the primary culprit.  The `build_info` module reflects the configuration used during TensorFlow's compilation; if the CUDA and cuDNN components weren't correctly detected or linked during this process, the version information won't be present.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, when built with CUDA support, embeds information about the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library versions it's linked against. This information is crucial for reproducibility and debugging.  The `build_info` module provides this metadata.  The `cudnn_version_number` attribute, specifically, reports the version of the cuDNN library used. Its absence signifies that either:

* **No CUDA support was included during compilation:**  TensorFlow was built without CUDA support altogether. This typically occurs when the build process doesn't find the CUDA toolkit or when the build configuration explicitly disables CUDA. In this scenario, no cuDNN information will be present, as cuDNN is a CUDA-specific library.
* **CUDA support was attempted but failed:** The build system attempted to incorporate CUDA, but encountered errors during the linking phase. This could result from version mismatches (incompatible CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions), incorrect environment variables, or problems with the CUDA installation itself.  TensorFlow might have compiled, but incompletely.
* **Incorrect build environment:** The environment variables pointing to CUDA and cuDNN libraries were incorrect or missing during the TensorFlow build process. This could be caused by conflicting installations or improperly configured environment variables.


Therefore, diagnosing this problem necessitates examining the TensorFlow build process and the underlying CUDA/cuDNN installation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following Python code snippets illustrate how to access and check for the `cudnn_version_number` attribute and how to investigate the overall build information.

**Example 1: Checking for the Attribute:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    cudnn_version = tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()['cudnn_version_number']
    print(f"cuDNN version: {cudnn_version}")
except KeyError:
    print("cudnn_version_number attribute not found. CUDA support may be missing or incomplete.")
```

This code attempts to access the attribute.  A `KeyError` is caught to gracefully handle the absence of the attribute, indicating a likely problem.  In my experience, this is the most straightforward initial check.


**Example 2: Examining the Entire Build Info:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

build_info = tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()
print("TensorFlow Build Information:")
for key, value in build_info.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

This code provides a comprehensive view of the TensorFlow build information.  Analyzing the output, particularly the CUDA-related entries (e.g., `cuda_version`, `cuda_compute_capabilities`), can help pinpoint the root cause.  Looking for missing or inconsistent entries is critical.  I often found subtle discrepancies in compute capability reported between `build_info` and `nvidia-smi` output, leading to the problem's identification.


**Example 3: Verifying CUDA and cuDNN Installation:**

While not directly part of TensorFlow's `build_info`, verifying the independent CUDA and cuDNN installations is essential.  This can be done (though not shown directly in code here) via command-line tools provided with those installations. For instance, `nvcc --version` and examining the cuDNN library files directly would provide confirming information.  This step confirms whether the problem lies within TensorFlow's build or in the underlying CUDA/cuDNN setup.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, especially the sections detailing installation and build instructions for CUDA support.  The CUDA toolkit documentation, focusing on installation and verification. The cuDNN documentation, paying close attention to compatibility details with specific CUDA toolkit versions and TensorFlow versions.  Consult the troubleshooting sections in all of these resources; I found them invaluable in past debugging efforts.  Finally, examining relevant forum posts and community discussions on TensorFlow and CUDA integration will often unveil common solutions to similar problems.  These resources provide detailed instructions and best practices, often addressing subtle issues that might be missed otherwise.  In situations with deeply nested dependencies, careful attention to version compatibility is paramount.
