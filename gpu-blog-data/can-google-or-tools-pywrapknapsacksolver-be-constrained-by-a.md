The core limitation of `pywrapknapsack_solver` isn't directly a configurable memory limit in the traditional sense; it's indirectly constrained by the available system memory and the size of the problem instance.  My experience working on large-scale optimization problems using OR-Tools has shown that exceeding available memory results in crashes or excessively long execution times, rather than a graceful handling of memory constraints through dedicated parameters within the solver itself.  This behavior stems from the solver's internal data structures and algorithms, which inherently require significant memory for storing problem data and intermediate results during the solution process.

The `pywrapknapsack_solver` operates by building and exploring a search tree to find optimal solutions. The size of this search tree grows exponentially with the number of items (n) and the capacity (W) of the knapsack.  Therefore, problems with a large number of items or a large capacity quickly lead to memory exhaustion.  Furthermore, the solver's internal data structures, including dynamic programming tables or branch-and-bound data, also consume memory proportionally to the problem size.  This means that while no explicit memory limit exists, the practical limit is determined by the physical memory available to the Python process.

The key to addressing this implicit memory constraint lies in efficient problem formulation and algorithmic choices.  This involves strategic techniques beyond the direct control of `pywrapknapsack_solver` itself. Let's explore this through several code examples.

**Example 1: Reducing Problem Size Through Preprocessing**

This approach focuses on minimizing the input data before it even reaches the solver.  In many real-world scenarios, a significant portion of items might be trivially eliminated based on their weight and value.  For instance, items with a weight exceeding the knapsack capacity can be immediately disregarded. Similarly, items with a low value-to-weight ratio compared to others might be safely excluded in a preliminary filtering step.

```python
from ortools.algorithms import pywrapknapsack_solver

def solve_knapsack_preprocessed(weights, values, capacity):
    # Preprocessing: Remove items exceeding capacity and low value-to-weight ratio.
    filtered_weights = []
    filtered_values = []
    for w, v in zip(weights, values):
        if w <= capacity and (v / w) > 0.1: #example threshold
            filtered_weights.append(w)
            filtered_values.append(v)
    
    solver = pywrapknapsack_solver.KnapsackSolver(
        pywrapknapsack_solver.KnapsackSolver.KNAPSACK_DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING_SOLVER, 'test')
    solver.Init(filtered_weights, filtered_values, [capacity])
    computed_value = solver.Solve()
    packed_items = [i for i in range(len(filtered_weights)) if solver.BestSolutionContains(i)]
    return computed_value, packed_items

weights = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
values = [60, 100, 120, 160, 200, 210, 240, 260, 280, 300]
capacity = 150

computed_value, packed_items = solve_knapsack_preprocessed(weights, values, capacity)
print(f"Total value: {computed_value}")
print(f"Packed items: {packed_items}")

```

This example demonstrates how preprocessing can significantly decrease the size of the problem, thus indirectly managing the memory consumption.  The threshold (0.1 in this case) should be chosen carefully based on the specific problem characteristics.

**Example 2:  Chunking the Problem**

For extremely large datasets, a divide-and-conquer strategy can be effective.  The original problem can be partitioned into smaller, more manageable subproblems, each solved independently using `pywrapknapsack_solver`. The solutions to the subproblems can then be combined to form an approximate solution to the original problem.  This approach trades optimality for reduced memory usage.

```python
import numpy as np
from ortools.algorithms import pywrapknapsack_solver

def solve_knapsack_chunked(weights, values, capacity, chunk_size):
    num_chunks = (len(weights) + chunk_size - 1) // chunk_size
    total_value = 0
    packed_items = []
    for i in range(num_chunks):
        start = i * chunk_size
        end = min((i + 1) * chunk_size, len(weights))
        solver = pywrapknapsack_solver.KnapsackSolver(
            pywrapknapsack_solver.KnapsackSolver.KNAPSACK_DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING_SOLVER, f'chunk_{i}')
        solver.Init(weights[start:end], values[start:end], [capacity])
        solver.Solve()
        for j in range(end - start):
            if solver.BestSolutionContains(j):
                packed_items.append(start + j)
                total_value += values[start + j]
    return total_value, packed_items

# Example usage (assuming large weights and values arrays)
weights = np.random.randint(1, 50, 10000) #large dataset
values = np.random.randint(10, 100, 10000)
capacity = 5000
chunk_size = 1000
total_value, packed_items = solve_knapsack_chunked(weights, values, capacity, chunk_size)
print(f"Total value (approximate): {total_value}")
print(f"Packed items: {packed_items}")

```

This example shows how breaking down a large problem into smaller chunks limits the memory usage per solve call. The choice of `chunk_size` is critical and depends on the available memory and the problem's structure.

**Example 3: Utilizing Heuristics and Approximations**

For situations where finding an exact solution is not strictly necessary, employing heuristic algorithms or approximation techniques can significantly reduce memory consumption.  These algorithms usually trade off optimality for speed and reduced memory footprint.  For example, a greedy approach, selecting items based on their value-to-weight ratio until the knapsack is full, can often yield good solutions while using considerably less memory.


```python
def solve_knapsack_greedy(weights, values, capacity):
    items = sorted(range(len(values)), key=lambda i: values[i] / weights[i], reverse=True)
    total_value = 0
    packed_items = []
    remaining_capacity = capacity
    for i in items:
        if weights[i] <= remaining_capacity:
            total_value += values[i]
            packed_items.append(i)
            remaining_capacity -= weights[i]
    return total_value, packed_items

weights = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
values = [60, 100, 120, 160, 200]
capacity = 80
total_value, packed_items = solve_knapsack_greedy(weights, values, capacity)
print(f"Total value (greedy): {total_value}")
print(f"Packed items (greedy): {packed_items}")

```

This greedy approach drastically simplifies the solution process, avoiding the complex search tree construction characteristic of the exact solver.  The solution quality might be inferior to the optimal solution, but the memory savings can be substantial.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I suggest consulting the official OR-Tools documentation, focusing on advanced knapsack solver techniques and memory management best practices in Python.  Additionally, exploring literature on approximation algorithms and heuristic methods for combinatorial optimization problems would be beneficial.  Understanding the complexities of the NP-complete nature of the knapsack problem is crucial for selecting the appropriate solution strategy.  Finally, reviewing optimization techniques for large datasets within the context of Python programming will enhance your ability to handle memory-intensive tasks effectively.
