Gzipping static assets like JavaScript and CSS files in Sails.js significantly reduces bandwidth consumption and improves website performance.  My experience optimizing numerous Sails.js applications has shown that neglecting this crucial step can lead to considerable performance degradation, especially on high-traffic sites.  Directly implementing gzip compression within Sails itself is not the recommended approach; instead, leveraging a capable reverse proxy or a dedicated server module proves more efficient and robust.  The most effective method involves configuring a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle the compression.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Sails.js, while a powerful framework, is primarily focused on the application logic and data management aspects of web development.  Handling low-level tasks like gzip compression is better left to specialized tools.  These tools can often perform these operations with greater efficiency and provide features such as caching and advanced compression algorithms beyond the capabilities of a typical Node.js middleware.

Implementing gzip compression at the reverse proxy level offers several key advantages:

* **Efficiency:**  The proxy server is typically optimized for handling HTTP requests and static assets, making it significantly faster at processing gzip compression compared to doing it within the Sails application itself.  This avoids burdening your Node.js application with additional processing overhead, particularly beneficial under high load.

* **Centralized Management:**  All your static asset compression can be configured in a single location, allowing for consistent application of compression across multiple applications and environments.  This simplifies maintenance and reduces the likelihood of inconsistencies.

* **Advanced Features:**  Reverse proxies often offer sophisticated features beyond basic gzip compression. This can include advanced caching mechanisms, load balancing, and security features such as SSL termination.

While a custom Sails.js middleware *could* handle gzip compression, the performance overhead and maintenance burden generally outweigh the benefits.  This is based on my direct experience debugging performance bottlenecks in several high-traffic Sails.js applications.  The resources consumed by adding compression to the application layer frequently overshadowed the performance gains achieved.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the configuration required in different reverse proxies.  These examples are illustrative and might require adjustments based on your specific server configuration.

**Example 1: Nginx Configuration**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;
    root /path/to/your/sails/app/assets;

    location ~* \.(js|css)$ {
        gzip on;
        gzip_proxied any;
        gzip_types application/javascript text/css;
        gzip_vary on;
        expires 30d;
    }

    # ... rest of your Nginx configuration ...
}
```

This Nginx configuration block targets files ending with `.js` or `.css`.  `gzip on` enables gzip compression. `gzip_proxied any` is important if you are using a proxy upstream,  allowing gzip to be processed effectively. `gzip_types` specifies the MIME types to compress. `gzip_vary on` ensures the `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is added to responses, preventing caching issues. `expires` sets a cache expiry time.  Remember to adjust `/path/to/your/sails/app/assets` to reflect your asset directory.

**Example 2: Apache Configuration**

```apache
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css application/javascript
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    RequestHeader set Accept-Encoding "" env=no_gzip
  </IfModule>
</IfModule>
```

This Apache configuration uses `mod_deflate` to handle the compression.  The `AddOutputFilterByType` directive specifies the MIME types to compress.  The addition of `<IfModule mod_headers.c>` and its nested directive is crucial to prevent issues with clients that don't support gzip compression. This prevents compatibility issues and improves user experience for those clients.

**Example 3:  Illustrative Sails.js Middleware (Not Recommended):**

While I strongly discourage this method due to performance implications, this demonstrates how it *could* be implemented:

```javascript
// api/policies/gzip.js
module.exports = function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.url.match(/\.(js|css)$/)) {
    res.setHeader('Content-Encoding', 'gzip');
    // Note: This requires a dedicated streaming gzip library and is significantly less efficient
    // than a reverse proxy approach
    // ... complex streaming gzip implementation would go here...
  }
  next();
};
```

This policy would apply gzip compression to JavaScript and CSS files. However, the significant processing overhead required for on-the-fly compression in Node.js makes this less efficient than using a reverse proxy.  Implementing robust streaming gzip in Node.js efficiently adds considerable complexity. The efficiency loss becomes significantly noticeable under load.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of Nginx configuration, I recommend consulting the official Nginx documentation.  Similarly, the Apache HTTP Server documentation offers comprehensive guidance on configuring `mod_deflate`.  Finally, a solid grasp of HTTP headers and caching mechanisms is essential for optimizing web application performance.  Understanding the implications of `Vary` headers is particularly important when implementing gzip compression.  These resources provide detailed explanations and practical examples that will enable you to make informed choices for your specific setup.
