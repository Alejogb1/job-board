The "negative dimension size" error in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to the MNIST dataset typically stems from a mismatch between the convolutional layer's output shape and the subsequent layer's input expectations, often arising from incorrect padding or stride parameters.  This is a common pitfall I've encountered repeatedly during my work on various image classification projects, even with seemingly straightforward datasets like MNIST.

**1.  Explanation:**

A CNN processes images through a series of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.  Each layer modifies the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature maps.  The output shape of a convolutional layer is dictated by the input shape, kernel size, stride, and padding.  A negative dimension size arises when the calculations for the output dimensions result in a negative value, implying the convolutional operation attempted to produce a feature map with a negative height or width.  This indicates an error in the layer's configuration.

Let's examine the formula governing output dimensions for a single convolutional layer:

Output Height/Width = `⌊(Input Height/Width + 2 * Padding - Kernel Size) / Stride⌋ + 1`

Where:

* `⌊⌋` denotes the floor function (rounding down to the nearest integer).
* Input Height/Width:  Dimensions of the input feature map.
* Padding: The number of pixels added to the borders of the input.
* Kernel Size: The size of the convolutional kernel (filter).
* Stride: The number of pixels the kernel moves across the input in each step.

A negative dimension arises when the numerator `(Input Height/Width + 2 * Padding - Kernel Size)` becomes negative, leading to a negative result after the floor and addition operations. This typically occurs when the kernel size is larger than the input dimensions, even with the addition of padding.  Insufficient padding, or an overly aggressive stride, can also lead to this issue.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples use TensorFlow/Keras, illustrating different scenarios leading to the error and demonstrating correct configurations.

**Example 1: Insufficient Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (5, 5), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #Incorrect Padding
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This will likely throw a "negative dimension size" error during model training or summary.
# The default padding is 'valid', meaning no padding. With a (5,5) kernel on a 28x28 input, the output
# will be negative based on the formula above.
model.summary()
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the common error of insufficient padding. The kernel size is (5, 5), larger than a portion of the 28x28 input. The default 'valid' padding adds no extra pixels, resulting in a negative output dimension.  This should be addressed by explicitly adding padding, ideally using 'same' padding or specifying a numeric padding value.


**Example 2: Correct Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (5, 5), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.summary()
```

**Commentary:** This corrected example uses `padding='same'`. This ensures that the output height and width are the same as the input, preventing the negative dimension error.  The `MaxPooling2D` layer further reduces the dimensions, which is a standard practice in CNNs.


**Example 3: Incorrect Stride and Kernel Size:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (7, 7), strides=(3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #Large stride and kernel
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#This may or may not throw a negative dimension size error depending on the specific padding used, but it's highly likely with the combination of large kernel and stride.
model.summary()
```


**Commentary:** This example shows a scenario where a large kernel size (7,7) coupled with a large stride (3,3) can potentially lead to a negative dimension, even with padding. The large stride reduces the output significantly in each step, and combined with a large kernel, it might quickly result in negative dimensions.  Carefully selecting appropriate stride and kernel sizes in relation to the input size and padding is crucial.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures and the mathematical operations involved, I recommend consulting standard deep learning textbooks.  Pay particular attention to the chapters discussing convolutional layers and their parameterization.  Furthermore, reviewing the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) is indispensable for accurate parameter setting and troubleshooting. Finally, explore academic papers detailing CNN architectures applied to image classification tasks; this will expose you to best practices and common pitfalls.  Analyzing successful architectures can provide valuable insight into avoiding issues such as the "negative dimension size" error.
