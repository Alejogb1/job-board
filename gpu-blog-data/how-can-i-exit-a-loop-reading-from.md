The fundamental challenge in exiting a loop reading from two pipes in C lies in reliably detecting the end-of-file (EOF) condition on both pipes simultaneously.  Simply checking for EOF on one pipe before proceeding to the other can lead to indefinite blocking on the pipe still containing data, or worse, data loss if one pipe closes prematurely.  My experience debugging multi-process communication in high-throughput data processing pipelines has highlighted the critical need for robust error handling and synchronization mechanisms in these scenarios.

The core strategy for gracefully exiting such a loop involves using `select()` or `poll()` system calls to monitor the readability of both pipes.  These functions allow the program to wait for data to become available on either pipe, or for an exceptional condition such as a pipe closure to occur.  This avoids busy-waiting, which is inefficient and can lead to performance degradation, especially under heavy load.  Furthermore, appropriate error checking is imperative to handle potential system call failures and unexpected pipe closures.

**1.  Explanation:**

The `select()` system call allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors for readiness.  In the context of two pipes, we would monitor the file descriptors associated with each pipe for readability.  The `FD_SET` macros facilitate setting up the file descriptor sets for input and output.  The `select()` call blocks until at least one of the monitored file descriptors becomes ready, or until a timeout occurs.  Upon return, we can check which file descriptors are ready using `FD_ISSET()`.  If either pipe's file descriptor indicates readiness, we attempt to read from that pipe.  If `read()` returns 0 (indicating EOF), we know that pipe has been closed.  If an error occurs during `read()`, we must handle the error appropriately.  Once EOF is detected on both pipes, the loop terminates.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Basic `select()` Implementation:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main() {
    int pipe1[2], pipe2[2];
    fd_set readfds;
    int maxfd;
    char buffer[1024];
    int bytes_read;

    if (pipe(pipe1) == -1 || pipe(pipe2) == -1) {
        perror("pipe");
        exit(1);
    }

    // ... (Code to populate pipe1 and pipe2, potentially from child processes) ...


    maxfd = (pipe1[0] > pipe2[0]) ? pipe1[0] : pipe2[0];
    maxfd++; // Add 1 for select()

    while (1) {
        FD_ZERO(&readfds);
        FD_SET(pipe1[0], &readfds);
        FD_SET(pipe2[0], &readfds);

        if (select(maxfd, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL) == -1) {
            perror("select");
            exit(1);
        }


        if (FD_ISSET(pipe1[0], &readfds)) {
            bytes_read = read(pipe1[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
            if (bytes_read == -1) {
                perror("read pipe1");
                exit(1);
            } else if (bytes_read == 0) {
                close(pipe1[0]);
                close(pipe1[1]); // Close writing end if not already closed
            } else {
                // Process data from pipe1
            }
        }

        if (FD_ISSET(pipe2[0], &readfds)) {
            bytes_read = read(pipe2[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
            if (bytes_read == -1) {
                perror("read pipe2");
                exit(1);
            } else if (bytes_read == 0) {
                close(pipe2[0]);
                close(pipe2[1]); //Close writing end if not already closed
            } else {
                // Process data from pipe2
            }
        }

        // Check for EOF on both pipes
        if (pipe1[0] == -1 && pipe2[0] == -1) break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Example 2:  Handling Timeouts with `select()`:**

This example incorporates a timeout, preventing indefinite blocking if no data is available on either pipe.

```c
// ... (Includes as in Example 1) ...

    struct timeval timeout;
    timeout.tv_sec = 1; // 1-second timeout
    timeout.tv_usec = 0;

    while(1){
        // ... (FD_ZERO, FD_SET as in Example 1) ...

        if (select(maxfd, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &timeout) == -1) {
          perror("select");
          exit(1);
        } else if (select(maxfd, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &timeout) == 0){
          //Timeout occurred, no data available
          continue; //Try again
        }
        // ... (rest of the logic similar to Example 1) ...
    }
```

**Example 3:  Using `poll()` for similar functionality:**

`poll()` offers a slightly different interface but achieves the same result.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <poll.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main() {
    int pipe1[2], pipe2[2];
    struct pollfd fds[2];
    int timeout_ms = 1000; //1 second timeout

    if (pipe(pipe1) == -1 || pipe(pipe2) == -1) {
        perror("pipe");
        exit(1);
    }

    fds[0].fd = pipe1[0];
    fds[0].events = POLLIN;
    fds[1].fd = pipe2[0];
    fds[1].events = POLLIN;


    while (1) {
        int ret = poll(fds, 2, timeout_ms);
        if (ret == -1) {
            perror("poll");
            exit(1);
        } else if (ret == 0) {
          //Timeout occurred
          continue;
        }

        if (fds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
            //Read from pipe1, handle EOF as in previous examples.
        }

        if (fds[1].revents & POLLIN) {
            //Read from pipe2, handle EOF as in previous examples.
        }

        //Check for EOF on both pipes as in previous examples.

    }
    return 0;
}
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago: This provides detailed explanations of system calls such as `select()` and `poll()`, crucial for understanding the intricacies of I/O multiplexing.
*   The relevant sections of the "man pages" for `select()`, `poll()`, `pipe()`, `read()`, `FD_SET`, `FD_ISSET`, and error handling functions like `perror()` and `errno`.  These are invaluable references for detailed information on the system calls and their behavior.
*   A good C programming textbook focusing on system-level programming and process management. This will solidify your understanding of inter-process communication and the underlying concepts.


These examples and resources should provide a solid foundation for building robust and efficient code that handles multiple pipe reads concurrently, addressing the complexities of EOF detection and error handling in a reliable manner.  Remember that rigorous testing is essential to ensure your solution performs as expected in various scenarios, including unexpected pipe closures and varying data volumes.  Always handle potential errors gracefully to prevent program crashes and data loss.
