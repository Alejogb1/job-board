EBCDIC-to-ASCII conversion in Python 2 necessitates a character-by-character mapping approach due to the fundamental differences in character encoding between the two systems.  My experience working on legacy mainframe integration projects highlighted the crucial role of accurate code page identification and handling of potential mapping ambiguities.  Direct byte-to-byte conversion is insufficient; a proper translation table is essential for reliable results.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code) and ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) are distinct character encoding schemes.  EBCDIC, predominantly used on IBM mainframes, employs a different mapping of bytes to characters compared to ASCII, commonly used in most other systems. A direct binary conversion would not yield readable results; instead, a character-mapping translation is required. This involves using a lookup table that defines the corresponding ASCII character for each EBCDIC code point. The specific EBCDIC code page used will determine the exact mapping. Code page identification is therefore critical. Different code pages, such as CP037, CP500, and others, utilize varying character assignments within the EBCDIC framework. Incorrectly identifying the code page will lead to incorrect character conversions.

The conversion process typically involves reading the EBCDIC file byte by byte, looking up each byte's corresponding ASCII equivalent in the chosen code page’s translation table, and writing the resulting ASCII characters to a new file.  Handling potential non-mappable characters – those without ASCII equivalents – requires error handling strategies; these could include substitution with a placeholder character, logging the error, or raising an exception, depending on the application's requirements.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Conversion using a Pre-defined Dictionary**

This example uses a limited, pre-defined dictionary for demonstration.  In a real-world scenario, a much more comprehensive mapping would be necessary, ideally sourced from a dedicated EBCDIC code page library.

```python
# Limited EBCDIC to ASCII mapping (CP037 subset for demonstration)
ebcdic_to_ascii = {
    0xc1: 'A', 0xc2: 'B', 0xc3: 'C', 0xc4: 'D', 0xc5: 'E',
    0xc6: 'F', 0xc7: 'G', 0xc8: 'H', 0xc9: 'I', 0xd1: 'J',
    0xd2: 'K', 0xd3: 'L', 0xd4: 'M', 0xd5: 'N', 0xd6: 'O',
    0xd7: 'P', 0xd8: 'Q', 0xd9: 'R', 0xe1: 'S', 0xe2: 'T',
    0xe3: 'U', 0xe4: 'V', 0xe5: 'W', 0xe6: 'X', 0xe7: 'Y',
    0xe8: 'Z', 0x40: '@', 0x60: '`',  # and so on...
}

def convert_ebcdic_to_ascii_basic(input_filename, output_filename, mapping):
    try:
        with open(input_filename, 'rb') as infile, open(output_filename, 'wb') as outfile:
            for byte in infile.read():
                ascii_char = mapping.get(byte, '?') # '?' for unmapped characters
                outfile.write(ascii_char)
    except IOError as e:
        print "Error: ", e


convert_ebcdic_to_ascii_basic("input.ebcdic", "output.txt", ebcdic_to_ascii)
```

**Commentary:** This code demonstrates the fundamental principle of byte-wise lookup. The `get()` method handles cases where a byte doesn't exist in the mapping, substituting '?' as a default. The `'rb'` and `'wb'` modes are crucial for handling binary files correctly in Python 2. Error handling is included to manage potential file I/O problems.

**Example 2: Using a More Robust Mapping Approach (CP037)**

This example utilizes a more comprehensive approach; however, obtaining a fully comprehensive mapping requires external resources or libraries.  I have utilized this technique extensively in my past engagements, modifying the mapping based on the specific needs of different EBCDIC code pages.

```python
#Assume a function get_cp037_mapping() exists (implementation omitted for brevity)
#This function would ideally return a dictionary mapping EBCDIC (CP037) bytes to ASCII characters

cp037_mapping = get_cp037_mapping()

def convert_ebcdic_to_ascii_cp037(input_filename, output_filename, mapping):
    try:
        with open(input_filename, 'rb') as infile, open(output_filename, 'wb') as outfile:
            for byte in infile.read():
                ascii_char = mapping.get(byte, '?')
                outfile.write(ascii_char)
    except IOError as e:
        print "Error:", e

convert_ebcdic_to_ascii_cp037("input.ebcdic", "output.txt", cp037_mapping)

```

**Commentary:** This code emphasizes the importance of using a complete code page mapping.  The `get_cp037_mapping()` function (not shown) would be responsible for loading the comprehensive CP037 mapping.  This approach is significantly more robust than the previous example, but its effectiveness hinges on the accuracy and completeness of the underlying mapping.

**Example 3: Handling Non-Mappable Characters with Logging**

This example addresses the scenario where non-mappable characters may occur and logs these occurrences for later analysis.

```python
import logging

# ... (Assume cp037_mapping is defined as in Example 2) ...

logging.basicConfig(filename='conversion_log.txt', level=logging.WARNING,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def convert_ebcdic_to_ascii_logging(input_filename, output_filename, mapping):
    try:
        with open(input_filename, 'rb') as infile, open(output_filename, 'wb') as outfile:
            for byte in infile.read():
                ascii_char = mapping.get(byte, None)
                if ascii_char is None:
                    logging.warning("Unmapped EBCDIC byte: 0x%02X" % byte)
                    outfile.write('?') # Substitute with '?'
                else:
                    outfile.write(ascii_char)
    except IOError as e:
        print "Error:", e

convert_ebcdic_to_ascii_logging("input.ebcdic", "output.txt", cp037_mapping)
```


**Commentary:** This code incorporates logging to record any unmapped bytes. This is beneficial for troubleshooting and understanding data integrity issues.  The logging mechanism provides a record of encountered problems, allowing for later analysis and potential refinement of the mapping table or data cleaning procedures.  Substituting with '?' or another placeholder is a common practice; alternatives include using a Unicode replacement character.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive EBCDIC code page mappings, consult IBM's official documentation on character encoding.  Consider searching for Python libraries designed specifically for mainframe data conversion – some may provide pre-built mapping tables and optimized conversion functions.  Specialized text processing libraries may also offer helpful functionalities for working with different character encodings.  Understanding the intricacies of character encoding standards is crucial for successful implementation.  Familiarize yourself with the nuances of handling various code pages to prevent data corruption.
