The compatibility of compiled CUDA libraries with mismatched runtime libraries, specifically in the context of cuDNN versions, is a frequent source of headaches for deep learning practitioners. I've personally debugged similar issues across various platforms, and the nuances can significantly impact application stability and performance. In your specific scenario – a source library compiled against cuDNN 8.1.0 attempting to execute with a runtime cuDNN 8.0.5 library in Google Colab – the short answer is: it's highly likely to fail or produce undefined behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this is the case, along with illustrative examples.

**Understanding the CuDNN ABI and Versioning**

The crux of the problem lies within the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of cuDNN. The ABI dictates how compiled code interacts with the shared library at runtime. Every release of cuDNN, though semantically similar, can introduce internal data structure changes, function renames, or modifications to calling conventions. These alterations mean that a compiled piece of code referencing, for example, `cudnnConvolutionForward_v8` in cuDNN 8.1.0 may find that the corresponding function is absent or has a different signature in cuDNN 8.0.5.

This issue isn’t simply about version numbers; it’s about the underlying binary compatibility. A newer cuDNN version doesn't guarantee backward compatibility with older compiled libraries. In fact, such an assumption often leads to segmentation faults or, worse, silent errors causing incorrect results, which are notoriously difficult to debug.

**The Problem in Detail**

When you compile a library using the cuDNN headers and libraries from version 8.1.0, the compiler incorporates specific knowledge about the cuDNN API present at that time. This information is hard-coded into the compiled library, including the address of the relevant cuDNN functions. At runtime, when your Python environment loads the cuDNN shared object (the `.so` file in Linux or `.dll` in Windows), the library loader performs a process called dynamic linking or binding. It attempts to match symbols (function names and data structures) used in your compiled code against symbols present in the loaded runtime library.

In your specific scenario, where the runtime library is cuDNN 8.0.5, the library loader is unlikely to find the exact symbols referenced by the 8.1.0 compiled code. If it does find symbols that are seemingly compatible, they might have different internal structures, which would result in unpredictable behavior. Imagine attempting to use a tool designed for one type of bolt on a different one; it might seem to fit initially, but it won't achieve the intended purpose and may even damage the hardware.

This is the fundamental issue: the ABI mismatch. The compiled code expects a specific cuDNN 8.1.0 ABI, whereas the runtime system presents it with a cuDNN 8.0.5 ABI. This discrepancy almost invariably leads to crashes or corrupted output, although the specific failure mode might vary.

**Code Example Demonstrations (Conceptual)**

Since we can't directly exemplify the internal linking process in a Python setting without creating low-level C++ extensions, I will provide conceptual demonstrations using Python code that mirrors the expected problems.

*   **Example 1: Function Name Mismatch (Simulated)**

```python
# Assume a library compiled against cuDNN 8.1.0 has this function call:
def forward_pass_810(handle, input_data, filter_data):
    # Simulate call to cuDNN function compiled with 8.1.0 header
    if get_cudnn_version() == '8.1.0':
        output = _cudnn_forward_810(handle, input_data, filter_data)
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("CuDNN version mismatch detected")
    return output

def _cudnn_forward_810(handle, input_data, filter_data):
    # Simulate actual cuDNN 8.1.0 API call (would be C++)
    print("cuDNN 8.1.0 forward pass")
    return "output 8.1.0"


# Assume in Colab we have a cuDNN 8.0.5 runtime
def get_cudnn_version():
    return '8.0.5'

# Simulate accessing the library
if get_cudnn_version() == '8.1.0':
    forward_pass_810_runtime= forward_pass_810
elif get_cudnn_version() == '8.0.5':
  def forward_pass_805(handle, input_data, filter_data):
    raise RuntimeError("CuDNN version mismatch detected")
  forward_pass_810_runtime = forward_pass_805

try:
  handle = "some_handle"
  input_data = "some_input"
  filter_data = "some_filter"
  output_result = forward_pass_810_runtime(handle, input_data, filter_data)
  print(output_result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

*   **Commentary:** This code attempts to demonstrate the issue where a compiled library calls `_cudnn_forward_810`, a function it was compiled to expect using cuDNN 8.1.0 headers. When the program runs, the runtime only provides a mocked `forward_pass_805` and raises a runtime exception to demonstrate the version mismatch because the simulation of function name does not exist. This shows that a compiled library looking for a function specific to cuDNN 8.1.0 will fail when confronted with a cuDNN 8.0.5 runtime environment.

*   **Example 2: Data Structure Mismatch (Simulated)**

```python
# Assume library compiled with cuDNN 8.1.0
class CuDNN_810_Data:
    def __init__(self, data):
      self.data_ = data
      self.struct_version_ = '8.1.0'

    def __str__(self):
      return f"cuDNN 8.1.0 struct: data={self.data_}"

def consume_cudnn_810_data(cudnn_data):
    if cudnn_data.struct_version_ != '8.1.0':
        raise RuntimeError("CuDNN data structure mismatch")
    return f"data {cudnn_data.data_} successfully consumed"

#Assume the Colab Runtime provides a structure for cuDNN 8.0.5
class CuDNN_805_Data:
    def __init__(self, data):
      self.data_ = data
      self.struct_version_ = '8.0.5'

    def __str__(self):
      return f"cuDNN 8.0.5 struct: data={self.data_}"

def create_cudnn_data(data):
  if get_cudnn_version() == '8.1.0':
      return CuDNN_810_Data(data)
  elif get_cudnn_version() == '8.0.5':
    return CuDNN_805_Data(data)

try:
  data_1 = create_cudnn_data("initial")
  output_2= consume_cudnn_810_data(data_1)
  print(output_2)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

*   **Commentary:** This example highlights a mismatch in the structure of data types used by the library and the cuDNN runtime. The library compiled against 8.1.0 attempts to consume a `CuDNN_810_Data` object, whereas when running with the environment providing 8.0.5, it produces an `CuDNN_805_Data` and throws an exception to demonstrate that the underlying data structure is mismatched, even if the underlying library accepts data. While this example uses a simplified struct, in cuDNN real data structures for convolutions and other kernels could vary significantly across versions.

*   **Example 3: API Behaviour Change (Simulated)**

```python
# Assume library compiled against cuDNN 8.1.0
def configure_cudnn(handle, flags):
    if get_cudnn_version() == '8.1.0':
      print("cuDNN 8.1.0 configuration called")
      _configure_cudnn_810(handle,flags)
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("CuDNN version mismatch")

def _configure_cudnn_810(handle, flags):
    print("cuDNN 8.1.0 underlying configuration")
    if flags['option_a']:
      print("option_a enabled using 8.1.0 convention")
    else:
        print("option_a is not enabled using 8.1.0 convention")

# Simulate the cuDNN 8.0.5 runtime changes behavior
def _configure_cudnn_805(handle, flags):
  print("cuDNN 8.0.5 underlying configuration")
  if flags['option_a']:
    print("option_a enabled using 8.0.5 convention")
  else:
      print("option_a is not enabled using 8.0.5 convention")
def configure_cudnn_runtime(handle, flags):
    if get_cudnn_version() == '8.1.0':
        configure_cudnn(handle, flags)
    elif get_cudnn_version() == '8.0.5':
        _configure_cudnn_805(handle, flags)
try:
  handle_1 = "some_handle"
  config_flags = {'option_a':True}
  configure_cudnn_runtime(handle_1,config_flags)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error {e}")

```

*   **Commentary:** This example shows that even if function names and data structures might be seemingly compatible, the actual behavior of an API can change from version to version. The underlying functionality in 8.1.0 for the `option_a` flag may be very different than its counterpart in 8.0.5. While there is no error thrown in this case, and seemingly the call goes through, the behaviour is unexpected and would cause silent error in production code.

**Resource Recommendations**

To further understand the intricacies of shared library compatibility and address potential conflicts, I suggest the following areas for research:

1.  **System Level Dynamic Linkers**: Research how the dynamic linker works on Linux (e.g. `ld`) and Windows. Understanding this process is critical to diagnose linking problems. Pay attention to concepts like symbol resolution and shared object search paths.

2.  **C++ ABI Compatibility**: Investigate documentation on C++ ABI changes over time. Although cuDNN is a CUDA library, it is often interfaced with via C++. Understanding fundamental ABI principles is beneficial.

3.  **CUDA Documentation**: Refer to NVIDIA’s CUDA toolkit documentation regarding compatibility and versioning constraints between different components. The documentation provides crucial information on the intended use cases and expected behavior for CUDA applications. This is paramount to any CUDA/cuDNN development.

In conclusion, using a compiled cuDNN library that expects version 8.1.0 with a runtime of 8.0.5 is practically guaranteed to lead to problems. The only way to mitigate these issues is to ensure that the compiled library and the runtime library use the same version of cuDNN. In your case, ensure that Colab provides 8.1.0 or recompile the library you have so it is compliant with Colab's version.
