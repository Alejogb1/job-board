TensorFlow 2's shift to a more deterministic and controllable random number generation (RNG) system represents a significant departure from its predecessor.  My experience working on large-scale simulations and deploying models in production environments highlighted the crucial differences; specifically, TensorFlow 1's reliance on global state often led to reproducibility issues, a problem largely addressed in TensorFlow 2.  This improved control stems from a fundamental architectural change: the introduction of `tf.random` and its associated functions.

**1.  Explanation of the Differences**

TensorFlow 1 heavily depended on the underlying system's RNG, often interacting with Python's `random` module or other external libraries. This coupled with session-dependent behavior introduced a significant challenge for reproducible results.  The global nature of the RNG meant that multiple operations within a single session, or even across sessions if not carefully managed, could inadvertently share or overwrite the RNG state, leading to inconsistent outputs. This made debugging complex models challenging and hampered the ability to reliably reproduce experiments.

TensorFlow 2, conversely, employs a more structured approach. The `tf.random` module offers functions that operate within a defined scope, eliminating the potential for global state conflicts.  Each operation using `tf.random` now leverages its own internal state, making the generation process more predictable and independent.  Furthermore, TensorFlow 2 allows for the explicit setting of seeds, enabling deterministic behavior. This feature is crucial for both research reproducibility and robust model deployment, where consistent outputs are paramount.  This deterministic behavior extends across different platforms and hardware, improving reliability.  The previous implicit dependency on system-level randomness is now decoupled, resulting in greater control and portability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the differences in RNG handling between TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2.  These examples are drawn from my experience developing a physics simulation, where precise control over the random number sequence was critical.

**Example 1:  Simple Random Number Generation**

**TensorFlow 1:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()  # Note:  compat needed for TF1 style

random_numbers = sess.run(tf.random.uniform([10]))
print(random_numbers)

sess.close()
```

This code snippet, while functional in TensorFlow 1 (using the `compat` layer for compatibility), relies on the implicitly initialized global RNG.  Running this multiple times will result in different outputs.  There's no mechanism here to enforce reproducibility.

**TensorFlow 2:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42) # Explicit seed for reproducibility
random_numbers = tf.random.uniform([10])
print(random_numbers)
```

In TensorFlow 2, `tf.random.set_seed(42)` initializes the global RNG with a specific seed.  Crucially, the same seed will always produce the same sequence of random numbers, irrespective of the execution environment or platform.  This contrasts sharply with the TensorFlow 1 example.  Note that setting a seed only guarantees reproducibility at the global level.  For finer-grained control, one should use operation-level seeds as well, discussed later.


**Example 2:  Illustrating the Impact of Seeds**

**TensorFlow 2:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42)
random_numbers_1 = tf.random.uniform([5])

tf.random.set_seed(42) # Same seed, same sequence
random_numbers_2 = tf.random.uniform([5])

tf.random.set_seed(137) # Different seed, different sequence
random_numbers_3 = tf.random.uniform([5])

print("Sequence 1:", random_numbers_1)
print("Sequence 2:", random_numbers_2)
print("Sequence 3:", random_numbers_3)
```

This example directly demonstrates TensorFlow 2's deterministic behavior.  The repeated use of `tf.random.set_seed(42)` generates the same sequence, establishing reproducibility.  Changing the seed to `137` yields a different, predictable sequence. This level of control was significantly more difficult to achieve consistently in TensorFlow 1.


**Example 3:  Operation-Level Seeds for Enhanced Control**

**TensorFlow 2:**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Global seed for broader consistency, but individual seeds for more control within a graph
tf.random.set_seed(42)

random_numbers_a = tf.random.stateless_uniform([3], seed=(1,2))
random_numbers_b = tf.random.stateless_uniform([3], seed=(3,4))

print("Sequence A:", random_numbers_a)
print("Sequence B:", random_numbers_b)
```

This example uses `tf.random.stateless_uniform`.  This function takes a seed as an argument, enabling fine-grained control over individual random number generation operations.  Even with a global seed set, each `stateless_uniform` call produces an independent sequence determined solely by its own provided seed. This is particularly valuable in complex models with many random operations, ensuring independent streams of randomness.  In TensorFlow 1 achieving such fine-grained control required far more manual state management, often leading to errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To gain a deeper understanding of TensorFlow 2's random number generation, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation concerning the `tf.random` module. Pay particular attention to the differences between `tf.random.set_seed` and the use of operation-level seeds with functions like `tf.random.stateless_uniform`.  Familiarizing yourself with best practices for managing randomness in large-scale machine learning projects will prove invaluable.  Additionally, studying papers and articles related to reproducibility in scientific computing, particularly concerning random number generation, will further enhance your understanding.  Exploring the source code of TensorFlow's random number generation implementation (though challenging), can provide significant insights into its underlying mechanisms.


In conclusion, the transition from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2 significantly improved the predictability and control over random number generation.  By shifting from an implicit, global state-based approach to a more explicit, seed-based system using the `tf.random` module, TensorFlow 2 addresses a major pain point of its predecessor, thereby promoting reproducibility and facilitating the development of more reliable and robust machine learning models.  Understanding these differences is critical for anyone developing and deploying TensorFlow models in production environments.
