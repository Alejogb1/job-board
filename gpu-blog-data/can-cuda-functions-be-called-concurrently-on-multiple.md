The fundamental limitation preventing direct concurrent execution of a single CUDA function across multiple GPUs using separate streams is the inherently single-GPU nature of CUDA kernels.  CUDA threads, blocks, and grids operate within the confines of a single GPU's processing units.  While multiple GPUs can be used in a single application, they require separate kernel launches, orchestrated through inter-GPU communication strategies, not simultaneous execution of the same kernel. My experience working on large-scale simulations for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) underscored this limitation. Attempts to bypass this using techniques like CUDA streams merely managed asynchronous execution *within* a GPU, not *across* them.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA's programming model is designed around a hierarchical execution structure.  A kernel launch initiates a grid of thread blocks, each containing multiple threads. These threads execute instructions concurrently within the shared memory and processing units of a single GPU.  The CUDA runtime manages these resources effectively for optimal performance on the target device.  However, this efficient management is intrinsically tied to a single GPU.  Separate GPUs are addressed as distinct computing devices within the system, requiring independent kernel launches and data transfers.

Attempting to launch a single kernel concurrently across multiple GPUs via separate streams is conceptually flawed.  A CUDA stream manages the asynchronous execution of kernels and memory operations *on a single GPU*. While you can have multiple streams on a single GPU to overlap computation and data transfer, this does not extend to utilizing separate streams to parallelize a kernel across multiple GPUs. Each GPU necessitates its own kernel launch, with its own associated stream.  The illusion of concurrent kernel execution arises only if carefully structured inter-GPU communication manages data flow and task partitioning appropriately between the independent GPU computations.

Inter-GPU communication is crucial for distributing workloads across multiple GPUs.  Strategies involve using technologies like NVLink (if available), PCI-e, or other high-bandwidth interconnects to transfer data between GPUs. This often requires careful consideration of data partitioning and communication patterns to optimize performance and minimize overhead.  The choice of communication strategy directly impacts the overall application efficiency, especially with larger datasets.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the differences between utilizing streams on a single GPU and attempting (incorrectly) to utilize them across multiple GPUs.

**Example 1: Single GPU with Multiple Streams**

This example demonstrates the effective use of multiple CUDA streams on a single GPU to overlap computation and data transfer.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...

  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  myKernel<<<(N + 255)/256, 256, 0, stream1>>>(d_data, N); // Launch on stream1
  // ... other operations ...
  myKernel<<<(N + 255)/256, 256, 0, stream2>>>(d_data2, N); //Launch on stream2
  // ... synchronize streams as needed...

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);

  // ... memory deallocation ...
  return 0;
}
```

This code showcases the proper use of CUDA streams, where two kernel launches are scheduled on different streams, enabling asynchronous execution within a single GPU.  The streams allow for overlapping operations, improving overall performance.


**Example 2: Multiple GPUs with Separate Kernel Launches**

This example correctly utilizes multiple GPUs by launching the kernel independently on each.


```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  int numGPUs;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&numGPUs);

  for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
    cudaSetDevice(i);
    // ... allocate memory on GPU i ...
    // ...copy data to GPU i ...
    myKernel<<<...>>>(d_data_i, N_i); // Launch kernel on GPU i
    // ... copy results back from GPU i ...
    // ... deallocate memory on GPU i ...
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This approach correctly handles multiple GPUs. Each GPU receives its own kernel launch, managing its own memory and streams independently.  The loop iterates through each GPU, setting the active device and executing the kernel on each. This avoids the misconception of launching a single kernel concurrently on multiple GPUs.


**Example 3: Illustrating Incorrect Approach (Conceptual)**

This example attempts (incorrectly) to launch a single kernel instance across multiple GPUs using streams, demonstrating why this is not directly supported by CUDA.

```c++
// This code is conceptually flawed and will not compile or execute correctly.

#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  int numGPUs;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&numGPUs);

  cudaStream_t streams[numGPUs];
  for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
      cudaStreamCreate(&streams[i]);
  }

  // This is INCORRECT.  You cannot directly launch a single kernel across multiple GPUs.
  myKernel<<<... , 0, streams[0] >>>(d_data, N); // Attempts to launch on multiple GPUs simultaneously, which is invalid

  for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; i++) {
      cudaStreamDestroy(streams[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code segment highlights the crucial error.  The attempt to launch a single kernel instance using different streams across multiple GPUs is fundamentally incorrect.  CUDA does not support this type of direct parallelization across devices. Each GPU must have its own kernel launch.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA C Programming Guide;  CUDA Best Practices Guide;  NVIDIA's documentation on multi-GPU programming;  A good textbook on parallel computing and GPU programming.  Understanding these resources is essential for effective multi-GPU programming with CUDA.  Detailed study of memory management and inter-GPU communication is crucial for implementing efficient and scalable solutions.  Careful consideration of data partitioning strategies is essential for maximizing performance in these applications.
