In my experience developing various deep learning models, handling multiple loss functions effectively is crucial for optimizing complex tasks. Specifically, in PyTorch, backpropagating gradients arising from multiple losses requires a nuanced approach, primarily because the `backward()` method is inherently designed to propagate gradients associated with a single scalar value. When you have multiple losses, it's vital to combine them appropriately before calling `backward()` to achieve the desired update to model parameters.

The core principle relies on aggregating the individual losses into a single scalar value that represents the overall objective function. This aggregation step is necessary because gradient descent operates on a single scalar loss value, adjusting model weights to minimize that value. There are several strategies for combining individual losses, each with implications for model training.

One common approach is to simply sum the losses together:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Example Data
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5
batch_size = 32
x = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
y_true_1 = torch.randn(batch_size, output_size)
y_true_2 = torch.randint(0, 2, (batch_size,)).long()

# Initialize Model, Loss, and Optimizer
model = MyModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion_1 = nn.MSELoss()
criterion_2 = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred = model(x)

    # Compute individual losses
    loss_1 = criterion_1(y_pred, y_true_1)
    loss_2 = criterion_2(y_pred, y_true_2)

    # Combine losses by summing
    total_loss = loss_1 + loss_2

    # Backpropagation
    total_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 20 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Total Loss: {total_loss.item()}")

```
In this example, two losses, `loss_1` (mean squared error) and `loss_2` (cross-entropy), are computed based on the model's output against two different target variables. These losses are then added together to form `total_loss`. By calling `total_loss.backward()`, PyTorch calculates the gradients with respect to this summed loss, effectively influencing parameter updates to simultaneously address both objective criteria. The output of `y_pred` in this case would need to be modified in a practical setting to allow for two differing loss computations. This serves to illustrate the concept at a basic level.

Another important technique involves introducing weights for each individual loss, offering fine-grained control over their contributions to the optimization process:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size_1, output_size_2):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2_1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size_1)
        self.fc2_2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size_2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        output_1 = self.fc2_1(x)
        output_2 = self.fc2_2(x)
        return output_1, output_2

# Example Data
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size_1 = 5
output_size_2 = 2
batch_size = 32
x = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
y_true_1 = torch.randn(batch_size, output_size_1)
y_true_2 = torch.randint(0, 2, (batch_size,)).long()

# Initialize Model, Loss, and Optimizer
model = MyModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size_1, output_size_2)
criterion_1 = nn.MSELoss()
criterion_2 = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
loss_weight_1 = 0.7
loss_weight_2 = 0.3
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred_1, y_pred_2 = model(x)

    # Compute individual losses
    loss_1 = criterion_1(y_pred_1, y_true_1)
    loss_2 = criterion_2(y_pred_2, y_true_2)

    # Combine losses with weights
    total_loss = loss_weight_1 * loss_1 + loss_weight_2 * loss_2

    # Backpropagation
    total_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Total Loss: {total_loss.item()}")
```

Here, we have modified the architecture such that the model outputs two sets of predictions. This allows two loss functions to be computed from this model. `loss_weight_1` and `loss_weight_2` directly influence the contribution of each loss towards the overall optimization. Setting these weights requires careful tuning and depends heavily on the specific problem, requiring experimentation and analysis of results.  This weighting approach helps emphasize particular aspects of the model's performance and can be extremely powerful in achieving a more balanced training regime. For example, if one loss tends to dominate the gradient updates, reducing its weight can mitigate this effect.

Finally, another common practice, particularly in multi-task learning scenarios, involves not just scalar multiplication but potentially more complex operations between the different losses. In many practical settings, the losses may have different scales or units, and combining them with simple summation or weighting may not be optimal. Scaling or normalizing the individual losses before combining them often improves training stability and convergence:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size_1, output_size_2):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2_1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size_1)
        self.fc2_2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size_2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        output_1 = self.fc2_1(x)
        output_2 = self.fc2_2(x)
        return output_1, output_2

# Example Data
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size_1 = 5
output_size_2 = 2
batch_size = 32
x = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
y_true_1 = torch.randn(batch_size, output_size_1)
y_true_2 = torch.randint(0, 2, (batch_size,)).long()

# Initialize Model, Loss, and Optimizer
model = MyModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size_1, output_size_2)
criterion_1 = nn.MSELoss()
criterion_2 = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred_1, y_pred_2 = model(x)

    # Compute individual losses
    loss_1 = criterion_1(y_pred_1, y_true_1)
    loss_2 = criterion_2(y_pred_2, y_true_2)

    # Normalize losses using a simple example (other more complex normalizations might be needed)
    loss_1_normalized = loss_1 / torch.mean(loss_1)
    loss_2_normalized = loss_2 / torch.mean(loss_2)

    # Combine normalized losses (e.g. equally weighted)
    total_loss = 0.5 * loss_1_normalized + 0.5 * loss_2_normalized

    # Backpropagation
    total_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Total Loss: {total_loss.item()}")
```

In this more advanced case, the losses are divided by their respective means for normalization. While this is a rather simplistic approach to normalization, it helps to demonstrate that simply adding or even weighting losses may not always be sufficient. Other common normalizations might involve dividing by the variance, or the use of more sophisticated gradient balancing techniques. The core concept, however, remains that backpropagation occurs only on the aggregated single scalar loss value.

In summation, backpropagating multiple losses in PyTorch requires combining those losses into a single scalar. The choice of how to combine them—simple addition, weighted summation, normalization— profoundly impacts the training outcome and requires thorough experimentation.  For further exploration of loss function combinations, I recommend reading research papers in multi-task learning, specifically papers related to dynamic weighting and gradient balancing. Exploring techniques in optimizing non-convex objective functions, as well as reading PyTorch documentation on loss functions, would be useful. Texts focusing on stochastic gradient descent, including modifications such as Adam, also contribute to a deeper understanding of how gradient backpropagation and model weights interplay.
