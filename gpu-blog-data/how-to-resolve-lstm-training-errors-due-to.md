The root cause of LSTM predictions exceeding 1, assuming a task requiring bounded output (e.g., probability prediction), often stems from the absence of a suitable output activation function.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in financial time series forecasting has shown that this oversight frequently leads to instability during training and inaccurate, unbounded predictions.  The LSTM's inherent ability to capture long-range dependencies doesn't preclude the need for a final layer specifically designed to constrain the output.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

LSTMs, powerful recurrent neural networks, excel at processing sequential data. However, their internal architecture doesn't intrinsically enforce output bounds.  The final layer's output, before any activation function is applied, is a raw, unconstrained value. This means the network can, and often will, generate predictions far exceeding the desired range (e.g., probabilities beyond [0, 1]).  To address this, a suitable activation function must be applied to the output layer. The choice depends on the specific problem; for probability predictions, a sigmoid function is almost always necessary.  For other bounded ranges, other functions like tanh (for [-1, 1]) or a custom function might be more appropriate.  Failure to include an appropriate activation function is the most common reason for predictions surpassing the specified bounds.  Furthermore, improper scaling of input data can indirectly contribute to this issue; overly large input values can lead to internal network activations that amplify the unbounded output problem.

Another potential source of error lies in the loss function. While not directly causing predictions outside the [0, 1] range, an unsuitable loss function can hinder the network's ability to learn the correct mappings and exacerbate the effect of unbound outputs.  For probability predictions, binary cross-entropy or categorical cross-entropy are the standard choices, penalizing predictions far from the true values.  Using a mean squared error (MSE) function, for instance, might appear suitable at first glance, but it doesn't explicitly account for the probability constraints and can lead to slower convergence and less accurate bounded predictions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sigmoid Activation for Probability Prediction (Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Sigmoid activation for probability
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training code ...
```

This Keras example showcases a simple LSTM model designed for binary classification. The crucial element here is the `activation='sigmoid'` argument within the `Dense` layer.  The sigmoid function ensures that the output is always between 0 and 1, representing a probability. The `binary_crossentropy` loss function complements the sigmoid activation, ensuring that the network learns to optimize for probability estimates.


**Example 2:  Handling Multi-Class Probability (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1) #Softmax for multi-class probabilities

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) #Take the last hidden state
        out = self.softmax(out)
        return out

model = LSTMModel(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() #Appropriate loss function for multi-class classification
#... training code ...
```

This PyTorch example demonstrates an LSTM model for multi-class classification.  The `nn.Softmax` function is crucial; it transforms the raw output of the linear layer into a probability distribution over multiple classes, ensuring the outputs sum to 1. The use of `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` as the loss function is critical for optimizing the model given a probability distribution target.  Note that we take the last hidden state from the LSTM output; the choice of how to aggregate LSTM's time-series output depends on the specific task.


**Example 3: Custom Bounded Output (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_activation(x):
  return tf.clip_by_value(x, -1, 1) #Example: Bound output between -1 and 1

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=custom_activation)
])
#... training code ...
```

This example illustrates the flexibility of Keras. A custom activation function is defined using `tf.clip_by_value` to constrain the output between -1 and 1. This approach allows for greater control over the output range, accommodating situations beyond the standard sigmoid or tanh limitations.  The choice of loss function should adapt to this new output range.  MSE might be a suitable choice here.
