The core distinction between `tf.keras.Sequential` and `tf.keras.Model` in TensorFlow lies in their architectural flexibility and the manner in which they define the computational graph. `Sequential` models are inherently linear stacks of layers, suitable for simpler, feedforward networks, while `Model` provides the capability to construct arbitrarily complex, multi-input, multi-output models with shared layers and non-linear connectivity.

In my experience, the limitations of `Sequential` models become apparent when implementing architectures beyond simple classification or regression tasks. For instance, attempting to construct a U-Net or a residual network using only `Sequential` would be exceptionally cumbersome, if not impossible, due to their inherent non-sequential branching and merging of information flow. The simplicity of `Sequential` is its strength, but that simplicity translates to a lack of expressiveness for more intricate topologies.

Specifically, a `tf.keras.Sequential` model is built by passing a list of layers to its constructor. These layers are then connected sequentially, with the output of one layer becoming the input of the next. There is no explicit definition of input or output tensors; they are implicitly defined by the order of the layers. This approach makes rapid prototyping and building basic networks straightforward. However, because each layer implicitly connects to the previous layer only, complex architectures that leverage shortcut connections, multi-source inputs, or varied output structures are not naturally achievable using this paradigm. `Sequential` models are fundamentally limited to a single input and a single output chain.

The `tf.keras.Model`, on the other hand, offers a more programmatic and flexible interface. I conceptualize this as more of a directed acyclic graph definition rather than a simple linear stack. This allows us to define any architecture achievable with tensor manipulation within the TensorFlow framework. This flexibility allows, for example, the creation of arbitrarily complex networks including those with multiple inputs, multiple outputs, skip connections, and layer reuse (shared weights). Building a model using the functional API, which is used to define a `tf.keras.Model`, requires explicitly connecting layers by passing the output tensors of one layer as the input tensors of subsequent layers. This level of control allows the creation of arbitrary directed acyclic graphs, offering unparalleled flexibility in model design. This contrasts sharply with the implicitly defined flow in `Sequential` models.

The advantage of using `tf.keras.Model` and the functional API, while requiring more upfront code, is that the architecture is explicitly specified. This makes the model easier to understand, debug, and maintain especially for non-trivial architectures. The ability to explicitly pass tensors between layers enables layer reuse, weight sharing and complex topologies, which are impossible with `Sequential`.

To illustrate these differences, consider these three code examples:

**Example 1: A Simple Feedforward Network Using `Sequential`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Using Sequential to define a simple classifier.
model_sequential = tf.keras.Sequential([
  layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)), # Input layer
  layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Output layer
])

# Print the model summary.
model_sequential.summary()
```

This code constructs a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. The `input_shape` parameter is defined in the first layer, which automatically creates the input tensor for the model. Subsequent layers do not need input tensor definitions since they connect directly to the preceding layer. The simplicity of `Sequential` is clear, making it ideal for simple tasks. The `summary()` method provides details about the number of parameters in each layer.

**Example 2: A Multi-Input Network Using `Model` (Functional API)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Input layers
input_a = tf.keras.Input(shape=(32,), name="input_a")
input_b = tf.keras.Input(shape=(64,), name="input_b")

# Processing branches.
dense_a = layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(input_a)
dense_b = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(input_b)

# Concatenate layer outputs.
concat = layers.concatenate([dense_a, dense_b])

# Output layer.
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(concat)

# Model definition.
model_functional = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)

# Print the model summary.
model_functional.summary()
```

This example demonstrates the power of the functional API and how it is used to construct a `tf.keras.Model`. We define two input layers, each with a specified shape. We then process each input through dedicated `Dense` layers before concatenating the outputs. Finally, a single output layer is defined. Crucially, the connections are explicitly defined, making it easy to specify arbitrary input and output flows within the model. Note the use of `tf.keras.Input`, which defines a symbolic input tensor that can be passed as input to other layers. The `tf.keras.Model` is then constructed by specifying the list of input tensors and output tensors, thereby fully defining the data flow within the model. The summary method also reflects the multi-input and more complex flow of this example, which is not possible with `Sequential`.

**Example 3: A Model with Shared Layers Using `Model` (Functional API)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Input layer.
input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(128,), name="input")

# Shared dense layer.
shared_dense = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')

# Processing branches using the shared layer.
branch_1 = shared_dense(input_layer)
branch_2 = shared_dense(input_layer)

# Further processing.
dense_1 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(branch_1)
dense_2 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(branch_2)

# Output layer.
output_1 = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense_1)
output_2 = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense_2)

# Model definition.
model_shared = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output_1, output_2])

# Print the model summary.
model_shared.summary()
```

This example illustrates how shared layers can be implemented with the `tf.keras.Model`.  Here, the `Dense` layer named `shared_dense` is created as a separate object. This shared layer is then used by multiple branches of the network. This kind of weight sharing is a powerful feature that allows for efficient parameter usage in multi-branched models. Note that both branches receive the same input layer via the shared dense layer. This pattern is impossible to achieve directly using a `Sequential` model and highlights the control of layer connections that is fundamental to the functional API approach.  The model has a single input and two output layers, a common scenario for tasks like multi-objective learning.

In summary, the choice between `Sequential` and `Model` depends on the architectural complexity required. `Sequential` is preferred for prototyping and building simple models, while `Model` provides the flexibility necessary to construct sophisticated neural network architectures.  I consider the transition to the `Model` API as a critical step in moving beyond introductory use of Keras. The flexibility this functional style provides unlocks true architectural freedom.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing TensorFlow's official documentation and tutorials, especially those covering the functional API. In addition, numerous books and online resources focus on advanced neural network architectures, which heavily employ the capabilities of `tf.keras.Model`. Studying established architectures like ResNets or Transformers provides excellent practical context for understanding the utility of functional style models. Exploring these resources, with emphasis on both fundamental concepts and concrete implementations, should solidify the differences between these two core approaches to model building in Keras.
