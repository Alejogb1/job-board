The effectiveness of pooling XLNet/BERT sequence outputs hinges critically on the nuanced weighting scheme employed.  Simply averaging the hidden states ignores the inherent variability in token importance within a given sequence.  Over my years developing NLP models for sentiment analysis and question answering, I've found that a weighted average, informed by attention mechanisms or learned importance scores, yields significantly superior performance compared to straightforward averaging.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Weighted averaging of XLNet/BERT outputs involves calculating a single vector representation by assigning different weights to each hidden state in the sequence.  This contrasts with simple averaging, which treats all tokens equally.  The weights themselves can be derived in several ways.  One approach leverages the attention mechanism inherent in the transformer architecture.  The attention weights, which represent the importance of each word in relation to other words in the sequence, can be directly used as weights for the weighted average. This method implicitly captures contextual relationships between words.

Alternatively, a separate learned weighting mechanism can be introduced. This can be a simple feed-forward neural network taking the entire sequence of hidden states as input and outputting a weight vector. This method allows for a more flexible and potentially more powerful weighting scheme than directly utilizing attention weights.  The complexity of this network can be adjusted to prevent overfitting and to improve generalizability.  Another approach would involve designing a specialized network layer, trained alongside the base model, that directly learns positional embeddings which encode importance. These embeddings, potentially fed into a softmax function to ensure appropriate normalization, then serve as the weights in the pooling process.

In all cases, the weighted average is computed as follows:

`pooled_vector = Σᵢ (wᵢ * hᵢ)`

where:

* `pooled_vector` is the resulting single vector representation.
* `wᵢ` is the weight assigned to the i-th hidden state.
* `hᵢ` is the i-th hidden state vector from the XLNet/BERT output.
* `Σᵢ` denotes the summation over all hidden states (tokens) in the sequence.


Crucially, the weights `wᵢ` should sum to one (or be normalized to sum to one) to maintain consistent scaling and prevent the pooled vector from becoming arbitrarily large or small.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Attention-based Weighting**

```python
import torch

def attention_pooling(hidden_states, attention_weights):
    """Pools hidden states using attention weights.

    Args:
        hidden_states: Tensor of shape (sequence_length, hidden_dim).
        attention_weights: Tensor of shape (sequence_length,).  Should sum to approximately 1.

    Returns:
        Tensor of shape (hidden_dim,).
    """
    # Normalize attention weights to ensure they sum to 1
    attention_weights = attention_weights / torch.sum(attention_weights)
    pooled_vector = torch.matmul(attention_weights.unsqueeze(1), hidden_states).squeeze(1)
    return pooled_vector

# Example usage: (Assuming you have access to 'hidden_states' and 'attention_weights' from your XLNet/BERT model)
pooled_vector = attention_pooling(hidden_states, attention_weights)
```

This example directly utilizes the attention weights produced by the transformer model as weights for the weighted average.  It's a simple and efficient method, leveraging information already computed by the model.  However, it might be limited by the attention mechanism's inherent biases.

**Example 2: Learned Weighting with a Feed-Forward Network**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class WeightingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(WeightingNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        x = torch.mean(hidden_states, dim=0)  # Pooling to reduce dimensionality
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        weights = self.softmax(self.fc2(x)) #Ensure weights are normalized
        return weights.squeeze(1)

# Example usage:
weighting_network = WeightingNetwork(input_dim=768, hidden_dim=256) #Example dimensions
weights = weighting_network(hidden_states)
pooled_vector = torch.matmul(weights.unsqueeze(1), hidden_states).squeeze(1)

```

This approach introduces a learnable weighting mechanism. The feed-forward network learns to assign weights based on the overall context of the input sequence.  The mean pooling step reduces the dimensionality before feeding to the network.  The `softmax` function guarantees weights are normalized.  The network's architecture (number of layers, hidden units) is a hyperparameter to be tuned.


**Example 3:  Positional Embeddings for Weighting**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PositionalWeighting(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, seq_len, hidden_dim):
        super(PositionalWeighting, self).__init__()
        self.positional_embeddings = nn.Embedding(seq_len, hidden_dim)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=0)

    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        positions = torch.arange(hidden_states.shape[0])
        weights = self.linear(self.positional_embeddings(positions)).squeeze(1)
        weights = self.softmax(weights)
        pooled_vector = torch.matmul(weights.unsqueeze(1), hidden_states).squeeze(1)
        return pooled_vector


positional_weighting = PositionalWeighting(seq_len=512, hidden_dim=768)
pooled_vector = positional_weighting(hidden_states)
```

Here, the model learns separate positional embeddings. These embeddings represent the importance of each position independently.  A linear layer and a softmax function transform these embeddings into normalized weights. This offers a more direct method to learn position-specific importance than utilizing attention weights directly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of attention mechanisms, I recommend consulting the original Transformer paper and subsequent works exploring attention variations.  A comprehensive text on deep learning, covering recurrent and attention-based models, will provide broader context.  Finally, studying papers specifically addressing sentence embeddings and text classification with BERT/XLNet will offer practical insights and advanced techniques.  Exploring various pooling strategies within these papers will prove beneficial.  Understanding the nuances of  softmax activation functions and their impact on weight normalization is also crucial.
