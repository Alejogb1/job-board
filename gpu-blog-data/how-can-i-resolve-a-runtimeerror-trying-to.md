The core issue behind the `RuntimeError: Trying to eval in EAGER mode with a custom learning rate` arises from a fundamental mismatch between how TensorFlow's Eager Execution operates and how custom learning rates are typically managed when employing `tf.keras.Model.fit()`. Specifically, when you attempt to utilize a custom learning rate defined outside of the `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` context, especially within a training loop constructed in Eager mode, the backpropagation process encounters inconsistencies. This occurs because `fit()` expects a fixed optimizer state and learning rate during an evaluation phase (e.g., when calculating validation metrics), but the custom learning rate may be changing dynamically within the provided code.

In TensorFlow, `tf.keras.Model.fit()` leverages a pre-configured optimizer to handle gradient application, including adjusting parameters based on a potentially dynamic learning rate. When a learning rate is controlled *outside* of the optimizer—perhaps using a manual update within a training loop—the `fit()` method's internal evaluation processes don't have a mechanism to account for these manual adjustments. It expects the optimizer to maintain state, which it does not if you are using code like `opt.lr = new_lr` directly in the training loop. The error surfaces when the validation phase is initiated by `fit()` and tries to 'evaluate' (calculate validation metrics). Because the optimizer's internal state isn't prepared for the dynamic learning rate, the framework throws an error, attempting to evaluate the model without the necessary optimizer information.

To illustrate and clarify, let's consider a scenario where I previously attempted to implement a custom cyclical learning rate scheduler. I was using a simplistic approach, modifying the learning rate attribute of an optimizer directly within the training loop. This produced the exact `RuntimeError` referenced. Here’s a problematic code snippet representative of the incorrect method:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data and model
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

epochs = 5
batches_per_epoch = 10

for epoch in range(epochs):
  for batch in range(batches_per_epoch):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        batch_idx = batch * 10
        logits = model(X_train[batch_idx:batch_idx+10])
        loss = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()(y_train[batch_idx:batch_idx+10, None], logits)
      grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      
      # Incorrect dynamic LR application
      new_lr = 0.005 + 0.005 * np.cos(epoch + batch/batches_per_epoch)
      optimizer.learning_rate.assign(new_lr) 
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
  
  # Validation will fail with this setup
  history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, verbose=0) 
  print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {history.history['loss'][0]}")

```

In this example, I am manually updating the `optimizer.learning_rate` attribute within the training loop. This modification, while it does adjust the learning rate for the current training step, bypasses the internal mechanisms of the `fit()` function. Consequently, when `fit()` is called for the validation step, it attempts to use the optimizer with an out-of-sync state that hasn’t been preserved properly between the training loop's manual update and the validation procedure.

The resolution lies in implementing dynamic learning rates via TensorFlow's built-in `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules` or by using a `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler`.  These options enable the learning rate to change within the optimizer's internal calculations, allowing `fit()` to perform its validation steps correctly. Here’s an example using `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data and model as before
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Learning rate schedule
initial_learning_rate = 0.01
decay_steps = 10 # Number of steps where the learning rate will decay over time
decay_rate = 0.96 # Factor by which the LR will decay
learning_rate_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate, decay_steps, decay_rate
)

# Optimizer with scheduler
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate_schedule)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training using the model.fit method
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=1)

```

In this revised example, the learning rate is no longer manually manipulated within the training loop. Instead, an `ExponentialDecay` schedule is defined using `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules` and passed as the `learning_rate` parameter to the `Adam` optimizer. The optimizer now manages the dynamic updates to the learning rate, making the internal states consistent and allowing validation during training to proceed seamlessly.

A second viable approach, useful for more intricate scheduling patterns, is to use `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler`. Here's an example showcasing how I’d define and integrate a custom learning rate schedule using a callback:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data and model as before
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# Custom Learning rate schedule via Callback
def step_decay(epoch):
  initial_lrate = 0.01
  drop = 0.5
  epochs_drop = 2.0
  lrate = initial_lrate * np.power(drop, np.floor((1+epoch)/epochs_drop))
  return lrate

# Create the Callback
lr_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(step_decay)


# Optimizer with initial learning rate (important for callbacks)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training using the model.fit method with callback
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=1, callbacks=[lr_callback])

```

In this example, the `step_decay` function defines the custom learning rate schedule.  The `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler` applies the defined function to the optimizer's learning rate before each training epoch begins, ensuring that the optimizer's state is always consistent before validation steps within `fit()`. This encapsulates the dynamic learning rate management within the `tf.keras` framework, thereby eliminating the `RuntimeError`.

In summary, the error arises from modifying the optimizer's learning rate directly within the training loop. The resolution is to employ either built-in `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules` or `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler` to manage learning rate dynamics properly. When used correctly, `fit()`’s evaluation process works as expected, as the underlying optimizer state is kept in sync by these mechanisms.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing the TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections detailing `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules` and `tf.keras.callbacks`. In addition, resources that delve into the specifics of Eager Execution and optimizer state management can be valuable. Numerous online tutorials and educational courses also present various examples of learning rate scheduling within the `tf.keras` framework, which are highly beneficial for gaining practical experience. Finally, examining the source code of `tf.keras.Model.fit` could reveal the internal processes where the error surfaces, aiding in developing a deeper understanding of the issue.
