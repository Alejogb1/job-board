CUDA kernel launch times, specifically the time elapsed between the CPU-side function call that launches a kernel and the actual execution of that kernel on the GPU, are not directly measurable using standard CUDA API calls during kernel execution itself. This is because kernel code runs asynchronously on the GPU, separate from the CPU thread that initiated it. Measuring this requires specific techniques involving CUDA events, timing markers, and careful consideration of CPU-GPU synchronization.

The core challenge lies in the asynchronous nature of CUDA programming. When you call a kernel launch, the CPU thread hands off the task to the GPU and continues execution. The kernel itself may not begin execution immediately, depending on the GPU scheduler, other queued tasks, and the overall system load. This delay is critical to understand because it contributes to the perceived latency of your CUDA application. Naively using CPU-side timers to wrap the kernel launch API call will capture much more than just the launch time, including the overhead of the CPU-side function call, the time it takes for the GPU command to be created and submitted to the queue, and potentially even other unrelated CPU activities.

To accurately isolate the launch time, we must utilize CUDA events. These events are lightweight timestamps that can be inserted into the GPU command stream. We can record the time immediately *before* the kernel launch, and then record another timestamp *after* the kernel begins execution on the GPU, by placing an event right before the kernel itself begins processing. The difference between these timestamps provides the accurate launch time.

Let’s illustrate this with code. Suppose we are performing a simple vector addition, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are float arrays of size 'N'.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    const int N = 1024 * 1024; // Large vector size
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
    float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;

    // Allocate host memory
    h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
    h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
    h_C = (float*)malloc(size);

    // Initialize host arrays (omitted for brevity)

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size);

    // Copy data to device (omitted for brevity)

    // Setup Grid and Block Dimension
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;

    cudaEvent_t start, end;
    float elapsedTime;

    // Create the start and end events
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&end);

    // Record the start event
    cudaEventRecord(start, 0);

    // Launch the kernel
    vectorAdd<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);

    // Record the end event
    cudaEventRecord(end, 0);

    // Synchronize the CPU to make sure all operations finished
    cudaEventSynchronize(end);

    // Calculate the elapsed time
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, end);

    std::cout << "Kernel Launch Time: " << elapsedTime << " ms" << std::endl;

    // Cleanup (omitted for brevity)
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(end);
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);
    free(h_A);
    free(h_B);
    free(h_C);
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses `cudaEventCreate`, `cudaEventRecord`, `cudaEventSynchronize`, and `cudaEventElapsedTime` to accurately measure the time between the CPU call to launch the kernel, and the completion of the work on the GPU. The key is that `cudaEventRecord` inserts a marker into the GPU command stream, allowing the GPU to track the time of these events. By calling `cudaEventSynchronize`, we force the CPU to wait until the GPU has reached the 'end' event, thus ensuring our timing data is valid.

However, this example is not without its caveats. `cudaEventSynchronize` will halt the CPU thread until the GPU completes all work. If the goal is to measure the launch time only and not necessarily wait for all the work on the GPU to complete before moving forward, a second version is required.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N, cudaEvent_t start_event) {
    cudaEventRecord(start_event, 0);
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }
}

int main() {
  const int N = 1024 * 1024; // Large vector size
  size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
  float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
  float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;

  // Allocate host memory
  h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
  h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
  h_C = (float*)malloc(size);

  // Initialize host arrays (omitted for brevity)

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size);

  // Copy data to device (omitted for brevity)

  // Setup Grid and Block Dimension
  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;

  cudaEvent_t start, end;
  float elapsedTime;

  // Create the start and end events
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&end);

    // Record the start event
  cudaEventRecord(start, 0);

    // Launch the kernel
    vectorAdd<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N, end);

    cudaEventSynchronize(end);

    cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, end);

    std::cout << "Kernel Launch Time: " << elapsedTime << " ms" << std::endl;

  // Cleanup (omitted for brevity)
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(end);
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);
    free(h_A);
    free(h_B);
    free(h_C);
  return 0;
}
```

In this modified version, the `cudaEventRecord` call for the 'end' event has been moved to the start of the kernel code. Now, the ‘start’ event is recorded right before the kernel is launched, and then the 'end' event is recorded within the kernel as the very first operation. This provides us with the time elapsed between launching the kernel, and the kernel beginning execution, thus isolating the kernel launch time.

Finally, a critical aspect often overlooked is that the first kernel launch after an application initializes tends to be significantly slower. This is often attributed to driver initialization, GPU context creation, and memory allocations that can occur on the first kernel launch. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a 'warm-up' kernel launch, or at least be cognizant of this effect when measuring kernel launch times. To illustrate this, I'll add a quick "warm-up" launch to the previous example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N, cudaEvent_t start_event) {
    cudaEventRecord(start_event, 0);
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }
}

int main() {
  const int N = 1024 * 1024; // Large vector size
  size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
  float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
  float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;

  // Allocate host memory
  h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
  h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
  h_C = (float*)malloc(size);

  // Initialize host arrays (omitted for brevity)

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size);

  // Copy data to device (omitted for brevity)

  // Setup Grid and Block Dimension
  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (N + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;

  cudaEvent_t start, end;
  float elapsedTime;

  // Create the start and end events
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&end);

    // Warmup Kernel Launch (without timing)
    vectorAdd<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N, end);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // Record the start event
  cudaEventRecord(start, 0);

    // Launch the kernel
    vectorAdd<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N, end);

    cudaEventSynchronize(end);

    cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, end);

    std::cout << "Kernel Launch Time: " << elapsedTime << " ms" << std::endl;

  // Cleanup (omitted for brevity)
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(end);
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);
    free(h_A);
    free(h_B);
    free(h_C);
  return 0;
}
```

In this version, the vector addition kernel is launched and synchronized *before* any timing occurs. The first launch is used to initialize the hardware and driver.  The results of subsequent launches will now more accurately reflect the actual time taken to launch a kernel and allow for meaningful performance analysis.

For more in-depth understanding and best practices, consult the CUDA programming guide and the CUDA runtime API documentation. Specific books or online resources dedicated to high-performance GPU computing provide comprehensive explanations of kernel timing and CUDA optimization techniques. Additionally, exploring sample code within the NVIDIA CUDA SDK can be beneficial for practical examples of event-based timing. Studying profiling tools, such as the NVIDIA Nsight tools suite, can also offer deeper insights into GPU performance characteristics, although they provide different metrics than direct launch time measurements.
