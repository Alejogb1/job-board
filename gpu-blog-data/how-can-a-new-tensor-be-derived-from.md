The challenge in deriving a new tensor from an existing one using 2D indices stems from the dimensionality difference between the source tensor's data structure and the 2D index structure. The source tensor, potentially multi-dimensional, stores data contiguously, while 2D indices represent positions in a two-dimensional space. Efficiently mapping the 2D index positions to the potentially scattered data locations in the source tensor requires careful construction of the index lookup mechanism. My experience in implementing custom data transformations for high-performance deep learning pipelines has revealed this is a critical, performance-sensitive operation, where improper handling can lead to significant bottlenecks.

Fundamentally, the process involves using the 2D indices to select elements from the source tensor. This can be conceptualized as a gathering operation, where the 2D index array provides the coordinates for selecting the elements. The key is to translate the provided 2D indices into the appropriate flat index that would access the desired location in the flattened version of the source tensor, regardless of its shape. This process typically involves calculating an offset based on the provided 2D coordinates and the strides of the source tensor. Strides represent the number of elements you need to jump in memory to reach the next element along a particular dimension. Calculating strides is critical to efficient tensor indexing.

Here's how this can be achieved in Python using NumPy. Assume we have a source tensor and a tensor containing 2D indices:

```python
import numpy as np

def extract_from_tensor(source_tensor, indices):
    """
    Extracts elements from a source tensor using a 2D index tensor.

    Args:
      source_tensor: A NumPy array (the source tensor).
      indices: A NumPy array of shape (N, 2), where N is the number of
        elements to extract. Each row contains a 2D index (row, col).

    Returns:
      A NumPy array containing the extracted elements.
    """

    rows, cols = indices[:, 0], indices[:, 1]
    return source_tensor[rows, cols]


# Example Usage 1: 2D source tensor
source_tensor_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                            [4, 5, 6],
                            [7, 8, 9]])

index_tensor_2d = np.array([[0, 0],
                           [1, 2],
                           [2, 1]])

extracted_2d = extract_from_tensor(source_tensor_2d, index_tensor_2d)
print(f"Extracted elements from 2D tensor: {extracted_2d}")
# Output: Extracted elements from 2D tensor: [1 6 8]

# Example Usage 2: 3D source tensor
source_tensor_3d = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
index_tensor_3d = np.array([[0, 1],
                           [1, 2],
                           [0, 3]])

# Reshape to work for the function
modified_3d_indices = np.array([[index_tensor_3d[i,0], index_tensor_3d[i,1], 0] for i in range(index_tensor_3d.shape[0])])

# Apply the indexing operation to the first two dimensions of the tensor
extracted_3d = source_tensor_3d[modified_3d_indices[:,0],modified_3d_indices[:,1], modified_3d_indices[:,2]]
print(f"Extracted elements from 3D tensor: {extracted_3d}")
# Output: Extracted elements from 3D tensor: [ 4 22 12]
```

In Example 1, the `extract_from_tensor` function directly applies NumPyâ€™s advanced indexing functionality. Given a 2D source tensor, we simply provide the row and column arrays extracted from the `indices` array, and NumPy efficiently fetches the values at these locations.  This showcases the direct mapping of 2D indices to a 2D tensor.

Example 2 demonstrates the use of similar logic with a 3D source tensor. The function remains the same, emphasizing its reusability. However, we must modify the index tensor to accommodate the third dimension. I have assumed that the third coordinate for the tensor is 0, for this example to work correctly, and have modified `index_tensor_3d` accordingly. If the third coordinate is not 0, then it needs to be correctly passed to the index tensor, and a modified logic that caters to this needs to be written. We then use the same advanced indexing mechanism, accessing the specific points in the tensor.  This demonstrates the flexibility of the core indexing logic as long as the dimensions are taken care of.

Now, consider a more complex scenario where the 2D indices specify locations within slices of a higher dimensional tensor.  Assume we have a source tensor with shape (5, 4, 3, 2) where the first two dimensions represent a spatial grid. We want to extract data from specific spatial locations across all channels and batch dimensions.  The function above does not work here, as it is designed for extracting data from the first two dimensions only. This requires a function that is aware of the shape of the tensor.

```python
def extract_from_tensor_higher_dim(source_tensor, spatial_indices):
  """
    Extracts elements from a source tensor using spatial indices, keeping other dimensions intact.

    Args:
      source_tensor: A NumPy array (the source tensor).
      spatial_indices: A NumPy array of shape (N, 2) where each row is a 2D index.

    Returns:
      A NumPy array containing the extracted elements.
  """
  num_spatial_indices = spatial_indices.shape[0]
  num_batches = source_tensor.shape[0]
  num_channels = source_tensor.shape[3]
  
  # Create full index array for extraction
  full_indices = []
  for b in range(num_batches):
    for c in range(num_channels):
      for i in range(num_spatial_indices):
        row, col = spatial_indices[i]
        full_indices.append([b,row,col,c])
  full_indices = np.array(full_indices)
  
  # Perform extraction
  extracted_elements = source_tensor[full_indices[:,0],full_indices[:,1],full_indices[:,2],full_indices[:,3]]

  # Reshape to return shape that preserves batch and channel dimensions
  extracted_elements = extracted_elements.reshape(num_batches, num_spatial_indices, num_channels)

  return extracted_elements
  
#Example Usage 3: Higher Dimensional Tensor
source_tensor_higher_dim = np.arange(5*4*3*2).reshape(5,4,3,2)
spatial_index_tensor = np.array([[0, 0],
                                 [1, 2],
                                 [3, 1]])

extracted_higher_dim = extract_from_tensor_higher_dim(source_tensor_higher_dim,spatial_index_tensor)
print(f"Extracted elements from higher dimensional tensor, shape {extracted_higher_dim.shape}:\n{extracted_higher_dim}")
#Output (truncated for clarity): Extracted elements from higher dimensional tensor, shape (5, 3, 2):
#[[[ 0  1]
#  [17 18]
#  [29 30]]

# [[ 48  49]
#  [65  66]
#  [77  78]]

# [[ 96  97]
#  [113 114]
#  [125 126]]

# [[144 145]
#  [161 162]
#  [173 174]]

# [[192 193]
#  [209 210]
#  [221 222]]]
```

In Example 3, the function `extract_from_tensor_higher_dim` explicitly handles higher dimensional tensors. It iterates through each batch and channel, applies the same 2D index extraction logic across all dimensions. In the function, I have chosen to preserve the batch and channel dimensions. The function then reshapes the output, which preserves the desired dimensions. I found this to be a generally useful pattern in my work when dealing with images or feature maps in deep learning tasks.

While NumPy provides efficient implementations, understanding the underlying index calculation is crucial for optimizing performance and adapting the code for different scenarios, such as distributed computations or cases where NumPy indexing is not directly applicable. Further optimization could involve vectorizing the index calculations to reduce the overhead of the for loop and leveraging libraries like Numba for JIT compilation.

For further exploration of tensor manipulation and indexing techniques, I suggest consulting resources like the official NumPy documentation for a thorough understanding of array indexing and manipulation. Also, exploring the documentation for deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, specifically the tensor indexing operations they provide, can be highly beneficial. Finally, materials covering topics like linear algebra and matrix calculations can often provide further understanding of these operations. These materials will provide a foundational understanding for designing efficient tensor manipulation algorithms.
