The discrepancy between the TensorFlow version reported within a Jupyter Notebook and the version ostensibly installed within a conda environment is a common source of confusion, often stemming from the notebook's kernel selection.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during large-scale model training and deployment projects, leading to subtle but significant errors if not carefully addressed.  The Jupyter Notebook doesn't inherently *know* what TensorFlow version is installed in your conda environment; it relies on the kernel it's connected to.

1. **Explanation:**  A Jupyter Notebook operates by connecting to a kernel—essentially, a separate process that executes the code.  Your conda environment creates isolated Python installations.  If your notebook isn't configured to use the kernel associated with your desired conda environment, it will utilize a different Python interpreter, potentially one with a different TensorFlow version (or no TensorFlow at all). This difference arises from the way Jupyter manages kernels and how conda environments create isolated spaces.  A common scenario is having a system-wide Python installation (often the default), which might contain an older TensorFlow version, while your conda environment holds a newer one.  The notebook will reflect the TensorFlow version within its currently active kernel, not necessarily the one you intend to use.

2. **Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Identifying Active Kernel and its TensorFlow Version:**

```python
import sys
import tensorflow as tf

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"Current Kernel: {sys.executable}")
```

This simple script prints the Python version, the TensorFlow version (if installed within the active kernel), and the path to the Python executable currently running the kernel. This information directly clarifies which Python environment and, by extension, which TensorFlow version, the notebook is currently using.  I've used this countless times to debug unexpected version conflicts, pinpointing the mismatch between intended and active environments. Note that if TensorFlow isn't installed in the kernel, an `ImportError` will occur.

**Example 2:  Listing Available Kernels:**

```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

This command, executed in your terminal (not within the notebook), provides a list of all registered Jupyter kernels. Each kernel is associated with a specific Python environment.  This allows you to verify if the kernel connected to your notebook corresponds to the conda environment containing your desired TensorFlow version. I often use this command to ensure that the correct kernel is available and its location aligns with the anticipated conda environment.  Discrepancies here often indicate an issue with kernel registration.

**Example 3:  Creating and Selecting a Conda Environment Kernel:**

```bash
# Create a conda environment (replace 'myenv' with your environment name)
conda create -n myenv python=3.9 tensorflow

# Install ipykernel within the new environment
conda activate myenv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name="Python (myenv)"

# In Jupyter Notebook: Select the 'Python (myenv)' kernel from the kernel menu.
```

This sequence demonstrates the process of creating a conda environment specifically for TensorFlow, installing the `ipykernel` package within it, registering the environment as a Jupyter kernel, and then selecting it in your notebook.  This ensures the notebook is utilizing the Python interpreter and associated TensorFlow version within the newly created conda environment.  This has been a crucial step in many of my projects where version control and reproducibility are paramount.  I’ve found this methodical approach avoids the confusion arising from multiple TensorFlow versions.

3. **Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official Jupyter documentation on kernels.  This provides comprehensive information about managing and selecting kernels.
*   The official conda documentation on environment management. This is essential for understanding the creation and isolation of Python environments.
*   A book on Python packaging and virtual environments.  Understanding these concepts is fundamental for effectively managing dependencies in a project and ensuring the stability and reproducibility of your work.  This extends beyond TensorFlow to any library or package you might use.


In summary, the perceived TensorFlow version discrepancy often arises from a mismatch between the Jupyter Notebook's active kernel and the conda environment's installation. By carefully examining the kernel, verifying its association with your intended conda environment, and using the provided code examples to confirm the active environment and TensorFlow version, one can effectively resolve this common issue.  Thorough environment management is paramount for reproducible and robust scientific computing.
