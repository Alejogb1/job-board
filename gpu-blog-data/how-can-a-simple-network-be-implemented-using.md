TensorFlow, at its core, provides the necessary computational tools for defining and training neural networks, even those of a simple structure. My experience from developing image classification models for a research project has frequently leveraged TensorFlow’s capacity for implementing these rudimentary networks. What may appear deceptively basic can be a crucial starting point for understanding more sophisticated architectures. Building a simple network in TensorFlow fundamentally involves defining a model architecture, selecting an optimization algorithm and a loss function, and then iteratively training this model using input data.

The core process comprises these key steps. First, the network’s architecture is constructed by stacking layers of computation, such as dense (fully connected) layers. Each layer's purpose is to transform the input data in a way that the model can learn patterns related to the given task. Next, a suitable optimization algorithm, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam, needs selection; this method dictates how the network weights are adjusted during training. Simultaneously, a loss function is chosen, which quantifies the discrepancy between the model’s prediction and the actual target value. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression tasks and categorical cross-entropy for classification tasks. Finally, through iterative training, the optimizer modifies the model's weights by calculating gradients of the loss function and updating them. This process, repeated across numerous data points, gradually improves the model's performance.

To illustrate, consider a simple linear regression model. This model will have a single dense layer, taking an input feature and producing a single output, and is trained to predict a numerical value based on that feature. Here is the TensorFlow code for implementing this linear regression model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# 1. Define the model architecture.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# 2. Choose optimizer and loss function.
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# 3. Generate dummy training data
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], dtype=float)
y_train = np.array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0], dtype=float)

# 4. Compile the model.
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)

# 5. Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# 6. Make a prediction
x_test = np.array([6.0])
prediction = model.predict(x_test)
print(f"Prediction for x=6: {prediction}")
```
This code first defines a sequential model, which is appropriate for layering in a simple fashion. It contains a single `Dense` layer which linearly transforms the input. The learning rate of the SGD optimizer, along with the `MeanSquaredError` loss function, are selected. We then generate dummy data that follows a linear relationship for training the model.  The `model.compile()` method finalizes the model and prepares it for training.  The `fit()` method then performs the training, iteratively improving the model. Lastly, a prediction is generated using the trained model, demonstrating its learnt relationship.

Let’s progress to a more complex case: a binary classification problem. For this, imagine categorizing items into two classes based on a single input feature. The model requires a sigmoid activation function in the final layer to provide a binary output. The `BinaryCrossentropy` loss function is used, as it is standard for binary classification tasks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# 1. Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=[1])
])

# 2. Choose optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# 3. Generate dummy training data
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0], dtype=float)
y_train = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=float)


# 4. Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])

# 5. Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=200)

# 6. Make predictions
x_test = np.array([3.5, 6.5])
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
print(f"Predictions for x=3.5 and x=6.5: {predictions}")
```

In this example, we incorporate the sigmoid activation function, which squashes the output to the range [0, 1], appropriate for a probability of belonging to one of the classes. We also leverage the Adam optimizer for more efficient training and use BinaryCrossentropy for measuring the classification loss. Training is then performed, with ‘accuracy’ tracked as a metric, providing a measure of performance beyond the loss. Predictions are generated, revealing how the model classifies new input data points.

Extending our concept further, consider a slightly more complex network. Let's introduce a hidden layer, which increases the model's capacity for learning nonlinear relationships. In this instance, the same binary classification task from the last example is approached by adding one `Dense` layer with `relu` activation, followed by a final `Dense` layer with `sigmoid` activation:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# 1. Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=8, activation='relu', input_shape=[1]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# 2. Choose optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# 3. Generate dummy training data
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0], dtype=float)
y_train = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=float)

# 4. Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])

# 5. Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=200)

# 6. Make predictions
x_test = np.array([3.5, 6.5])
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
print(f"Predictions for x=3.5 and x=6.5: {predictions}")

```

Here, the introduction of an intermediate dense layer with ReLU activation adds non-linearity, potentially allowing the model to learn more complex decision boundaries.  The remaining steps of optimization, loss calculation, training, and prediction follow a similar pattern. This demonstrates a straightforward manner to expand network capacity by adding layers.

For further understanding and exploration, I would recommend delving into several resources. First, the official TensorFlow documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to all aspects of the framework. Specifically, sections detailing layers (`tf.keras.layers`) and optimizers (`tf.keras.optimizers`) are particularly relevant for these examples. Secondly, “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron provides a good blend of theoretical grounding and practical implementation advice, which is especially useful for beginners. Lastly, the “Deep Learning” book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville offers a more in-depth treatment of theoretical concepts underpinning neural networks; this source is highly recommended for deeper understanding of these models and their training procedures. These texts provide valuable foundations for designing and interpreting the behavior of even simple neural networks.
