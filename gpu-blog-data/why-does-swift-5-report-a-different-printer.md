The discrepancy between the printer reported by Swift 5 and the expected printer often stems from the application's failure to properly interact with the system's print subsystem, specifically concerning the selection and management of the default printer.  In my experience debugging similar issues across various macOS and iOS projects, I've found that this frequently arises from neglecting the nuances of the `NSPrintInfo` class and its interaction with the system's print spooler.

**1. Explanation:**

Swift, through its Objective-C bridging, relies on the Foundation framework's printing capabilities.  The core class handling print information is `NSPrintInfo`. This class doesn't merely reflect the currently selected printer; it actively *participates* in defining the print job's parameters.  A common error is to assume `NSPrintInfo.shared` will always return the printer the user intends, disregarding that this may be overridden implicitly or explicitly within the application's printing logic.

Several factors can contribute to this mismatch:

* **Multiple Printers:** The system might have multiple printers installed, some possibly network-connected, each with varying capabilities.  The application needs to be precise in specifying which printer it wants to use.  A simple `NSPrintInfo.shared` might grab the system's *default* printer, which could differ from the user's recent selection in the system settings or another application.

* **Default Printer Changes:** The system default printer can be changed at any time, either manually by the user or programmatically by another application.  If the Swift application doesn't refresh its printer information dynamically, it might continue using an outdated reference.

* **Incorrect Print Job Configuration:**  `NSPrintInfo` allows customization of numerous aspects of the print job, including paper size, orientation, and color settings.  If these settings are incompatible with the selected printer, the system might silently choose a different, more compatible printer, leading to unexpected results.

* **Security Restrictions:** Depending on the system's security policies and the application's entitlements, access to certain printers might be restricted. This restriction could lead to the application defaulting to a different accessible printer without explicit notification.  This was a significant issue I faced when working on a print-heavy enterprise application requiring secure printer selection.

To avoid these issues, it is crucial to actively manage and verify `NSPrintInfo` before initiating a print operation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Explicit Printer Selection:**

```swift
import AppKit

func printDocument(document: NSData, printerName: String) {
    let printInfo = NSPrintInfo.shared
    if let printers = NSPrintInfo.shared.printers, let printer = printers.first(where: { $0.displayName == printerName }) {
        printInfo.printer = printer
    } else {
        print("Error: Printer '\(printerName)' not found.")
        return
    }

    let printOperation = NSPrintOperation(view: nil, printInfo: printInfo)
    printOperation.printInfo.dictionary[.NSPrintJobName] = "MyDocument" //Set job name
    printOperation.data = document
    printOperation.run()
}

// Usage: Replace "MyPrinterName" with the actual printer name.
let myData = "Hello world!".data(using: .utf8)! as NSData
printDocument(document: myData, printerName: "MyPrinterName")
```

This example demonstrates explicitly selecting a printer using its name.  It iterates through available printers, searching for a match.  Error handling is included for cases where the specified printer is unavailable.  Note the explicit setting of the `printInfo.printer` property, overriding any implicitly selected printer.  The use of `displayName` ensures the comparison is done based on user-friendly names rather than internal identifiers.

**Example 2:  Handling Printer Selection Changes:**

```swift
import AppKit

class MyViewController: NSViewController {
    var printInfo: NSPrintInfo!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        printInfo = NSPrintInfo.shared
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(defaultPrinterChanged), name: .NSPrintInfoChanged, object: nil)
    }
    
    @objc func defaultPrinterChanged() {
        print("Default printer changed. Updating print info...")
        printInfo = NSPrintInfo.shared
        //Update UI elements or print parameters based on new default printer
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```

This code addresses the dynamic nature of the default printer. By registering an observer for the `.NSPrintInfoChanged` notification, the application is informed when the default printer changes.  This allows for updating the `printInfo` object, ensuring that subsequent print operations use the current default printer.  Crucially, it proactively adjusts to system changes instead of relying on stale information.  In a more complex application, this would trigger UI updates to reflect the change or re-evaluate print job parameters for compatibility.

**Example 3: Verifying Printer Capabilities:**

```swift
import AppKit

func checkPrinterCapabilities(printInfo: NSPrintInfo) -> Bool {
    // Check for specific paper sizes or color support.
    if !printInfo.canPrintColor {
        print("Warning: Printer does not support color printing.")
    }
    if !printInfo.isPaperSizeSupported(.A4) {
        print("Warning: Printer does not support A4 paper size.")
    }
    // Add more checks as needed.
    return printInfo.canPrintColor && printInfo.isPaperSizeSupported(.A4) //Adjust condition as needed.
}

// Example usage:
let printInfo = NSPrintInfo.shared
if checkPrinterCapabilities(printInfo: printInfo) {
    // Proceed with printing
} else {
    // Handle unsupported capabilities. Possibly inform the user or select alternative printer
}
```

This example highlights the importance of verifying printer capabilities before committing to a print job. By explicitly checking for supported features (e.g., color printing, paper size), the application can avoid unexpected behavior.  The function returns a Boolean value indicating whether the printer meets the minimum requirements.  This allows for more robust error handling and better user experience, preventing silent failures due to printer mismatches.  The conditions here are illustrative; youâ€™d tailor them to the specific requirements of your document and expected printer capabilities.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Apple's official documentation on `NSPrintInfo` and printing in macOS and iOS.
*  A reputable book on advanced iOS or macOS development.  Look for chapters dedicated to printing and system interaction.
*  Relevant Stack Overflow questions and answers concerning Swift printing.  Focus on those relating to `NSPrintInfo`, printer selection, and error handling.



By meticulously handling `NSPrintInfo`, actively managing default printer changes, and thoroughly checking printer capabilities, developers can ensure that their Swift applications reliably interact with the print system, avoiding discrepancies between expected and reported printers.  Remember, proactive error handling and explicit printer selection are key to achieving reliable printing behavior.
