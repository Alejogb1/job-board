The optimal number of layers in a Python neural network is not a fixed value; it's fundamentally determined by the complexity of the problem being addressed.  My experience, spanning several years of developing deep learning models for various applications—from natural language processing to image recognition—has consistently shown that a heuristic approach, guided by empirical validation, is far superior to adhering to arbitrary layer counts.  Overfitting and underfitting are the key considerations, and the network architecture should be carefully tailored to balance these competing forces.  Simply put, there's no magic number.

**1. Understanding the Trade-off: Depth vs. Complexity**

A deeper network (more layers) allows for the hierarchical representation of features.  Early layers might learn simple features, while subsequent layers combine these into increasingly complex representations.  This hierarchical feature extraction is particularly potent for tasks involving intricate patterns, like image classification where the network might learn edges in early layers, then textures, and finally complete objects.  However, increasing depth introduces significant challenges.  Firstly, training becomes computationally more expensive, requiring more time and resources.  Secondly, the risk of overfitting increases dramatically.  A deep network with excessive parameters can memorize the training data, performing well on seen examples but poorly on unseen data.  Conversely, a shallow network (fewer layers) might lack the capacity to capture the intricate patterns within the data, leading to underfitting and poor generalization.

This highlights the critical need for a systematic approach involving experimentation and validation.  The ideal number of layers is a sweet spot—the point where the network's capacity is sufficient to model the data's complexity without overfitting.

**2. Practical Approaches to Determining Layer Count**

My workflow typically involves a combination of techniques: starting with a relatively simple architecture and progressively increasing complexity while monitoring performance.  I use techniques like cross-validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Furthermore, understanding the nature of the data itself is critical.  High-dimensional data, such as images, often benefit from deeper architectures compared to low-dimensional data like time series with simple patterns.

**3. Code Examples & Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the construction of neural networks with varying depths using the Keras library.  These are simplified examples and should be adapted based on the specific problem and dataset.

**Example 1: Shallow Network (Two Hidden Layers)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

This example demonstrates a shallow network with two hidden layers (64 and 128 neurons respectively).  The input layer has 784 neurons (suitable for a flattened 28x28 image), and the output layer has 10 neurons for a 10-class classification problem.  The ReLU activation function is commonly used in hidden layers, while softmax is suitable for multi-class classification in the output layer.  The `validation_split` parameter is crucial for monitoring performance on unseen data during training.

**Example 2: Medium-Depth Network (Four Hidden Layers)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=2)])
```

This network adds two more hidden layers, increasing the model's complexity.  Note the inclusion of an `EarlyStopping` callback.  This callback monitors the validation loss and stops training early if it fails to improve for a specified number of epochs (patience=2 in this case), preventing overfitting.

**Example 3:  Deep Network with Dropout (Six Hidden Layers)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)])

```

This example showcases a deeper network with six hidden layers.  Crucially, it incorporates dropout layers (`keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)`).  Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training, reducing the risk of overfitting by preventing the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron.  The `batch_size` parameter is also adjusted to improve training efficiency and possibly reduce overfitting.  The increased number of epochs reflects the need for more training iterations in deeper networks.  Again, early stopping is crucial.

**4.  Resource Recommendations**

For a more comprehensive understanding of neural network architecture, I recommend consulting the following:  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville;  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron; and relevant academic papers on neural network design and optimization.  Exploring the documentation for Keras and TensorFlow is also invaluable for practical implementation.  Careful study of these resources will allow you to develop a deeper appreciation for the nuances of designing optimal neural network architectures. Remember, experimentation, careful evaluation, and iterative refinement are key to determining the optimal number of layers for your specific application.
