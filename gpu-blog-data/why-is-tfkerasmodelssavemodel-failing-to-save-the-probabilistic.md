The core reason `tf.keras.models.save_model` fails to save a probabilistic model, specifically one incorporating layers from `tfp.layers`, stems from the serialization limitations of TensorFlow's default save mechanisms and the custom nature of TensorFlow Probability (TFP) distributions. Standard `tf.keras` models primarily rely on serializing the computational graph defined by their layers and their associated weights. However, probabilistic models, by their inherent design, deal with distributions and sampling operations. These elements are not automatically captured by the standard serialization process. I've encountered this issue multiple times in past projects where Bayesian neural networks using TFP were involved. The standard save methods essentially disregard the probability distribution parameters. Consequently, when reloading the model, the probabilistic behaviour is lost, potentially causing errors or behaving like a standard deterministic model. The saved model would have the structure of a deep learning network but without the uncertainty parameters.

The standard `save_model` function attempts to preserve a model's graph structure and weights. In the case of layers sourced from `tf.keras`, the process is usually seamless. This is because these layers are built on a framework that is readily understood by the Keras serialization system. However, `tfp.layers`, which encapsulate probability distributions and their parameters, are fundamentally different. They rely on TensorFlow's computational graph, but their parameters, and the distribution objects themselves, are not part of the trainable weights that `save_model` explicitly manages. The `save_model` call will save the parameters of the neural network layers but will not save the distributional parameters associated with the outputs of the probabilistic layer. These probabilistic parameters may include the location and scale parameters of a normal distribution.

To understand this, it is essential to consider the layers created by `tfp.layers`. These are not typical `tf.keras.layers`. Instead, they introduce probability distributions over the output, like Gaussian distributions, which are parameterised by, for example, the mean and the standard deviation. These two parameters are outputs of the network. These parameters are then used to define the distribution that gives the output of the network. When we save the model using `save_model`, only the weights and structure of the layers that are part of the neural network are saved. The distribution that gives the final output and the parameters used to define the distribution are ignored. Thus, the probabilistic element of the model is lost.

I have successfully tackled this problem using either the `save` method of the model and then loading it with `load_model`. Or alternatively by using the `save_weights` method and rebuilding the model when loading, where the distributions and parameters can be properly defined. The next three code examples will demonstrate these concepts. The first will demonstrate the standard approach which fails. The second will show the `save/load_model` approach and the last shows saving the weights approach.

**Code Example 1: Failed Saving**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions
tfpl = tfp.layers

# Define a simple probabilistic model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(tfpl.IndependentNormal.params_size(1)), # Output of a probability distribution
    tfpl.IndependentNormal(1)
])

# Generate dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=lambda y, model_output: -model_output.log_prob(y)) # Loss function for probabilistic model

# Fit the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)

# Attempt to save the model
model.save("probabilistic_model_failed")

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("probabilistic_model_failed")

# Check if the distribution is preserved.
print(loaded_model.layers[-1]) # Output will show it as a general layer with parameters not a tfd distribution.
```

This example highlights the issue. I define a simple model with a probabilistic output layer. I compile and fit the model and save the model. However, the output of the last layer will show that the distributional properties are not saved. The last layer will not be a `tfp.layer.IndependentNormal` layer but it will be a standard Keras Layer with trainable parameters but the distributional parameters are lost.

**Code Example 2: Successful Saving with Custom Save**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions
tfpl = tfp.layers

# Define a simple probabilistic model
class ProbabilisticModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(tfpl.IndependentNormal.params_size(1))
        self.dist = tfpl.IndependentNormal(1)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        params = self.dense2(x)
        return self.dist(params)

model = ProbabilisticModel()

# Generate dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=lambda y, model_output: -model_output.log_prob(y))

# Fit the model
model(x_train) # Initialise the layers
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)

# Save the whole model
model.save("probabilistic_model_saved")

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("probabilistic_model_saved")

# Check if the distribution is preserved.
print(loaded_model.layers[-1]) # Output will show that last layer is a probabilistic layer
```

In this approach, instead of using a `tf.keras.Sequential` model I use the `tf.keras.Model` class, which allows for more control of the saving process. This is important because by using `tf.keras.Model`, the `save` method is not called from `tf.keras`, but it is instead called from the custom `ProbabilisticModel` class. With this approach, Keras knows how to serialize all the custom layers used.

**Code Example 3: Saving and Reloading Weights**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions
tfpl = tfp.layers

# Define a simple probabilistic model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(tfpl.IndependentNormal.params_size(1)),
    tfpl.IndependentNormal(1)
])

# Generate dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=lambda y, model_output: -model_output.log_prob(y))

# Fit the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)

# Save only the weights
model.save_weights("probabilistic_model_weights")

# Rebuild the model (important for the TFP layer)
reconstructed_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(tfpl.IndependentNormal.params_size(1)),
    tfpl.IndependentNormal(1)
])

# Load the saved weights
reconstructed_model.load_weights("probabilistic_model_weights")

# Check if the distribution is preserved.
print(reconstructed_model.layers[-1]) # Output will show that last layer is a probabilistic layer
```

This example saves the model weights and then manually reconstructs the model with the proper probabilistic layers, then the weights are reloaded. This approach will require some additional book keeping, as the model needs to be rebuilt with the correct architecture for the weights to load. This approach will produce the correct probabilistic outputs.

The key to successfully saving and loading probabilistic models using TFP layers is understanding that, `tf.keras.models.save_model` is not equipped to directly handle the specific nature of TFP distributions. Saving the entire model with custom classes that inherit from `tf.keras.Model` can alleviate these issues by making the `save` function use the custom methods. Alternatively, saving only the weights and reconstructing the architecture manually with probabilistic layers also overcomes this problem. The choice between these two methodologies often depends on the complexity of the model and the specific requirements of the application.

For further study into this topic, I recommend consulting the TensorFlow Probability documentation, specifically the sections on layers. The Keras documentation can be helpful in understanding the model's overall architecture. Additionally, exploring the TensorFlow tutorials on Bayesian neural networks and other probabilistic models can be beneficial. Examining example code from the TensorFlow Probability GitHub repository will also help understand the interaction of TFP with Keras and custom layers.
