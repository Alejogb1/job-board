It's not uncommon to observe four output values per time step when using Keras with recurrent layers, specifically LSTMs or GRUs, particularly if you’re not explicitly configuring the model for single-output time steps. The core issue lies in the default behavior of these layers, which by design, return the *hidden state* of the recurrent unit at each time step rather than only the final output. This often surprises newcomers expecting a straightforward sequence-to-sequence mapping.

By default, a recurrent layer in Keras, when not configured otherwise, produces an output sequence where each element represents the internal hidden state vector at that particular time step. The size of this vector is determined by the ‘units’ argument you specify when defining the layer, e.g. `LSTM(units=128)`. In addition to the hidden state, Keras, for technical reasons concerning optimization, outputs another two variables internally that are relevant only for backpropagation, alongside the hidden state. When you are using a `return_sequences=True` option you usually see that output, which has the shape `(batch_size, time_steps, units)`. Then, you may see a fourth output, which depends on if you set the `return_state=True` parameter.

However, it's crucial to understand that this is not a problem per se, but rather the intended functionality of the layers. Most sequence modeling tasks, such as machine translation or text generation, often require access to these intermediate hidden states, using them as input to a subsequent layer or for direct use in a loss calculation. It's the responsibility of the model architecture to correctly leverage or disregard these values.

**Core Concept: Recurrent Layer Outputs**

A basic recurrent layer, like an LSTM or GRU, is fundamentally a state machine. At each time step, it receives an input, processes it using its internal parameters (weights and biases), and updates its internal state (the hidden state). This internal state is a vector, capturing a compressed representation of the input history up to that point. When `return_sequences=True`, we are accessing these states *at each time step*. This is different from the classic feedforward architectures which pass information along a layer from one end to the other. If we have a time sequence of 10 time steps then each time step will pass along information which depends on the previous time steps.

To illustrate, let’s assume a simple text classification task. While ultimately we are classifying the entire sequence, we could still access the hidden representation of each word to perform analysis. This ability is vital for capturing temporal dependencies within the input sequence. Let’s say we need to encode each word of a sentence. The first hidden state will encode the information of the first word, the second hidden state encodes the information of the first two words and so on. The final hidden state encodes the whole sequence.

When `return_sequences=False` (which is the default), the layer returns only the final hidden state of the sequence. This is suitable for sequence-to-vector tasks, where you are looking to make a prediction based on the whole sequence.

The four values sometimes observed are due to the fact Keras is often optimized to make use of GPU acceleration. Therefore, the outputs from the layer are structured in a way that makes it easier for the Keras backend (Tensorflow, or other frameworks) to efficiently perform computations. The internal states of the LSTM, `h` (hidden) and `c` (cell), are returned alongside the output. When the `return_state=True` option is set Keras gives the layer output plus the internal states as separate outputs, which are then available for subsequent layers or to be saved as part of a custom training loop. If the `return_state=True` option is not set, only the output is returned, and Keras manages the other internal states in the background. When using a GRU the output is returned alongside one internal state, in a similar manner as with the LSTM case.

**Code Examples and Explanations**

Here are three code examples demonstrating various output configurations and the associated explanations:

**Example 1: Basic LSTM with `return_sequences=False` (Single Output)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Define input shape
input_shape = (10, 20) # (time_steps, features)
inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)

# Define LSTM layer with 64 units.
lstm_layer = LSTM(64)(inputs) # Default return_sequences is False

# Create the model.
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=lstm_layer)

# Generate dummy data
dummy_input = np.random.rand(32, 10, 20) # (batch_size, time_steps, features)

# Predict
output = model.predict(dummy_input)
print("Output shape when return_sequences=False:", output.shape) # output shape: (32, 64)
```

*Explanation:* Here, `return_sequences` is not specified, defaulting to `False`. The LSTM layer outputs a single vector for each sequence in the batch, representing the final hidden state. Therefore, the output shape is `(batch_size, units)`, in this case `(32, 64)`. The other internal states of the layer, although calculated in the backend, are not accessible without using `return_state=True`. We can use this type of output, for example, to classify the entire sequence into a given category. We are essentially encoding the whole sequence and using the result to perform some task.

**Example 2: LSTM with `return_sequences=True` (Sequence of Outputs)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Define input shape
input_shape = (10, 20)
inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)

# Define LSTM layer with return_sequences=True
lstm_layer = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(inputs) # Explicitly set return_sequences=True

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=lstm_layer)

# Generate dummy data
dummy_input = np.random.rand(32, 10, 20)

# Predict
output = model.predict(dummy_input)
print("Output shape when return_sequences=True:", output.shape) # output shape: (32, 10, 64)
```

*Explanation:* With `return_sequences=True`, the LSTM layer returns the hidden state at each time step in the sequence, as a sequence. Therefore, the output shape is `(batch_size, time_steps, units)`, in this case `(32, 10, 64)`. This is the standard configuration for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the output is a sequence rather than a single vector. This allows us to perform more complex operations on the sequence. The other internal states of the layer are still not accessible using this configuration.

**Example 3: LSTM with `return_state=True` and `return_sequences=True` (Multiple Outputs)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Define input shape
input_shape = (10, 20)
inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)

# Define LSTM layer with return_state and return_sequences
lstm_layer, hidden_state, cell_state = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)(inputs)

# Create the model, the outputs will be placed on a list
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[lstm_layer, hidden_state, cell_state])

# Generate dummy data
dummy_input = np.random.rand(32, 10, 20)

# Predict
output, h, c = model.predict(dummy_input)
print("Shape of output when return_state=True and return_sequences=True:", output.shape) # Output shape (32, 10, 64)
print("Shape of h:", h.shape) # Output shape (32, 64)
print("Shape of c:", c.shape) # Output shape (32, 64)
```

*Explanation:* This example illustrates the most complex scenario. `return_sequences=True` gives us the sequence of hidden states, as in the second example, but `return_state=True` additionally returns the last hidden state (`h`) and the last cell state (`c`) of the LSTM. Note that this final `h` is the same output we would have if we used `return_sequences=False`. When we set `return_state=True` the first output of the layer corresponds to the layer's output. In the case of `return_sequences=True` this is a sequence. The second output corresponds to the last hidden state. The third output corresponds to the last cell state. If we use a GRU we'll only have the hidden state. These internal states might be useful for advanced configurations and custom training loops that need to keep track of such states at the end of the sequence.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, exploring resources that explain recurrent neural networks and LSTMs/GRUs is beneficial. Look for tutorials explaining the underlying math and mechanics of these layers and how they are trained by backpropagation through time. Focus on explanations that cover the concept of hidden states and their role in capturing sequential information. Documentation and tutorials on sequence modeling with Keras will clarify the different outputs when using `return_sequences` and `return_state`. Some specific topic recommendations are: recurrent neural networks theory, LSTMs and GRUs architecture and theory, backpropagation through time, Keras core API and usage with time series data. Be sure to spend some time implementing a few examples on your own.

In conclusion, the multiple outputs per time step from Keras recurrent layers are due to the combination of the layer's natural tendency to maintain internal states, the flexibility of offering sequences of outputs, and Keras' design to optimize backend computation. These behaviors are controllable via the arguments `return_sequences` and `return_state` which affect the number and type of values returned at the output of the layer. It is not a flaw or error but a deliberate design choice that enables various sequence modeling applications. Understanding this is fundamental to working with recurrent models effectively.
