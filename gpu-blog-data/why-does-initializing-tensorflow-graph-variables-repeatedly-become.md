Repeated initialization of TensorFlow graph variables exhibits performance degradation due to a confluence of factors primarily related to resource management and the underlying computational graph structure.  My experience optimizing large-scale TensorFlow models has shown that this isn't simply a matter of redundant computation, but a more nuanced issue impacting both memory allocation and the efficiency of the TensorFlow runtime.

**1.  Explanation:**

The performance slowdown isn't solely attributed to the repeated execution of the `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` or similar initialization operations.  Instead, it stems from the cumulative effects on several internal TensorFlow mechanisms.  Firstly, each initialization attempt constructs a new computational graph, or at least significantly modifies the existing one, depending on the nature of the variable definitions.  This graph construction process itself is computationally expensive.  TensorFlow's graph optimization strategies, while powerful, are not designed for repeated, incremental graph modifications of this kind. They're optimized for a single, well-defined graph.

Secondly, and perhaps more critically, repeated initialization leads to increasingly fragmented memory allocation.  TensorFlow, particularly in its eager execution mode, relies heavily on dynamic memory allocation.  Each variable initialization allocates memory for the variable's tensor data.  Repeatedly allocating and deallocating these tensors without proper cleanup can result in memory fragmentation, forcing the system to resort to less efficient memory management techniques like paging.  This becomes particularly problematic with large models, where memory allocation overhead dominates the overall execution time.

Thirdly,  the interaction between the initialization process and the TensorFlow runtime's session management plays a role.  Repeatedly creating and potentially destroying sessions (explicitly or implicitly) can introduce significant overhead. While TensorFlow's resource management attempts to optimize this, repeated session creation and variable initialization can overwhelm its capabilities, leading to delays in subsequent initialization attempts.  Furthermore, if GPU resources are utilized, the context switching and memory allocation on the GPU contribute significantly to the performance degradation.

Finally, the interaction with other parts of the system, such as the operating system's memory allocator, should not be overlooked. System-level memory management can become strained due to fragmentation, causing significant delays in satisfying subsequent memory requests, thus impacting TensorFlow's performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

for i in range(10):
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        W = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.random.normal([100, 100]))
        b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
        # ... further operations using W and b ...
```

This code demonstrates the inefficient approach. A new session is created and variables are initialized within each iteration, leading to performance degradation as explained above.  Each iteration suffers from the cumulative effects of repeated graph construction, memory fragmentation, and session management overhead.

**Example 2: Efficient Initialization using a Single Session**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    W = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.random.normal([100, 100]))
    b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    for i in range(10):
        # ... operations using W and b ...
```

Here, a single session is created, and variables are initialized only once. Subsequent iterations reuse the initialized variables, avoiding the performance penalty associated with repeated initialization. This significantly improves performance.


**Example 3:  Initialization with `tf.function` (for TensorFlow 2.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_operation(W, b):
    # ... operations using W and b ...
    return result

W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([100, 100]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([100]))

for i in range(10):
    result = my_operation(W, b)
    # ... use the result ...
```

This showcases a TensorFlow 2.x approach utilizing `tf.function`. This improves performance by compiling the operations within `my_operation` into a more efficient graph, minimizing runtime overhead.  The variables are initialized only once outside the loop, further contributing to the efficiency gain. Note the absence of explicit session management, inherent in the TensorFlow 2.x paradigm.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals and memory management, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on graph construction, session management, and memory optimization.  Additionally, texts focusing on high-performance computing and parallel programming provide valuable context. Finally, research papers on optimizing deep learning model training often address related performance bottlenecks.  Careful attention to these resources, combined with profiling your specific code, will lead to a precise understanding of the performance bottlenecks in your application and guide you to effective solutions.
