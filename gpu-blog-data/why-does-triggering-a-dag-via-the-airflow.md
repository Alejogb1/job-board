The discrepancy between successful DAG triggering through the Airflow UI and failure via the REST API often stems from subtle differences in authentication, authorization, and the execution context.  In my experience troubleshooting Airflow deployments, particularly across large, multi-user environments, this issue frequently arises from inconsistencies in how permissions are handled and how the API request is structured compared to the implicit authentication and authorization mechanisms the UI utilizes.

**1. Authentication and Authorization Discrepancies:**

The Airflow UI typically leverages session-based authentication, often integrated with a provider like OAuth or a backend database storing user credentials.  Upon successful login, a session token is generated and implicitly included in subsequent requests made by the browser. This token verifies the user's identity and permissions. The REST API, however, relies on explicit authentication mechanisms, most commonly basic authentication (username/password) or API keys. If the API request lacks the correct credentials, or if the user associated with those credentials lacks the necessary permissions to trigger the specified DAG, the request will fail.  This is often compounded by misconfiguration of the Airflow webserver, where the authentication backend might not be correctly configured for the API endpoints.

I once encountered this issue in a production environment where a new security policy mandated the use of API keys exclusively.  While the UI continued functioning flawlessly, our automated pipeline relying on REST API calls began failing.  The root cause?  We neglected to update the API key configuration within the scripts responsible for triggering DAGs, resulting in unauthorized access attempts.


**2. Context and Execution Environment:**

The UI operates within a browser environment, inherently inheriting certain contextual information, including potentially environment variables, which might be crucial for Airflow's execution. The REST API request, conversely, might be executed from a separate environment, lacking these critical contextual elements. For instance, Airflow may rely on environment variables to configure database connections or other essential settings. If these variables aren't explicitly provided in the API request (e.g., through headers or request body), the DAG execution might fail due to missing configuration.  Moreover, the user's environment might contain specific paths or settings related to the DAG's dependencies that are absent in the environment launching the API request.  This difference in context can manifest as seemingly unrelated errors during DAG execution.


**3. Request Body and Parameter Validation:**

In my experience, seemingly minor discrepancies in the structure of the API request body can also be problematic.  The Airflow REST API often expects specific parameters, such as the DAG ID, execution date (or a run ID), and potentially configuration settings.  Missing or incorrectly formatted parameters can lead to a failed request, even if authentication is successful.  Furthermore, the API endpoint might employ input validation â€“ for instance, checking for the presence of certain fields or verifying the data type of specific parameters.  Any deviation from the expected format or content could result in request rejection.  This often becomes challenging when migrating from older Airflow versions to newer ones where the API specifications might have subtly changed.  Thorough review of the Airflow API documentation is crucial to avoid these errors.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Authentication**

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/<DAG_ID>/dagRuns"
headers = {'Authorization': 'Basic <incorrect_credentials>'} #Incorrect credentials

response = requests.post(url, json={"run_id": "my_run"})
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

This example demonstrates a common pitfall: using incorrect credentials in the `Authorization` header.  Replacing `<incorrect_credentials>` with the correctly encoded base64 representation of "username:password" is crucial for successful authentication. Note the explicit specification of `run_id`.

**Example 2: Missing Configuration Parameters**

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/<DAG_ID>/dagRuns"
headers = {'Authorization': 'Basic <correct_credentials>'}

# Missing crucial configuration parameter
response = requests.post(url, json={"run_id": "my_run"})
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

This example highlights the importance of providing all necessary parameters. Airflow might require additional parameters beyond `run_id` depending on the DAG's configuration.  Referencing the Airflow REST API documentation for the specific parameters required by the `/dagRuns` endpoint is essential.


**Example 3:  Correct Authentication and Parameterization**

```python
import requests
import base64

username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
dag_id = "your_dag_id"
run_id = "my_unique_run_id"

url = f"http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns"

credentials = f"{username}:{password}"
encoded_credentials = base64.b64encode(credentials.encode()).decode()

headers = {'Authorization': f'Basic {encoded_credentials}'}

payload = {"run_id": run_id}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())

```

This example showcases a more robust implementation, demonstrating proper base64 encoding of credentials and explicit definition of all necessary parameters.   Remember to replace placeholders like `<DAG_ID>`, "your_username", "your_password", and "your_dag_id" with your actual values.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official Airflow documentation, including the API reference guide, should be your primary source of information.  Additionally, consult the documentation for your specific Airflow provider (e.g., the database provider used by Airflow) for authentication and configuration guidelines.  Exploring Airflow's logging mechanisms will also provide valuable insights into the reasons behind failed API calls. Finally, reviewing Airflow's configuration files, particularly `airflow.cfg`, will often help identify misconfigurations that can cause this type of discrepancy.
