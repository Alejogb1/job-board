MinMaxScaler's core function, scaling numerical features to a specified range (typically [0, 1]), fundamentally alters the underlying data distribution and can induce significant consequences for machine learning model training and interpretation. I've seen firsthand how indiscriminate application of this scaler can mask critical patterns or introduce biases into models. This response details these implications, providing illustrative code examples.

The primary implication revolves around the fact that MinMaxScaler relies entirely on the observed minimum and maximum values within the training data. It applies a linear transformation to each feature using this formula:

```
x_scaled = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)
```

Where `x` is the original feature value, `x_min` is the observed minimum, and `x_max` is the observed maximum within the training set. If these values are outliers or extreme samples, they significantly impact scaling parameters, potentially squashing the majority of data points into a narrower range. When used in model training, this leads to several potential problems.

Firstly, sensitivity to outliers is a key concern. Consider a dataset where the 'age' feature is usually within the 20-70 range, but one outlier exists with an age of 120. MinMaxScaler will shift all values toward the lower end of the [0, 1] scale, with most data points clustering near the lower ranges while the outlier controls the scaling parameters. This diminishes the original feature's variance, reducing the information signal and potentially negatively impacting model performance when the outlier is not representative of actual, typical cases. While some argue that outlier removal beforehand solves this, it assumes the user knows what constitutes an outlier and also assumes the user has time to do the analysis and data preparation. 

Secondly, a critical issue emerges during deployment of the model on data not present in the training set. If the new data contains values outside the training range's minimum and maximum, those values will be scaled beyond the [0, 1] range. This happens because MinMaxScaler uses the training data's scaling parameters, not the testing (or production) data's. This means the model is operating on an input that it was not trained on, rendering any interpretation of prediction quality useless.

Thirdly, there is the potential for introducing bias, especially when features have different distributions. For example, if one feature is highly skewed (e.g., income) and another is relatively normally distributed (e.g., height), MinMaxScaler will compress or expand the feature ranges differently. While this may scale values to a common scale, that is not its original intent. This can affect model interpretation because features with less original variance are now occupying a larger range, which can influence their coefficient values in a linear model and the perceived feature importance in non-linear models.

Below are examples demonstrating these implications:

**Example 1: Impact of Outliers**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample data with an outlier
data_with_outlier = np.array([20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 120]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Scale using MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data_with_outlier = scaler.fit_transform(data_with_outlier)

print("Original Data with Outlier:\n", data_with_outlier)
print("\nScaled Data with Outlier:\n", scaled_data_with_outlier)

# Sample data without the outlier for comparison
data_no_outlier = np.array([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Scale using MinMaxScaler
scaler_no_outlier = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data_no_outlier = scaler_no_outlier.fit_transform(data_no_outlier)

print("\nOriginal Data without Outlier:\n", data_no_outlier)
print("\nScaled Data without Outlier:\n", scaled_data_no_outlier)

```

This demonstrates that the outlier skews the entire scaling, concentrating all the lower values near zero. The second scaling is more evenly distributed because of the lack of an outlier.

**Example 2: Scaling New Data With Pre-Trained Scaler**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Training data
train_data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Fit the scaler on training data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(train_data)

# New data with values outside training range
new_data = np.array([0, 25, 60]).reshape(-1, 1)
scaled_new_data = scaler.transform(new_data)

print("Training Data:\n", train_data)
print("\nScaled New Data:\n", scaled_new_data)
```

Here, the scaler is fit using only training data. The new data contains points outside of that range (specifically `0` and `60`). When transformed by the trained scaler, the new values go outside of the [0,1] bound, which will create inconsistencies with a model trained on [0,1] input features. The model has never been trained on such values and will most likely produce poor predictions.

**Example 3: Impact on Different Distributions**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create two features with different distributions
feature_1 = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=100).reshape(-1, 1)  # Normally distributed
feature_2 = np.random.exponential(scale=20, size=100).reshape(-1, 1)  # Exponentially distributed

data = np.concatenate((feature_1, feature_2), axis=1)

# Scale
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)


# Plot original distributions
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.hist(data[:,0], alpha=0.5, label='Feature 1')
plt.hist(data[:,1], alpha=0.5, label='Feature 2')
plt.title('Original Distributions')
plt.legend()

# Plot scaled distributions
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.hist(scaled_data[:,0], alpha=0.5, label='Scaled Feature 1')
plt.hist(scaled_data[:,1], alpha=0.5, label='Scaled Feature 2')
plt.title('Scaled Distributions')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
This example uses two distributions, normal and exponential, to demonstrate how different data spreads are impacted by min-max scaling. While both are bounded to [0,1], the relative data density of the values are now affected and the interpretation of feature importance could be skewed.

In conclusion, while MinMaxScaler is a popular scaling technique, its dependency on training data limits poses multiple problems. It can reduce the effect of non-outlier data, create inconsistencies on testing data, and introduce bias based on distribution types.

For a more detailed understanding of data preprocessing techniques, I recommend reviewing materials on data transformations, outlier handling, and model deployment. Research documentation and papers relating to these fields would provide a thorough understanding of best practices. Resources focusing on the specific limitations of scalers and the effect of scaling on different types of models are also highly beneficial. Finally, practical experience and experimentation on varied datasets remains the best means to determine if MinMaxScaler (or any other scaler) is appropriate.
