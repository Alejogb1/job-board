The discrepancy between the sum of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) and the total number of observed values arises from the fundamental distinction between the *predicted* and *observed* classifications within a binary classification problem.  My experience with large-scale anomaly detection systems has repeatedly highlighted this crucial point.  The total observed values represent the complete dataset, while TP, TN, FP, and FN are derived solely from the model's predictions against that dataset.  This inherent asymmetry means the sum of these four metrics will only equal the total observed values under specific, and often unrealistic, conditions.

Let me clarify with a precise explanation.  The total observed values represent the actual number of instances in your dataset, encompassing both positive and negative classes.  For instance, in a spam detection system, this would be the total number of emails processed.  However, TP, TN, FP, and FN are generated by comparing your model's predictions to the ground truth labels.  TP denotes correctly identified positives (spam emails correctly flagged as spam), TN represents correctly identified negatives (ham emails correctly identified as ham), FP represents incorrectly identified positives (ham emails incorrectly flagged as spam), and FN represents incorrectly identified negatives (spam emails incorrectly identified as ham).

The key is that a model can, and often does, *miss* classifying certain instances.  These missed classifications are not inherently accounted for in the TP, TN, FP, and FN count. A model might encounter an instance it's entirely unable to classify confidently, potentially assigning it a probability threshold below the decision boundary, effectively disregarding it from the final confusion matrix calculation. This is especially prominent when dealing with imbalanced datasets or models with high uncertainty. Thus, the sum of TP, TN, FP, and FN will only match the total observed values when your model predicts a classification for *every* instance in your dataset â€“ a scenario rarely achieved in practice.

Consider the following scenarios and accompanying code examples illustrating this disparity.  I've used Python and NumPy for their clarity and widespread adoption in data science.

**Example 1:  Perfect Classification**

This idealized case demonstrates the only scenario where the sum of TP, TN, FP, and FN equals the total observed values.

```python
import numpy as np

# Ground truth labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
y_true = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0])

# Model predictions (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
y_pred = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0])

TP = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 1))
TN = np.sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 0))
FP = np.sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 1))
FN = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 0))

total_observed = len(y_true)
print(f"TP: {TP}, TN: {TN}, FP: {FP}, FN: {FN}")
print(f"Total Observed: {total_observed}")
print(f"Sum of TP, TN, FP, FN: {TP + TN + FP + FN}")
```

This example will show that the sum of TP, TN, FP, and FN equals the total observed value because the model correctly classified every instance.

**Example 2:  Incomplete Classification with Threshold**

This example introduces a common scenario where a classification threshold leads to some instances being excluded from the final count.

```python
import numpy as np

# Ground truth labels
y_true = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0])

# Model prediction probabilities
y_prob = np.array([0.9, 0.8, 0.2, 0.1, 0.7, 0.3, 0.6, 0.4, 0.05, 0.01])

# Set a classification threshold
threshold = 0.5

# Predictions based on threshold
y_pred = np.where(y_prob >= threshold, 1, 0)

TP = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 1))
TN = np.sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 0))
FP = np.sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 1))
FN = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 0))

total_observed = len(y_true)
print(f"TP: {TP}, TN: {TN}, FP: {FP}, FN: {FN}")
print(f"Total Observed: {total_observed}")
print(f"Sum of TP, TN, FP, FN: {TP + TN + FP + FN}")

```

Here, instances with probabilities below the threshold are effectively ignored in the TP, TN, FP, FN calculation, leading to a sum less than the total observed.

**Example 3:  Handling Missing Predictions**

This illustrates how explicitly handling missing predictions can further highlight the difference.

```python
import numpy as np

# Ground truth labels
y_true = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0])

# Model predictions with some missing values (represented by NaN)
y_pred = np.array([1, 1, 0, np.nan, 1, 0, np.nan, 0, 0, 0])

# Mask out NaN values for calculation
mask = ~np.isnan(y_pred)
y_pred_masked = y_pred[mask]
y_true_masked = y_true[mask]

TP = np.sum((y_true_masked == 1) & (y_pred_masked == 1))
TN = np.sum((y_true_masked == 0) & (y_pred_masked == 0))
FP = np.sum((y_true_masked == 0) & (y_pred_masked == 1))
FN = np.sum((y_true_masked == 1) & (y_pred_masked == 0))

total_observed = len(y_true)
print(f"TP: {TP}, TN: {TN}, FP: {FP}, FN: {FN}")
print(f"Total Observed: {total_observed}")
print(f"Sum of TP, TN, FP, FN: {TP + TN + FP + FN}")

```

In this scenario, the `NaN` values represent instances the model failed to classify.  These are explicitly excluded from the calculation, further emphasizing the discrepancy between the sum of confusion matrix components and the total observed values.


In conclusion, the mismatch arises from the distinct nature of observed data and model predictions.  The former represents the entirety of your dataset, while the latter represents a subset potentially affected by thresholds, model limitations, and missing predictions. A comprehensive understanding of this difference is vital for interpreting evaluation metrics in binary classification tasks.  For further study, I would recommend consulting standard textbooks on machine learning and statistical pattern recognition.  Familiarizing yourself with different performance evaluation metrics beyond the confusion matrix will offer a more complete understanding of model performance.  Specifically, exploring precision-recall curves and ROC curves can provide valuable insights into model behavior across different classification thresholds.
