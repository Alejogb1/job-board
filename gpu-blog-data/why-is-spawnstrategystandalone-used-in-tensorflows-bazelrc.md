Understanding why `spawn_strategy=standalone` is often specified in TensorFlow's Bazelrc requires delving into the intricacies of Bazel's build process and how it interacts with TensorFlow's specific build requirements. Specifically, this setting mandates that each build action is executed in a completely isolated environment. This is not the default behavior of Bazel, and it's crucial for maintaining the integrity and reproducibility of TensorFlow's large and complex builds.

Normally, Bazel attempts to optimize build speed by reusing previously launched processes and sharing resources between actions whenever possible. This can include using pre-existing instances of compilers or other tools. While beneficial for smaller projects, this shared-process model creates significant challenges when dealing with a large codebase like TensorFlow. Issues such as interference between different tool versions, corrupted environments, and unpredictable resource usage become prevalent. These problems introduce significant debugging overhead, impede reproducibility, and lead to inconsistent build outcomes.

By enforcing `spawn_strategy=standalone`, Bazel creates a completely new and isolated execution environment for every single build action. This means each compiler invocation, each linking step, and each execution of a build tool happens within its own dedicated process, with its own separate environment variables, file system access, and resource allocation. The primary benefit of this isolation is eliminating the inter-action dependencies and environment conflicts that plague more optimized build strategies. This approach effectively treats each step as an entirely independent operation, reducing variability.

The cost, of course, is increased build times and higher system resource consumption since each action requires its own setup and tear down. This trade-off, however, is essential to achieving reliable builds for projects of TensorFlow’s scale. The increased consistency and predictability that `spawn_strategy=standalone` provides far outweigh the performance penalty in a high-stakes, collaborative environment like TensorFlow development.

Consider a scenario I experienced working on an internal TensorFlow extension. We had sporadic, difficult-to-reproduce build failures when the project was configured to use Bazel’s standard, optimized execution model. Tracing down the root cause revealed that a subtle change in environment variables during one part of the build was leaking into another, causing a seemingly unrelated compiler invocation to fail in unexpected ways. After we switched to the standalone strategy, these kinds of unpredictable failures vanished, improving the stability of our continuous integration pipeline significantly.

To understand the impact further, let's examine concrete examples. Below is a simplified representation of a Bazel build rule and how it interacts with `spawn_strategy=standalone`:

```python
# Example 1: Basic C++ compilation rule (simplified for illustration)
cc_binary(
  name = "my_program",
  srcs = ["my_program.cc"],
  deps = ["@some_lib//:some_lib"],
)
```
Without `spawn_strategy=standalone`, when `my_program.cc` needs to be compiled, Bazel might reuse a previous C++ compiler instance. This re-use is faster since it avoids the overhead of launching a new process but it can introduce subtle dependency issues if different compiler flags were used in previous invocations. With standalone strategy however, the compilation action would always invoke a completely fresh compiler instance, initialized with a standardized set of parameters, including environment variables and compiler options. This significantly reduces the risk of unexpected build failures caused by state leaks from previous build steps.

Another example, consider a rule that executes a custom build tool:

```python
# Example 2: Custom build tool invocation
genrule(
    name = "my_generator",
    srcs = ["input.txt"],
    outs = ["output.txt"],
    cmd = "$(location custom_tool) < $(location input.txt) > $(location output.txt)",
    executable = True,
)
```

Without the standalone strategy, if the location of `custom_tool` (which could be a python or shell script in this case) changes between consecutive builds, or if this tool modifies environment variables, the execution context of `my_generator` could vary unpredictably from one build to another due to Bazel's process reuse optimization. This variation can lead to inconsistent outputs and debug challenges. With standalone strategy however, a new execution context, with a well-defined set of environmental parameters is initialized for each call of `custom_tool`. This ensures that the execution of `my_generator` is always isolated, avoiding unexpected dependencies and providing reproducible output each time.

Finally consider an example where the build system requires a specific version of a tool:

```python
# Example 3: Invoking a tool with a specific version in a python script
genrule(
    name = "version_check",
    outs = ["version.txt"],
    cmd = "python $(location check_version.py) > $(location version.txt)",
    tools = ["check_version.py"]
)
```

```python
# check_version.py
import subprocess
import os
def main():
  result = subprocess.run(['my_tool', '--version'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
  version = result.stdout.strip()
  with open("version.txt", "w") as f:
      f.write(f"Tool Version: {version}\n")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this case the `check_version.py` script needs a specific version of `my_tool`. In a non-standalone environment, if a different version of `my_tool` was invoked previously during the same build, and happens to still be running or partially initialized, that could corrupt or alter the results of `check_version.py` which is used to generate version.txt. The standalone strategy mitigates this by ensuring a pristine environment each time `check_version.py` is executed, meaning it will reliably retrieve the correct version of `my_tool` with its own isolated process, avoiding any pollution from previous uses of the `my_tool` binary.

In summary, the adoption of `spawn_strategy=standalone` in TensorFlow's Bazelrc prioritizes build consistency and reproducibility over speed optimizations that can lead to unpredictable issues. This approach is essential for a large, collaborative project like TensorFlow, where subtle variations in the build environment can have significant impacts on stability and debuggability. While a performance penalty is incurred, the benefits are well worth it for ensuring a reliable and consistent build process.

For further reading and to deepen your understanding of Bazel, I recommend reviewing the official Bazel documentation, particularly the sections dealing with build strategies, execution environments, and rule concepts. In addition to that, exploring examples of large open source projects' Bazel configurations will help see real-world applications of these concepts. Finally, engaging with the Bazel community through their forums and mailing lists can provide valuable insights and practical advice.
