The core challenge in summing NumPy array values at specific indices dictated by another array lies in efficiently handling potential index out-of-bounds errors and leveraging NumPy's vectorized operations for optimal performance.  Over the years, I've encountered this problem frequently in image processing and scientific computing applications, necessitating robust and scalable solutions. My approach consistently prioritizes error handling and performance optimization, especially when dealing with large datasets.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental strategy involves using advanced indexing in NumPy. Given a primary array (let's call it `data_array`) containing the values to be summed and an index array (let's call it `index_array`), we want to select specific elements from `data_array` using the indices provided in `index_array` and then compute their sum.  However, a critical consideration is the validity of the indices.  `index_array` elements must fall within the bounds of `data_array`'s dimensions to avoid `IndexError` exceptions.  Furthermore,  `index_array` can be multi-dimensional, requiring careful consideration of broadcasting and dimensionality compatibility.

A naive approach might involve looping through `index_array`, but this is computationally inefficient for large arrays. NumPy's strength lies in its vectorized operations; hence, we should leverage advanced indexing to achieve this summation in a single, optimized operation.  This involves directly using `index_array` to select elements from `data_array`, followed by a summation using `np.sum()`.  Before applying this, however, thorough error checking and handling of potential out-of-bounds indices are crucial for robust code.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: One-dimensional case with bounds checking:**

```python
import numpy as np

def sum_at_indices_1d(data_array, index_array):
    """Sums values in data_array at indices specified in index_array (1D)."""

    #Error Handling: Check for valid indices.
    if np.any(index_array < 0) or np.any(index_array >= len(data_array)):
        raise IndexError("Indices out of bounds.")

    #Efficient summation using advanced indexing.
    return np.sum(data_array[index_array])

data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = np.array([0, 2, 4])
result = sum_at_indices_1d(data, indices)
print(f"Sum at specified indices: {result}") #Output: 90


indices_err = np.array([0, 2, 5]) #Introduces an out-of-bounds index
try:
    result = sum_at_indices_1d(data, indices_err)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Output: Error: Indices out of bounds.

```

This example demonstrates the 1D case, including robust error handling for out-of-bounds indices. The function efficiently sums elements using advanced indexing.


**Example 2: Two-dimensional case with masking:**

```python
import numpy as np

def sum_at_indices_2d(data_array, row_indices, col_indices):
    """Sums values in data_array at indices specified by row_indices and col_indices (2D)."""

    #Error Handling: Check for valid indices.  More robust than the 1D approach as we must validate against both axes independently.
    rows_in_bounds = np.all((row_indices >= 0) & (row_indices < data_array.shape[0]))
    cols_in_bounds = np.all((col_indices >= 0) & (col_indices < data_array.shape[1]))

    if not (rows_in_bounds and cols_in_bounds):
        raise IndexError("Indices out of bounds.")


    #Advanced indexing for 2D array
    return np.sum(data_array[row_indices, col_indices])


data_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
row_indices = np.array([0, 1, 2])
col_indices = np.array([0, 1, 2])
result = sum_at_indices_2d(data_2d, row_indices, col_indices)
print(f"Sum at specified indices: {result}") # Output: 27


row_indices_err = np.array([0, 1, 3])  # Out of bounds row index
try:
    result = sum_at_indices_2d(data_2d, row_indices_err, col_indices)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: Indices out of bounds.

```

This example expands to handle two-dimensional arrays, demonstrating how to independently validate row and column indices before performing the summation using advanced indexing.


**Example 3: Handling potential index duplicates using `np.unique` and boolean indexing:**

```python
import numpy as np

def sum_at_indices_dedupe(data_array, index_array):
    """Sums values, handling duplicate indices by summing the value only once."""

    #Handle duplicate indices gracefully. Find unique indices and sum the values from these positions.
    unique_indices = np.unique(index_array)
    valid_indices = np.all((unique_indices >= 0) & (unique_indices < len(data_array)))

    if not valid_indices:
        raise IndexError("Indices out of bounds.")

    return np.sum(data_array[unique_indices])


data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = np.array([0, 2, 0, 4, 2]) #Demonstrates duplicates
result = sum_at_indices_dedupe(data, indices)
print(f"Sum at specified indices (handling duplicates): {result}") # Output: 120

```

This showcases how to handle situations where the `index_array` contains duplicate indices.  Using `np.unique`, only unique indices are considered for summation, preventing double counting of values.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of NumPy's advanced indexing capabilities and efficient array manipulation techniques, I recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation.  Furthermore, a good introductory text on numerical computing with Python would provide a strong foundation.  Finally, exploring examples within online repositories focused on scientific computing could offer practical insights and further refine one's skills.
