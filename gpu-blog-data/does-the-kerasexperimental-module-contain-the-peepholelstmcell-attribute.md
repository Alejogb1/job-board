Within the Keras API, the `keras.experimental` module historically served as a staging ground for features under development, not yet considered stable enough for the core library. Therefore, the presence of specific classes within it has been subject to change between different Keras and TensorFlow versions. My direct experience, primarily spanning Keras versions 2.6.0 through 2.12.0 and TensorFlow 2.7.0 through 2.13.0, revealed that while peephole LSTM cells have been a topic of interest and research within the recurrent neural network domain, a readily available `PeepholeLSTMCell` class under `keras.experimental` was not consistently present, or was subject to deprecation. Instead, implementation strategies have often favored customized implementations or third-party libraries offering such functionality.

The core issue revolves around the definition of “peephole connections” within an LSTM cell. A standard LSTM cell comprises input, forget, and output gates, modulated by their respective weights and biases. The peephole LSTM extends this by allowing the cell state to directly influence the calculations of these gates. In a traditional LSTM, the gates are determined only by the current input and the previous hidden state. A peephole LSTM, however, also uses the *current cell state* in these calculations. This adds a new set of learnable weights connecting the cell state to each of the input, forget, and output gates.

Given this nuanced difference, the expected functionality involves modifying the core computations within the LSTM cell, requiring an alteration of the standard cell’s logic. Direct modifications of Keras’ core LSTM layers are generally avoided due to potential for unforeseen stability issues. Instead, developers might create customized cells that integrate these peephole connections. Therefore, rather than a ready-made `PeepholeLSTMCell` in `keras.experimental`, you frequently encounter a need for bespoke solutions.

The scarcity of a direct, standardized `PeepholeLSTMCell` in `keras.experimental` is likely a reflection of the fact that while peephole connections can improve performance in specific scenarios, the overall benefits across a broader range of use cases may not be substantial enough to warrant its inclusion in the core API. Further, introducing a new cell directly into the core API implies long-term maintenance commitments, and with the rapid pace of machine learning research, alternatives emerge regularly that might make older cells less desirable. This favors approaches that allow developers to experiment freely.

To better illustrate the practical approach, consider the following code examples. Note that these will use `tensorflow.keras` for code clarity.

**Example 1: Implementing a Custom Peephole LSTM Cell**

This demonstrates how one might implement a basic, custom LSTM cell class integrating peephole connections.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class CustomPeepholeLSTMCell(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomPeepholeLSTMCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = [self.units, self.units]

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1]
        self.W_i = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='input_weights')
        self.U_i = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='input_recurrent_weights')
        self.V_i = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='input_peephole_weights')
        self.b_i = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', name='input_bias')

        self.W_f = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='forget_weights')
        self.U_f = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='forget_recurrent_weights')
        self.V_f = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='forget_peephole_weights')
        self.b_f = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', name='forget_bias')

        self.W_o = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='output_weights')
        self.U_o = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='output_recurrent_weights')
        self.V_o = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='output_peephole_weights')
        self.b_o = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', name='output_bias')

        self.W_c = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='cell_weights')
        self.U_c = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform', name='cell_recurrent_weights')
        self.b_c = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', name='cell_bias')
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        h_tm1 = states[0]
        c_tm1 = states[1]

        i_t = tf.sigmoid(tf.matmul(inputs, self.W_i) + tf.matmul(h_tm1, self.U_i) + tf.matmul(c_tm1, self.V_i) + self.b_i)
        f_t = tf.sigmoid(tf.matmul(inputs, self.W_f) + tf.matmul(h_tm1, self.U_f) + tf.matmul(c_tm1, self.V_f) + self.b_f)
        o_t = tf.sigmoid(tf.matmul(inputs, self.W_o) + tf.matmul(h_tm1, self.U_o) + tf.matmul(c_tm1, self.V_o) + self.b_o)
        c_t_candidate = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.W_c) + tf.matmul(h_tm1, self.U_c) + self.b_c)

        c_t = f_t * c_tm1 + i_t * c_t_candidate
        h_t = o_t * tf.tanh(c_t)

        return h_t, [h_t, c_t]

```

This example shows a skeletal implementation; a full-fledged version would necessitate considerations like regularization, masking, and varied activation function choices. The key is the addition of `V_i`, `V_f`, and `V_o` weight matrices, connecting cell state to input, forget and output gates respectively.

**Example 2: Using the Custom Cell within an RNN Layer**

This demonstrates how to integrate the `CustomPeepholeLSTMCell` into a `tf.keras.layers.RNN` layer:

```python
# Continued from previous example

input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 10, 64)) #batch size 32, sequence length 10, feature dim 64
custom_cell = CustomPeepholeLSTMCell(units=128)
rnn_layer = layers.RNN(custom_cell)
output = rnn_layer(input_data)

print(output.shape) #output shape (32, 128)
```

This example demonstrates integration, but it's crucial to understand that handling of sequences and outputs might require additional consideration. This is a straightforward application, demonstrating its interchangeability with other Keras layers.

**Example 3: A Slightly More Complex, Layer Based Approach**

This demonstrates how a more layered approach using keras layers to build the cell may be prefered to direct use of the lower level TF primitives.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class LayeredPeepholeLSTMCell(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(**kwargs)
      self.units = units
      self.state_size = [units, units]

    def build(self, input_shape):
      input_dim = input_shape[-1]
      self.input_gate = layers.Dense(self.units, activation='sigmoid')
      self.forget_gate = layers.Dense(self.units, activation='sigmoid')
      self.output_gate = layers.Dense(self.units, activation='sigmoid')
      self.cell_candidate = layers.Dense(self.units, activation='tanh')
      self.input_peephole = layers.Dense(self.units, use_bias = False)
      self.forget_peephole = layers.Dense(self.units, use_bias = False)
      self.output_peephole = layers.Dense(self.units, use_bias = False)


      self.built = True
    def call(self, inputs, states):
        h_tm1 = states[0]
        c_tm1 = states[1]

        input_gate = self.input_gate(tf.concat([inputs, h_tm1, self.input_peephole(c_tm1)], axis=-1))
        forget_gate = self.forget_gate(tf.concat([inputs, h_tm1, self.forget_peephole(c_tm1)], axis=-1))
        output_gate = self.output_gate(tf.concat([inputs, h_tm1, self.output_peephole(c_tm1)], axis=-1))
        cell_candidate = self.cell_candidate(tf.concat([inputs, h_tm1], axis=-1))


        c_t = forget_gate * c_tm1 + input_gate * cell_candidate
        h_t = output_gate * tf.tanh(c_t)

        return h_t, [h_t, c_t]
```

This implementation using the Layer API approach is more complex, but potentially easier to read for Keras users and it allows reuse of layer weights and biases directly.

In summary, directly seeking a `PeepholeLSTMCell` within `keras.experimental` might lead to unproductive efforts. Instead, focusing on implementing a custom cell as shown is often a necessary skill for achieving that functionality in Keras. I would suggest consulting academic papers on LSTM architectures, as well as the relevant TensorFlow Keras documentation which can provide better understanding of the underlying concepts and API components. Furthermore, exploring more advanced recurrent neural network implementations found in research papers, particularly those relating to sequence modeling and recurrent layers, might be fruitful. Finally, consulting blog posts or open-source repositories (with appropriate diligence as to their credibility) could provide further insight into variations on this approach. While the `keras.experimental` namespace can offer interesting features, it's critical to be aware that its contents are subject to modification or removal, underscoring the necessity of flexible and adaptive coding strategies.
