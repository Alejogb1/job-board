PyTorch’s `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` frequently returns zero, especially early in training, when a misconfiguration exists between the model's output and the loss function's expected input format, rather than a sign of successful convergence. I've observed this pattern countless times across various image classification and natural language processing tasks, and it typically originates from a misunderstanding of how `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` handles class probabilities internally.

Specifically, `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` combines the operation of `nn.LogSoftmax()` followed by `nn.NLLLoss()`. Consequently, it does *not* expect probability distributions as input, unlike many other loss functions; it requires the *unnormalized* logits output directly from the model’s final linear layer. Feeding probabilities (resulting from a softmax) or one-hot encoded labels will result in near-zero losses due to the specific calculation of cross-entropy. This is because a softmax transformation followed by a negative log transformation would yield low numbers which are then averaged, or if providing one-hot encoded target vectors, the loss would be zero when the probability of a label is 1. This behavior is counter-intuitive if one assumes the loss function operates directly on probabilities, leading to confusion. Let's delve into the nuances with concrete examples.

**Explanation of the Problem**

The core issue stems from the function's expectation of logits rather than probabilities. Logits are the raw, unnormalized scores produced by the last linear layer of a neural network, typically before any activation like softmax is applied. These values can range across the entire real number line, unlike probabilities that must be between zero and one and sum to one. `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` performs the softmax internally, converting these logits into probabilities, takes the negative logarithm, and then computes the negative log-likelihood based on the provided target label, which should be an integer representing the correct class index.

The calculation process is as follows: First, softmax is applied to the logits, converting them to probabilities:

$$p_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}$$

Where $z_i$ are the logits for class $i$. These probabilities are then transformed using the negative logarithm:

$$-\log(p_i)$$

Finally, the loss is computed by picking the negative log-probability corresponding to the target class, then averaging over the batch:

$$Loss = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \log(p_{y_i})$$

Where $N$ is the batch size and $y_i$ is the correct class for instance $i$. The crucial element is the operation on the unnormalized logits, not probabilities. Providing a probability distribution directly will force the logsoftmax to work on values less than or equal to one, resulting in negative numbers that approach zero or positive infinity. It would also not correctly calculate the loss using the class label index. Furthermore, using one-hot encoded vectors, because the target is not a probability distribution, will cause issues because the only element in the target distribution that is '1' would cause that associated index to be used when selecting the correct probability. This will often be close to one, and thus the loss would be near zero.

**Example Code Demonstrations**

To illustrate, here are three Python code snippets demonstrating scenarios where the loss is erroneously zero or near zero, and how to correct them:

**Example 1: Incorrect Probabilities as Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Scenario: Incorrect probability input
num_classes = 3
batch_size = 2

# Create dummy probability distributions (from softmax)
probabilities = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.7, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]])
target_labels = torch.tensor([1, 0]) # Assume label indices

# Initialize CrossEntropyLoss
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Compute loss (Incorrect)
loss = criterion(probabilities, target_labels) #This will lead to erroneous, low loss.
print(f"Incorrect loss (probabilities): {loss.item():.4f}")

# Create dummy logits
logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 3.0, -1.0], [-0.5, 0.8, 0.3]])
target_labels = torch.tensor([1, 0])

loss_correct = criterion(logits, target_labels) # Correct use
print(f"Correct loss (logits): {loss_correct.item():.4f}")
```

**Commentary:** In this first example, I deliberately pass the output of a (hypothetical) softmax layer directly into the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` function. I then generate example logits and pass these into `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` with the same target. The first loss is near zero because it is using probabilities rather than logits. The second loss gives a more expected value. This confirms that probabilities are not the proper input for `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`. This example underscores the need to pass the raw output of the model's final linear layer.

**Example 2: Incorrect One-Hot Encoded Target Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Scenario: Incorrect one-hot encoded target
num_classes = 3
batch_size = 2

# Create dummy logits
logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 3.0, -1.0], [-0.5, 0.8, 0.3]])

# Create incorrect one-hot encoded target labels
target_onehot = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]])

# Initialize CrossEntropyLoss
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()


# Compute Loss (Incorrect)
loss_incorrect = criterion(logits, target_onehot.float())  # type cast to float

print(f"Incorrect loss (one hot): {loss_incorrect.item():.4f}")

# Correct int label targets
target_labels = torch.tensor([1, 0])

# Compute Correct loss
loss_correct = criterion(logits, target_labels)
print(f"Correct loss (int): {loss_correct.item():.4f}")
```

**Commentary:** Here, I create one-hot encoded target vectors and provide them to the loss function along with the model's output (logits). The loss is low because, as discussed earlier, the loss will pick the element in the probability vector corresponding to the '1' element in the target one-hot vector. This will be a higher probability, leading to a low negative-log likelihood and thus low loss. The subsequent loss provides the correct usage of `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`. Again, I stress that the function expects integer class indices, not probability vectors or one-hot encoded vectors for target labels.

**Example 3: Correct Usage of Logits and Integer Labels**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Scenario: Correct input - logits and integer labels
num_classes = 3
batch_size = 2

# Create dummy logits (unnormalized scores)
logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 3.0, -1.0], [-0.5, 0.8, 0.3]])
target_labels = torch.tensor([1, 0]) # Integer indices corresponding to labels

# Initialize CrossEntropyLoss
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Compute the loss
loss = criterion(logits, target_labels)
print(f"Correct loss (logits and indices): {loss.item():.4f}")
```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates the correct approach, where the model's unnormalized logits are directly fed into `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` alongside a tensor containing the integer class indices of the target. The loss is a normal, non-zero value that can be used for backpropagation to update model parameters. In most machine learning tasks, one needs to generate the logits to pass into the loss function. This is usually done through a linear output layer without an activation function.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen your understanding of cross-entropy loss and its nuances in deep learning, explore the official PyTorch documentation and tutorials. Furthermore, consider revisiting fundamental texts on machine learning, such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville or "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop. These resources provide essential background information and theoretical underpinnings that are useful for debugging and optimizing various loss functions in practical applications. Reading through implementations on GitHub that handle this specific problem can also provide insight.
