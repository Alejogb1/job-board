Ordered dictionaries, while preserving insertion order, don't inherently align with the column-oriented structure of a pandas DataFrame. I've encountered numerous scenarios, particularly when dealing with API responses or parsing structured logs, where the data arrives as an `OrderedDict`. Directly converting this to a DataFrame can be less efficient than utilizing pandas’ intended design patterns if done naively. The key is understanding the underlying data layout and leverage the correct pandas DataFrame constructor.

A typical approach might involve iterating over the `OrderedDict` and appending rows to a list, which is subsequently used to create the DataFrame. This, however, leads to poor performance when dealing with even moderately sized datasets. Pandas' column-oriented nature benefits greatly from data being provided in a column-wise manner directly to the DataFrame constructor. We can achieve this transformation through strategic list comprehension.

The inefficiency stems from the row-wise construction when iteratively building a list of rows first. Each row append operation causes Python to reallocate memory, which escalates with dataset size. Pandas is optimized for receiving data as lists of columns. When creating a DataFrame from a list of rows, it first iterates through the entire list and then further transforms it to match its columnar format, incurring additional processing time. Therefore, it's more efficient to transform the `OrderedDict` into a columnar format before passing it to the pandas constructor.

The most direct and performant solution involves extracting keys and values separately from the `OrderedDict` to form the dataframe’s column data. This method leverages pandas' internal efficiencies.

Here's how it looks in practice. Consider an `OrderedDict` representing employee data:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import pandas as pd

data = OrderedDict([
    ('employee_id', [101, 102, 103]),
    ('name', ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']),
    ('department', ['Engineering', 'Sales', 'Marketing'])
])

# Efficient Creation
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

In this example, the `OrderedDict`'s keys directly become column names and its values form the column data. Pandas can directly use this columnar data to construct the DataFrame. This is significantly faster for larger datasets compared to manual row-wise construction.

Let us consider a more complex scenario where the `OrderedDict` is nested, such that each value is a list of dictionaries instead of lists of values directly. This type of data structure often results from the parsing of JSON structures or similar serialized data formats. In this case, one can't create a pandas DataFrame directly as in the previous example; we must first flatten this structure.

Here’s a situation demonstrating such a case:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import pandas as pd

data = OrderedDict([
    ('employee_id', [{'id': 101}, {'id': 102}, {'id': 103}]),
    ('details', [
       {'name': 'Alice', 'department': 'Engineering'},
       {'name': 'Bob', 'department': 'Sales'},
       {'name': 'Charlie', 'department': 'Marketing'}
       ])
])

# Flattening the data before creating DataFrame
flattened_data = {}
for key, values in data.items():
    if isinstance(values[0], dict):
      flattened_data[key] = [d.get(list(d.keys())[0]) for d in values]
    else:
      flattened_data[key] = values

df = pd.DataFrame(flattened_data)

print(df)

```

In this example, we cannot directly pass the original `OrderedDict` to the DataFrame constructor as the values are lists of dictionaries. We first flatten this data structure. In the code above, for each key-value pair in the `OrderedDict`, we check if the first element of value list is a dictionary. If so, we extract a single value from every dictionary using a list comprehension and append these values to a list, which we assign back to the key in `flattened_data`. Finally, a pandas DataFrame is created from this flattened structure. The `get(list(d.keys())[0])` method ensures that we only extract values from the dictionary values using the first key in the dictionary.

Finally, consider a scenario in which the OrderedDict contains values which are also ordered dicts.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import pandas as pd

data = OrderedDict([
    ('employee_id', OrderedDict([('id', [101, 102, 103])])),
    ('details', OrderedDict([
        ('name', ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']),
        ('department', ['Engineering', 'Sales', 'Marketing'])
    ]))
])

# Transform nested OrderedDict to flat dict
flattened_data = {}
for key, value in data.items():
  if isinstance(value, OrderedDict):
    for k, v in value.items():
      flattened_data[f"{key}_{k}"] = v
  else:
    flattened_data[key] = value


df = pd.DataFrame(flattened_data)
print(df)
```
Here, each entry is an `OrderedDict`. We transform this structure by iterating through the keys in the original `OrderedDict`. If the value is another `OrderedDict` we iterate over it and merge the nested key in a new dictionary with a modified key. If it isn't, then we include it directly in the flattened dictionary. This resulting dictionary is suitable for creating a pandas DataFrame.

For further exploration and a deeper understanding of efficient data manipulation, I recommend consulting the official pandas documentation, which covers various data structures, including DataFrame creation and manipulation. The book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney provides in-depth knowledge on data wrangling with pandas. Additionally, the "Effective Pandas" blog offers practical tips and strategies for enhancing data analysis workflows and avoiding common pitfalls. These resources contain information on diverse data loading strategies, which can further enhance efficiency when handling large datasets and different file formats.
