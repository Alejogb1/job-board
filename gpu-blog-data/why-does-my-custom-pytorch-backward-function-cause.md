The instability you're observing in your custom PyTorch backward function, manifesting as exploding loss within a seemingly simple Mean Squared Error (MSE) example, likely stems from numerical instability during gradient computation, exacerbated by the interaction between your custom function and automatic differentiation.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue numerous times while working on complex deep learning models, particularly when dealing with non-standard activation functions or loss calculations.  The problem often isn't immediately apparent in the forward pass but becomes strikingly obvious during backpropagation.

The core issue lies in the manner in which PyTorch's automatic differentiation (autograd) engine handles gradients.  Autograd utilizes computational graphs to track operations and compute gradients efficiently.  However, your custom backward function might introduce operations that amplify numerical errors significantly during the chain rule application, leading to gradient explosion. This can happen if the gradients computed within your custom function are excessively large or contain unbounded elements.  Factors such as ill-conditioned matrices, unbounded activation function derivatives, or improper scaling within the custom function all contribute to this.

Let's break down this problem through explanation and illustrative examples.  The standard MSE loss calculation is numerically stable.  The problem emerges when introducing a custom function into the loss calculation, altering the gradient flow.

**1. Explanation: Sources of Numerical Instability in Custom Backward Functions**

The primary culprits in gradient explosion within custom backward functions are:

* **Large Gradient Values:**  If your custom function generates gradients with magnitudes significantly larger than the gradients generated by other parts of the model, these large values will propagate through the computational graph, potentially leading to overflow.

* **Ill-Conditioned Matrices:** If your custom function involves matrix operations (e.g., inversions or solving linear systems), and these matrices are ill-conditioned (meaning their condition number is very high), the resulting gradients will be highly sensitive to small perturbations in the input data, leading to numerical instability.

* **Unbounded Derivatives:**  If the derivative of your custom function is unbounded or grows rapidly with the input, even small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the gradient, contributing to explosion.

* **Incorrect Gradient Calculation:**  Simple errors in the mathematical derivation of the gradient within the custom function will obviously lead to incorrect and possibly explosive gradients.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's consider three scenarios, progressively revealing the sources of instability.  These examples focus on a simplified MSE context for clarity.

**Example 1:  Excessively Large Gradient due to Unscaled Feature**

```python
import torch

# Define a custom function with an unbounded gradient
def custom_function(x):
  return torch.exp(100 * x)

# Sample data
x = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0]])

# Calculate loss with custom function
loss = torch.mean((custom_function(x) - y)**2)

# Calculate gradients
loss.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

In this example, the exponential function with a large scaling factor (100) produces unbounded derivatives.  The gradient calculation will likely lead to `inf` or `nan` values, indicating gradient explosion.

**Example 2: Ill-conditioned Matrix in Custom Function**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Define a custom function involving a matrix operation
def custom_matrix_op(x):
  A = torch.tensor([[1e-6, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]])  # Ill-conditioned matrix
  b = torch.tensor([x, 1.0])
  sol = torch.linalg.solve(A, b)
  return sol[0]

x = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0]])

loss = torch.mean((custom_matrix_op(x) - y)**2)
loss.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

Here, the matrix `A` is intentionally ill-conditioned. The `torch.linalg.solve` function might be unstable, leading to large and inaccurate gradients.  Note the potential for numerical instability due to the very small value (1e-6) in the matrix.

**Example 3: Incorrect Gradient Calculation**

```python
import torch

# A custom function with an incorrect gradient calculation
def custom_incorrect_gradient(x):
  return x**3

x = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0]])

loss = torch.mean((custom_incorrect_gradient(x) - y)**2)
loss.backward(create_graph=True)  # create_graph for second-order gradients

# Incorrect calculation of gradient in the custom backward pass (Illustrative)
x.grad.data = 2*x.data # Incorrect gradient (should be 6*x**2)
print(x.grad)


loss.backward() #Attempt second-order gradient calculation leading to further instability
print(x.grad)
```

This demonstrates how a simple error in the gradient calculation in a backward pass can cause instability, particularly when higher-order gradients are involved. The incorrect gradient calculation will be amplified during subsequent backpropagation steps.  Note the use of `create_graph=True` to allow computation of higher-order gradients, highlighting the cascading effect of errors.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

I strongly recommend reviewing the PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation and custom autograd functions. Additionally, explore numerical analysis texts focusing on stability of numerical methods and error propagation.  Finally, a solid grounding in linear algebra and calculus, specifically concerning vector and matrix calculus, is crucial for understanding and debugging such issues.  Thoroughly review the mathematical derivations for your custom function's gradient to ensure accuracy.  Consider using gradient clipping techniques as a mitigation strategy to control gradient magnitudes, although this is a bandaid rather than a solution for underlying numerical instability.  Careful attention to scaling and numerical precision is key.
