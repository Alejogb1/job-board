The core challenge in solving Pyomo scheduling problems with non-continuous objective functions lies in the inherent incompatibility between many standard solvers and the discrete nature of such objectives.  My experience working on large-scale resource allocation projects within the energy sector highlighted this precisely.  While continuous formulations, readily handled by solvers like IPOPT or SNOPT, offer computational efficiency, they often fail to capture the realistic, often stepwise or integer-constrained, nature of real-world costs and penalties.  This necessitates the use of Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) solvers or the careful reformulation of the problem.

**1.  Explanation of the Problem and Solution Approaches**

A continuous objective function assumes that the objective value changes smoothly with changes in decision variables.  However, in scheduling, costs might involve fixed setup charges (e.g., starting a machine), step changes in energy pricing, or discrete choices regarding resource allocation.  These discontinuities prevent the direct application of gradient-based optimization techniques used by continuous solvers.

Several approaches can mitigate this:

* **Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP):** This is the most direct approach. MINLP solvers, such as BARON or Couenne, explicitly handle both continuous and integer variables, allowing for the direct modeling of non-continuous objective functions.  The trade-off is significantly increased computational complexity compared to continuous optimization. Problem size and the structure of the non-continuous elements greatly influence solution time.

* **Piecewise Linear Approximation:** If the non-continuous function is relatively smooth, it can be approximated using piecewise linear segments. This transforms the non-linear problem into a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, which are generally easier to solve than MINLP problems.  The accuracy of the solution depends on the granularity of the approximation; finer approximations increase accuracy but also problem size and complexity.

* **Reformulation:**  Sometimes, clever reformulation of the objective function or constraints can eliminate the non-continuity. This might involve introducing auxiliary variables and constraints to represent the discrete choices in a continuous manner.  This requires a deep understanding of the problem structure and often involves significant creativity.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the three approaches using a simplified scheduling problem involving two machines (A and B) and three tasks (1, 2, 3), each with a processing time and a cost. The objective is to minimize the total cost.  Note that realistic scheduling problems are substantially more complex, involving precedence constraints, resource limitations, and time windows.


**Example 1: MINLP Formulation**

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

model = ConcreteModel()

model.machines = Set(initialize=['A', 'B'])
model.tasks = Set(initialize=['1', '2', '3'])

model.processing_time = Param(model.tasks, model.machines, initialize={('1', 'A'): 2, ('1', 'B'): 3,
                                                                        ('2', 'A'): 1, ('2', 'B'): 2,
                                                                        ('3', 'A'): 4, ('3', 'B'): 1})

model.cost = Param(model.tasks, model.machines, initialize={('1', 'A'): 10, ('1', 'B'): 12,
                                                             ('2', 'A'): 8, ('2', 'B'): 9,
                                                             ('3', 'A'): 15, ('3', 'B'): 11})

model.assign = Var(model.tasks, model.machines, domain=Binary)

model.obj = Objective(expr=sum(model.cost[t,m] * model.assign[t,m] for t in model.tasks for m in model.machines), sense=minimize)

model.one_machine_per_task = ConstraintList()
for t in model.tasks:
    model.one_machine_per_task.add(sum(model.assign[t,m] for m in model.machines) == 1)

# Solve using a MINLP solver (e.g., BARON)
solver = SolverFactory('baron')
results = solver.solve(model)
model.display()
```

This code directly models the problem as an MINLP using binary variables (`model.assign`) to indicate task assignment.  BARON, a robust MINLP solver, is then used to find the optimal solution.  Note the inclusion of a constraint ensuring that each task is assigned to exactly one machine.


**Example 2: Piecewise Linear Approximation**

Let's assume a non-continuous cost function for machine A, where the cost increases stepwise depending on the total processing time allocated to it.  We can approximate this using piecewise linear segments.  This requires a more sophisticated model, potentially leveraging functions from Pyomo's `Piecewise` module.


**Example 3: Reformulation -  Illustrative Example (Conceptual)**

Consider a scenario where the cost depends on whether a task is completed before a certain deadline.  Instead of directly including the deadline in the objective as a discontinuity (e.g., a penalty if the deadline is missed), we can introduce a binary variable representing whether the deadline is met and incorporate it into the cost function linearly.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of MINLP solvers, consult specialized texts on mathematical optimization.  Pyomo's documentation provides comprehensive guidance on model building and solver interfaces.  Studying the practical aspects of constraint programming might be advantageous in advanced scheduling scenarios.  Finally, textbooks covering linear and nonlinear programming provide the fundamental mathematical background necessary for effective problem formulation and solution strategy selection.  Understanding duality theory can be particularly helpful in analyzing the sensitivity and feasibility of complex optimization problems.
