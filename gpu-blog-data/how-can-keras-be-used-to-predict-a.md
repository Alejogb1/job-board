The challenge of predicting a specific digit within a larger numerical string using Keras necessitates a shift from standard classification tasks that target a single, categorical output. Instead, we're dealing with a sequence-to-sequence problem, where the input is a numerical string and the output is a single digit within that string, considered as a separate prediction task. This requires treating the number as a sequence of individual digits, often encoded and processed using recurrent or convolutional neural network architectures before isolating the target digit and making a classification on the possible outcomes (0-9).

I've previously encountered this scenario while building a system to predict specific digits in handwritten postal codes from image scans, where accuracy beyond just recognizing the entire number was essential. In that context, a multi-stage process, incorporating both image processing and sequence-based analysis, proved to be the most effective method. Adapting this methodology for the present, non-image-based problem, I'd first focus on generating a suitable dataset: numerical strings of varying lengths, with a corresponding label for each string indicating which digit position to target and the true digit at that position.

A basic feedforward network alone wouldn't effectively capture the sequential dependencies inherent in a numerical string; the network would treat each digit as an independent feature, neglecting the crucial positional information. This is where recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs or GRUs, or alternatively, 1D convolutional networks (Conv1D), become advantageous. These architectures can process the numerical string one digit at a time, or a small window of digits at a time, respectively, learning the relationships between digits and their positions.

Here’s a concrete strategy: I’d encode each digit into a numerical representation, either as a one-hot vector or an embedding. For a simple problem, one-hot encoding, representing each digit from 0 to 9 as a separate 10-dimensional vector (e.g., 0=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and 1=[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and so on), is adequate. The numerical string is converted into a sequence of these encoded digits. An RNN or Conv1D layer receives this sequence as input. The length of the sequence is determined by the number of digits. Then the network learns to map the input sequence, considering the specific digit position, to the corresponding digit.

Here are three code examples outlining different approaches:

**Example 1: LSTM-based Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Hyperparameters
max_seq_length = 10
vocab_size = 10
embedding_dim = 64
lstm_units = 128
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32

#Generate Dummy Data
def generate_data(num_samples):
  X = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(num_samples, max_seq_length))
  positions = np.random.randint(0, max_seq_length, size = num_samples)
  y = np.array([X[i,pos] for i,pos in enumerate(positions)])
  positions_encoded = np.eye(max_seq_length)[positions]
  return X, positions_encoded, y

X, positions, y = generate_data(10000)
#Model Creation
input_layer = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,))
embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)
lstm_layer = LSTM(units=lstm_units, return_sequences=False)(embedding_layer) # No need to return sequences here
position_input = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,))
concat_layer = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([lstm_layer, position_input])
output_layer = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(concat_layer)

model = Model(inputs=[input_layer, position_input], outputs=output_layer)
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Reshape y
y_reshaped = y.reshape(-1, 1)
#Training Model
model.fit([X, positions], y_reshaped, epochs=num_epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2)
```

This example utilizes an LSTM to capture the temporal dependencies between digits. A separate input is created for the position of the target digit to focus prediction. After embedding the digits, the LSTM layer's output, representing the hidden state of the sequence, is concatenated with a one-hot encoded representation of the target digit position. This combined representation is then passed through a fully connected layer for the final classification, the goal being the prediction of the target digit. The `return_sequences=False` ensures that the LSTM produces only the final hidden state, streamlining computation. A `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss is used since our target ‘y’ are integers.

**Example 2: Conv1D Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Conv1D, GlobalMaxPooling1D, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Hyperparameters
max_seq_length = 10
vocab_size = 10
embedding_dim = 64
filters = 128
kernel_size = 3
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
#Generate Dummy Data
def generate_data(num_samples):
  X = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(num_samples, max_seq_length))
  positions = np.random.randint(0, max_seq_length, size = num_samples)
  y = np.array([X[i,pos] for i,pos in enumerate(positions)])
  positions_encoded = np.eye(max_seq_length)[positions]
  return X, positions_encoded, y

X, positions, y = generate_data(10000)
# Model Creation
input_layer = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,))
embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)
conv_layer = Conv1D(filters=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, activation='relu')(embedding_layer)
max_pooling_layer = GlobalMaxPooling1D()(conv_layer)
position_input = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,))
concat_layer = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([max_pooling_layer, position_input])
output_layer = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(concat_layer)

model = Model(inputs=[input_layer, position_input], outputs=output_layer)
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Reshape y
y_reshaped = y.reshape(-1, 1)
# Training Model
model.fit([X, positions], y_reshaped, epochs=num_epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2)
```

Here, I've employed Conv1D layers for sequence processing. This architecture uses convolutional filters to learn local patterns within the numerical sequence, making it effective at capturing positional features, though not as explicitly temporal as an RNN. The  `GlobalMaxPooling1D` layer is used to extract the most important features after the convolution layer. Similar to the LSTM example, the output is concatenated with a one-hot encoded version of the target digit position, enhancing the model's ability to target prediction at a certain position.

**Example 3: Embedding the Target Position**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Hyperparameters
max_seq_length = 10
vocab_size = 10
embedding_dim = 64
lstm_units = 128
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32

#Generate Dummy Data
def generate_data(num_samples):
  X = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(num_samples, max_seq_length))
  positions = np.random.randint(0, max_seq_length, size = num_samples)
  y = np.array([X[i,pos] for i,pos in enumerate(positions)])
  return X, positions, y
X, positions, y = generate_data(10000)
# Model Creation
input_layer = Input(shape=(max_seq_length,))
embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)
lstm_layer = LSTM(units=lstm_units, return_sequences=False)(embedding_layer)
position_input = Input(shape=(1,))
position_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=max_seq_length, output_dim=embedding_dim)(position_input)
flattened_position = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(position_embedding)
concat_layer = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([lstm_layer, flattened_position])
output_layer = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(concat_layer)

model = Model(inputs=[input_layer, position_input], outputs=output_layer)
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Reshape y
y_reshaped = y.reshape(-1, 1)
positions_reshaped = positions.reshape(-1, 1)
# Training Model
model.fit([X, positions_reshaped], y_reshaped, epochs=num_epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2)

```

This example uses an embedding layer for the target digit position rather than one-hot encoding. The single integer representing the digit position is passed through an embedding layer which produces a learnable vector that is then concatenated with the LSTM output. This allows the network to learn positional relationships in a different way than one-hot encoded representations, which can sometimes prove beneficial. It uses an identical LSTM architecture as the first example but differs in its use of positional embedding.

The above examples are simple implementations; more sophisticated models could include attention mechanisms, bidirectional RNNs, or deeper convolutional layers for more complex prediction scenarios. Data augmentation or different pre-processing techniques would also assist in specific cases.

For further exploration, I’d recommend focusing on research regarding sequence-to-sequence learning with attention mechanisms for more advanced applications of digit prediction. Resources dedicated to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) specifically would also be valuable for understanding the intricacies of LSTM layers. Additionally, convolutional neural network literature concentrating on their use in sequence analysis could be useful for applying Conv1D layers with more effective configurations.
