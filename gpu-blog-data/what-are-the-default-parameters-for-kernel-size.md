The `Conv2D` layer in Keras, based on my extensive experience implementing convolutional neural networks for image processing tasks, does not possess inherent default values for kernel size, padding, and stride that are universally applicable.  Instead, these parameters are explicitly required during layer instantiation, and failing to specify them results in a `TypeError`.  This contrasts with some other Keras layers which might infer defaults based on input shape. The assumption of default parameters often leads to confusion and subtle bugs; explicitly defining these hyperparameters is crucial for reproducible results and understanding the convolutional operation's impact on the feature maps.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `Conv2D` layer performs a convolution operation, sliding a kernel (a small matrix of weights) across an input feature map.  The key parameters governing this operation are:

* **`kernel_size`:** This defines the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the convolutional kernel. It's specified as a tuple `(height, width)`, e.g., `(3, 3)` for a 3x3 kernel.  This kernel's weights are learned during the training process.  Larger kernels capture larger receptive fields, potentially capturing more context but requiring more parameters and computation. Smaller kernels are computationally cheaper but might miss crucial spatial relationships.

* **`strides`:** This determines the step size by which the kernel moves across the input feature map.  It is also a tuple `(vertical_stride, horizontal_stride)`. A stride of (1, 1) implies that the kernel moves one pixel at a time, while a stride of (2, 2) means it skips every other pixel. Larger strides reduce the output feature map's spatial dimensions, resulting in a coarser representation but with decreased computational cost.

* **`padding`:** This parameter controls how the input feature map's boundaries are handled.  The common options are:
    * **`'valid'`:** No padding is applied.  The output feature map's dimensions are reduced based on the kernel size and stride.  This can lead to significant information loss at the boundaries.
    * **`'same'`:** Padding is added to ensure the output feature map has the same spatial dimensions as the input (or as close as possible, given the stride). The exact amount of padding depends on the kernel size and stride, calculated internally by Keras to achieve this 'same' size output.  This is often preferred when preserving spatial information is vital.

The absence of default values for these hyperparameters forces the user to consciously choose these parameters according to the specific needs of their model architecture and the nature of the input data.  The choice directly affects the receptive field, computational complexity, and the resulting feature maps' spatial resolution.  Incorrect selection can lead to issues ranging from decreased performance to outright model failure.  My experience shows that careful consideration of these parameters is often crucial for optimal results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Small Kernel, Valid Padding, Unit Stride**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='valid',
                        input_shape=(28, 28, 1), activation='relu')
])

# Commentary: This example utilizes a small 3x3 kernel, 'valid' padding (no padding added), and a unit stride.
# The output will be smaller than the input due to the 'valid' padding.  Suitable for detecting local features.
# The input_shape is explicitly defined (28x28 grayscale image).
```

**Example 2: Larger Kernel, Same Padding, Stride 2**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same',
                        input_shape=(128, 128, 3), activation='relu')
])

# Commentary: This example employs a larger 5x5 kernel, 'same' padding to maintain the spatial dimension (approximately),
# and a stride of 2.  The output will have roughly half the spatial resolution of the input, reducing computation.
# This configuration is common in downsampling layers to reduce the feature map size. The input is a 128x128 RGB image.
```

**Example 3:  Multiple Convolutions with Varying Parameters**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same',
                        input_shape=(64, 64, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='valid', activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1), padding='same', activation='relu')
])

# Commentary: This demonstrates a more complex scenario involving multiple convolutional layers with different parameter settings.
# The first layer maintains spatial resolution ('same' padding), the second downsamples significantly ('valid' padding, stride 2),
# and the third layer again maintains spatial resolution.  This architectural pattern is often employed in deeper CNNs.
# Note the layered approach with increasing filter countsâ€”a common strategy in CNN design.  The input is a 64x64 RGB image.
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would suggest consulting the official Keras documentation on the `Conv2D` layer.  A good textbook on deep learning would provide comprehensive coverage of convolutional neural networks and the significance of these hyperparameters.  Finally, reviewing research papers focused on CNN architectures and their design choices will reveal best practices and common parameter selections in various contexts.  Understanding the mathematical background of convolutions is also beneficial for informed hyperparameter tuning.  Extensive experimentation and analysis of results on diverse datasets are crucial for mastering this aspect of CNN design.  My own expertise has been honed through years of dedicated practice and exploration of these very topics.
