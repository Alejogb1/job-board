The abrupt termination of a Jupyter Notebook kernel upon importing Keras is rarely due to a single, easily identifiable cause.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous projects, involving diverse hardware configurations and TensorFlow/Theano backends, points to a confluence of factors, primarily stemming from resource contention and incompatibility between Keras, its backend, and the underlying system environment.  The problem manifests most frequently when dealing with GPU acceleration, but also surfaces in CPU-only setups, albeit less dramatically.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The kernel death isn't a direct consequence of the `import keras` statement itself, but rather a cascading failure triggered by actions performed during the Keras initialization process.  This initialization involves several steps:

* **Backend Selection:** Keras dynamically chooses a backend (TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK).  If the selected backend is not properly installed or configured, or if there's a conflict between multiple backend installations, the initialization can fail catastrophically. This often manifests as a segmentation fault or a memory allocation error, leading to kernel termination.  The lack of robust error handling within the backend's initialization routine exacerbates this, resulting in a silent kernel crash instead of a user-friendly error message.

* **GPU Resource Allocation:** When using a GPU backend (most commonly TensorFlow with CUDA), Keras attempts to allocate GPU memory. Insufficient available GPU memory, driver conflicts, or improper CUDA installation can lead to allocation failures and subsequent kernel crashes.  Furthermore, even if sufficient memory *exists*, faulty CUDA drivers or incorrect CUDA toolkit versions can cause silent failures during memory allocation, again resulting in a kernel death.

* **Dependency Conflicts:**  Keras relies on numerous dependencies, including NumPy, SciPy, and the chosen backend.  Version mismatches or conflicts between these dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior during initialization, potentially triggering kernel crashes.  This is particularly prevalent in environments where multiple Python installations or virtual environments coexist, leading to conflicting library versions being loaded.

* **System-Level Issues:**  While less common, problems such as insufficient system RAM, a faulty driver for the graphics card, or even limitations of the operating system's memory management can indirectly contribute to kernel crashes upon Keras import.  These issues often manifest as out-of-memory errors or segmentation faults, effectively killing the kernel.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating a Backend Conflict:**

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "tensorflow" # Explicitly setting the backend

try:
    import keras
    print("Keras imported successfully.")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error importing Keras: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

* **Commentary:**  This example explicitly sets the Keras backend to TensorFlow.  If TensorFlow isn't properly installed or a conflict exists with another backend (e.g., Theano), the `import keras` statement will likely fail. The `try-except` block provides more informative error handling than a bare `import`. Note that even a properly installed Tensorflow might not work, if there is another installation in the system path causing conflict.


**Example 2: Checking GPU Availability and Memory:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
try:
  physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
  if physical_devices:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
      print("GPU available and memory growth enabled.")
  else:
      print("No GPU found. Using CPU.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error configuring GPU: {e}")

try:
  import keras
  print("Keras imported successfully.")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error importing Keras: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

* **Commentary:** This example first checks for GPU availability using TensorFlow.  If a GPU is found, it enables memory growth, allowing Keras to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed, mitigating out-of-memory errors.  The error handling is crucial in identifying potential GPU configuration problems. This approach avoids allocating all available GPU memory at startup, reducing the likelihood of immediate failure.


**Example 3:  Managing Virtual Environments:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install Keras and its dependencies within the virtual environment
pip install tensorflow keras numpy scipy

# Run your Jupyter Notebook within the activated virtual environment
jupyter notebook
```

* **Commentary:** This example demonstrates the use of virtual environments, a critical technique for isolating project dependencies and preventing conflicts.  By creating a dedicated virtual environment, you ensure that the specific versions of Keras and its dependencies are consistent and don't clash with other projects or system-wide installations.  This dramatically minimizes dependency-related problems leading to kernel crashes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow and Keras documentation.  Consult the troubleshooting sections within these documents to address specific errors encountered during installation and usage.  A comprehensive guide to Python virtual environments is invaluable.  Familiarize yourself with the nuances of CUDA and cuDNN installation and configuration if using a GPU.  Understanding basic Linux system administration (if applicable) is beneficial for diagnosing low-level system problems that may be affecting Keras.  Finally, a solid grasp of Python exception handling and debugging techniques will greatly aid in resolving kernel death issues.
