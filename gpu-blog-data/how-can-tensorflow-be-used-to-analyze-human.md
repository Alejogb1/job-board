Analyzing human body angle and rotation using TensorFlow involves leveraging machine learning, specifically computer vision techniques, to interpret image or video data. I’ve spent a considerable portion of my career developing systems that use this technology, often starting with foundational pose estimation models. The core process is threefold: data acquisition, model training or leveraging a pre-trained model, and subsequent analysis of the model’s output to calculate angles and rotations. This isn’t a trivial task, as variations in lighting, clothing, and perspective can significantly affect accuracy.

The initial step involves acquiring data suitable for training or utilizing a model. This typically means either obtaining images or video recordings that contain individuals performing movements of interest. In the case of training a custom model, this data must be meticulously annotated, with specific body keypoints (joints) marked on each image frame. Common keypoint annotations might include the nose, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. The number of keypoints depends on the desired precision and complexity of analysis. If using a pre-trained model, annotation requirements are eliminated, but careful consideration must be given to how accurately the pre-trained model aligns with the specific body movements in the target data.

Once data is prepared, the next phase involves deploying TensorFlow to either train a model or utilize an existing one. Models like those available through TensorFlow Hub or the OpenPose implementations provide pre-trained capabilities for pose estimation. When choosing a model, it's crucial to evaluate its performance on a held-out validation dataset. This avoids overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well to unseen instances. If training a model, the input would be annotated images and the output would be predicted keypoint locations. These are typically represented as (x,y) pixel coordinates for each keypoint in the image or a normalized value in the [0,1] range based on image dimensions. If using a pre-trained model, the output would be similar, derived from processing input images.

The extracted keypoints are, in essence, raw data, not angles or rotations. These require post-processing to perform calculations. Here, trigonometry and vector algebra are key tools. For calculating angles, the positions of three keypoints that form the vertices of an angle are needed. For example, to find the angle of the elbow, the positions of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist are required. Vectors are constructed by subtracting the position of one point from another, and the dot product of these vectors can be used to determine the angle using the arc cosine function. Similarly, rotations can be defined around a specific axis, such as the shoulder joint, and vector calculations are used to determine the change in orientation with respect to a reference position.

Let’s explore code examples to demonstrate:

**Example 1: Calculating the Angle between three points (2D).**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def calculate_angle(point_a, point_b, point_c):
    """Calculates the angle formed by three points.

    Args:
        point_a: Tensor representing (x, y) coordinates of point A.
        point_b: Tensor representing (x, y) coordinates of point B (vertex).
        point_c: Tensor representing (x, y) coordinates of point C.

    Returns:
        Angle in degrees between vectors AB and BC.
    """

    vector_ab = tf.cast(point_a - point_b, tf.float32)
    vector_bc = tf.cast(point_c - point_b, tf.float32)

    dot_product = tf.reduce_sum(vector_ab * vector_bc)

    magnitude_ab = tf.norm(vector_ab)
    magnitude_bc = tf.norm(vector_bc)

    cosine_angle = dot_product / (magnitude_ab * magnitude_bc)
    angle_radians = tf.acos(tf.clip_by_value(cosine_angle, -1.0, 1.0))
    angle_degrees = tf.degrees(angle_radians)

    return angle_degrees

# Example usage:  Tensorflow tensors representing pixel coordinates

point_a = tf.constant([10, 20], dtype=tf.int32) # Example shoulder position
point_b = tf.constant([30, 40], dtype=tf.int32) # Example elbow position
point_c = tf.constant([50, 30], dtype=tf.int32) # Example wrist position


angle = calculate_angle(point_a, point_b, point_c)
print(f"Angle (degrees): {angle.numpy():.2f}")
```

In this example, `calculate_angle` demonstrates how to compute the angle between two vectors originating from a single vertex (point B). The input points are represented as TensorFlow tensors. It performs vector subtraction, calculates the dot product, the magnitude of vectors, and then utilizes the inverse cosine function to determine the angle in radians, which is finally converted to degrees. The use of `tf.clip_by_value` is important to avoid potential `NaN` results from numerical imprecision when dealing with floating point cosine calculations which could go slightly outside the bounds of -1 to 1. This also makes the function more resilient with real-world data.

**Example 2: Estimating a simplified rotational orientation (2D)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def calculate_orientation(reference_vector, current_vector):
    """Calculates the angle between two vectors indicating the orientation.

    Args:
        reference_vector: Tensor representing (x, y) coordinates of a reference vector
        current_vector: Tensor representing (x,y) coordinates of a current vector

    Returns:
        Rotation angle in degrees between the reference and the current vectors.
    """

    ref_normalized = tf.math.divide(reference_vector, tf.norm(tf.cast(reference_vector, dtype=tf.float32)))
    cur_normalized = tf.math.divide(current_vector, tf.norm(tf.cast(current_vector, dtype=tf.float32)))

    # Using atan2 to get the angle respecting quadrant.
    ref_angle = tf.atan2(ref_normalized[1], ref_normalized[0])
    cur_angle = tf.atan2(cur_normalized[1], cur_normalized[0])

    rotation = (cur_angle - ref_angle)
    rotation_degrees = tf.degrees(rotation)
    return rotation_degrees

# Example usage:

reference_vector = tf.constant([1, 0], dtype=tf.int32) # Reference Vector
current_vector = tf.constant([0, 1], dtype=tf.int32) # Rotated current vector

orientation = calculate_orientation(reference_vector, current_vector)
print(f"Rotation Angle (degrees): {orientation.numpy():.2f}")
```

This example function, `calculate_orientation`, calculates the rotational difference between a *reference* vector and the *current* vector. Normalizing the vectors allows us to compute the rotation independent of scale, and the use of the `arctan2` ensures proper calculation across all quadrants. The result can be interpreted as the rotation of the limb represented by the vector with respect to a reference state.

**Example 3: Applying the function to keypoints extracted from a model output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# Assume that the keypoint extraction has already happened, and this is just processing
# Typically the output from a pose estimation model such as MoveNet.

def analyze_pose(keypoints_tensor):
  """Analyzes pose based on keypoints
     Args:
        keypoints_tensor: a tensor of shape (n, 2) where n represents the number of keypoints
                          and each keypoint is described by (x,y)

    Returns:
      dictionary containing calculated values
  """

  #Assume Keypoints are ordered nose, left shoulder, right shoulder, left elbow, right elbow,
  #                                      left wrist, right wrist, left hip, right hip
  #                                      left knee, right knee, left ankle, right ankle
  
  left_shoulder = keypoints_tensor[1]
  right_shoulder = keypoints_tensor[2]

  #For this example, let's assume a known reference vector - could be precalculated from calibration frames.
  reference_shoulder = tf.constant([1, 0], dtype=tf.int32)

  left_arm_vector = tf.cast(left_elbow - left_shoulder, dtype=tf.int32)
  right_arm_vector = tf.cast(right_elbow - right_shoulder, dtype=tf.int32)

  left_elbow_angle = calculate_angle(left_shoulder, left_elbow, left_wrist)
  right_elbow_angle = calculate_angle(right_shoulder, right_elbow, right_wrist)
  left_shoulder_rotation = calculate_orientation(reference_shoulder, left_arm_vector)
  right_shoulder_rotation = calculate_orientation(reference_shoulder, right_arm_vector)

  results = {
      "left_elbow_angle": left_elbow_angle.numpy(),
      "right_elbow_angle": right_elbow_angle.numpy(),
      "left_shoulder_rotation" : left_shoulder_rotation.numpy(),
      "right_shoulder_rotation": right_shoulder_rotation.numpy()
  }

  return results

#Example Keypoints
keypoints_example = tf.constant([
        [100, 100], #Nose
        [100, 150], #left shoulder
        [200, 150], #right shoulder

pose_analysis_results = analyze_pose(keypoints_example)
print("Pose Analysis Results:")
for key, value in pose_analysis_results.items():
  print(f"{key}: {value:.2f}")

```
In this example, `analyze_pose`, demonstrates the analysis of extracted keypoints from a model such as MoveNet. It assumes the presence of such a model and is designed to receive the model's output. The code extracts the positions of various body parts such as shoulder, elbow, wrist etc. and then calculates the angles for the left and right elbows, and also the rotation of both shoulders with respect to a reference vector. This can be adapted to many different body parts and movements, and outputted as a json structure.

For further learning and resource exploration, consider examining textbooks on computer vision, deep learning, and robotics. "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville provides a comprehensive treatment of the underlying mathematical principles and algorithms. "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Szeliski is an excellent reference for understanding computer vision methodologies. Additionally, exploring the official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable when you wish to understand the nuances of API usage. Research papers published in computer vision conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV often present cutting-edge techniques and architectures that can be adapted or extended for specific needs. Lastly, open-source projects on platforms such as GitHub serve as practical examples of how pose estimation and related techniques are applied in real-world situations.
