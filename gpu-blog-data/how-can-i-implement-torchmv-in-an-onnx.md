The `torch.mv` operation, while seemingly straightforward in PyTorch, presents specific challenges when directly exporting to the ONNX format, primarily due to ONNX's limited support for named tensor dimensions. My experience in deploying PyTorch models to edge devices via ONNX highlights the necessity of understanding these intricacies to ensure successful model conversion and inference.

The crux of the issue stems from `torch.mv` being a specialized function for matrix-vector multiplication where PyTorch implicitly understands the dimension layout. However, ONNX, being a graph-based interchange format, requires explicit dimension definitions and operations. Thus, direct translation of `torch.mv` isn't always possible, necessitating a change to a more generic equivalent that ONNX can understand, typically by using the more general `torch.matmul` or, at a lower level, transposing the vector.

The standard ONNX exporter in PyTorch tries to implicitly convert `torch.mv` to `MatMul` when the input is a 2D matrix and a 1D vector. However, the crucial point is that `MatMul` requires both operands to have an explicit rank (number of dimensions). If the vector dimension is ambiguous, typically as a dynamic dimension, or not properly recognized as a single dimensional tensor, then the conversion process could fail, produce incorrect graphs, or generate warnings.

In practical terms, this implies that you must shape your input vector to a specific format before `torch.mv` is called, particularly if working with a dynamic input size for which the dimensions cannot be fully inferred by the exporter. This is often achieved through `torch.reshape`. The general strategy involves ensuring that the vector has an explicit 2D representation with a single column before multiplication. Then, using matrix multiplication with a transposed vector.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of different approaches and their implications, along with code examples:

**Approach 1: Explicit Reshape Before `torch.mv`**

This method focuses on directly modifying the tensor shape before calling the `torch.mv` function, ensuring that the vector has an explicit two-dimensional structure (specifically as a column vector, having dimensions such as (n, 1). This is often the most straightforward solution.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model_Reshape(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(Model_Reshape, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x, v):
        v = v.reshape(-1, 1) # Reshape the vector to (N, 1)
        result = torch.mv(self.linear.weight, v.squeeze()) # Squeeze after the reshape to remove extra dimension for torch.mv
        return result

# Example usage and export:
input_size = 5
hidden_size = 3
model = Model_Reshape(input_size, hidden_size)
x = torch.randn(1, input_size)
v = torch.randn(input_size)
dummy_input = (x, v)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model_reshape.onnx", verbose=True, input_names=["x", "v"],
                 output_names=["output"])
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates reshaping the input vector `v` to `(N, 1)` before it is used in `torch.mv`. This allows ONNX to recognize the dimensions clearly during the export. However, `torch.mv` is still used, which can potentially cause issues. It's generally better to replace it with a `torch.matmul` operation directly after reshaping. The `squeeze()` operation is necessary here because `torch.mv` is still being used, and requires a 1D tensor for the vector parameter, rather than the 2D we created via reshape.

**Approach 2:  Using `torch.matmul` with Vector Transpose**

This approach eliminates the `torch.mv` operation, which can lead to the previously noted issues. We rely on `torch.matmul` which is generally more compatible with ONNX. It involves transposing the vector and treating it as a matrix for multiplication.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model_Matmul(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(Model_Matmul, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x, v):
        v = v.reshape(1, -1) # Reshape v to (1, N) to make it a row vector
        result = torch.matmul(self.linear.weight, v.transpose(0, 1))  # Transpose to make it a column vector and perform matrix multiplication
        return result.squeeze() # Squeeze to make output have one dimension

# Example usage and export:
input_size = 5
hidden_size = 3
model = Model_Matmul(input_size, hidden_size)
x = torch.randn(1, input_size)
v = torch.randn(input_size)
dummy_input = (x, v)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model_matmul.onnx", verbose=True, input_names=["x", "v"],
                 output_names=["output"])
```

*Commentary:* This method directly replaces `torch.mv` with `torch.matmul`. The vector `v` is reshaped into a row vector, then transposed into a column vector, enabling us to perform matrix multiplication between the weight and the vector. The resulting tensor is squeezed to return the expected 1D result. This method is generally more reliable as `torch.matmul` has wider support and better handling of tensor ranks within the ONNX framework.

**Approach 3: Using Reshape and `torch.matmul` Directly**

This approach combines the principles of explicitly reshaping tensors and using matrix multiplication. We are reshaping our vector explicitly into the correct 2-D representation (column vector), and using `torch.matmul` instead of `torch.mv`. It is a more verbose method but explicitly makes the required operations clear.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model_Explicit(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(Model_Explicit, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x, v):
        v = v.reshape(-1,1) # Reshape the vector to have dimensions of (N, 1)
        weight_matrix = self.linear.weight # Get the weight matrix
        result = torch.matmul(weight_matrix, v) # Perform matrix multiplication using torch.matmul
        return result.squeeze() # squeeze the extra dimension and return the vector

# Example usage and export:
input_size = 5
hidden_size = 3
model = Model_Explicit(input_size, hidden_size)
x = torch.randn(1, input_size)
v = torch.randn(input_size)
dummy_input = (x, v)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model_explicit.onnx", verbose=True, input_names=["x", "v"],
                 output_names=["output"])
```

*Commentary:* This approach prioritizes direct manipulation and the use of `torch.matmul` for consistency. It explicitly reshapes the vector, retrieves the weight matrix from the linear layer, and performs the matrix multiplication. The result is squeezed to achieve the correct 1D output shape. It's a highly reliable and explicit approach suitable for complex models and is generally recommended.

In my experience, the third approach offers the most robust method for ensuring a successful export. While the other approaches can work, potential issues with implicit conversion and dynamic dimensions can arise.

For further research, I recommend examining resources that explain ONNX operator specifications. Look into the official ONNX documentation to understand how operators like `MatMul` are defined and used, as well as the documentation on the PyTorch ONNX exporter. Exploring tutorials and articles on exporting PyTorch models to ONNX can also be beneficial. Understanding the expected tensor ranks (number of dimensions) for every operation involved and their implications for the ONNX exporter is critical. You may also want to consult the ONNX documentation on dynamic shapes, particularly if you need to support vectors of variable sizes in your model. This combination of resources will give a broader understanding of what makes PyTorch models work well within the constraints of the ONNX graph format.
