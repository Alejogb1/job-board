TensorFlow and Keras, by design, are verbose, providing detailed logging of training progress, graph construction, and other operational nuances. This verbosity, while often beneficial for debugging and performance analysis, can become an impediment in certain contexts, such as integration with other systems, automated scripting, or when seeking clean console outputs. Disabling these outputs requires controlling TensorFlow's logging mechanisms and Keras’s associated print statements. My experience, particularly while building a reinforcement learning agent interacting with a real-time simulation environment, made me keenly aware of the need for suppressed outputs. The constant stream of epoch updates significantly hampered the log readability of the simulator.

**Disabling TensorFlow Outputs**

TensorFlow’s logging behavior is primarily managed through its `tf.get_logger()` function. This retrieves the root logger, which then controls the level of information emitted. The default logging level is `INFO`, resulting in the output of informational messages, warnings, and errors. I've found it most effective to modify the log level to `ERROR`, effectively suppressing informational and warning messages, but still displaying critical errors if they arise.

The primary method involves using the `tf.get_logger().setLevel()` method. This allows direct adjustment of the logging threshold. Crucially, this needs to be done before any TensorFlow operations are initiated to be fully effective. While there is no direct way to completely eliminate *all* outputs, setting the level to `ERROR` is the most robust method I've encountered. I have observed, however, that some specific TensorFlow components, particularly those related to GPU configuration, may still emit messages, though far fewer than the default setting.

Another method, often discussed, involves modifying the `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. While this works in specific use cases, it’s less flexible and can be problematic when deploying applications across different environments. Directly controlling the logger provides greater predictability and programmatic control. Therefore, I generally favor the programmatic approach using `tf.get_logger().setLevel()`. I’ve also found that setting the `TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH` environment variable to `true` can reduce some initial setup related logging when working with GPUs. However, the effectiveness of this can vary based on the GPU driver.

**Disabling Keras Outputs**

Keras, being a high-level API, integrates with TensorFlow's logging but also introduces its own print statements, primarily during model training and loading processes. While the TensorFlow logger manipulation affects most messages emanating from the Keras backend, some Keras specific outputs, such as progress bars and epoch summaries, require different handling. I’ve consistently found the most reliable approach is utilizing the `verbose` parameter within Keras functions like `model.fit()` and `model.fit_generator()`.

Setting `verbose` to `0` effectively suppresses training progress bars and per-epoch summaries. I’ve utilized this setting extensively during hyperparameter optimization runs. The default value is `1`, which displays the progress bar, and `2` displays only one line per epoch. I’ve noticed that while this is a simple parameter change, its impact is significant regarding console clutter during training runs.

Additionally, when dealing with `model.load_weights()`, no explicit `verbose` parameter exists. The loading process generally provides no output unless an error occurs. Therefore, this function is less of a concern regarding output suppression. I have also come across the occasional issue of custom callbacks generating output. This, however, would require modification of those custom callbacks themselves.

**Code Examples and Commentary**

*Example 1: Disabling TensorFlow logging*

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import logging

# Disable TensorFlow logging (set to error level)
tf.get_logger().setLevel(logging.ERROR)

# Example TensorFlow operation (will not generate verbose output)
a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
print(c)  # Standard print output will still work

# Example of what would be suppressed (if logging was INFO)
# tf.print("This would be suppressed with ERROR level logging", output_stream=sys.stderr)
```

In this example, I first import TensorFlow and the Python `logging` module. I then utilize `tf.get_logger().setLevel(logging.ERROR)` to set the logging level to error. Following that, I execute a simple matrix multiplication; this would normally output information about TensorFlow’s graph construction, and execution, which is suppressed using the aforementioned method. Standard python `print` functions will still function as expected. I've commented out an example of a message that would be suppressed if the logging level wasn’t set to `ERROR`.

*Example 2: Disabling Keras verbose output during training*

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np


# Sample data for training
x_train = np.random.random((100, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1))

# Define a simple Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(12, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


# Train the model with verbose=0
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)

print("Training Completed (no progress output)")
```

Here, I define a simple Keras model using the sequential API, along with randomized input data. Importantly, the `model.fit()` method is called with `verbose=0`. This prevents the progress bar, and per-epoch loss/accuracy values, from being printed to the console during training. I’ve observed this to be extremely helpful in situations where I wish to record the training in external logs.

*Example 3: Combining TensorFlow and Keras output suppression*

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import logging
import numpy as np

# Disable TensorFlow logging
tf.get_logger().setLevel(logging.ERROR)


# Sample data for training
x_train = np.random.random((100, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1))

# Define a simple Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(12, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with verbose=0
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)


# Example model saving and loading, which generates minimal output by default.
model.save('my_model.h5')
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')


print("Model Trained and Saved (minimal output)")
```

This example combines the techniques from the first two code examples. I've first disabled TensorFlow's logging and then suppressed the Keras training output. Following that, I demonstrate an example of model saving and loading, which I find does not typically produce any output outside of error conditions. This demonstrates a use case where a user wants to run a TensorFlow / Keras training with minimal console clutter.

**Resource Recommendations**

For more detailed information on TensorFlow's logging framework, consult the official TensorFlow documentation under the “Logging” section. It provides an in-depth explanation of various logging levels and their implications. Within the Keras documentation, examine the `model.fit` function's parameters documentation to further understand how the `verbose` parameter functions. Look into the Keras API documentation for details on the `Model` object, and its behavior relating to training and loading. Also, the Python standard library’s `logging` module documentation can give a broader understanding of how logging frameworks operate, and can be beneficial for more complex logging requirements.
