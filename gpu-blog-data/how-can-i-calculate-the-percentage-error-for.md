Calculating the percentage error for each MNIST digit label involves evaluating the performance of a trained model on the MNIST dataset, specifically focusing on how often the model incorrectly predicts each digit. This process necessitates not only a trained model but also a method to systematically assess its predictions against the actual labels. My experience developing image classifiers for autonomous navigation systems has required frequent and granular error analysis, making this a familiar process.

The initial step requires loading the MNIST dataset and generating predictions using a trained classifier. This classifier might be based on various architectures, from simple logistic regression to deep convolutional networks. For this explanation, I assume a model trained on the standard MNIST training set and ready to make predictions on the test set. The key principle is to compare the model’s predicted label for each image in the test set with the image’s corresponding true label. This comparison forms the basis for calculating the percentage error. The error is the ratio of misclassifications to the total number of samples for each digit.

The calculation will iterate through each digit from 0 to 9. For each digit, the subset of the test data which carries that specific label is extracted. Then, the model predicts a label for each of these samples. The number of predictions that do not match the true label is counted. This count is divided by the total number of samples with that true label. This resulting ratio, multiplied by 100, yields the percentage error for that particular digit. A high percentage error indicates that the model has difficulty classifying samples of that specific digit, while a low percentage error suggests better accuracy for that label.

Here’s how this could be implemented in Python, leveraging libraries like NumPy and a hypothetical `Classifier` class that encapsulates the trained model. I'll provide three snippets, each highlighting a slightly different aspect.

**Example 1: Basic Error Calculation**

```python
import numpy as np

class Classifier:  # Assume this is a placeholder for our model
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def predict(self, images): # Assumes images is a numpy array of shape (n, 784)
        return np.random.randint(0, 10, images.shape[0])

def calculate_digit_errors(test_images, test_labels, classifier):
    """Calculates and returns the percentage error for each MNIST digit.

    Args:
        test_images (np.ndarray): Test images of shape (num_samples, 784).
        test_labels (np.ndarray): Test labels of shape (num_samples,).
        classifier (Classifier): A trained model with a predict method.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are digits (0-9) and values are percentage errors.
    """
    digit_errors = {}
    for digit in range(10):
        digit_indices = np.where(test_labels == digit)[0]
        digit_images = test_images[digit_indices]
        digit_labels = test_labels[digit_indices]
        predictions = classifier.predict(digit_images)
        misclassifications = np.sum(predictions != digit_labels)
        total_samples = len(digit_labels)
        percentage_error = (misclassifications / total_samples) * 100 if total_samples > 0 else 0.0
        digit_errors[digit] = percentage_error
    return digit_errors

# Generate sample data for demonstration
test_images_example = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
test_labels_example = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)
trained_model = Classifier()
errors = calculate_digit_errors(test_images_example, test_labels_example, trained_model)

for digit, error in errors.items():
    print(f"Error for digit {digit}: {error:.2f}%")
```

This snippet provides the core logic of iterating through each digit, extracting relevant data, generating predictions, counting misclassifications, and computing the percentage error. It uses NumPy for efficient array manipulation. The Classifier class is a placeholder to illustrate the function usage; in a realistic scenario, this would be an instance of a class associated with the specific trained model. The print statement at the end demonstrates how to present the results.

**Example 2: Utilizing a Confusion Matrix**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

class Classifier: #Same placeholder as before
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def predict(self, images):
        return np.random.randint(0, 10, images.shape[0])

def calculate_digit_errors_cm(test_images, test_labels, classifier):
  """Calculates digit errors using a confusion matrix.

    Args:
        test_images (np.ndarray): Test images of shape (num_samples, 784).
        test_labels (np.ndarray): Test labels of shape (num_samples,).
        classifier (Classifier): A trained model with a predict method.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are digits (0-9) and values are percentage errors.
  """
  predictions = classifier.predict(test_images)
  cm = confusion_matrix(test_labels, predictions)
  digit_errors = {}
  for digit in range(10):
      total_samples_for_digit = np.sum(cm[digit, :])
      misclassifications_for_digit = total_samples_for_digit - cm[digit, digit]
      percentage_error = (misclassifications_for_digit / total_samples_for_digit) * 100 if total_samples_for_digit > 0 else 0.0
      digit_errors[digit] = percentage_error
  return digit_errors

# Generate sample data for demonstration
test_images_example = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
test_labels_example = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)
trained_model = Classifier()
errors_cm = calculate_digit_errors_cm(test_images_example, test_labels_example, trained_model)

for digit, error in errors_cm.items():
    print(f"Error for digit {digit}: {error:.2f}%")
```

This example introduces the use of a confusion matrix, generated by the `sklearn.metrics` library. The confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction outcomes, indicating how many samples of each digit were correctly or incorrectly predicted. From this matrix, we can determine the number of samples belonging to a digit and the number that were misclassified for that digit, enabling the calculation of the percentage error. Using the confusion matrix can sometimes be computationally more efficient than the iterative approach, especially for large datasets.

**Example 3: Incorporating Data Augmentation Considerations**

```python
import numpy as np

class Classifier: #Same placeholder as before
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def predict(self, images):
        return np.random.randint(0, 10, images.shape[0])

def calculate_digit_errors_augmentation(test_images, test_labels, classifier, augmentation_type='none'):
    """Calculates digit errors, optionally considering different augmentations.

    Args:
        test_images (np.ndarray): Test images of shape (num_samples, 784).
        test_labels (np.ndarray): Test labels of shape (num_samples,).
        classifier (Classifier): A trained model with a predict method.
        augmentation_type (str): Type of data augmentation ('none', 'rotation', 'translation', or 'zoom').

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are digits (0-9) and values are percentage errors.
    """
    digit_errors = {}
    for digit in range(10):
        digit_indices = np.where(test_labels == digit)[0]
        digit_images = test_images[digit_indices]
        digit_labels = test_labels[digit_indices]

        # Hypothetical augmentation (replace with actual augmentation code)
        if augmentation_type == 'rotation':
            augmented_images = digit_images + np.random.randn(*digit_images.shape) * 0.1  # Placeholder
        elif augmentation_type == 'translation':
             augmented_images = digit_images + np.random.randn(*digit_images.shape) * 0.2
        elif augmentation_type == 'zoom':
             augmented_images = digit_images + np.random.randn(*digit_images.shape) * 0.05
        else:
            augmented_images = digit_images

        predictions = classifier.predict(augmented_images)
        misclassifications = np.sum(predictions != digit_labels)
        total_samples = len(digit_labels)
        percentage_error = (misclassifications / total_samples) * 100 if total_samples > 0 else 0.0
        digit_errors[digit] = percentage_error
    return digit_errors

# Generate sample data for demonstration
test_images_example = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
test_labels_example = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)
trained_model = Classifier()

augmentations = ['none', 'rotation', 'translation', 'zoom']
for aug in augmentations:
    errors_augmented = calculate_digit_errors_augmentation(test_images_example, test_labels_example, trained_model, augmentation_type=aug)
    print(f"Errors with {aug} augmentation:")
    for digit, error in errors_augmented.items():
        print(f"  Error for digit {digit}: {error:.2f}%")
```

This last example explores the impact of data augmentation on error rates. Often, especially when working with image data, data augmentation techniques like rotations, translations, or zooms are employed during training to improve the model’s generalization. Here, we use a placeholder for hypothetical augmentation. When assessing performance, it might be crucial to analyze errors under different augmentation conditions, which this third code example demonstrates. In a practical context, you would replace the placeholder augmentation with the actual augmentation techniques applied during training.

For further exploration, consider researching resources focused on machine learning metrics. Textbooks on statistical learning provide a theoretical basis for error analysis. Publications from institutions and researchers in the area of computer vision can give further insights. Specific documentation and tutorials from the creators of the used libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) will enhance comprehension of the available functionalities and their proper utilization. These resources collectively should give a better grasp of how to analyze the percentage error for each digit within the MNIST dataset and its relevant applications.
