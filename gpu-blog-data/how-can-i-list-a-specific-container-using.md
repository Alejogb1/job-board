My experience in managing containerized environments using LXC/LXD has frequently required pinpointing individual containers for monitoring, maintenance, or debugging purposes. The LXD command-line tool offers several methods to list containers, but specifying a particular one necessitates filtering options within these listings. Default commands usually show all containers running on an LXD host, which isn't helpful when you need data from or about a specific instance.

To retrieve information about a specific container, instead of simply listing all containers, the command `lxc list` needs to be combined with a filter. The filter uses the container’s name, which is assigned during creation or cloning. This approach is more efficient than parsing the output of a general listing command, as it directly queries the LXD daemon for the requested container. LXD's filtering mechanism leverages the API, allowing for structured data retrieval. It also offers features like filtering by state (running, stopped, etc.), although name-based filtering is the most direct approach to answering your specific question.

The basic syntax for retrieving information about a single container is:

```bash
lxc list <container_name>
```

This command outputs details about the specified container if it exists and the user has sufficient permissions. It's equivalent to querying the LXD API directly for an instance using its name. If a container with that name doesn't exist, LXD will indicate this by providing no output or an error message. This is crucial to understand, since silent failures may indicate a typo in the container name or accidental deletion.

Let's examine three code examples illustrating different scenarios of listing a container:

**Example 1: Basic Container Listing**

```bash
lxc list my-app-container
```

*Commentary:* This is the most straightforward application of the command. `my-app-container` is the name of the container. If this container exists, LXD displays its information, including its state (running, stopped), IP address (if assigned), and configuration details. The output is formatted as a table, with columns detailing different attributes of the container. The absence of output implies either no container with the specified name is found or an error has been encountered. In my experience, double-checking the container name in such situations is vital before resorting to more complex debugging procedures. I frequently use tab completion for container names to prevent such errors. The output format remains consistent when a single container is queried, thus simplifying script automation. This command would show something similar to:

```
+------------------+---------+-----------------+------+-----------+-----------+
|       NAME       |  STATE  |      IPV4       | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+------------------+---------+-----------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| my-app-container | RUNNING |  192.168.1.100  |      | CONTAINER |     0     |
+------------------+---------+-----------------+------+-----------+-----------+

```

**Example 2: Listing a Container with Specific Output Format**

```bash
lxc list my-db-container --format yaml
```

*Commentary:* This example extends the first by using the `--format` option to request the output in YAML format. This can be very useful when you need to programmatically process the information about a container or store it in a configuration management system. LXD supports multiple output formats including 'json' and 'csv'. Using YAML simplifies the process of extracting specific pieces of information about the container compared to working with the default table output. For instance, in a script, I might extract the IP address using a tool like 'yq' from a YAML output of the container's information rather than parsing the tabular output using awk or grep. Choosing the format appropriate for the use case reduces complexity and potential error in data manipulation. This example outputs information that is similar to this:

```yaml
- config:
    image.os: ubuntu
    image.release: focal
  created_at: 2023-10-26T12:34:56Z
  devices: {}
  ephemeral: false
  name: my-db-container
  profiles:
  - default
  state:
    cpu: {}
    disk:
      root:
        usage: 377612288
    memory:
      usage: 13841408
    network:
    - addresses:
        - 10.0.0.101
      dev: eth0
      host_name: my-db-container
      hwaddr: 00:16:3e:aa:bb:cc
      type: broadcast
      updated_at: 2023-10-26T12:34:56Z
    status: Running
    status_code: 103
  type: container
```

**Example 3: Checking If a Container Exists Using Exit Code**

```bash
lxc list nonexistent-container > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Container 'nonexistent-container' found."
else
  echo "Container 'nonexistent-container' not found."
fi
```

*Commentary:* This example illustrates a common approach to script logic, where the existence of a container needs to be checked without parsing output. The `lxc list` command is redirected to `/dev/null` to suppress the standard output and error messages. The exit code (`$?`) then reflects the status of the command execution. A '0' exit code indicates success, which in the context of `lxc list` means the container exists. A non-zero exit code indicates a failure (typically that the specified container does not exist). This is a highly efficient approach in scripts and avoids the cost of parsing potentially large outputs. I have used this logic extensively in automated container management scripts for validating the presence of critical containers before initiating updates or backups. I often utilize this strategy within CI/CD pipelines.

It's also important to understand that LXD allows the use of partial matches in some cases, particularly when filtering with more advanced options, but relying on exact container names is generally preferred for clarity and reliability when retrieving specific container details. It avoids unintended consequences and ambiguity when a partial match leads to multiple results.

Regarding resources, several publications provide a solid understanding of LXC/LXD, including documentation from the project maintainers. "LXD Container Management" provides thorough instructions on usage, while texts on system administration commonly cover Linux containerization in depth. Furthermore, the LXD project’s website contains detailed instructions and example use cases that I have found extremely beneficial. I also rely heavily on the official API documentation to understand low-level interactions. Online courses and tutorials also offer practical knowledge for managing LXC/LXD, specifically on container lifecycle management. These varied resources allow for developing skills in LXC/LXD at differing levels of expertise. A strong foundation, combined with practical experimentation using a local LXD environment, typically results in mastery of container management with this powerful tool.
