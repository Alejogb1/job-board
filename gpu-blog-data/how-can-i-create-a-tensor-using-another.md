Reindexing and reshaping tensor data based on the content of another tensor is a common, yet sometimes nuanced, task in deep learning and scientific computing. The core challenge lies in using the values within an *index* tensor as the actual *locations* in a destination tensor where data from the source tensor will be placed, or to select data from a source tensor based on the indices held in another. I've frequently encountered this requirement when dealing with sparse data structures and custom data handling pipelines in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

The straightforward approach involves utilizing indexing mechanisms that most deep learning frameworks provide. It is not a simple element-wise copy. Rather, think of it as building a new tensor, filling its slots based on rules established by the indices and source data. The primary functionality for this is often achieved using a combination of gather-scatter operations or advanced indexing techniques.

**Conceptual Explanation**

Let’s first consider the scenario where the values in a designated index tensor represent the destination indices, and we want to populate a new tensor using values from a source tensor. For this scenario, the source tensor is assumed to contain all the values you want to insert and the index tensor defines where the values are put. The index tensor will define the shape and size of the new tensor. This type of operation is often referred to as *scatter*. There is no direct requirement that the new tensor and the source tensor be related in shape or size.

The operation can be visualized as a mapping: for each position in your source tensor, the corresponding element in the *index* tensor dictates where that source tensor's element is placed in the new destination tensor. This implies that the index tensor can repeat locations and that many source tensor elements can potentially map to the same destination slot. In such cases, the framework will either overwrite the initial value or perform an additive operation, usually based on the specifics of the function called. The alternative is often called *gather*, where indices select elements from the source tensor, thereby reordering or filtering.

Now, let's look at the reverse: using index values to selectively retrieve data from a source tensor, which is termed *gathering*. In this case, your *index* tensor dictates which elements to select from a source tensor. The shape and size of the resulting tensor are defined by the index tensor. It’s like specifying which rows, columns, or elements to fetch from the source using the index values.

In both operations, careful handling of boundary conditions is crucial. If indices are out of the valid range for your destination or source tensor (depending on whether it's a scatter or gather operation), the frameworks typically raise an error or offer methods to handle these cases by either clamping or discarding out-of-bounds indices.

**Code Examples**

For clarity, I'll show these operations in PyTorch, a framework I use frequently for model prototyping. The principles, however, translate to similar functions in other libraries like TensorFlow. I often employ NumPy for data processing, which often requires this kind of data manipulation.

*Example 1: Scatter Operation*

```python
import torch

# Source tensor with values
source_tensor = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30, 40])

# Index tensor indicating where to place source values
index_tensor = torch.tensor([2, 0, 1, 2])

# Define the destination tensor shape
destination_shape = (5,) # Destination tensor will have 5 elements.

# Initialize destination tensor to zeros
destination_tensor = torch.zeros(destination_shape)

# Perform scatter operation
destination_tensor.scatter_(0, index_tensor, source_tensor)
# scatter_  will overwrite any existing elements in the destination_tensor
# Note that this performs the operation *in place*
print("Result of scatter operation:", destination_tensor) # Output: tensor([20., 30., 10.,  0., 40.])

# Another scatter operation with accumulation
destination_tensor = torch.zeros(destination_shape)
destination_tensor.scatter_add_(0, index_tensor, source_tensor)
print("Result of scatter_add operation:", destination_tensor) # Output: tensor([20., 30., 50.,  0., 0.])
```
In this example, the values from `source_tensor` are placed into the `destination_tensor` at locations specified by `index_tensor`. For example, `source_tensor[0]` which is `10` is placed into `destination_tensor[index_tensor[0]]`, so it is put in `destination_tensor[2]`. Note that in the second call, we instead use `scatter_add_` to accumulate values on repeated indices. We observe how the value 50 has been inserted into the third position in `destination_tensor`, instead of 10. This demonstrates overwriting vs accumulating for multiple instances of the same index.

*Example 2: Gather Operation*

```python
import torch

# Source tensor
source_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                             [4, 5, 6],
                             [7, 8, 9]])

# Index tensor to select rows
index_tensor_rows = torch.tensor([0, 2, 1])

# Gather rows
gathered_rows = torch.index_select(source_tensor, 0, index_tensor_rows)
print("Gathered rows:\n", gathered_rows)
# Output: tensor([[1, 2, 3],
#                  [7, 8, 9],
#                  [4, 5, 6]])

# Index tensor to select elements
index_tensor_elements = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 5, 8])

gathered_elements = source_tensor.flatten()[index_tensor_elements]
print("Gathered elements:", gathered_elements)
# Output: tensor([1, 2, 3, 6, 9])
```
This example illustrates the use of `index_select` to gather rows and using a flattened source tensor to select arbitrary elements. We use `index_select` to select *whole rows* of `source_tensor` specified by indices in `index_tensor_rows` and obtain a result whose rows are permuted. We select arbitrary elements by first flattening the tensor, and selecting specific values based on a new `index_tensor_elements`

*Example 3: Advanced Indexing with Multiple Dimensions*
```python
import torch

# Source tensor
source_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)

# Index tensors (row, column, and depth)
index_rows = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])
index_cols = torch.tensor([2, 0, 1])
index_depth = torch.tensor([1, 3, 2])

# Select elements based on the index tensors
result = source_tensor[index_rows, index_cols, index_depth]
print("Result of advanced indexing:", result) # Output: tensor([9, 15, 6])

# Advanced indexing with slices and indices
result_sliced = source_tensor[0, 0:2, 1:3]
print("Result of sliced advanced indexing:\n", result_sliced)
# Output: tensor([[ 1,  2],
#                 [ 5,  6]])

```
This example shows how to perform a selection of an individual element given three independent index tensors using advanced indexing. Each index tensor selects an index in one dimension of the `source_tensor`. The result is a tensor whose elements are obtained by stepping through the index tensors element-wise and selecting values from `source_tensor`. We also show how to mix index tensors and ranges or slices to specify more sophisticated index operations.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further learning, I would recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g. PyTorch or TensorFlow) or Numerical library (e.g. NumPy). Look into the functions named along the lines of `scatter`, `gather`, `index_select`, and advanced indexing.  Also, review articles focusing on sparse matrix representation, as these frequently use index manipulation similar to the techniques described here. Examining the API documentation for the data handling operations for different frameworks can reveal the differences in implementation choices. The tutorials and official examples provided by these libraries are valuable.
