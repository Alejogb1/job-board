The discrepancy between the TensorFlow version reported by your system's package manager and the version active within a Jupyter Notebook environment is a common source of frustration. This arises primarily from the interplay between virtual environments and Python's package management mechanisms.  In my experience troubleshooting numerous deep learning projects, I've found that resolving this often involves a careful examination of the environment's configuration and dependencies.

**1. Explanation of the Discrepancy:**

TensorFlow, like many Python packages, benefits from the use of virtual environments. These isolated environments prevent dependency conflicts between different projects.  When you install TensorFlow using `pip install tensorflow` or `conda install tensorflow`, the installation is typically confined to the currently active environment.  If you're working within a Jupyter Notebook launched without activating a specific virtual environment, the Notebook will default to the system-wide Python interpreter, which might have a different, or even absent, TensorFlow installation.  Conversely, if you activate a virtual environment *before* launching Jupyter, and *that* environment contains a TensorFlow installation, the Notebook will then utilize that version. The system-level `pip` or `conda` commands will always reflect the system-wide installation, irrespective of the active virtual environment within Jupyter. This fundamental difference is crucial to understanding the mismatch.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate methods for identifying and resolving version discrepancies.  These assume some familiarity with command-line interfaces and Python.

**Example 1:  Verifying TensorFlow Versions using `pip` and within Jupyter:**

```python
# System-wide TensorFlow version (outside Jupyter)
!pip show tensorflow

# TensorFlow version within the Jupyter Notebook
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

The first line uses the `!` magic command in Jupyter to execute a shell command.  This displays the TensorFlow information as reported by `pip` for the system's Python interpreter.  The second line imports TensorFlow and prints the version number as seen by the Jupyter kernel.  A mismatch between these two outputs strongly suggests that Jupyter is operating within a different environment.

**Example 2:  Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment with TensorFlow:**

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment (using venv)
python3 -m venv tf_env

# Activate the virtual environment
source tf_env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS; tf_env\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install TensorFlow within the activated environment
pip install tensorflow

# Verify the installation (within the activated environment)
pip show tensorflow

# Launch Jupyter from within the activated environment
jupyter notebook
```

This example demonstrates the correct procedure. First, a new virtual environment named `tf_env` is created.  Activation makes it the active environment.  TensorFlow is then installed *into* this environment. Finally, Jupyter is launched *from within* this activated environment, ensuring that the Notebook utilizes the correctly installed version.


**Example 3: Specifying the Kernel in Jupyter:**

If you already have multiple kernels (representing different environments) configured in Jupyter, you can explicitly choose the one containing your desired TensorFlow version:

```python
# Within the Jupyter Notebook interface, go to "Kernel" -> "Change kernel"
# Select the kernel corresponding to the virtual environment with your desired TensorFlow version.
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

Jupyter's kernel management allows selecting the interpreter used by the Notebook. This example highlights the manual selection process for switching kernels within the Jupyter interface itself. Selecting a kernel associated with an environment where TensorFlow is installed appropriately will resolve the version conflict without necessitating re-installation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the official documentation for both TensorFlow and your chosen package manager (pip or conda).  Understanding the intricacies of virtual environments, specifically how to create, activate, and manage them, is paramount. The Python documentation on virtual environments provides valuable insights into their usage.  Furthermore, consult the Jupyter documentation to understand its kernel management system. Thoroughly studying these resources is essential for proficiently managing Python dependencies and environments.


In summary, the apparent discrepancy stems from the lack of alignment between the system's Python interpreter and the interpreter used by the Jupyter Notebook. By diligently employing virtual environments and correctly configuring Jupyter kernels, you can ensure consistency and prevent this common issue.  These procedures, coupled with a clear understanding of package management principles, guarantee a seamless and reliable workflow for your deep learning projects.
