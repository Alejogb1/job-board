Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy, implemented by web browsers for security, is the primary reason AJAX requests fail across different domains. As a developer who's debugged countless front-end integrations over the past decade, I've consistently seen CORS configurations surface as the root cause of seemingly inexplicable network errors. The core issue stems from the browser's attempt to protect users from malicious scripts that might attempt to read sensitive data from other websites. If a web page residing on `domainA.com` tries to fetch content via AJAX from `domainB.com`, the browser will, by default, block the request. This restriction exists because without it, a malicious script could potentially impersonate the user and extract data that should only be accessible within their session on `domainB.com`.

To understand this fully, consider a scenario where a legitimate website `domainA.com` makes an AJAX request to a web service hosted on `domainB.com`. The web service on `domainB.com` will typically send a response with data. However, the browser will first evaluate the origin of the script making the request and the origin of the resource requested. If these origins are not identical, then the browser triggers a preflight request using the HTTP method `OPTIONS`. This preflight request solicits specific information from the server, most notably what HTTP methods and headers are acceptable from the client, and whether credentials like cookies can be included. The server on `domainB.com` then responds with appropriate CORS headers. These headers effectively authorize certain origins, methods, and headers to access the resource. If the server doesn't provide correct headers or if the server is not configured to allow the request made by `domainA.com`, the browser will block the actual AJAX request, even if the web service works as expected. The browser does this without displaying an error to the user - it's a security decision enforced at the browser level.

The most common CORS-related error displayed in the developer console is typically something like: "has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." This message indicates the absence of the crucial header that permits cross-origin access. This can occur in several situations, such as an incorrect or missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, a failure of the preflight `OPTIONS` request, or a mismatch between the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` or `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` specified by the server and the parameters of the AJAX request.

Here are three examples that highlight different aspects of CORS configurations and common pitfalls:

**Example 1: Basic CORS Implementation (Server-side)**

Assume I'm building a REST API with Node.js and Express. I've created an endpoint at `/api/data` which I want to make accessible from a front-end application on a different domain. A typical approach on the server side involves setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in my response.

```javascript
// Node.js server code (using Express)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://domainA.com'); // Only allow requests from domainA.com
  res.json({ message: 'Data from the server' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

In this code, the server responds with the JSON payload. Critically, before sending the payload, it sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `http://domainA.com`. If I send a request from a web page at `http://domainA.com`, the browser will allow the request. However, if the request comes from another domain (e.g. `http://domainC.com`), the browser will block the request because the origin doesn't match the allowed origin. This example illustrates the basic need for configuring the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the server. Without this header, the browser will block any cross-domain requests. Additionally, the value can be a wildcard `*`, which allows any domain to access the resource, but should be used with caution, as it can pose security risks.

**Example 2: Handling Preflight Requests**

When an AJAX request uses a method other than `GET`, `POST`, or `HEAD`, or includes custom headers, the browser sends a preflight request via the HTTP `OPTIONS` method. The server must respond to this `OPTIONS` request correctly.

```javascript
// Node.js server code (using Express) - handling preflight
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Handles the preflight OPTIONS request
app.options('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://domainA.com');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
    res.sendStatus(204);
});


// Handles actual GET request
app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://domainA.com');
    res.json({ message: 'Data from the server' });
});

// Handles a POST request
app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://domainA.com');
  res.json({ message: 'Data posted successfully' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

Here, I've explicitly included logic to handle `OPTIONS` requests, which uses a route with the same URI. The response to the preflight request includes three crucial headers: `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, which specifies the HTTP methods that are permitted (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` in this case); `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, which lists which custom headers are permissible; and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, allowing cookies/authorization headers from the client. Note that the values provided in `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers have to match the actual HTTP method used, and all custom headers provided by the client respectively. If a mismatch exists, the browser will fail the request. The actual `GET` and `POST` requests will also need to have the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set; it is not sufficient to only send it in the response to the preflight `OPTIONS` request.

**Example 3: Requesting Credentials**

AJAX requests that need to include credentials like cookies require the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header with the value `true`. Furthermore,  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` *cannot* be set to the wildcard `*` in this scenario, instead it should specify the origin explicitly.

```javascript
// Node.js server code (using Express)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/secureData', (req, res) => {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://domainA.com');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
    res.json({ message: 'Secure data' });
});


app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

On the client-side the AJAX request must include `withCredentials: true`, in its settings. If  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is not sent, the browser will not include the credentials in the request, potentially causing authentication failures. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header also must specifically list the origin (`http://domainA.com` in this example); if set to `*`, the request will fail in this case, further emphasizing the security precautions implemented by the browser.

In summary, cross-domain AJAX failures are primarily due to the browser's CORS policy which requires explicit server-side configuration to allow cross-origin requests. Understanding the preflight process, correctly setting the necessary headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, and understanding when credentials are required is fundamental to working with AJAX requests across origins.

For further learning, I recommend exploring resources that provide in-depth explanations of HTTP headers, especially those that deal with CORS. Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides excellent documentation on the subject of CORS and provides a comprehensive explanation of the relevant headers. Additionally, resources focusing on web security principles and server-side configurations for various frameworks can enhance understanding of this topic.  Understanding the specific implementation details for your web server (e.g. Apache, Nginx, Node.js) is beneficial in avoiding these pitfalls. Consulting documentation for the web framework you utilize is also a valuable step.
