The `wait()` system call returning -1, specifically in Xcode 7.2.1 (7C1002), within the context of process control, generally indicates an error has occurred during the waiting operation. This is a fundamental signal to examine the accompanying `errno` value for specific details about the failure. In my experience, working with inter-process communication and process forking on older macOS systems, this behavior primarily manifested due to either signal interruption or the target process being terminated unexpectedly.

The `wait()` function, as defined by POSIX standards, provides a mechanism for a parent process to suspend execution until a child process terminates or experiences a state change. Its primary purpose is resource management; specifically, the release of process table entries and the collection of the child's exit status. A successful `wait()` will return the process ID of the terminated child and update a status variable to reflect why that child terminated. Failure, indicated by a return value of -1, immediately triggers further analysis as it disrupts the normal program flow. Critically, when a process receives a signal that is not explicitly ignored, the `wait()` call can be interrupted. Such interruption can result in a return of -1, even though the actual process to wait on may not have an inherent issue. The specific value contained within the `errno` variable becomes the focus for understanding the error that occurred.

Let’s examine specific error cases with code.

**Example 1: Signal Interruption**

This example demonstrates how a signal, specifically `SIGINT`, can interrupt a `wait()` call.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <signal.h>

void signal_handler(int signum) {
    printf("Signal %d caught\n", signum);
}

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

    if ((pid = fork()) == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process: Sleeping for 5 seconds...\n");
        sleep(5);
        printf("Child process: Exiting.\n");
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    } else {
        signal(SIGINT, signal_handler); //Register signal handler for SIGINT

        printf("Parent process: Waiting for child...\n");
        pid_t waited_pid = wait(&status);

        if (waited_pid == -1) {
            perror("Wait failed");
            printf("errno: %d\n", errno); // print errno for investigation

            if(errno == EINTR){
                printf("Wait was interrupted by a signal.\n");
            }

        }
       else {
            printf("Parent process: Child process %d terminated.\n", waited_pid);
            if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
                printf("Child exited with status: %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
            }
        }

        printf("Parent process: Exiting.\n");

    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this scenario, if a user sends a `SIGINT` signal (typically by pressing Ctrl+C) while the parent process is executing the `wait()`, the `wait()` call will likely be interrupted. The `errno` will typically be set to `EINTR`, indicating that the system call was interrupted by a signal. The signal handler executes, printing the signal caught, and the parent process continues its execution after the return of `-1` from `wait`.  In this specific case, the expected behavior is for the signal handler to execute while the `wait()` call is ongoing, which will interrupt the syscall returning -1 and setting `errno` to `EINTR`. This is an important case as it is very common for system calls to be interrupted in a system and requires proper handling.

**Example 2: Child Process Termination Due to Error**

This example illustrates a scenario where the child process terminates abnormally, which could also result in `wait()` returning -1 under less careful use of system calls. The critical difference here is that the child is the problem, not a signal to the parent

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

    if ((pid = fork()) == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (pid == 0) {
       // intentionally cause a segmentation fault
        int *ptr = NULL;
        *ptr = 10;

         printf("Child process: Exiting.\n");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else {
        printf("Parent process: Waiting for child...\n");
        pid_t waited_pid = wait(&status);
        if (waited_pid == -1) {
            perror("Wait failed");
            printf("errno: %d\n", errno);
        } else {
            printf("Parent process: Child process %d terminated.\n", waited_pid);
              if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
                printf("Child exited with status: %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
            } else if (WIFSIGNALED(status)) {
                printf("Child terminated by signal: %d\n", WTERMSIG(status));
            }
        }
          printf("Parent process: Exiting.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the child process deliberately causes a segmentation fault by attempting to dereference a null pointer.  This will cause the child to terminate abnormally, receiving a `SIGSEGV` signal from the OS, and depending on the specifics of the system and how the parent utilizes the return value, it can result in the parent’s `wait()` call potentially return `-1`, although usually `wait` should return the child's pid, and the status will indicate that the child terminated due to a signal, with the specific signal being available via the `WTERMSIG` macro. However, failure to check `WIFEXITED`, and relying only on the return value of wait as an indicator of failure, can easily lead to confusion. This can also occur if the child is terminated with an uncaught exception or if there is some system error during exit.

**Example 3: Incorrect Use of `waitpid`**

Sometimes, a `-1` return value from a related `waitpid` function can occur due to mistakes in function usage. While not directly `wait()`, `waitpid()` provides finer control, and incorrect implementation can lead to errors which are often confused for a problem with the basic `wait()`. The following demonstrates an incorrect use, and how it can generate a `-1` error return.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;
    pid_t child_pid;


    if ((pid = fork()) == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process: Sleeping for 2 seconds...\n");
        sleep(2);
        printf("Child process: Exiting.\n");
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    } else {
        printf("Parent process: Waiting for child...\n");
        child_pid = waitpid(pid + 1, &status, 0); // Incorrect pid used in waitpid.
        if (child_pid == -1) {
            perror("Waitpid failed");
            printf("errno: %d\n", errno); // print errno for investigation
        } else {
            printf("Parent process: Child process %d terminated.\n", child_pid);
            if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
                printf("Child exited with status: %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
            }
        }
        printf("Parent process: Exiting.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this final example, the parent process uses the `waitpid` function, but it uses `pid + 1` instead of the actual `pid` returned by `fork`. Since there isn't a child with the specified pid,  `waitpid` will correctly return `-1` and set `errno` to `ECHILD` indicating there's no child with the target pid.  While the general principle of `wait()` returning -1 due to errors is still applicable, this example highlights a user-introduced bug using a related syscall. Debugging in such cases can be frustrating if the user assumes that it is a `wait` bug when it is, in reality, improper usage of the `waitpid` call itself.

When encountering `wait()` returning -1, the following should be investigated. Firstly, I would review the code for any potential signal handling that might interrupt the `wait` system call. Secondly, I would check how child processes are handled, specifically if they are exiting normally. This includes checking signal handlers within the child as these will impact exit behavior. Finally, the `errno` value itself needs to be interrogated. Common values include `EINTR` (interrupted by a signal), `ECHILD` (specified process does not exist), and `EFAULT` (invalid memory address). The manual pages (via `man errno`) are very important when debugging system call error. For more detailed analysis of process management, the texts "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" by W. Richard Stevens and "Operating System Concepts" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne provide an excellent foundation for understanding the finer points of OS process management. In addition to standard books, reviewing the documentation for system calls on `man` pages proves an invaluable resource. These are typically accessed via the terminal. These resources will provide greater insight into error handling and process control within the Unix-like systems. The return of `-1` from `wait()` is not inherently a bug in the system, but a robust mechanism to signal error conditions which requires detailed analysis to understand.
