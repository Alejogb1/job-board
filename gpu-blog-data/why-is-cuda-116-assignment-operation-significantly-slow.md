The performance degradation observed in CUDA 11.6 assignment operations, specifically those involving large data transfers between host and device memory, often stems from an underappreciated interaction between the asynchronous nature of CUDA streams and the default memory allocation strategy.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-performance computing simulations for astrophysical fluid dynamics revealed this subtle but significant bottleneck.  While seemingly straightforward, a simple assignment – for instance, copying a large array from host to device – can incur substantial latency if not carefully managed.

The core issue lies in the implicit synchronization points created when dealing with large datasets.  CUDA, by default, employs asynchronous execution. This means that kernel launches and memory transfers are initiated, but the CPU doesn't wait for their completion unless explicitly instructed.  However, if the CPU attempts to access the data on the device *before* the asynchronous transfer is complete, a costly implicit synchronization occurs, effectively halting CPU execution until the transfer finishes. This synchronization completely negates the performance gains promised by asynchronous operations, leading to the perceived slowdown in assignment operations.

The solution involves employing explicit synchronization mechanisms and optimizing memory management.  This involves careful consideration of CUDA streams, events, and potentially custom memory allocators. I've found that neglecting these elements frequently leads to the performance issues described in the question.

**1.  Explanation of Asynchronous Operations and Implicit Synchronization**

CUDA's asynchronous model allows for overlapping computation and data transfer.  The CPU can launch a kernel and initiate a memory copy to the device simultaneously.  Ideally, the CPU then proceeds with other tasks while the GPU works.  However, if the CPU needs the data transferred to the device *before* it can continue, it implicitly waits for the completion of the transfer.  This wait, often hidden within the seemingly simple assignment operation, introduces significant latency, especially when dealing with large arrays, which is precisely where the slowdowns in CUDA 11.6 are most noticeable.  This is amplified by increased memory bandwidth limitations relative to compute capabilities present in modern GPUs.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate this with three code examples progressing in complexity and optimization.

**Example 1: Inefficient Approach (Slow)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int *h_data, *d_data;
  int N = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB of data

  h_data = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, N * sizeof(int));

  // Initialization (omitted for brevity)

  cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Implicit Synchronization happens here if CPU needs d_data immediately.
  // This is the source of the slowdown.

  // ... further computations using d_data ...

  cudaFree(d_data);
  free(h_data);
  return 0;
}
```

This example showcases the typical problematic approach.  The `cudaMemcpy` call is asynchronous.  However, if the subsequent computations using `d_data` are initiated immediately after the `cudaMemcpy` call, the CPU will implicitly wait for the transfer to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous execution.

**Example 2:  Using CUDA Events for Explicit Synchronization**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation as in Example 1) ...

  cudaEvent_t start, stop;
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop);

  cudaEventRecord(start, 0); // Record start event before memcpy
  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data, h_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, 0);
  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0); // Record stop event after memcpy

  cudaEventSynchronize(stop); // Explicit synchronization

  // Computations using d_data can now proceed without blocking.

  cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, stop);
  printf("Time: %f ms\n", elapsedTime);

  // ... (Memory deallocation as in Example 1) ...
  cudaEventDestroy(start);
  cudaEventDestroy(stop);
  return 0;
}
```

This example introduces CUDA events to provide explicit synchronization.  The `cudaEventSynchronize(stop)` call ensures that the CPU waits for the memory copy to complete before proceeding.  While explicit, this still might not be optimal, as it forces the CPU to wait.  The timing using `cudaEventElapsedTime` helps measure the transfer time.

**Example 3:  Asynchronous Computations with Streams**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation as in Example 1) ...
  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data, h_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

  // Launch kernel asynchronously on the same stream
  // ... kernel launch on stream ...

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); // Synchronize only when needed

  // ... further computations using d_data ...

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
  // ... (Memory deallocation as in Example 1) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example utilizes CUDA streams for true asynchronous execution.  The memory copy and kernel launch are both performed on the same stream, allowing for overlapping execution.  `cudaStreamSynchronize` is called only when the results from the kernel are required, minimizing unnecessary waiting. This is the most efficient approach if kernel computations can follow the data transfer.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official CUDA programming guide and the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide.  Additionally,  familiarizing oneself with performance analysis tools provided within the NVIDIA Nsight ecosystem will prove invaluable for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks in CUDA applications.  Finally, exploring advanced memory management techniques, such as pinned memory (`cudaHostAlloc`) and zero-copy techniques, can further optimize data transfers between host and device.  Thorough profiling is crucial; I've often found unexpected bottlenecks hidden in seemingly simple code sections through careful profiling.
