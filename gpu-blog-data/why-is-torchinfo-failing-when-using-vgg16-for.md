`torchinfo` failing when employing VGG16 for transfer learning often arises from a mismatch between the expected input shape of `torchinfo` and the actual input shape of the modified VGG16 model. I've encountered this frequently while adapting pretrained models for custom tasks. Specifically, the issue typically manifests when you alter the final layers of VGG16 (removing or changing the classification layers) but fail to inform `torchinfo` of this change during initialization. `torchinfo` expects the model's forward pass to accommodate the default input size used during its initialization process, usually the ImageNet image size of 224x224 pixels. If you truncate VGG16, say, before the fully connected layers and feed it a different dimension, `torchinfo` will attempt to trace through the original graph, inevitably failing. Let's unpack this with some code and see how it behaves.

First, consider the standard case without modifications. This showcases how `torchinfo` typically functions:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from torchinfo import summary

# Load a standard VGG16 model with pretrained weights
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# Print model summary, torchinfo will implicitly use the input shape (1, 3, 224, 224)
summary(model)
```

Here, `torchinfo` generates a table without issue. The standard `vgg16` model accepts input tensors of shape (batch\_size, 3, 224, 224). By not specifying an `input_size`, `summary()` implicitly infers this based on how the layers are constructed during initialization. Everything aligns. The default behavior works because the model's forward pass is prepared to handle this specific input size, and `torchinfo` is able to trace through the complete graph.

Now, let's examine a scenario with a modified VGG16 model. This is where problems start:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from torchinfo import summary

# Load pretrained VGG16
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# Remove the classification layers for feature extraction
model = torch.nn.Sequential(*list(model.children())[:-1])

# Generate a summary; observe error: this will most likely error with incorrect input sizes.
try:
    summary(model)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")


# Fix it by passing the appropriate input shape to summary function.
summary(model, input_size=(1, 3, 224, 224))
```

In this example, I load the pretrained VGG16 and then remove the final fully connected layers using `torch.nn.Sequential` and Python list slicing. This is a common starting point for feature extraction. The problem surfaces when `summary(model)` is called; `torchinfo` attempts to execute `model.forward()` using the default input dimensions. Because the final layers are gone, the model doesnâ€™t have the forward path required by the default input dimensions, specifically for the classification layers. This results in an error, as `torchinfo` cannot trace through the pruned graph. The error usually relates to incorrect number of dimensions being processed, for example a linear layer expecting input features of size 4096 and receiving a tensor of dimension (7, 7, 512).

The fix is to specify the correct input size directly to the `summary` function. The output of the sequential network is still an image-like tensor, and the summary function can calculate the shapes using this, allowing it to output the expected tensor shapes correctly.

Let's explore a situation where the output shape is drastically altered and how `torchinfo` can handle this, while also demonstrating how the `col_names` argument can provide a more detailed output:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from torchinfo import summary

# Load pretrained VGG16
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# Isolate the features portion
features_portion = torch.nn.Sequential(*list(model.features.children()))
# Wrap with a AdaptiveAvgPool2d layer to reduce feature map size.
model = torch.nn.Sequential(features_portion,
                                   torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1,1)),
                                  torch.nn.Flatten(1),
                                   torch.nn.Linear(512, 10) ) # A new classification head
# Generate a summary with additional columns
summary(model, input_size=(1, 3, 224, 224),
        col_names = ("input_size", "output_size", "num_params", "kernel_size", "mult_adds"))
```

In this last example, I've taken only the `features` portion of the pretrained VGG16 model, added an `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` layer to squeeze the spatial dimensions down to 1x1, flattened it, and then added a new classification head with only 10 output classes. This is useful when you're retraining for a drastically smaller dataset with different classes. By specifying `col_names`, I have extended the output table and provide details on kernel size and the number of multiply-accumulate operations, which can be useful when debugging or for estimating computational costs. Crucially, despite the dramatic change in model structure, the summary now works because the correct `input_size` of (1, 3, 224, 224) is specified. The `torchinfo` module has correctly inferred the shape progression through the model.

The underlying mechanism behind `torchinfo` involves a forward pass through a copy of the model that it is given. It records the input and output shapes of each layer to calculate the number of parameters, multiply-adds, and memory footprint. However, this process requires the model to complete the forward path without raising any errors. When the model is altered and `input_size` is not passed, it attempts the forward pass with the original shape, not taking into account modifications which inevitably leads to the error. Explicitly passing the `input_size` tells `torchinfo` how to correctly perform this trace, even when the model has been truncated or had layers altered.

For resources, I recommend focusing on the official PyTorch documentation for understanding how model building, layer modifications and pre-trained weights work. Explore tutorials on feature extraction from pre-trained models, as this can help in identifying patterns that frequently lead to `torchinfo` errors when you attempt to adapt a model's architecture. Furthermore, examining the `torchinfo` repository's issue tracker on GitHub can provide insights into common pitfalls and user experiences when dealing with model summaries. A deep understanding of the PyTorch automatic differentiation process and model tracing helps identify sources of shape mismatches that may lead to these errors during model inspection.
