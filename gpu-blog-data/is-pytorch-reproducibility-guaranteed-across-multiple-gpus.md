Reproducibility in PyTorch across multiple GPUs is not inherently guaranteed without careful consideration of several factors, primarily due to the asynchronous nature of CUDA operations and the variations in parallel execution. I’ve spent considerable time debugging inconsistencies stemming from this very issue, working on a large-scale distributed training project involving complex convolutional neural networks for image segmentation. The core problem revolves around the non-deterministic behavior that arises when multiple threads interact with the GPU concurrently.

To understand this, let's delve into the key contributors. First, CUDA operations, such as matrix multiplication and convolution, are executed asynchronously on the GPU. The CPU dispatches these operations, and they are performed independently. When using multiple GPUs, these operations are spread across them. This means that the order in which individual operations complete can vary slightly between runs, even with the same initial conditions. This variance is often within acceptable floating-point tolerance but can propagate, especially with certain architectures and large models, causing noticeable deviations in the final model weights and, therefore, results.

Secondly, data shuffling in distributed training exacerbates the issue. When using a `DistributedSampler`, even if the random seed is set, the actual order in which data samples are processed on each GPU depends on the specific timing of data transfers and computation. Minor variations in this timing can cause the GPUs to effectively see the training data in a slightly different order, thus impacting the optimization path.

Thirdly, certain operations within PyTorch, especially those involving atomic operations or concurrent memory access, may show slight variations in their execution depending on GPU architecture and driver versions. For instance, the specific scheduling of reductions across different CUDA cores can result in small, often negligible, differences in computed values, which accumulate over multiple iterations, leading to overall non-reproducibility.

To mitigate these challenges and improve reproducibility, PyTorch provides several mechanisms. Setting the random seed across all relevant libraries—Python’s `random`, NumPy, and PyTorch itself—is a necessary first step. However, this is not sufficient on its own when multiple GPUs are in play. We must ensure deterministic algorithms are selected wherever possible.

Let's analyze some code examples to demonstrate these points:

**Example 1: Basic Random Seed Initialization (Not sufficient for multi-GPU)**

```python
import torch
import random
import numpy as np

def set_seed(seed):
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    random.seed(seed)

set_seed(42)

# Example Model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_data)
print(output)

```
In this initial example, I demonstrate setting the seeds for all relevant random number generators. While necessary, this on its own is not sufficient. Running this on a single GPU will indeed produce consistent results, but inconsistencies will appear when using multiple GPUs with a distributed data parallel paradigm.

**Example 2: Using Deterministic Algorithms**

```python
import torch
import random
import numpy as np

def set_seed(seed):
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    random.seed(seed)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True #Enforce deterministic behaviour
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False #Disable benchmark to ensure determinism

set_seed(42)

# Example Model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_data)
print(output)

```

In Example 2, I added the `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` and `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False` lines to enforce a deterministic behavior from cuDNN. This is a crucial step when aiming for reproducibility. `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` forces cuDNN to use deterministic algorithms, even if they are slightly slower. It is important to note that if any cuDNN operation doesn't have a deterministic implementation, this setting could raise an error. `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False` disables the cuDNN benchmarking feature, which optimizes kernels based on input shapes. While this benchmarking is helpful in optimizing runtime, it introduces a non-deterministic component that can lead to variations. Although these two settings contribute to better reproducibility across GPUs, they come with performance considerations and may require trade-offs based on specific needs. Additionally, this step may not fully guarantee perfect reproducibility in the presence of specific hardware and low level drivers.

**Example 3: Multi-GPU Training with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)**

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
import random
import numpy as np


def set_seed(seed):
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    random.seed(seed)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

def train(rank, world_size, seed):
    set_seed(seed)

    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="tcp://127.0.0.1:23456", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

    model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5).to(rank) #Place model to specific GPU
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # Create a simple dataset for distributed training
    dataset_size = 200
    input_data = torch.randn(dataset_size, 10).to(rank)
    labels = torch.randn(dataset_size,5).to(rank)

    sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(
        range(dataset_size), num_replicas=world_size, rank=rank, shuffle=True)

    for epoch in range(2):  # Train for 2 epochs
        sampler.set_epoch(epoch) # Important to set epoch for DistributedSampler
        for idx in sampler:
            input_batch = input_data[idx].unsqueeze(0)
            label_batch = labels[idx].unsqueeze(0)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(input_batch)
            loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, label_batch)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        print(f"Rank: {rank}, Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
    
    dist.destroy_process_group()

def main():
    world_size = 2 # Number of GPUs to use
    mp.spawn(train, args=(world_size,42), nprocs=world_size, join=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This example demonstrates the key changes needed for reproducible multi-GPU training. I used the `torch.distributed` library for creating a distributed data parallel setup. The `DistributedSampler` is essential, and as you can see, it is imperative to call `sampler.set_epoch(epoch)` before iterating over the sampler to ensure a different, randomized, yet deterministic data order across epochs. Not doing so means that each epoch will have the same data ordering. Furthermore, the model needs to be allocated to the specific GPU identified by the rank. The distributed process group is initialized with a specified backend (nccl here), and I included proper destruction of the process group at the end of the training process. Note that this code requires `torch.distributed` and the appropriate backend (NCLL is used here). You also need the same python code running on all GPUs.

Beyond these, controlling environment variables related to the CUDA library and specific hardware can also play a role. However, such adjustments fall outside the scope of a purely software-focused discussion.

In my experience, full reproducibility across different GPU architectures is extremely challenging to achieve, especially with complex models. While setting seeds and enabling deterministic algorithms provide a solid foundation, minor variations may still surface in very large scale systems due to hardware-level variations and driver specific optimizations, specifically across different GPUs or different driver versions.

For further exploration, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on reproducibility and distributed training. Research papers on deterministic deep learning and high-performance computing can provide valuable insights into the nuances of these complex issues. Textbooks on parallel and distributed computing might be helpful for a deeper understanding of the concepts at play. Finally, community forums such as the PyTorch discuss forum can often reveal specific issues other users have encountered and the workarounds they have found helpful.
