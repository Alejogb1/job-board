TensorFlow 1's CPU memory consumption, particularly its susceptibility to leaks, stems primarily from the interaction between its graph execution model and Python's garbage collection mechanism.  Unlike TensorFlow 2's eager execution, TensorFlow 1's static graph approach creates a detached memory landscape where tensors and operations aren't immediately reclaimed even after their computational use concludes.  This is a consequence of the graph's lifecycle, which often outlives the Python objects referencing the tensors it manages.

My experience troubleshooting this issue in large-scale production systems at a previous firm involved analyzing thousands of lines of TensorFlow 1 code. We observed that improperly managed sessions and the accumulation of intermediate tensors within lengthy computation chains were recurring culprits.  Failing to explicitly close sessions resulted in the persistence of allocated memory, while the accumulation of intermediate results, particularly with complex models and iterative processes, overwhelmed available resources.

**1.  Explanation:  The Role of Sessions and the Graph**

TensorFlow 1 organizes computations as graphs, where nodes represent operations and edges represent the data flow (tensors) between them.  A `tf.Session` is responsible for executing this graph.  Crucially, the session holds onto memory allocated for tensors and operations within the graph, even if those tensors are no longer directly accessed by the Python program. Python's garbage collector, relying on reference counting, won't automatically reclaim memory held by the session's internal structures until the session itself is explicitly closed. This delayed deallocation, coupled with the often considerable memory demands of deep learning computations, contributes to substantial memory leaks.  The problem is exacerbated when multiple sessions are created and left unclosed within loops or function calls, creating a cumulative effect of persistent memory allocations.  Furthermore, certain TensorFlow operations, especially those involving variable sharing or large constant tensors, can contribute to higher baseline memory usage, making leaks more pronounced.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unclosed Session Leading to Memory Leak**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def leaky_function():
    with tf.Session() as sess:  # Session created but not explicitly closed outside the function
        a = tf.constant([1.0] * 10000000) #Large tensor
        b = tf.constant([2.0] * 10000000)
        c = tf.add(a, b)
        sess.run(c) # This runs but the session remains open.

for i in range(100):  # Repeated calls exacerbate the problem
    leaky_function()

```

This example demonstrates a classic memory leak scenario. The `tf.Session` is created within `leaky_function`, but not explicitly closed. Each call to `leaky_function` allocates memory for the tensors `a`, `b`, and `c` which remains within the session until the interpreter terminates.  Repeating this call creates a cumulative memory leak.  The solution is straightforward: close the session explicitly.

**Example 2: Proper Session Management**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def non_leaky_function():
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        a = tf.constant([1.0] * 10000000)
        b = tf.constant([2.0] * 10000000)
        c = tf.add(a, b)
        sess.run(c)
        #Explicitly closing the session releases allocated memory
        sess.close() #this is crucial

for i in range(100):
    non_leaky_function()
```

This corrected version demonstrates proper session management.  The `sess.close()` call explicitly releases the resources held by the session, preventing the memory leak. While the `with` statement offers a degree of automatic closure, it's best practice to explicitly call `sess.close()` in scenarios where exceptions might prematurely exit the `with` block.


**Example 3:  Intermediate Tensor Accumulation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def intermediate_tensor_leak():
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        results = []
        a = tf.constant([1.0])
        for i in range(1000000): #Long loop creating many tensors
            a = tf.add(a, tf.constant([1.0]))
            results.append(sess.run(a)) # each iteration adds to memory usage
        sess.close()

intermediate_tensor_leak()
```

This example showcases how accumulating intermediate results can lead to memory exhaustion.  Each iteration in the loop generates a new tensor, which is added to the `results` list. Even though the session is closed, the large `results` list still occupies substantial memory.  The solution involves managing the size of intermediate results more effectively, potentially using generators or processing results in smaller batches to limit memory usage.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1 documentation remains a critical resource for understanding session management and graph execution.  Furthermore, consult materials on Python's memory management and garbage collection to better understand the interplay between TensorFlow and the underlying Python runtime.  Exploring profiling tools specifically designed for Python applications can aid in identifying memory bottlenecks and leaks.  Finally, a strong understanding of numerical computation and memory efficiency in general will prove invaluable in avoiding memory-related issues in TensorFlow 1 and any similar framework.
