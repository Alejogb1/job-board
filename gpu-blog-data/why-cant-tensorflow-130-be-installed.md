TensorFlow 1.3.0's installation failures often stem from incompatibility with the system's Python version, CUDA toolkit version, and cuDNN library version.  In my experience resolving countless dependency conflicts during my years working on large-scale machine learning projects at Xylos Corp,  this particular TensorFlow version presents unique challenges due to its reliance on specific, now-outdated, software versions.  The absence of backward compatibility, especially with CUDA, frequently results in installation errors even if the required libraries appear to be installed.

**1.  Explanation of Installation Challenges:**

TensorFlow 1.3.0, while functional for its time, is no longer actively supported. This directly impacts installation attempts on modern systems.  The primary hurdles involve:

* **Python Version Mismatch:**  TensorFlow 1.3.0 has stringent Python version requirements.  Attempting installation with Python 3.9 or later will invariably result in failures.  The supported Python version range is narrow, typically Python 3.5 through 3.7.  Any deviation necessitates either employing a virtual environment with a compatible Python interpreter or upgrading the entire system to a supported version (generally not advisable for production environments due to potential software conflicts).

* **CUDA and cuDNN Version Conflicts:**  This is arguably the most common source of error. TensorFlow 1.3.0 necessitates a specific CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library version.  These libraries are crucial for GPU acceleration.  Installing newer versions often leads to incompatibility, causing the TensorFlow installation process to terminate with cryptic error messages.  The specific required CUDA and cuDNN versions are rarely explicitly stated in the documentation.  Determining them requires careful analysis of error messages and manual investigation through trial and error, or by consulting archived forum threads dedicated to TensorFlow 1.3.0.

* **Operating System Compatibility:**  While TensorFlow 1.3.0 had broader OS support than more recent versions, subtle system-level differences can still interfere with installation.  For instance, the presence of certain kernel modules or conflicting system libraries might lead to installation issues. This is particularly prevalent on systems with multiple versions of the same libraries installed.

* **Missing Dependencies:**  TensorFlow 1.3.0 and its associated components rely on various supporting libraries such as `protobuf`, `numpy`, and `six`.  Missing or incompatible versions of these dependencies can silently fail the installation process or result in runtime errors.  Explicitly verifying the availability and version consistency of these dependencies before attempting a TensorFlow installation is crucial.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three scenarios showcasing typical installation pitfalls and their solutions:


**Scenario 1: Python Version Incompatibility**

```bash
# Attempting installation with Python 3.9
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
# Results in an error indicating Python version incompatibility.
```

**Solution:** Create a virtual environment with a compatible Python version (e.g., Python 3.6).

```bash
python3.6 -m venv tf1.3env
source tf1.3env/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
```
This approach isolates TensorFlow 1.3.0 and its dependencies within a controlled environment, preventing conflicts with other Python projects.  The `python3.6` command might need adjustment depending on the exact Python 3.6 interpreter location.


**Scenario 2: CUDA and cuDNN Version Mismatch**

```bash
# Attempting installation with a mismatched CUDA toolkit and cuDNN.
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
# Results in an error referencing CUDA or cuDNN failure.
```

**Solution:**  Install the specific CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions compatible with TensorFlow 1.3.0.  This often requires consulting community forums or archived documentation for the correct versions.  Note that incorrectly matching CUDA and cuDNN versions can lead to either a silent failure or an application crash later on.  Thorough verification is necessary.

```bash
# Hypothetical correct versions (needs to be determined from external sources)
sudo apt-get install cuda-9.0  #Example for Debian/Ubuntu - Adjust for your system
sudo apt-get install libcudnn7=7.0.5.15-1+cuda9.0
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
```

**Scenario 3: Missing Dependencies**

```bash
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
# Results in an error indicating missing dependencies (e.g., protobuf).
```

**Solution:** Install the missing dependencies explicitly before attempting the TensorFlow installation.  Use the requirements file if available for TensorFlow 1.3.0 or manually install crucial dependencies like `protobuf`, `numpy` and `six` using pip. Ensure version compatibility.


```bash
pip install protobuf==3.6.1 numpy==1.14.5 six==1.11.0
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
```

Remember to replace the version numbers with the ones compatible with TensorFlow 1.3.0 which you might need to determine yourself via experimentation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would advise consulting the official TensorFlow documentation archives for TensorFlow 1.x, specifically targeting information related to the 1.3.0 release.  Additionally, exploring archived Stack Overflow threads and community forums from around the time of the 1.3.0 release can provide valuable insights into common installation problems and their solutions.  Finally, reviewing the release notes for TensorFlow 1.3.0 might yield clues regarding compatibility requirements.  Examining the error messages carefully is also a critical component of successful troubleshooting. Carefully note the library versions indicated in the error messages - this is often the key to resolving the problem.  If possible, isolate the installation in a virtual machine to limit potential conflicts with your primary operating system's environment.  This way, if anything goes wrong, you can simply discard the VM instead of potentially compromising your primary OS installation.
