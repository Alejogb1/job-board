Airflow's templating engine, while powerful, can exhibit unexpected behavior if not handled meticulously.  The root cause of unintended attribute rendering often stems from a misunderstanding of Jinja2's context and the scoping mechanisms within Airflow's DAGs and tasks.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale data pipelines has revealed that the problem usually lies in either insufficiently scoped variables or the inadvertent exposure of undesired objects within the template context.

**1. Explanation:**

Airflow's templating system uses Jinja2.  Jinja2 renders templates by evaluating expressions within the template against a provided context.  This context is a dictionary-like structure where keys are variable names and values are the corresponding objects.  The crucial point is that the context is hierarchical.  A template within a task inherits the context of its parent DAG, which, in turn, can inherit from further upstream contexts. This inheritance is the primary source of the problem: if a variable with the same name exists at multiple levels of the context hierarchy, the template will render the value closest to it in the hierarchy.  Therefore, if an undesired variable leaks into a higher scope, the template will mistakenly render its value.

Another common source of error involves dynamically generated contexts within operators or custom operators. If these are not properly constructed or cleaned, unintended variables can seep into the global context affecting downstream tasks.  Furthermore, improper use of `default` arguments in custom functions passed to Jinja2 can lead to unexpected values being rendered. These defaults might not be context-aware and may expose values unintended for the template. Finally, misunderstanding how Jinja2 handles undefined variables can also lead to unexpected results.  Jinja2 will typically render the variable name itself if a variable referenced within the template is undefined in the context.  This, in many cases, is exactly the unwanted behavior observed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Variable Scope Issue**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='scope_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    # This task defines a 'global_var'
    task1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        bash_command='echo "global_var=global_value" > /tmp/global_var.txt'
    )

    # This task uses the template, inheriting 'global_var' unintentionally
    task2 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        bash_command='echo "{{ global_var }}"',
    )

    task1 >> task2
```

In this example, `task1` creates a file containing a variable. While this is not directly added to the Airflow context,  it might be inadvertently picked up by another process or a subsequent task’s environment, causing `task2` to render 'global_value'.  This highlights the importance of managing external variables and environment variables separately from the Airflow context to prevent such unintended behavior.  The ideal solution would be to explicitly pass necessary variables into the context of `task2`.


**Example 2: Dynamic Context Generation**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def generate_context(**kwargs):
    context = kwargs['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='task1')
    context['undesired_var'] = "This shouldn't be rendered"
    return context

with DAG(
    dag_id='dynamic_context_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        python_callable=lambda: {'desired_var': 'This should be rendered'}
    )

    task2 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        python_callable=generate_context,
        provide_context=True
    )

    task1 >> task2
```

Here, `generate_context` adds `undesired_var` to the context passed to `task2`.  Even if a template in `task2` only needs `desired_var`,  `undesired_var` is present in the context and could potentially be rendered if a template mistakenly refers to it.  Best practice here is to filter the context explicitly to only include the variables needed for each template.


**Example 3: Default Arguments in Custom Functions**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def my_function(var1, var2="default_value"):
    return f"var1: {var1}, var2: {var2}"

with DAG(
    dag_id='default_args_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        python_callable=lambda: {'var1': 'value1'}
    )

    task2 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        python_callable=lambda context: my_function(context['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='task1')['var1']),
        provide_context=True
    )

```

In this example, the `my_function` has a default argument `var2`. If `var2` is not explicitly provided in the call to `my_function`, it will use the default value ‘default_value’ which is not related to the intended context of the template. A better approach would involve eliminating default arguments or making them context-aware through conditional logic.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Airflow documentation on templating; a comprehensive guide to Jinja2 templating;  a book on Python for data engineers (covering context managers and variable scoping). Understanding Jinja2's templating principles is crucial.  Reviewing Python's scope rules and context management best practices will help prevent context contamination.  Focusing on explicit variable passing and avoiding implicit context inheritance can mitigate these issues.  Thoroughly testing templates with various input values is also essential.
