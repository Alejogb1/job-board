TensorFlow's `tf.nn.pool` function, while versatile, doesn't directly offer a "max-min pooling" layer in the conventional sense.  The typical understanding of pooling involves either maximum or minimum operations, not a combination.  However, we can effectively replicate the behavior of a max-min pooling layer by strategically combining TensorFlow operations.  My experience optimizing convolutional neural networks for image recognition applications frequently necessitated similar custom pooling strategies.  This response details how I approached this problem.

**1.  Understanding the Desired Functionality**

A hypothetical "max-min pooling" layer would aim to capture both the maximum and minimum activations within a defined spatial region (similar to how max pooling focuses on the maximum).  This would yield two output maps: one reflecting the maximum values and another reflecting the minimum values in each pooling window. This isn't a standard pooling method because the simultaneous consideration of maximum and minimum values fundamentally changes the information preserved.  Standard max pooling, for example, focuses solely on the most prominent feature activations, while min pooling highlights potentially weaker but still informative signals. The combination could provide a richer representation of feature diversity within local regions.

**2.  Implementation Using TensorFlow Operations**

To achieve the desired max-min pooling effect, we need to leverage TensorFlow's `tf.nn.pool` with different pooling modes and then concatenate the results.

**Code Example 1: Basic Max-Min Pooling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def max_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides, padding='SAME'):
  """
  Performs max and min pooling on the input tensor.

  Args:
    input_tensor: The input tensor.  Should be a 4D tensor (batch_size, height, width, channels).
    window_shape: A tuple or list specifying the pooling window shape (height, width).
    strides: A tuple or list specifying the strides (height, width).
    padding: 'SAME' or 'VALID'.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing two tensors: the max-pooled and min-pooled tensors.  Both tensors have the same shape.
  """

  max_pool = tf.nn.pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides, pooling_type='MAX', padding=padding)
  min_pool = tf.nn.pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides, pooling_type='AVG', padding=padding) #Using AVG for min, needs post-processing

  return max_pool, min_pool

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 10, 3)) # batch_size, height, width, channels
window_shape = (2, 2)
strides = (2, 2)

max_pooled, min_pooled = max_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides)
print("Max-pooled tensor shape:", max_pooled.shape)
print("Min-pooled tensor shape:", min_pooled.shape)

```

This example shows how to separately compute max and min pooling using `tf.nn.pool`. Note that there's no direct "min" pooling; we use average pooling as a proxy, understanding that the average of a small window will be greatly influenced by the minimum value within it. For precise min pooling, a custom operation would be more appropriate, as shown later.

**Code Example 2: Concatenated Max-Min Pooling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (max_min_pool function from Example 1) ...

def concatenated_max_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides, padding='SAME'):
  """
  Performs max and min pooling and concatenates the results along the channel dimension.

  Args:
    input_tensor: Input tensor.
    window_shape: Pooling window shape.
    strides: Strides.
    padding: Padding type.

  Returns:
    A tensor containing the concatenated max and min pooled outputs.
  """
  max_pooled, min_pooled = max_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides, padding)
  concatenated = tf.concat([max_pooled, min_pooled], axis=3) # Concatenate along channel axis
  return concatenated


#Example Usage (same input as before)
concatenated_output = concatenated_max_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides)
print("Concatenated output shape:", concatenated_output.shape)
```

This example showcases a more practical approach by concatenating the max and min pooled tensors along the channel dimension. This creates a single output tensor containing both types of information.

**Code Example 3:  Custom Min Pooling with tf.reduce_min**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides, padding='SAME'):
    """
    Performs min pooling using tf.reduce_min. More precise than average pooling.
    """
    input_shape = input_tensor.shape.as_list()
    output_shape = [input_shape[0],
                    (input_shape[1] + window_shape[0] -1 ) // window_shape[0],
                    (input_shape[2] + window_shape[1] -1 ) // window_shape[1],
                    input_shape[3]]

    output = tf.nn.conv2d(
        input_tensor,
        filter=tf.ones(window_shape + [input_shape[3], 1]),
        strides=[1] + strides + [1],
        padding=padding,
        data_format='NHWC'
    )
    min_pooled = tf.math.reduce_min(
            tf.reshape(output, [-1, window_shape[0] * window_shape[1]])
        , axis=1)

    return tf.reshape(min_pooled, output_shape)

# Example usage (same input as before)
custom_min_pooled = custom_min_pool(input_tensor, window_shape, strides)
print("Custom min-pooled tensor shape:", custom_min_pooled.shape)

```
This illustrates a custom min pooling operation, providing better precision than relying on average pooling. It leverages `tf.reduce_min` for accurate minimum value determination. Note this custom implementation is computationally costlier than the average pool approximation.

**3.  Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's pooling operations and convolutional neural networks in general, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, a reputable textbook on deep learning (e.g., "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville), and exploring relevant research papers on advanced pooling techniques.  Understanding matrix operations and linear algebra is also crucial.  These resources should provide a strong foundation to build upon your understanding of pooling and its applications in various deep learning architectures.
