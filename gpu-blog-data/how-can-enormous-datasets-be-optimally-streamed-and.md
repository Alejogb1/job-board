Handling extremely large datasets that exceed available memory requires a careful approach to data ingestion and processing when using TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset`. I've personally managed pipelines that dealt with terabytes of data daily, and the strategies I employed relied heavily on optimized streaming and transformation techniques. Creating a `tf.data.Dataset` from such sources necessitates avoiding loading everything into memory at once; instead, we must construct a pipeline that reads, transforms, and provides data to the model in manageable batches.

The core idea is to leverage `tf.data.Dataset`’s ability to work with iterators rather than directly with data. This is achieved by creating a source that yields data elements, usually in batches, and subsequently feeding it into the `Dataset`. We’ll specifically look at using generators, file-based reading, and efficient preprocessing.

**1. Streaming Data from Generators:**

A practical approach involves defining a generator function that reads data from an external source, like a database, network stream, or a large file in chunks. This generator, when used within `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`, creates an iterable data source without needing to load all data into memory at initialization.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def data_generator(file_paths, batch_size=32):
    """
    A generator that yields batches of data from multiple files.
    Assumes each file contains numerical data, for example, text transformed to numerical vector.
    """
    for file_path in file_paths:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            batch = []
            for line in f:
                try:
                  numeric_data = np.fromstring(line.strip(), dtype=float, sep=',')
                  batch.append(numeric_data)
                  if len(batch) == batch_size:
                      yield np.array(batch)
                      batch = []
                except ValueError:
                    print(f"Skipping invalid line: {line.strip()}")

            if batch:  # Yield any remaining data less than a full batch
                yield np.array(batch)

# Sample Usage:
file_list = ['data_part1.txt', 'data_part2.txt', 'data_part3.txt'] # Replace with real filepaths
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    lambda: data_generator(file_list),
    output_signature=tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None, 100), dtype=tf.float64)
)

# Example of how to consume the dataset
for batch in dataset.take(2): # takes only 2 batches
  print(batch.shape)
```

In the `data_generator` function, we iterate through the provided file paths. Each file is opened, and we process lines into a numerical representation, aggregating them into batches. If a line is invalid, we skip it and log it to the console instead of throwing errors. The `yield` keyword allows the function to act as a generator, producing batches of numerical data one at a time. The crucial aspect here is that this doesn't load all data at once. The `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` then creates a dataset that pulls data from this generator on demand, ensuring only small portions of the data are held in memory at any given time.  The output signature allows the framework to understand the shape and type of data produced.

**2. Efficient File-Based Reading and Sharding:**

For data stored in file systems, directly using TensorFlow’s `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` or `tf.data.TextLineDataset` can enhance performance due to optimized file processing. This approach also includes the option to shard datasets, enabling parallel processing and distributing the workload. I've found sharding particularly helpful with large datasets across multiple machines.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Sample file creation for illustrative purposes (replace with your actual files)
def create_sample_files(base_path, num_files, num_lines_per_file):
  os.makedirs(base_path, exist_ok=True)
  for i in range(num_files):
    file_path = os.path.join(base_path, f'data_{i}.txt')
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
      for j in range(num_lines_per_file):
        f.write(f"{j},{j+1},{j+2}\n")
  return [os.path.join(base_path, f'data_{i}.txt') for i in range(num_files)]


base_path = "sample_data"
file_list = create_sample_files(base_path, num_files=3, num_lines_per_file=10)


def parse_line(line):
  """Parses a line of text into a tensor."""
  split_line = tf.strings.split(line, sep=',')
  numbers = tf.strings.to_number(split_line, out_type=tf.float64)
  return numbers


dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset(file_list)
dataset = dataset.map(parse_line) # apply the line-parsing function
dataset = dataset.batch(32) #batch size of 32
#sharding the dataset
options = tf.data.Options()
options.experimental_distribute.auto_shard_policy = tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy.DATA
dataset = dataset.with_options(options)

# Example consumption
for batch in dataset.take(2):
   print(batch.shape)

import shutil
shutil.rmtree(base_path) # cleanup

```

Here, I create sample files to demonstrate the process; in a real-world scenario, you'd provide your actual file paths. The `tf.data.TextLineDataset` directly reads text files line by line and doesn't load the whole file in one go. This avoids memory overloads.  The `map` operation applies a function, `parse_line` in this case, to transform the text into tensors.  Batching then combines these parsed lines into batches. I have included `experimental_distribute.auto_shard_policy` for demonstration, this makes this sharded automatically, a critical aspect when working with very large datasets spanning multiple machines/GPUs. The `DATA` policy is most useful in these situations, as each input file is distributed among the shards.

**3. Efficient Preprocessing and Data Transformation:**

Applying preprocessing steps directly within the `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline enables these operations to execute in parallel and on the device, reducing overhead and increasing speed compared to performing preprocessing outside the pipeline. When I am dealing with large datasets, I prioritize data operations that are fully compatible with TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data preparation (replace with real data)
def create_sample_data(num_samples, feature_size):
    """Creates sample data for the example."""
    return np.random.rand(num_samples, feature_size)

num_samples = 1000
feature_size = 20
data = create_sample_data(num_samples, feature_size)

def preprocess(example):
    """Simulates a preprocessing operation."""
    processed_data = tf.cast(example, tf.float32)
    processed_data = processed_data * 2.0 # an example preprocessing step
    return processed_data

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE) # Parallel preprocessing
dataset = dataset.batch(32)
dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE) # Prefetching improves performance

# Example consumption
for batch in dataset.take(2):
    print(batch.shape)

```

This example showcases the use of `map` to apply the `preprocess` function to each element in the dataset.  The critical feature here is `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE`. This setting allows TensorFlow to parallelize the preprocessing efficiently, accelerating the pipeline performance. Further optimization is achieved by `prefetch`, which enables the dataset to prefetch the next batch of data, overlapping data loading with the model computation, significantly speeding up the training process. The `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` allows TensorFlow to use an optimal amount of resources for both parallel calls and prefetching.

In summary, constructing `tf.data.Dataset` for very large datasets involves creating a pipeline that efficiently streams data, performs necessary transformations on demand, and avoids loading the entire dataset into memory. I've found using generators for data from external sources, leveraging file-based reading for disk data, and parallelizing preprocessing operations within the `tf.data.Dataset` are essential strategies to ensure performance and scalability.  The consistent application of batching, sharding, and prefetching also significantly impacts performance on large datasets.  I always prioritize the implementation of these techniques as they tend to have a large effect on time taken to train.
