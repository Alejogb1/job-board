Loading a TensorFlow SavedModel into Keras is straightforward, provided the SavedModel adheres to the expected format.  The key is understanding that Keras models are, fundamentally, TensorFlow graphs.  My experience building and deploying large-scale recommendation systems has shown that a successful integration hinges on correctly identifying the appropriate entry points within the SavedModel.  A common pitfall is assuming a simple `load_model()` call will suffice for all scenarios; this often fails when dealing with models not explicitly saved as Keras models.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `tf.saved_model.load()` function serves as the primary mechanism for interacting with SavedModels regardless of their origin (Keras, Estimators, custom TensorFlow code).  This function returns a `tf.saved_model.load.SavedModel` object, which contains the model's graph and variables.  Crucially, the SavedModel must contain a concrete `tf.function` or a set of functions corresponding to the model's `call()` method, which represents the forward pass.  The signature definition within the SavedModel dictates how the model accepts and processes inputs.

Directly accessing the internal weights and biases is generally discouraged unless for specific debugging or analysis tasks.  The preferred method involves leveraging the loaded `SavedModel` object as a callable object, feeding it input data, and retrieving predictions. This approach ensures consistency and avoids potential issues arising from manual manipulation of internal TensorFlow graph structures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Loading a Keras SavedModel:**

This example showcases the simplest case: a Keras model saved using `model.save()`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the SavedModel
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/keras/savedmodel")

# Access the model's call method
infer = loaded_model.signatures["serving_default"]

# Prepare sample input data
sample_input = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])

# Perform inference
predictions = infer(tf.constant(sample_input))

# Access the predictions
print(predictions['output_0'].numpy()) # Assuming 'output_0' is the output tensor name

```

**Commentary:**  This approach works seamlessly because Keras models, when saved using `model.save()`, automatically generate a suitable SavedModel with a `serving_default` signature.  This signature defines the input and output tensors necessary for inference.  The `'output_0'` key might differ based on the model's output naming convention.  Always inspect the model's signature to determine the correct key.  In my experience with large models, explicit checking of the signature keys prevented runtime errors caused by incorrect assumptions.

**Example 2: Loading a SavedModel from a Custom TensorFlow Function:**

This example demonstrates loading a model defined using plain TensorFlow functions rather than Keras's high-level API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/custom/savedmodel")

# Assume the model has a signature named 'my_custom_signature'
infer = loaded_model.signatures['my_custom_signature']

# This model might have multiple inputs and outputs
sample_input1 = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])
sample_input2 = tf.constant([[3.0, 4.0]])

predictions = infer(input1=sample_input1, input2=sample_input2)

print(predictions['output'].numpy()) #  Output tensor named 'output' in the signature
print(predictions['auxiliary_output'].numpy()) # Another potential output tensor

```


**Commentary:**  When dealing with custom TensorFlow models, careful attention to the SavedModel's signature is crucial.  The `my_custom_signature` in this example highlights the need to identify the specific signature used for inference.  This signature explicitly defines the input and output tensors, which must be addressed by their assigned names (e.g., 'input1', 'input2', 'output', 'auxiliary_output').  During my work optimizing TensorFlow models for edge devices, correctly matching signature inputs was essential for deploying the models efficiently.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential Errors and Missing Signatures:**

This example addresses common issues encountered when loading SavedModels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/savedmodel")
    print("Model loaded successfully.")

    #Attempt to access the signature; handle exceptions gracefully
    try:
        infer = loaded_model.signatures["serving_default"]
    except KeyError:
        print("Warning: 'serving_default' signature not found. Check model's signature definition.")
        # Attempt alternative signature name or handle the lack of a suitable signature
        for sig_key in loaded_model.signatures:
          print(f"Available signature: {sig_key}")
          #Try using a different signature
          infer = loaded_model.signatures[sig_key]

    # ... rest of the inference code ...

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    # Implement appropriate error handling: logging, alerts, fallback mechanisms, etc.

```

**Commentary:**  Robust error handling is critical.  The `try...except` block manages potential failures during model loading and signature access.  A `KeyError` signifies the absence of the expected signature. In such cases, exploring other available signatures or implementing a fallback mechanism becomes necessary.  My experience working on production systems underscored the importance of reliable error handling to maintain system stability.  Log messages provide valuable debugging information.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on SavedModel management.  Refer to the TensorFlow guide on saving and loading models for in-depth explanations and best practices. Additionally,  exploring resources on TensorFlow's graph structure and function definitions would prove beneficial. Consult advanced TensorFlow tutorials for techniques related to custom model building and deployment.  Finally, studying the API documentation for `tf.saved_model.load()` is essential for effective utilization.
