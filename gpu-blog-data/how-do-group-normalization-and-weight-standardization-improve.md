Group Normalization (GN) and Weight Standardization (WS) are distinct regularization techniques that address the internal covariate shift problem in deep neural networks, albeit through different mechanisms.  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for image classification led me to extensively investigate both methods, revealing their unique strengths and limitations, especially within the Keras framework.  GN focuses on normalizing activations within groups of channels, while WS directly tackles the distribution of network weights.  Their combined effect can significantly enhance model stability and generalization capabilities.


**1.  Mechanism and Impact:**

Internal covariate shift, the change in the distribution of activations during training, hinders optimization and negatively impacts generalization.  Batch Normalization (BN), a widely adopted solution, normalizes activations across the batch dimension. However, this becomes problematic with small batch sizes, a common constraint due to memory limitations, especially when dealing with high-resolution images or complex architectures.  This is where GN provides a compelling alternative.

GN normalizes activations across channels within a specified group size, rather than the entire batch.  This reduces the reliance on batch size, mitigating the performance degradation observed with small batches.  Furthermore, GN exhibits superior performance in certain network architectures, particularly those employing depthwise separable convolutions, where channel dependencies are more localized.

Weight Standardization, on the other hand, operates directly on the network's weights. It standardizes each weight layer's output by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the weights themselves, before applying the activation function.  This helps to stabilize the gradient flow and prevent vanishing/exploding gradients, improving training stability and often leading to faster convergence. WS is computationally less expensive than GN as it only operates on weights, not activations, and doesn't introduce additional trainable parameters.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three Keras code examples illustrating the integration of GN and WS. Note that dedicated layers for GN and WS might need to be implemented or sourced from external libraries as they are not standard Keras layers.  The examples assume the availability of custom `GroupNormalization` and `WeightStandardization` layers.


**Example 1:  Integrating GN into a Convolutional Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from custom_layers import GroupNormalization # Assume this file contains the custom layer

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    GroupNormalization(groups=8), # Applying GN after the convolutional layer
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward integration of a `GroupNormalization` layer after a convolutional layer. The `groups` parameter controls the number of channels grouped for normalization.  Experimentation with different group sizes is crucial to determine optimal performance for a given task and network architecture.  I found that performance often plateaued beyond a certain group size.


**Example 2:  Applying WS to a Dense Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from custom_layers import WeightStandardization # Assume this file contains the custom layer

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    WeightStandardization(), #Applying WS before activation
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

This example shows how to apply `WeightStandardization` to a fully connected layer.  The layer is applied *before* the activation function, ensuring the standardized weights are used in the activation computation.  My experiments revealed that positioning is critical for WS's efficacy; placing it after the activation function yielded significantly worse results.


**Example 3: Combining GN and WS in a Deeper Network:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from custom_layers import GroupNormalization, WeightStandardization

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    GroupNormalization(groups=4),
    keras.layers.Activation('relu'),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3)),
    GroupNormalization(groups=8),
    keras.layers.Activation('relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    WeightStandardization(),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

This example demonstrates the combined use of GN and WS in a deeper convolutional network.  GN is applied after convolutional layers to stabilize activations, while WS is used before the final dense layer to further stabilize the weight distribution.  Careful consideration of the placement and parameters of both techniques is necessary.  In my experience, this combined approach often outperformed using either GN or WS alone.  The optimal combination, however, is highly architecture-dependent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Group Normalization, I highly recommend consulting the original research paper.  Similar guidance applies to Weight Standardization, where the original publication provides valuable context and theoretical underpinnings.  Finally,  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning offers a broad perspective on regularization techniques and their applications within various neural network architectures.  Thorough experimentation and a solid understanding of the underlying mathematical principles are essential for successful implementation and optimization.  Remember to carefully analyze the performance metrics to gauge the effectiveness of these techniques in your specific context.
