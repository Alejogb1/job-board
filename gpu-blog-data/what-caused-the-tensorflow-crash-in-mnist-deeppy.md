The most frequent cause of TensorFlow crashes in scripts like `mnist-deep.py`, based on my experience debugging similar projects involving deep learning models and the MNIST dataset, stems from insufficient resources, specifically GPU memory exhaustion or improper tensor handling.  This often manifests as a cryptic error message, devoid of explicit pointers to the line of code causing the issue.  This necessitates a systematic approach to identify the root cause.

My experience includes several projects deploying complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained hardware.  In one particular instance, a seemingly simple change to the network architecture, adding a few extra convolutional layers, resulted in a TensorFlow crash during training.  The error message was unhelpful, only indicating an out-of-memory condition.  The problem was not immediately apparent, highlighting the need for careful memory management and profiling.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow, being a framework designed for large-scale computation, relies heavily on efficient memory management.  When training deep learning models, particularly on large datasets like MNIST, substantial memory is allocated to store intermediate results, model parameters (weights and biases), and activation values.  Exceeding the available GPU memory or system RAM leads to an abrupt crash.  The error usually surfaces during a computationally intensive operation, such as a forward or backward pass through the network.

Further contributing factors include:

* **Batch Size:**  Larger batch sizes require more memory. A excessively large batch size can quickly exhaust available resources.
* **Model Complexity:** Deeper networks with many parameters necessitate more memory.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  Improperly handled data preprocessing, particularly involving large datasets, can contribute to memory bloat.
* **Tensor Shapes:**  Inconsistent or unexpectedly large tensor shapes can lead to memory issues.  Debugging these requires careful inspection of tensor dimensions at various stages of the network.
* **Gradient Accumulation:**  Techniques like gradient accumulation, while beneficial for training on limited resources, need meticulous implementation to avoid memory leaks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios leading to TensorFlow crashes within a `mnist-deep.py` context.  Each example focuses on a different aspect of memory management.

**Example 1:  Excessive Batch Size**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition) ...

# Problematic batch size
batch_size = 1024  # Too large for available memory

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(batch_size)

# ... (training loop) ...

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x_batch, training=True)  # Crash likely here
    loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the risk associated with excessively large batch sizes.  A value of 1024 might overwhelm the GPU's memory capacity, depending on the model's complexity and the available resources.  Reducing `batch_size` to a smaller value (e.g., 32 or 64) is often sufficient to resolve the issue.

**Example 2:  Improper Tensor Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (model definition) ...

# Problematic tensor handling:  unnecessary copies
x_batch = np.array(x_train[0:batch_size])  # NumPy array creation consumes memory
x_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(x_batch, dtype=tf.float32)  # Additional copy

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x_tensor, training=True)
    loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)

# ... (rest of training loop) ...
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates how unnecessary conversions between NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors can significantly increase memory consumption. The code first creates a NumPy array and then converts it to a TensorFlow tensor, leading to redundant memory allocation.  Using TensorFlow datasets and avoiding unnecessary NumPy array creation helps in optimizing memory usage.

**Example 3:  Memory Leaks with Custom Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units, units), initializer='random_normal')
        #Missing crucial memory cleanup

    def call(self, x):
        return tf.matmul(x, self.w)

# ... (model incorporating MyCustomLayer) ...
```

**Commentary:** This showcases a potential memory leak within a custom layer.  While not immediately obvious, failing to properly manage intermediate tensors within custom layers can lead to accumulation of memory over time, eventually resulting in a crash.  Carefully releasing unused tensors or leveraging techniques like `tf.function` for better memory management is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To effectively troubleshoot these issues, I highly recommend these steps:

1. **Reduce batch size:** Begin by systematically reducing the batch size.  Experiment with smaller values until the crash ceases.
2. **Profile memory usage:** Utilize TensorFlow's profiling tools to pinpoint memory bottlenecks. These tools help visualize memory allocation and identify memory-intensive operations.
3. **Optimize data preprocessing:** Streamline data loading and preprocessing to avoid unnecessary memory copies.
4. **Review tensor shapes:**  Carefully inspect tensor shapes at different stages of the network.  Unexpectedly large tensors can lead to crashes.
5. **Check for memory leaks:** Use tools designed to detect memory leaks to determine if any resources are not being properly released.
6. **Use TensorBoard:**  Monitor metrics during training using TensorBoard. This can aid in the detection of sudden jumps in memory consumption.
7. **Upgrade TensorFlow:**  Ensure you are using the latest stable version of TensorFlow, which may include performance enhancements and bug fixes related to memory management.
8. **Consider mixed precision training:** Employ mixed precision training to reduce memory footprint by using lower precision data types (e.g., FP16).  This usually requires careful consideration to avoid precision loss.


By meticulously addressing these points, identifying and rectifying the root cause of the TensorFlow crash in your `mnist-deep.py` script, and thus preventing similar issues in future projects, becomes feasible.  Remember systematic debugging, thorough examination of memory usage, and attention to detail are pivotal to successfully deploying and training deep learning models.
