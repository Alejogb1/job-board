Tokenization in the context of a fine-tuned BERT model for sequence classification requires a nuanced approach, deviating from simpler tokenization methods used with less sophisticated models.  My experience in developing sentiment analysis systems for financial news articles highlighted the importance of leveraging the model's pre-trained tokenizer for optimal performance. Directly applying a generic tokenizer will likely result in suboptimal classification accuracy, owing to the specific vocabulary and sub-word tokenization strategies employed during BERT's pre-training.

The core principle is to utilize the tokenizer associated with the specific BERT variant used for fine-tuning. This ensures consistency between the pre-training phase, the fine-tuning phase, and the inference phase.  Inconsistencies here can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect token IDs and consequently inaccurate classifications.  Failure to employ the correct tokenizer represents a frequent source of errors I've encountered in collaborative projects, even among experienced NLP engineers.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The process begins with loading the pre-trained BERT model and its corresponding tokenizer. The tokenizer is not a standalone entity; it's intrinsically linked to the model’s architecture and vocabulary.  It typically employs WordPiece or SentencePiece sub-word tokenization, breaking down words into smaller units to handle out-of-vocabulary words effectively.  Once loaded, the tokenizer transforms the input sentence into a sequence of numerical token IDs.  These IDs are then used as input to the fine-tuned `BertForSequenceClassification` model for processing.  The model expects this specific numerical representation, derived from its associated tokenizer, not a representation produced by a different method.

Critically, the tokenizer also handles tasks like adding special tokens, such as the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens necessary for BERT’s architecture. The [CLS] token's embedding is often used for classification, as it summarizes the entire sequence's information. The [SEP] token separates multiple sentences in a single input.  Ignoring these crucial steps will invariably cause prediction failures.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples demonstrate tokenization using different PyTorch versions and illustrate handling potential issues.  I’ve personally encountered these scenarios and refined the code based on those experiences.

**Example 1:  PyTorch 1.13 with transformers library (common setup):**

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer;  replace with your specific model name
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"  
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

sentence = "This is a sample sentence."
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentence, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# encoded_input contains 'input_ids', 'attention_mask', potentially 'token_type_ids'
print(encoded_input)

# Further processing with the model:
# with torch.no_grad():
#     outputs = model(**encoded_input)
#     predictions = outputs.logits
```

This code snippet showcases the standard procedure. The `padding=True` and `truncation=True` arguments ensure consistent input lengths, crucial for batch processing. `return_tensors='pt'` returns PyTorch tensors.  The commented-out section shows how to feed the tokenized input to the model for classification.  Remember to replace `"bert-base-uncased"` with your fine-tuned model's name.


**Example 2: Handling potential errors (out-of-vocabulary words):**

```python
try:
    encoded_input = tokenizer(sentence, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Error during tokenization: {e}")
    # Handle the error, potentially by replacing unknown tokens with a special token
    # or logging the error for analysis
    # ... error handling logic ...

# ... rest of the code ...
```

This example incorporates error handling.  While BERT's sub-word tokenization mitigates out-of-vocabulary issues, edge cases might still occur.  Robust error handling is essential for production-ready systems.  The commented section indicates how one might handle the exception, possibly replacing unknown words with a special token representing "unknown" or logging the issue for later investigation.


**Example 3:  Tokenization with different special tokens (less common but important):**

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizerFast

# Assuming a custom tokenizer was saved during fine-tuning with different special tokens
custom_tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("path/to/my/custom/tokenizer")

sentence = "This is another sentence."
encoded_input = custom_tokenizer(sentence, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
print(encoded_input)
```

This example demonstrates the use of a custom tokenizer, potentially created during the fine-tuning process if you modified the special tokens. This is less common but crucial when you've fine-tuned with non-standard special token configurations.  Replace `"path/to/my/custom/tokenizer"` with the actual path.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official Hugging Face Transformers documentation;  "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet;  research papers on BERT and related architectures (particularly those focusing on tokenization strategies).  A comprehensive understanding of sub-word tokenization algorithms (WordPiece, SentencePiece) is also highly beneficial.  Furthermore, exploring the source code of the Transformers library can be illuminating for deeper insights.


In summary, successfully tokenizing a sentence for use with a fine-tuned `BertForSequenceClassification` model hinges on using the model's associated tokenizer consistently. This ensures alignment between the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference stages, resulting in reliable and accurate classifications.  Failing to adhere to this crucial step is a common source of errors,  as my past experiences have repeatedly shown.  Robust error handling and a thorough understanding of the tokenizer's functionalities are essential for creating production-ready NLP applications.
