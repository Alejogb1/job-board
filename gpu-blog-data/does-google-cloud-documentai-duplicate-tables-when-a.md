Document AI's handling of table data during page rotation is not a simple duplication; it's a complex interaction between the OCR engine's interpretation of the visual layout and the Document AI processor's subsequent data structuring.  My experience working on large-scale document processing pipelines for financial institutions has shown that rotation significantly impacts the accuracy of table detection and, consequently, the resulting data.  Duplication is not the typical outcome, but rather an altered, often fragmented, representation of the original table.

The core issue stems from the fact that Google Cloud Document AI, like most Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, relies on spatial relationships to identify and extract table structures.  Rotation alters these spatial relationships fundamentally.  The algorithm, designed for a standard orientation, must reinterpret the visual patterns after a rotation.  This reinterpretation might lead to several scenarios:  the table is correctly identified but with altered cell coordinates; the table is fragmented into multiple smaller tables; or, the table is entirely missed due to the distortion of its characteristic visual cues (e.g., grid lines, consistent row/column spacing).

This process is not inherently flawed; it reflects the inherent challenges in processing arbitrarily rotated documents.  The OCR engine first identifies text blocks, lines, and layout elements irrespective of orientation. Subsequently, it applies heuristics to identify tables based on the identified elements and their relative positions. Rotation disrupts these heuristics, causing unpredictable outcomes.  The algorithm does *not* duplicate the table; instead, it attempts to reconstruct the table based on the newly interpreted spatial information.

Let's illustrate this with three code examples demonstrating different potential outcomes, assuming the use of the Document AI Python client library.  These examples are simplified for clarity and assume successful document processing and table extraction.  Error handling and more robust data validation would be essential in a production environment, a point I've learned through years of debugging large-scale document ingestion processes.

**Example 1: Partial Table Extraction**

```python
import google.cloud.documentai_v1 as documentai

# ... (Authentication and client initialization) ...

document = documentai.Document.from_bytes(...) # Rotated document

for page in document.pages:
    for table in page.tables:
        print(f"Table detected on page {page.page_number}:")
        for row in table.rows:
            for cell in row.cells:
                print(cell.text)

# Output might show only parts of the original table, or multiple smaller tables
# representing fragments of the original.
```

Here, the rotation might cause the table detection algorithm to only partially recognize the table, leading to incomplete data extraction.  This is a frequent observation, particularly with complex or poorly formatted tables.  The `table` objects will contain only the successfully identified parts.

**Example 2: Altered Cell Coordinates**

```python
import google.cloud.documentai_v1 as documentai
import json

# ... (Authentication and client initialization) ...

document = documentai.Document.from_bytes(...) # Rotated document

for page in document.pages:
    for table in page.tables:
        table_data = []
        for row in table.rows:
            row_data = [cell.text for cell in row.cells]
            table_data.append(row_data)
        print(json.dumps(table_data, indent=2))

#Output will be a JSON representation of the table. Note the coordinates are not directly
#accessible, but cell order changes reflecting the altered layout interpretation.
```

This example focuses on the data itself. The output shows the extracted table data.  While the data might be complete, the order of cells within rows and rows within the table will reflect the algorithm's interpretation of the rotated layout.  This can manifest as seemingly transposed columns or rows.

**Example 3: Table Misinterpretation**

```python
import google.cloud.documentai_v1 as documentai

# ... (Authentication and client initialization) ...

document = documentai.Document.from_bytes(...) # Rotated document

if not document.pages[0].tables:
    print("No tables detected.") #Possible outcome after rotation.

# Further processing is conditional on a successful table detection.
```

This example highlights a critical scenario: the OCR engine might fail to detect a table at all after rotation. This is particularly likely with tables that rely heavily on visual cues that are distorted by rotation (e.g., faint grid lines). The absence of tables (`len(document.pages[0].tables) == 0`) signifies a failure in the table recognition process.


In summary, Google Cloud Document AI does not duplicate tables when a page is rotated 90 degrees.  Instead, it attempts to reinterpret the visual layout and extract the table data based on the rotated image.  This reinterpretation can lead to partial extraction, altered cell ordering, or complete failure to detect the table.  The accuracy of table extraction after rotation is heavily dependent on the table's complexity, the quality of the original document scan, and the clarity of visual cues used by the OCR engine to identify the table's structure.  Preprocessing steps, such as deskewing or automatic rotation correction, prior to sending the document to Document AI, can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of table extraction in these situations.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* Google Cloud Document AI documentation:  Focus on the specifics of table extraction and the limitations related to layout and orientation.
* Advanced OCR techniques: Investigate techniques for handling skewed or rotated documents, including preprocessing methods and advanced OCR algorithms.
* Data cleaning and validation strategies: Develop robust methods to handle inconsistencies and potential data loss arising from imperfect OCR and table extraction.  Consider techniques for handling missing or out-of-order data.  A thorough understanding of data quality assessment is crucial.
