The fundamental determinant in how thread blocks are mapped to NVIDIA GPU multiprocessors (MPs) is the occupancy.  My experience optimizing CUDA kernels for high-performance computing has consistently shown that maximizing occupancy, while considering register usage and shared memory usage, is paramount for achieving optimal performance.  Occupancy directly influences the effective utilization of the MPs, as it represents the number of concurrently active warps per MP.  This, in turn, dictates the throughput and overall efficiency of the kernel execution.  Understanding this relationship is crucial for efficiently utilizing the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.

**1.  Explanation of Thread Block Mapping:**

NVIDIA GPUs employ a hierarchical execution model.  Threads are grouped into thread blocks, which are then scheduled onto Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  The scheduling is not a one-to-one mapping. Instead, it's a dynamic process influenced by several factors.

A single SM can concurrently execute multiple thread blocks.  However, the number of thread blocks that can run simultaneously on a single SM is limited by resource constraints: the number of registers, the amount of shared memory available, and the available warp schedulers.  The number of concurrently active warps within an SM is directly related to the occupancy.  Each warp consists of 32 threads.

The driver and runtime environment manage the mapping of thread blocks to SMs.  This process considers the characteristics of the kernel and the GPU architecture, aiming to maximize occupancy and minimize resource contention.  There's no deterministic, direct mapping of specific thread blocks to specific SMs.  Instead, the runtime dynamically assigns thread blocks to available SMs based on resource availability and scheduling priorities.

Factors influencing the mapping include:

* **Thread block size:**  Larger thread blocks can improve performance by reducing overhead, but only up to the point where register and shared memory limits are reached. Exceeding these limits leads to reduced occupancy.

* **Register usage per thread:**  High register usage per thread decreases the number of threads that can reside on an SM concurrently.

* **Shared memory usage per block:**  Similar to register usage, excessive shared memory usage per thread block restricts the number of concurrently executing blocks.

* **Hardware limitations:**  Each SM has a fixed number of registers, shared memory banks, and warp schedulers. These hardware constraints directly impact occupancy and therefore the number of thread blocks that can run concurrently.

The NVIDIA CUDA Occupancy Calculator is an invaluable tool for understanding and optimizing this process.  This tool, given kernel parameters like thread block dimensions, register usage, and shared memory usage, calculates the occupancy and helps fine-tune kernel parameters for improved performance.  By iteratively adjusting thread block dimensions and optimizing register/shared memory usage, one can approach the theoretical maximum occupancy, improving overall performance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how different thread block configurations impact occupancy.  These examples are simplified for clarity but represent fundamental principles.

**Example 1:  Suboptimal Thread Block Configuration:**

```c++
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation and data initialization) ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256; //Potentially suboptimal
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(data, N);

  // ... (data retrieval and cleanup) ...
}
```

**Commentary:** While a thread block size of 256 might seem reasonable, it might lead to suboptimal occupancy if the kernel's register usage per thread is high.  The CUDA Occupancy Calculator would reveal the impact of this choice, which should be iteratively refined.  A larger block size could lead to reduced occupancy due to exceeding the SM's resource limits.


**Example 2: Optimized Thread Block Configuration (Hypothetical):**

```c++
__global__ void optimizedKernel(int *data, int N) {
  // ... (similar kernel code as Example 1) ...
}

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation and data initialization) ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 128; //Potentially optimal after occupancy analysis
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  optimizedKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(data, N);

  // ... (data retrieval and cleanup) ...
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates a hypothetical scenario where reducing the thread block size to 128, after analyzing the kernel's resource usage with the occupancy calculator, improves occupancy and, consequently, performance. This reduction could be necessary if the kernel uses a significant amount of registers per thread.


**Example 3: Shared Memory Usage and Occupancy:**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *data, int *result, int N) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[tid] = data[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block
    // ... Perform computation using sharedData ...
    __syncthreads();
    result[i] = sharedData[tid];
  }
}
```

**Commentary:** This example incorporates shared memory. Efficient use of shared memory can significantly improve performance by reducing global memory accesses. However, excessive shared memory usage can negatively impact occupancy. The size of `sharedData` needs careful consideration.  Choosing a size that balances performance gains from shared memory with the impact on occupancy is crucial. The `__syncthreads()` calls ensure data consistency within the thread block.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide, the NVIDIA CUDA Occupancy Calculator, and the NVIDIA Nsight Compute profiler are invaluable resources for understanding and optimizing thread block mapping and occupancy.  Understanding the GPU architecture, particularly the characteristics of the specific SMs, is also critical.  Careful profiling using the aforementioned tools is essential for identifying bottlenecks and fine-tuning kernel configurations.  Additionally, a deep understanding of memory access patterns and efficient memory management techniques is crucial for maximizing performance.
