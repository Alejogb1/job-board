Obtaining prediction probabilities from a scikit-learn model deployed on Google AI Platform requires careful consideration of the model's architecture and the prediction service's output format.  My experience deploying numerous scikit-learn models, ranging from simple linear regressions to complex ensembles, has highlighted the importance of explicitly requesting probability outputs during both model training and prediction serving.  Failure to do so will often result in receiving only class labels, hindering downstream probabilistic analysis.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Scikit-learn models typically provide probability estimates through methods like `predict_proba()`. However, the direct application of this method within the prediction serving environment of Google AI Platform necessitates a slightly different approach.  The core issue lies in how the model is packaged and the prediction request is formatted.  The prediction request must instruct the deployed model to return probabilities, rather than simply class labels.  This is accomplished by leveraging the appropriate request structure defined by the AI Platform prediction service. The response then needs to be parsed correctly to extract these probabilities.  The structure and method vary slightly depending on whether you use the REST API or a client library such as the Google Cloud Client Library for Python. Both methods ultimately achieve the same goal: obtaining probability scores from the model.  Incorrect handling can lead to the reception of only the predicted class without associated confidence values.

Furthermore, the type of model significantly influences the format of the probability output.  For classification models, the output will be a NumPy array where each row represents a data instance and each column represents the probability of belonging to a specific class.  For regression models, the concept of probability is less direct; instead, the model provides predictions, and you might need to apply a transformation (for instance, using a sigmoid function for a binary outcome) to derive probability-like scores representing the confidence of the prediction.  Always carefully review the documentation of your specific scikit-learn model to understand the format of its prediction output.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  REST API with a Binary Classification Model**

This example demonstrates retrieving probabilities from a binary classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression) deployed via the REST API.

```python
import requests
import json
import numpy as np

# Define the prediction instance.  Replace with your actual data.
instances = [{"input_features": [0.5, 0.2, 0.8]}]

#  API endpoint - replace with your deployed model's endpoint.
url = "https://your-deployed-model-endpoint/predict"

# Create the request payload.  Note the inclusion of instances.
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
data = {"instances": instances}

# Make the prediction request.
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

# Check for successful response.
if response.status_code == 200:
    prediction = response.json()
    probabilities = np.array(prediction["predictions"])[:, 1] # Assuming class probabilities are in the second column
    print(f"Prediction Probabilities: {probabilities}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

This code uses the REST API to send a prediction request. The crucial point is the structure of the `data` variable, which conforms to the expected format by the AI Platform. The response is then parsed to extract the probabilities which in this binary case, are generally found in the second column of the `predictions` array.

**Example 2: Google Cloud Client Library for Python with a Multi-Class Model**

This example showcases the use of the Google Cloud Client Library for Python with a multi-class model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier).

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform
from google.protobuf import json_format
from google.protobuf.struct_pb2 import Value

# Initialize AI Platform client. Replace with your project details.
aiplatform.init(project="your-project-id", location="your-region")

# Define the model endpoint - replace with your deployed model's endpoint.
endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint("your-endpoint-id")

# Define the instances. Replace with your actual data.
instances = [
    {"input_features": [0.1, 0.9, 0.2]},
    {"input_features": [0.7, 0.1, 0.5]},
]

# This section was updated to address issues with prediction output, handling various model types more robustly.
predictions = endpoint.predict(instances=instances)

for prediction in predictions.predictions:
    try:
        probabilities = prediction.probabilities
        print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
    except AttributeError:
        print(f"Probabilities not directly available.  Check model output format.")

```

This example utilizes the client library, simplifying the interaction with the AI Platform.  Error handling is included, to account for situations where the probability output may not be directly accessible or not in the expected format; for example, with different types of models, the output structure can change.


**Example 3: Handling Regression Models and Probability Estimation**

Regression models do not natively output probabilities. To obtain probability-like scores, we need to add a post-processing step.

```python
import requests
import json
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit  # Sigmoid function

# ... (API request as in Example 1, assuming a regression model is deployed) ...

if response.status_code == 200:
    prediction = response.json()
    regression_predictions = np.array(prediction["predictions"])

    # Apply sigmoid if you need probabilities for a binary outcome.
    probability_estimates = expit(regression_predictions)  

    print(f"Regression Predictions: {regression_predictions}")
    print(f"Probability-like Estimates (after sigmoid): {probability_estimates}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

This example focuses on adapting the output of a regression model to obtain probability-like scores.  We use the sigmoid function to transform the regression predictions into values between 0 and 1. This is only appropriate for models where the output can be interpreted as a continuous representation of probability, like when dealing with logistic regression where prediction output can be considered a logit score. Other approaches, like calculating confidence intervals, might be more suitable for other regression model types.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Google Cloud documentation on AI Platform Prediction, specifically the sections detailing REST API usage and the Google Cloud Client Library for Python, provide the most accurate and up-to-date instructions.  Consult the scikit-learn documentation to understand the specific `predict_proba` method for your chosen model.  Thoroughly review the deployment process documentation for scikit-learn models within the AI Platform environment; paying close attention to model packaging and prediction request formatting.  Understanding the nuances of serialisation and deserialisation between Python and the server-side environment can often save considerable debugging time.  Finally, the official Python guide for NumPy and its array manipulation capabilities is crucial for processing the received prediction data.
