The crucial aspect often overlooked when preparing data for a Keras LSTM model is the inherent sequential nature of the input.  It's not simply a matter of ensuring the correct number of features; the temporal dimension must be explicitly defined and consistently formatted.  My experience working on time-series forecasting projects for financial institutions highlighted this repeatedly; failure to correctly shape the data resulted in model instability and poor predictive accuracy.  Understanding this fundamental principle is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation**

A Keras LSTM expects input data in a specific three-dimensional format: `(samples, timesteps, features)`.

* **samples:** This represents the number of independent data sequences. For example, if you're predicting stock prices, each stock would be a sample.  If analyzing sensor data, each sensor reading session would constitute a sample.

* **timesteps:** This is the length of each sequence.  In a time-series context, this corresponds to the number of time steps considered for each prediction.  A model predicting the next day's stock price based on the previous five days' data would have `timesteps = 5`.

* **features:**  This refers to the number of independent variables at each time step.  For stock price prediction, this might include the opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume – giving five features.  Sensor data might include temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.

Incorrectly shaping the data will lead to `ValueError` exceptions during model training, frequently indicating a mismatch between the input shape and the expected input shape of the LSTM layer.  Furthermore, even if the code runs without errors, inaccurate shaping can severely impact performance, leading to meaningless results.  The data must explicitly reflect the temporal dependencies the LSTM is designed to capture.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate correct data preparation using NumPy for different scenarios.  These are simplified for clarity but illustrate core principles applicable to more complex situations. I’ve extensively used this approach throughout my work, adapting it to diverse datasets.

**Example 1: Single Feature Time Series**

This example focuses on a simple time series with a single feature, such as daily temperature readings.

```python
import numpy as np

# Raw data: Daily temperatures
data = np.array([20, 22, 25, 23, 26, 28, 27, 29, 30, 29])

# Define the number of timesteps (e.g., using the previous 3 days to predict the next)
timesteps = 3

# Reshape the data for the LSTM
reshaped_data = []
for i in range(len(data) - timesteps):
    reshaped_data.append(data[i:i + timesteps])

reshaped_data = np.array(reshaped_data)
reshaped_data = reshaped_data.reshape(reshaped_data.shape[0], timesteps, 1) # Shape: (samples, timesteps, features)

print(reshaped_data.shape)  # Output: (7, 3, 1)  7 samples, 3 timesteps, 1 feature
print(reshaped_data)
```

This code iterates through the data, creating sequences of length `timesteps`. The final `reshape` operation ensures the correct (samples, timesteps, features) format.  Note the crucial `reshape(..., 1)` to explicitly define the single feature dimension.


**Example 2: Multiple Features Time Series**

This example extends the previous one to include multiple features. Consider predicting stock prices using opening price and volume.

```python
import numpy as np

# Raw data: Opening price and volume for multiple days
data = np.array([[100, 1000], [102, 1200], [105, 1100], [103, 900], [106, 1300], [108, 1400], [107, 1250]])

timesteps = 3
features = 2

reshaped_data = []
for i in range(len(data) - timesteps):
    reshaped_data.append(data[i:i + timesteps])

reshaped_data = np.array(reshaped_data)
reshaped_data = reshaped_data.reshape(reshaped_data.shape[0], timesteps, features) # Shape: (samples, timesteps, features)

print(reshaped_data.shape)  # Output: (4, 3, 2) 4 samples, 3 timesteps, 2 features
print(reshaped_data)
```

Here, the `features` variable explicitly sets the number of features (opening price and volume).  The `reshape` function adapts accordingly.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Samples with Varying Length Sequences**

Real-world datasets often present sequences of unequal lengths.  This requires padding shorter sequences to match the length of the longest sequence.  This example uses a more concise approach employing `pad_sequences` from Keras.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Raw data: multiple sequences of varying lengths. Each inner list is a sample.
data = [
    np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
    np.array([6, 7, 8]),
    np.array([9, 10, 11, 12])
]

# Pad sequences to the length of the longest sequence.
padded_data = pad_sequences(data, padding='pre', dtype='float32')

# Reshape to (samples, timesteps, features) - in this case, only 1 feature per timestep.
reshaped_data = padded_data.reshape(padded_data.shape[0], padded_data.shape[1], 1)

print(reshaped_data.shape) # Output will depend on the length of longest sequence and the number of samples.
print(reshaped_data)
```

This illustrates a robust method for handling uneven sequence lengths, a common challenge in real-world applications. The `padding='pre'` argument adds padding to the beginning of shorter sequences.  The `dtype='float32'` ensures data type compatibility with Keras.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of LSTM networks and their applications, I would recommend exploring the official Keras documentation and tutorials.  Furthermore, several excellent textbooks delve into the intricacies of deep learning, offering comprehensive explanations of recurrent neural networks and related concepts.  Finally, consulting research papers on time series analysis and LSTM applications will provide insights into advanced techniques and best practices.  These resources will equip you with the knowledge to navigate more complex data preparation tasks.
