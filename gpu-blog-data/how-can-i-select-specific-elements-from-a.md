TensorFlow’s ability to perform complex operations hinges on its adeptness at manipulating tensor data structures, which are multi-dimensional arrays. Precisely selecting elements within these tensors is fundamental for targeted computation and data extraction, and I've encountered the need for this across various image processing and time-series analysis projects over the years. This task is not a simple one-dimensional indexing problem but requires consideration of multiple axes and potentially irregular selection patterns.

The primary mechanism for selecting elements is indexing, which operates similarly to how indexing works with standard Python lists or NumPy arrays. However, TensorFlow introduces its own nuances, especially when dealing with symbolic tensors representing computational graphs. Indexing in TensorFlow occurs through the use of integer indices, slices, and ellipsis notation. One critical point is that any such operation generates a new tensor, maintaining the immutability of the original. Indexing doesn't modify the tensor in place; it rather derives a new tensor with the selected data.

**Understanding Basic Indexing**

For a tensor with *n* dimensions, indexing requires specifying *n* indices, one for each dimension. Consider a tensor with shape (3, 4, 5). Accessing a single element requires a three-element tuple indicating the position along each dimension. For instance, to retrieve the element at position (1, 2, 3), you'd use `tensor[1, 2, 3]`.

Slicing is equally powerful. Rather than selecting a single element, it extracts a range along a particular dimension. Slices are denoted using the colon operator, `:` within the brackets. The syntax for a slice is `start:end:step`. The `start` index is included, and the `end` index is excluded. The `step` argument specifies the interval between the selected elements. Omitting `start` defaults to the beginning of the dimension, while omitting `end` selects all the way to the end. Similarly, omitting `step` defaults to one. Thus, `tensor[0:2, :, 1:4]` selects rows 0 and 1, all columns, and elements from column 1 to 3 along the third dimension. A single colon `[:]` signifies that the entire dimension should be included.

Furthermore, TensorFlow supports ellipsis `...` to represent multiple colons for all remaining, unspecific dimensions. For example, if you have a 4D tensor and only want to slice along the first and second axes, you could write `tensor[1:3, 2:4, ...]`.

**Code Examples**

Below are three examples demonstrating various techniques:

**Example 1: Basic Indexing and Slicing**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 3D tensor with shape (2, 3, 4)
tensor_1 = tf.constant([
    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]],
    [[13, 14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24]]
], dtype=tf.int32)

# Accessing a single element
element_1 = tensor_1[1, 2, 3]
print("Element at (1, 2, 3):", element_1.numpy())  # Output: Element at (1, 2, 3): 24

# Slicing along multiple dimensions
slice_1 = tensor_1[0, 1:3, 1:3]
print("Slice of rows 1-2, cols 1-2 from first batch:\n", slice_1.numpy())
# Output:
# Slice of rows 1-2, cols 1-2 from first batch:
# [[6 7]
#  [10 11]]

slice_2 = tensor_1[:, :, 0:2]
print("Slicing the first two elements along dimension 3:\n", slice_2.numpy())
# Output:
# Slicing the first two elements along dimension 3:
# [[[ 1  2]
#   [ 5  6]
#   [ 9 10]]

#  [[13 14]
#   [17 18]
#   [21 22]]]
```
This first example demonstrates retrieving a single element and how slices can be combined to retrieve portions along various axes. The `.numpy()` method is used to extract the underlying NumPy array for visualization.

**Example 2: Ellipsis Notation and Negative Indexing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Creating a 4D tensor
tensor_2 = tf.constant(tf.range(24).reshape(2, 2, 2, 3))

#Using ellipsis to select the first element on the second and third axes
slice_3 = tensor_2[0, 1, ...]
print("Slice with Ellipsis:\n", slice_3.numpy())
# Output:
# Slice with Ellipsis:
# [[ 3  4  5]
#  [ 9 10 11]]

slice_4 = tensor_2[..., 1]
print("Slice with Ellipsis and a selected last index:\n", slice_4.numpy())
# Output
# Slice with Ellipsis and a selected last index:
# [[[ 1  4]
#   [ 7 10]]

#  [[13 16]
#   [19 22]]]

# Negative indexing (selecting last elements in axes)
slice_5 = tensor_2[-1, -1, :, -1]
print("Slice with negative indexing:\n", slice_5.numpy())
# Output: Slice with negative indexing: [17 23]
```

This second example demonstrates the flexibility that the ellipsis notation provides. It also shows negative indexing, where `-1` refers to the last element along a given dimension, enabling indexing from the end of the tensor.

**Example 3: Boolean Masking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 1D tensor
tensor_3 = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Create a boolean mask based on a condition
mask = tensor_3 > 30

# Use boolean mask for indexing
masked_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor_3, mask)
print("Boolean Masking Results:", masked_tensor.numpy())  # Output: Boolean Masking Results: [40 50]

#Create a 2D tensor
tensor_4 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
mask2 = tf.constant([[True, False],[False, True],[True, True]])
masked_tensor_2 = tf.boolean_mask(tensor_4, mask2)
print("Boolean Masking with 2D mask:\n", masked_tensor_2.numpy()) #Output: Boolean Masking with 2D mask: [1 4 5 6]
```
This last example demonstrates the power of using boolean masks to select elements based on a condition. The `tf.boolean_mask` function takes the original tensor and a mask tensor, where each `True` value in the mask corresponds to the selection of the element in the same position from the tensor. Note how in multi-dimensional tensors the masked results are flattened.

**Considerations and Limitations**

While indexing is powerful, it's essential to be mindful of performance, particularly in a TensorFlow graph environment where computations are deferred. Excessive or complex indexing operations, especially within loops, can create performance bottlenecks. Whenever possible, vectorize your operations to take advantage of TensorFlow’s optimized backend implementations.

Additionally, while slices can span multiple dimensions, individual axes must be contiguous slices. Operations that require non-contiguous access are better addressed through a combination of indexing, reshaping and boolean masking or `tf.gather_nd`.

**Recommendations**

To gain a thorough understanding, consulting TensorFlow's official documentation on slicing and indexing is essential. The API reference provides comprehensive details on all supported operations, including advanced indexing with `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd`. For working with tensors, the official tutorial on basic tensor operations from TensorFlow's website is a must-read. Furthermore, practical exercises from various online courses can help solidify these concepts. Experimenting with different indexing combinations on various tensor shapes will reinforce understanding. Remember, proficient tensor manipulation requires both a conceptual grasp and hands-on practice.
