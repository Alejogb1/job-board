The characteristic small size of a validation dataset in machine learning stems directly from its core purpose: to provide an unbiased estimate of a model's generalization performance on unseen data, a goal that contrasts sharply with the training process. During my years building predictive models for financial markets, the tension between model complexity and the need for robust validation was a constant challenge, and I learned that a small validation set is, in essence, a necessary constraint for effective evaluation.

The primary objective of the validation set is not to contribute substantially to the learning process itself, as the training set does. Instead, it acts as a measuring stick. Its limited size ensures that the majority of available data is used for model fitting, where parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize training error. A large validation set, while seemingly beneficial in providing more granular performance insights, would significantly reduce the size of the training set, potentially impacting the model's overall accuracy. This trade-off often leads to a scenario where a model might be well-validated on the holdout data but ultimately perform poorly on genuinely new data due to insufficient training exposure.

The size of the validation set is typically determined as a relatively small proportion of the total data, often ranging from 10% to 30%, although this can vary based on the total data available, the complexity of the model being used, and the nature of the data itself. In situations where data is exceedingly scarce, techniques like k-fold cross-validation mitigate some of these concerns by cycling which data partition is used for validation, effectively allowing all the data to be used for training and validation at some point.

The effectiveness of a validation set hinges critically on its ability to represent the population of unseen data accurately. If the validation set is too large, there's a potential risk that it overly influences the model's training through performance evaluations during hyperparameter tuning. I found, when working on an anomaly detection system for credit card fraud, that over-optimizing on a large validation set led to the model failing to capture novel fraud patterns that were not fully present in the validation data, which severely hampered its real-world utility.

Consider, for example, a scenario where we are classifying handwritten digits using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python with TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train_full, y_train_full), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Split training data into training and validation sets
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train_full, y_train_full, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Normalize pixel values
x_train, x_val, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_val / 255.0, x_test/ 255.0

print(f"Training data size: {x_train.shape[0]}")
print(f"Validation data size: {x_val.shape[0]}")
print(f"Test data size: {x_test.shape[0]}")

# Define a simple CNN model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train.reshape(-1,28,28,1), y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val.reshape(-1,28,28,1), y_val))
```
In this code, `train_test_split` divides the original training set (60,000 images) into training (48,000) and validation (12,000) sets. This division creates a validation set of 20% the size of the full training data, leaving the rest for training. This is a very standard practice. The final output will give the size of each split and a performance metric, the accuracy in this case for the model on the training and validation sets.

Now, let us consider a slight modification. Imagine the dataset was not pre-split into a training set and test set, and we had to do all splitting ourselves.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_full, y_full) , _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Split into training and a hold-out set
x_train_full, x_holdout, y_train_full, y_holdout = train_test_split(x_full, y_full, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#Further split training set into training and validation set
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train_full, y_train_full, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)


# Normalize pixel values
x_train, x_val, x_holdout = x_train / 255.0, x_val / 255.0, x_holdout/ 255.0

print(f"Training data size: {x_train.shape[0]}")
print(f"Validation data size: {x_val.shape[0]}")
print(f"Hold out data size: {x_holdout.shape[0]}")

# Define a simple CNN model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train.reshape(-1,28,28,1), y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val.reshape(-1,28,28,1), y_val))
```
Here, the original dataset is first split 80/20 into a training set (and associated validation set) and a holdout set, the latter used as an independent test set at the very end of the process. The training set is further split again into an 80/20 (of that split) ratio into the train and validation set. The validation set here has a total share of (0.8 * 0.2) or 16% of the original dataset, but is still a meaningful proportion to enable hyperparameter tuning. The key is that training set is still the dominant data resource.

Finally, consider an example with cross validation, which is useful when working with limited datasets.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
import numpy as np


# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_full, y_full) , _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values
x_full = x_full / 255.0

# Define a simple CNN model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

kfold = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
fold_no = 1

for train_index, val_index in kfold.split(x_full):
    x_train, x_val = x_full[train_index], x_full[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y_full[train_index], y_full[val_index]

    print(f"Training on fold number {fold_no}")
    print(f"Training data size: {x_train.shape[0]}")
    print(f"Validation data size: {x_val.shape[0]}")
    model = create_model()
    model.fit(x_train.reshape(-1,28,28,1), y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val.reshape(-1,28,28,1), y_val), verbose = 0)
    fold_no += 1
```

Here we iterate through training and evaluation cycles with different validation data in each iteration. In this example, there are 5 folds, meaning in each iteration the model is training on 80% of the data and validating against 20% of the data. The advantage here is that every data point is used for both training and validation, though not in the same iteration, ensuring a more comprehensive assessment of model performance given the data. Cross-validation is the preferred method if data is limited, although, in production it is common to evaluate models against an independent, static set of data.

The selection of the size of a validation dataset, despite its common use as an explicit split, is deeply rooted in the balancing act between maximizing data available for training, and the requirements to assess the performance of a model against new or unseen data. Ultimately, the validation process is about generalization rather than strict optimization.

For further understanding, explore resources that explain hyperparameter tuning using validation sets. Materials discussing model selection strategies and cross-validation techniques can also provide broader context. In addition, it is worthwhile to examine research in learning theory which often tackles the statistical nature of generalization. Texts and tutorials on applied machine learning, available from various academic institutions and reputable publishers, are also valuable resources that can contextualize the validation dataset within a comprehensive machine-learning workflow.
