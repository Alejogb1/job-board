The absence of calculated gradients in PyTorch often stems from a mismatch between the model's `requires_grad` attribute settings and the actual computation graph construction.  Specifically, parameters unintentionally detached from the computation graph, or operations performed outside the `torch.autograd` context, will prevent gradient backpropagation.  I've personally encountered this issue numerous times while developing complex recurrent neural networks and learned to systematically debug such situations.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation relies on a dynamically constructed computational graph.  Each tensor operation adds a node to this graph.  The `requires_grad` attribute of a tensor dictates whether it participates in gradient calculation.  By default, tensors created directly have `requires_grad=False`. This means operations involving these tensors won't contribute to the gradient calculation for other tensors with `requires_grad=True`.

A common error arises when parameters of a model are initialized with `requires_grad=False`, either explicitly or implicitly through operations that detach them from the computational graph. Functions like `torch.detach()` or `.data` access explicitly prevent gradient tracking.  Furthermore, certain operations, particularly those involving NumPy arrays or direct tensor manipulation outside of PyTorch's autograd functionality, can break the gradient flow.

Another crucial aspect is ensuring that the loss function used is appropriately connected to the model's parameters.  A flaw in the loss calculation or its connection to the optimizer, such as using the wrong tensors, can also prevent gradient updates.  The optimizer needs a correctly calculated gradient to perform parameter updates. Finally, using control flow operations within the model's forward pass without careful consideration of how autograd handles such situations can disrupt gradient calculations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `requires_grad` setting:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Incorrectly set requires_grad=False during parameter initialization
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
model.weight.requires_grad = False  # This prevents gradient calculation for weights

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_tensor)
loss = torch.nn.MSELoss()(output, torch.randn(1)) #Example loss calculation

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()

#Attempting to update the weights will fail because gradients are not computed.
optimizer.step()

# Check gradients:  You will observe that model.weight.grad is None.
print(model.weight.grad) 
```

This example demonstrates how setting `requires_grad=False` explicitly prevents gradient calculation.  To rectify this, the line `model.weight.requires_grad = False` should be removed or changed to `model.weight.requires_grad = True`.


**Example 2:  Detaching from the computational graph:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10,1)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,10)

# Detaching the tensor disconnects it from the computational graph
detached_output = model(input_tensor).detach()
loss = torch.nn.MSELoss()(detached_output, torch.randn(1))

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()

# Gradients will be None for model parameters
print(model.weight.grad)
```

Here, `model(input_tensor).detach()` creates a new tensor that's disconnected from the computational graph.  The loss calculation now operates on a detached tensor, thus preventing gradients from flowing back to the model's parameters. To resolve this, remove `.detach()`.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Loss Function Usage:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1)

output = model(input_tensor)

#Incorrect Loss Function application, gradients might be calculated but wrong.
loss = torch.nn.MSELoss()(output.data, target) #incorrect, operating on detached data.

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
print(model.weight.grad)
```

This example highlights a subtle mistake: Using `output.data` within the loss function detaches the output from the computational graph, leading to incorrect gradient calculations.  This is similar to the previous example. Removing `.data` will fix this issue, allowing proper gradient calculation and backpropagation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend carefully reviewing the PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation and the `requires_grad` attribute.  Thoroughly examining the official tutorials on building and training neural networks will provide valuable insight into the intricacies of computational graph construction and gradient calculations.  Additionally, understanding the inner workings of various optimizers and their interaction with the autograd system is essential.  The PyTorch source code itself can be a valuable resource for more in-depth understanding.  Finally, debugging tools and techniques within PyTorch, such as examining gradients directly, are crucial for isolating the source of gradient calculation problems.
