TensorFlow's `DNNRegressor` object, during its `.fit()` method execution, does not inherently provide a direct, readily accessible stream of loss values computed at each training step. The loss is internally tracked for optimization, but capturing this requires explicit configuration of the training process. Instead of directly fetching values, we modify the training workflow using TensorFlow's callback system and TensorBoard summaries to access these metrics.

By default, the `DNNRegressor` streamlines model training, handling the loss computation and backpropagation behind the scenes. We lack direct visibility of the interim loss. To retrieve these values, I've frequently employed a callback mechanism. This allows us to hook into the training loop, extracting the loss value during each batch processing. We also need to ensure that the loss is actually evaluated to be able to monitor it.

One approach involves defining a custom callback class that extends the `tf.keras.callbacks.Callback` base class. The base callback class provides a suite of methods that are triggered at various points in the training lifecycle, such as at the beginning of training epochs (`on_epoch_begin`) or at the end of training batches (`on_batch_end`). Specifically, I find `on_batch_end` effective for capturing loss values associated with every gradient update. By overriding this method, I can access the batch loss. However, since the loss function does not need to be computed before the optimizer performs an update, we need to ensure that loss is evaluated at the end of batch. We also need to ensure that batch is actually a part of training and not validation.

Here’s a code example demonstrating how I have implemented this in practice:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class LossCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, training_logs):
        super().__init__()
        self.training_logs = training_logs

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
       # Check if the logs are defined for the batch.
       if logs:
           if 'loss' in logs:
                self.training_logs.append(logs['loss'])

# Create dummy data.
train_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(2000, 5))
train_target = np.random.rand(2000, 1)

# Define feature columns.
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key=str(i)) for i in range(5)]

# Instantiate a DNNRegressor.
estimator = tf.estimator.DNNRegressor(
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    hidden_units=[64, 32],
    model_dir='./tmp_model_dir',
    optimizer='Adam'
)

# Create an input function.
def input_fn(df, targets, batch_size=32, num_epochs=None, shuffle=True):
    return tf.compat.v1.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(df), targets)).batch(batch_size).repeat(num_epochs).shuffle(buffer_size=100)

# Initialize an empty list to store loss values.
training_loss_values = []

# Instantiate custom callback
loss_callback = LossCallback(training_loss_values)


# Train the model with the custom callback.
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(train_data, train_target), steps=500, hooks=[])

# Print first 5 loss values
print(f"First five training loss values: {training_loss_values[:5]}")

# Delete temporary directory.
import shutil
shutil.rmtree('./tmp_model_dir')
```

In this implementation, `LossCallback` initializes with an empty list called `training_logs`. During the execution of each batch, the `on_batch_end` method extracts the 'loss' from the batch `logs` argument and appends it to the `training_logs` list. This effectively stores the loss values throughout training. It is then printed to the console.

An alternative to using custom callbacks directly is to make use of TensorBoard. TensorBoard offers interactive plots of metrics, graphs, and other aspects of model training, including the loss. While this does not provide the loss values as a direct array, it allows real-time monitoring of the loss trend during training through its UI. This approach provides the benefits of a more visual representation.

Here's how I typically configure TensorBoard logging during training:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create dummy data.
train_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(2000, 5))
train_target = np.random.rand(2000, 1)

# Define feature columns.
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key=str(i)) for i in range(5)]

# Instantiate a DNNRegressor.
estimator = tf.estimator.DNNRegressor(
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    hidden_units=[64, 32],
    model_dir='./tmp_model_dir',
    optimizer='Adam'
)

# Create an input function.
def input_fn(df, targets, batch_size=32, num_epochs=None, shuffle=True):
    return tf.compat.v1.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(df), targets)).batch(batch_size).repeat(num_epochs).shuffle(buffer_size=100)

# Instantiate logging hook
logging_hook = tf.estimator.LoggingTensorHook(
    tensors = {'loss' : 'loss'},
    every_n_iter = 100
    )

# Train the model with logging hook
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(train_data, train_target), steps=500, hooks=[logging_hook])

# Launch TensorBoard to view summaries.
# (Launch Tensorboard from the directory indicated in 'model_dir', for example './tmp_model_dir')

# Delete temporary directory
import shutil
shutil.rmtree('./tmp_model_dir')
```

In this snippet, `tf.estimator.LoggingTensorHook` logs the `loss` value every 100 steps. The tensor corresponding to the loss, indicated by the string `'loss'` is what is collected. After execution, launch TensorBoard using command line, pointing it to the specified `model_dir`. We can then see the plots of the `loss` values. This approach lets us avoid custom callbacks, but does not provide direct numerical loss values in the training script. The `every_n_iter` parameter can be adjusted depending on how often loss values need to be logged. It also does not track every training step loss but rather steps that are multiples of `every_n_iter`.

A final method, which I have found useful for debugging, is to manually define the training process by creating an underlying Keras model, then performing the gradient updates and loss evaluations manually. While more involved, this provides full control over each step. Here is an example that implements such a setup.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import math

# Create dummy data
train_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(2000, 5))
train_target = np.random.rand(2000, 1)

# Define input features
feature_columns = [tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,), name=str(i)) for i in range(5)]
feature_layers = tf.keras.layers.concatenate(feature_columns)
dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(feature_layers)
dense_2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(dense_1)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=None)(dense_2)

#Create underlying Keras model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=feature_columns, outputs=output_layer)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

#Create input function
def input_fn(df, targets, batch_size=32):
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(df), targets)).batch(batch_size).repeat(1).shuffle(buffer_size=100)


# Training loop.
num_epochs = 5
batch_size = 32
training_loss_values = []
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_inputs, batch_targets in input_fn(train_data, train_target, batch_size):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          batch_predictions = model(batch_inputs)
          batch_loss = loss_fn(batch_targets, batch_predictions)
          grads = tape.gradient(batch_loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
        training_loss_values.append(batch_loss.numpy())

# Print first five loss values
print(f"First five training loss values: {training_loss_values[:5]}")
```

This snippet constructs a Keras model equivalent to what `DNNRegressor` produces internally. The training loop iterates through the dataset, and in each batch, it calculates the loss, computes the gradients, and updates the weights using the gradient tape and optimizer. All `batch_loss` values are stored in a list, that is then printed out. This approach gives us finer control over the training process. Since all operations are conducted within the gradient tape, we can easily evaluate `batch_loss` before gradient updates.

For expanding your knowledge on callbacks, consult TensorFlow’s official documentation and API reference. Further information can be found in online resources which focus on detailed explanations of callback creation and applications. For a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and training processes, I recommend reading through TensorFlow’s core code for `tf.estimator` and `tf.keras`. Exploring these resources helps in understanding why the loss values are not readily available and why it is important to log them using either callbacks or through TensorBoard.
