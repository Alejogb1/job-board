Directly addressing the question of training ONNX models in C++, the core issue lies not in ONNX itself, but in the availability of suitable C++ frameworks capable of performing the gradient descent and backpropagation necessary for training.  ONNX excels at *inference*—running pre-trained models—in various environments.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involved extensive experimentation with ONNX, particularly for deployment in embedded systems.  While ONNX provides a standardized intermediate representation, the training process intrinsically depends on the underlying deep learning framework's automatic differentiation capabilities.  Thus, training an ONNX model directly in C++ requires a different approach than leveraging the established Python ecosystems of TensorFlow and PyTorch.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The standard workflow involves training a model in a high-level framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, exporting it to the ONNX format, and then deploying it for inference using an ONNX runtime in C++.  The training step, however, remains firmly within the Python environment. This is primarily due to the significant complexity involved in building a robust automatic differentiation engine from scratch in C++. While C++ provides performance advantages for inference, the ease of use and comprehensive features offered by Python's automatic differentiation libraries in TensorFlow and PyTorch are unparalleled.  The ecosystem surrounding these frameworks provides essential tools for managing gradients, optimizing the training process, and handling complex model architectures efficiently, something not readily available in a comparable C++ environment.

Attempts to directly train in C++ often involve using lower-level libraries that require manual implementation of backpropagation and gradient calculation, a process prone to errors and requiring extensive mathematical and programming expertise.  This manual implementation also significantly increases development time and complexity, negating many of the advantages of C++ in terms of performance for this particular stage. While specialized libraries might provide some assistance, the overhead in comparison to established Python frameworks remains substantial.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the standard workflow, focusing on the distinction between training (Python) and inference (C++).

**Example 1: TensorFlow Training and ONNX Export**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... define your model ...
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... layers ...
])

# ... compile and train your model ...
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Export to ONNX
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'saved_model')
# Convert saved model to ONNX using the onnx-tf converter
# ... (converter specific code here) ...
```

This Python code demonstrates a typical TensorFlow training process followed by exporting the trained model.  The crucial step is using the `tf.saved_model` and subsequently a converter to transform it into ONNX format. The ellipses (...) represent the model definition, training configuration, and ONNX conversion code, which would vary depending on model specifics and chosen converter.


**Example 2: PyTorch Training and ONNX Export**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
# ... define your model ...
model = nn.Sequential(
    # ... layers ...
)

# ... define loss function and optimizer ...
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# ... training loop ...
for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training iteration logic ...
    optimizer.step()

# Export to ONNX
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224) #Example Input
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", export_params=True)
```

This PyTorch equivalent showcases training using a custom loss function and optimizer, followed by exporting to ONNX using the `torch.onnx.export` function. Similar to the TensorFlow example, detailed model architecture and training specifics are omitted for brevity.  The `dummy_input` is crucial for the export process; it defines the input shape expected by the ONNX model.


**Example 3: C++ Inference using ONNX Runtime**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "onnxruntime_cxx_api.h"

int main() {
  Ort::Env env;
  Ort::SessionOptions session_options;
  Ort::Session session(env, "model.onnx", session_options);

  // ... prepare input data ...
  // ... create ort::Value input tensor ...

  // ... run inference ...
  Ort::RunOptions run_options;
  std::vector<Ort::Value> output_tensors = session.Run(run_options, input_tensors);

  // ... process output data ...

  return 0;
}
```

This C++ code snippet utilizes the ONNX Runtime C++ API to load the ONNX model ("model.onnx") and perform inference.  It highlights the basic structure for loading the model, preparing input data, running inference, and processing the output.  Importantly, this code does *not* involve training; it only performs inference on the pre-trained model exported from Python.  The ellipses (...) indicate the necessary code for input data preparation and output data processing, which will be model-specific.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of ONNX, consult the official ONNX documentation.  For TensorFlow and PyTorch specifics, refer to their respective official documentation. For a more thorough understanding of C++ and its deep learning libraries, investigate resources specializing in those areas.  Familiarization with linear algebra and calculus is fundamental for comprehending the underlying principles of deep learning.  Thorough knowledge of automatic differentiation concepts will prove invaluable.  Finally, exploring advanced C++ techniques for optimizing performance will be vital for leveraging the language's full potential for inference applications.
