The consistent prediction of 'True' by a PyTorch VGG16 model after training often points to a fundamental flaw in the model's training process, specifically a convergence towards a single class irrespective of the input data. This issue, while seemingly straightforward, usually stems from subtle errors in implementation, rather than an inherent problem with the VGG16 architecture itself. The scenario suggests the network has learned to output a specific class probability, overriding any input signal variation.

Several interlinked causes contribute to this behavior. One primary driver is a disproportionate training dataset. If a vast majority of your training data represents a single class (in a binary context where 'True' is one class), the network will learn to favor that class as it minimizes loss by predicting the majority output. This is exacerbated if the loss function is not well-matched to imbalanced data, such as standard binary cross-entropy. It doesn't penalize wrong classifications on the minority class enough relative to those on the majority. The loss, which acts as a signal guiding the learning, isn’t forcing the network to learn discriminatory features.

Secondly, training data errors, while common, have a profound impact on model convergence. Incorrect labels effectively mislead the model into learning incorrect mappings between features and classes. A dataset where most or all training examples are mislabeled as 'True' would predictably train the model to always output 'True'. Data quality directly impacts model quality.

Another significant factor is insufficient model training time and inappropriate learning parameters. If training stops too early, the model might not have the opportunity to learn differentiating features, resulting in a bias towards the initial weights or a class bias. Alternatively, learning rates set too high can cause weight oscillation and prevent the model from settling to a good solution and, consequently, to effectively discriminate between the classes. Likewise, if the learning rate is set too low, the training may plateau before the model converges to a discriminative solution. A poorly chosen optimizer, such as one with inappropriate momentum, can also hamper convergence.

Finally, and subtly, an inappropriate pre-processing pipeline, particularly one that normalizes data poorly, or ignores critical features of the data, will hinder learning. Data manipulation needs to preserve the essential discriminatory information for the classes. A failure to perform sufficient data augmentation also will result in a model that is not robust. This implies that when exposed to novel, unseen data, the model's prediction will likely be the class it was exposed to most often.

Based on my past experiences debugging similar issues, I've found that focusing on these specific aspects of the code is critical: dataset balance, data quality checks, hyperparameter configurations, and data processing.

Here are three common scenarios and code snippets illustrating how these issues can lead to consistently "True" predictions.

**Example 1: Imbalanced Dataset and Basic Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**

The following code represents a scenario where the data is heavily skewed towards one class. The loss function is also applied in its basic form, which is not designed for such scenarios.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import models
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np

# Simulate imbalanced data
num_true_samples = 1000
num_false_samples = 10
true_data = torch.randn(num_true_samples, 3, 224, 224)
true_labels = torch.ones(num_true_samples, dtype=torch.float) # 'True' represented as 1
false_data = torch.randn(num_false_samples, 3, 224, 224)
false_labels = torch.zeros(num_false_samples, dtype=torch.float) # 'False' represented as 0

all_data = torch.cat((true_data, false_data), dim=0)
all_labels = torch.cat((true_labels, false_labels), dim=0)
dataset = TensorDataset(all_data, all_labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

# Initialize VGG16 model
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 1) # Modify final layer
model.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

criterion = nn.BCELoss() # Standard Binary Cross Entropy Loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(10):
    for data, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data).view(-1)
        outputs = model.sigmoid(outputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Testing (using the first batch of inputs)
test_data, _ = next(iter(dataloader))
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model.sigmoid(model(test_data).view(-1))
    print(predictions)
    print(torch.round(predictions))
```

In this example, the VGG16 model will consistently predict 1 (True), because the dataset is dominated by class ‘1’. The standard binary cross entropy loss does not adequately weigh the fewer errors on class ‘0’, causing the model to favor the majority class predictions.

**Example 2: Incorrect Labeling**

This case simulates the effect of incorrectly labeled data. Here, all data, regardless of content, is labeled as ‘True’.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import models
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Simulate 1000 examples all labeled as 'True'
data = torch.randn(1000, 3, 224, 224)
labels = torch.ones(1000, dtype=torch.float) # all labels are 1 (True)

dataset = TensorDataset(data, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 1) # Modify final layer
model.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(10):
    for data, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data).view(-1)
        outputs = model.sigmoid(outputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Testing
test_data, _ = next(iter(dataloader))
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model.sigmoid(model(test_data).view(-1))
    print(predictions)
    print(torch.round(predictions))
```
Due to the fact that all training examples were assigned the label `True`, the model has no incentive to learn the representation for other labels. During evaluation, the model output predictions will thus be biased toward the majority class, in this case the True label.

**Example 3: Insufficient Training Iterations**
This example demonstrates that stopping training before the model has converged can result in predictions biased to one class.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import models
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
# Generate balanced data
num_samples = 500
true_data = torch.randn(num_samples, 3, 224, 224)
true_labels = torch.ones(num_samples, dtype=torch.float) # 'True' as 1
false_data = torch.randn(num_samples, 3, 224, 224)
false_labels = torch.zeros(num_samples, dtype=torch.float) # 'False' as 0

all_data = torch.cat((true_data, false_data), dim=0)
all_labels = torch.cat((true_labels, false_labels), dim=0)
dataset = TensorDataset(all_data, all_labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 1) # Modify final layer
model.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(1): # Trained for only 1 epoch. Insufficient training
    for data, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data).view(-1)
        outputs = model.sigmoid(outputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Testing
test_data, _ = next(iter(dataloader))
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model.sigmoid(model(test_data).view(-1))
    print(predictions)
    print(torch.round(predictions))
```
In this last scenario, only a single epoch was used to train the model. Given the insufficient exposure to the data, the model will output largely the same values across various inputs, in this case tending to 1. This is because it did not learn to discriminate features between the classes.

To rectify these scenarios, you can start by analyzing your data to confirm an adequate representation of each class. Implement a stratified sampling to guarantee a representative set of data for each class. Further, conduct a thorough review of the labels within the dataset to verify their correctness. Adjust loss functions to those more suited for imbalanced datasets, such as focal loss or class-weighted cross-entropy. Finally, systematically tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) and ensure the model has ample training epochs. I’d recommend exploring a grid search or random search to fine-tune those parameters.

For further reading, consider exploring books on deep learning that address the issues of imbalanced datasets and training procedures. Publications on best practices in data pre-processing and augmentation techniques will also prove invaluable. Additionally, papers on the nuances of loss functions in the context of deep learning can offer a deeper theoretical understanding.
