Disabling batch normalization during training is rarely beneficial and often detrimental to model performance, especially in deep networks.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects, specifically within the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has consistently demonstrated that batch normalization (BN) plays a crucial role in stabilizing training and improving generalization. While there are niche exceptions, outright disabling it is generally a suboptimal approach.

**1.  A Clear Explanation of Batch Normalization and its Impact:**

Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations of a layer during training.  This normalization involves subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation.  The normalized activations are then scaled and shifted using learned parameters, γ and β, respectively. This process addresses the internal covariate shift problem, a phenomenon where the distribution of activations changes throughout the training process, hindering efficient learning.  By normalizing activations, BN stabilizes training, allowing for the use of higher learning rates and preventing vanishing/exploding gradients.  Furthermore, it acts as a form of regularization, leading to improved generalization performance and reducing the need for extensive dropout or weight decay.

The benefits stem from several key mechanisms:

* **Faster Convergence:** Normalized activations accelerate gradient descent by preventing the network from getting stuck in poor local minima.  This is particularly relevant in deep networks where gradients can become very small or very large, significantly slowing down training.

* **Improved Generalization:**  By reducing the sensitivity of the network to the specific characteristics of a mini-batch, BN aids in learning more robust features that generalize better to unseen data. This effect has been extensively observed and documented in the literature.

* **Regularization Effect:** The normalization process implicitly regularizes the model, reducing overfitting.  This is because the network is less sensitive to minor fluctuations in the input data due to the normalization.


**Exceptions where disabling might be considered (rarely warranted):**

* **Very small batch sizes:**  In extremely small batches, the batch statistics are not reliable representations of the entire dataset's distribution. This can lead to unstable training and potentially benefit from disabling BN. However, it's often more beneficial to increase the batch size if feasible.

* **Specific architectures or datasets:**  In certain architectures or datasets, BN might interfere with optimization, leading to unexpected behavior. However, these scenarios are often problem-specific and require careful analysis rather than a blanket disabling of BN.  I've encountered such cases in highly specialized generative models, but even then, alternative normalization techniques were preferred over complete removal.

* **Debugging:**  During debugging, temporarily disabling BN might help in isolating issues within the network architecture or training process. This is a temporary measure for diagnostic purposes, not a permanent solution.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Standard Batch Normalization in TensorFlow/Keras:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example showcases a simple CNN with a BatchNormalization layer inserted after the convolutional layer.  The `BatchNormalization` layer automatically handles the normalization process during both training and inference.  This is the standard and generally recommended approach.


**Example 2: Disabling Batch Normalization (Not Recommended):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    # BatchNormalization layer removed
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates the removal of the `BatchNormalization` layer.  In my experience, this consistently led to slower convergence, poorer generalization, and increased sensitivity to learning rate hyperparameter tuning across multiple projects.  It should only be considered in the extremely rare and well-justified exceptions mentioned earlier.


**Example 3:  Layer Normalization as an Alternative:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

If there are compelling reasons to avoid batch normalization, layer normalization is a viable alternative. Layer normalization normalizes the activations across the features within a single sample, rather than across a batch. This can be beneficial in specific situations, although it's not a direct replacement and its performance might vary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of batch normalization and its intricacies, I recommend exploring comprehensive deep learning textbooks such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al. and research papers on the original batch normalization algorithm and subsequent improvements and alternatives.  Furthermore, consulting the documentation for popular deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) on the implementation details of batch normalization will prove beneficial.  Reviewing relevant sections in advanced machine learning textbooks will provide a thorough grounding in the underlying theoretical concepts.  Finally, analyzing published research comparing BN to alternative normalization techniques will offer valuable insight into the nuances of different approaches.
