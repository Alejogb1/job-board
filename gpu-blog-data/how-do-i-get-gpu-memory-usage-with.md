Accessing GPU memory usage within OpenCL requires a multi-faceted approach, as the standard API does not directly expose granular, real-time consumption metrics in the way system memory allocation often does. Instead, we leverage OpenCL's infrastructure for device queries alongside platform-specific extensions. I've found that a robust solution involves querying device information, tracking buffer allocations, and, when necessary, incorporating vendor-specific performance analysis tools.

The first element is querying the `CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE` property via `clGetDeviceInfo`. This provides the total, available global memory on the device; it's a static value representing the maximum allocatable memory, not the current usage. However, it's an important reference point. I’ve learned in projects with substantial OpenCL workloads that understanding the device's absolute capacity, before even considering current utilization, prevents out-of-memory errors.

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>

void getDeviceMemoryInfo(cl_device_id device) {
  cl_ulong globalMemorySize;
  cl_int err;

  err = clGetDeviceInfo(device, CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE, sizeof(cl_ulong), &globalMemorySize, nullptr);
  if (err != CL_SUCCESS) {
      std::cerr << "Error getting device global memory size: " << err << std::endl;
      return;
  }

  std::cout << "Total Global Memory (bytes): " << globalMemorySize << std::endl;
}

// Example usage:
// cl_platform_id platform; //Assume platform and device have been previously selected via clGetPlatformIDs and clGetDeviceIDs
// cl_device_id device;
// getDeviceMemoryInfo(device);
```
This snippet retrieves and prints the total global memory in bytes. The `clGetDeviceInfo` function is fundamental for querying a device’s properties; the first parameter is the device identifier, the second is the property being queried, the third is the size of the value being stored, the fourth is the pointer to where the value will be placed, and the final parameter would hold the actual size if the requested property is a string or an array. Error handling is critical; failing to check the return value from OpenCL API calls can lead to undefined behavior.

Calculating *used* memory requires more effort since OpenCL doesn't provide a direct "used memory" counter. My general approach is to track buffer allocations within my application. I’ve found that maintaining a map or list of allocated buffer sizes can provide a reasonable approximation. The logic involves capturing the allocation size at the moment of `clCreateBuffer`, adding it to a running tally, and subtracting it upon buffer release via `clReleaseMemObject`. This approach assumes exclusive management of buffer lifetimes; relying on other libraries to release your objects without your knowledge will result in inaccurate tracking.

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

std::map<cl_mem, size_t> allocatedMemory;

cl_mem createTrackedBuffer(cl_context context, cl_mem_flags flags, size_t size, void* host_ptr, cl_int* errcode_ret) {
  cl_mem buffer = clCreateBuffer(context, flags, size, host_ptr, errcode_ret);
  if (*errcode_ret == CL_SUCCESS) {
      allocatedMemory[buffer] = size;
      std::cout << "Buffer allocated: size = " << size << " , total memory = " << getTotalAllocatedMemory() << std::endl;
  }
  return buffer;
}

void releaseTrackedBuffer(cl_mem buffer) {
  auto it = allocatedMemory.find(buffer);
  if (it != allocatedMemory.end()) {
      std::cout << "Buffer released: size = " << it->second << " , total memory = " << getTotalAllocatedMemory() - it->second << std::endl;
      allocatedMemory.erase(it);
      clReleaseMemObject(buffer);
  } else {
      std::cerr << "Error: Attempted to release untracked buffer." << std::endl;
  }
}

size_t getTotalAllocatedMemory() {
  size_t total = 0;
  for (const auto& pair : allocatedMemory) {
      total += pair.second;
  }
  return total;
}

// Example usage:
// cl_context context; // Assume context has been created previously.
// cl_int err;
// cl_mem myBuffer = createTrackedBuffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_WRITE, 1024, nullptr, &err);
// ...
// releaseTrackedBuffer(myBuffer);

```

This example illustrates the core tracking mechanism. The `createTrackedBuffer` function serves as a wrapper around `clCreateBuffer`, recording allocated sizes. `releaseTrackedBuffer` removes the memory usage from the tracker. The global `allocatedMemory` map stores memory objects as keys and size of allocations as values. `getTotalAllocatedMemory` calculates the aggregate used memory. Note that this method only provides information about the allocations *created and tracked* through this mechanism.  Memory allocated outside of this wrapper is not accounted for, and might include the overhead associated with the context itself, and other OpenCL objects. For large-scale applications, I often implement a more sophisticated memory management system that can handle different buffer allocation policies, memory pools, and data transfer patterns.

Thirdly, in scenarios requiring precise, low-level performance data, I often explore vendor-specific extensions. These typically provide more detailed insights, including the amount of device memory allocated in various memory regions, memory access patterns, and bandwidth utilization. For NVIDIA GPUs, for instance, the Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute tools offer very detailed profiling of GPU usage with OpenCL applications. Similarly, AMD's Radeon GPU Profiler (RGP) provides analogous capabilities. Though these are external applications, they connect directly to the OpenCL API, offering much richer diagnostic information than what is exposed directly through the core API.  Their use requires understanding of the tools' individual workflows, which often means more time learning the tools alongside OpenCL.  I frequently use those tools to validate the assumptions made by my own tracking mechanisms and find that they are invaluable in performance optimization.

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>

void getDeviceExtensionInfo(cl_device_id device) {
  size_t ext_size;
  cl_int err = clGetDeviceInfo(device, CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS, 0, nullptr, &ext_size);
  if (err != CL_SUCCESS) {
      std::cerr << "Error getting device extensions size: " << err << std::endl;
      return;
  }

  char *extensions = new char[ext_size];
  err = clGetDeviceInfo(device, CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS, ext_size, extensions, nullptr);
  if (err != CL_SUCCESS) {
     std::cerr << "Error getting device extensions: " << err << std::endl;
     delete[] extensions;
     return;
  }

  std::cout << "Supported Device Extensions: " << extensions << std::endl;
  delete[] extensions;
}


// Example usage:
// cl_platform_id platform; //Assume platform and device have been previously selected via clGetPlatformIDs and clGetDeviceIDs
// cl_device_id device;
// getDeviceExtensionInfo(device);
```
This code prints the list of supported OpenCL extensions, which may point towards vendor-specific memory management information.  The presence of extensions such as "cl_khr_gl_sharing" or other specific vendor extensions can indicate support for more detailed profiling options.

In summary, directly getting "used" GPU memory with OpenCL is not straightforward, due to the API's design. Instead, a combination of querying for total memory, tracking buffer allocations in the application itself, and leveraging vendor-specific performance analysis tools is needed for a full picture. For further study, I would recommend reviewing the Khronos OpenCL Specification for detailed API documentation, along with vendor documentation for specific profiling tools, and any documentation from your OS on memory reporting specific to your devices and driver.
