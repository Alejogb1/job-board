Tensor objects in TensorFlow, particularly those created through the eager execution framework, typically do not possess an `is_initialized` attribute directly accessible in the manner one might expect from older, graph-based approaches. This is primarily because eager tensors are fundamentally different; they represent concrete, immediately evaluated values, rather than symbolic placeholders within a computation graph. The concept of "initialization" as it was used in graph execution—where nodes needed to be explicitly evaluated to yield a value—is largely absent in the eager paradigm. My experience migrating several large models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x exposed this shift acutely.

In TensorFlow 1.x, when utilizing a computation graph, variables were created as symbolic representations. These variables existed in an uninitialized state until an explicit initialization operation (typically involving `tf.global_variables_initializer()`) was executed within a session. The `is_initialized` attribute, when present, provided a mechanism to check this state. In that context, it was a crucial mechanism to prevent using a variable that was not assigned a value or an initial distribution.

However, TensorFlow 2.x’s eager execution promotes immediate, imperative evaluation. When you create a tensor or variable, its value is immediately known. There is no concept of deferred evaluation. For instance, if you create a tensor using `tf.constant([1,2,3])`, the underlying data is stored and available without any additional step. Similarly, `tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3,3]))` creates a variable that is immediately set to the tensor of zeros; there's no intermediate uninitialized state from a user perspective. The initialization happens within the object’s construction.

The change stems from a fundamental shift in computational paradigm. Graph execution was a "define-then-run" approach where you built a computational graph (define) and then executed it in a session (run). Eager execution is an “evaluate immediately” approach. Each operation is immediately executed, so the need to check whether operations have been run is diminished. `is_initialized` is therefore rendered obsolete in most use cases in eager mode. The initialization status is inherently reflected in the tensor's immediately available data and structure.

There might, however, be exceptions where an initialization check is useful when dealing with resource management or non-deterministic initialization (although it's generally good practice to ensure all variables are initialized when they are declared). However, in this case the appropriate strategy is usually to check whether variable values are set to a particular initial value or some other external condition.

The absence of an `is_initialized` attribute on eager tensors leads to certain code refactoring requirements when migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x. We need to adjust the way in which we manage variables and ensure all values are assigned before usage. While direct attribute access to an `is_initialized` flag is no longer the appropriate approach to variable management, I have found that the benefits of the simplified execution and debugging in the eager paradigm far outweigh this minor complication.

Let’s look at some illustrative code examples.

**Example 1: Demonstrating the Difference in Variable Creation and "Initialization"**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x (Graph execution) - Conceptual
# Assuming a placeholder and variable creation in a function (This cannot be directly run in TF2)
# with tf.Graph().as_default():
#     x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(None, 2))
#     W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(2,3)))
#     init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
#
# with tf.Session() as sess:
#     print(W.is_initialized) # This would be False, before init
#     sess.run(init)
#     print(W.is_initialized) # This would be True, after init
#
#  -------------------- Equivalent TensorFlow 2.x approach --------------------

# In TF2.x (Eager execution)
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(2,3)))
print(type(W)) # Output: <class 'tensorflow.python.ops.resource_variable_ops.ResourceVariable'>
# Note there is no 'is_initialized' attribute.
# print(W.is_initialized) #This will cause an AttributeError
print(W.numpy()) # Accessing the underlying value directly; there was no intermediate "uninitialized" state
```
**Commentary:** In the conceptual TensorFlow 1.x code (that cannot directly run in TF2.x) I tried to show how the explicit initialization process using `tf.global_variables_initializer()` and the `is_initialized` check would work. The equivalent TensorFlow 2.x version directly creates a resource variable and its value can be retrieved using the `.numpy()` method immediately after its creation. It is a class variable with no `is_initialized` attribute.

**Example 2: Addressing variable initialization with custom checks**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# In TF 2.x, if you want to mimic initialization checking
# (for an unusual or non-standard use case) you have to implement logic
# or check the data type.
def is_variable_initialized_custom(var):
  """
  Custom function to check if a variable has been initialized with a value
  Returns True if the variable's value is not None, otherwise False
  """
  try:
      return var.numpy() is not None
  except:
      return False


W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([2,2]))

print(is_variable_initialized_custom(W)) # This will print True, since W has been set to all zeros.

V = tf.Variable(None)
print(is_variable_initialized_custom(V)) # This will print False as V has no initial tensor data

V.assign(tf.ones([2,2])) # We've set a value.
print(is_variable_initialized_custom(V)) # This will now print True.
```
**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how to address a situation where one *really* needs an initialization check. This approach directly inspects the tensor data to determine if it exists. You will notice that a check such as `if V is not None:` will fail as a TensorFlow variable will never be `None`. A special check is therefore needed to see if the data has been set, and a try-except block is also added to ensure the function does not fail when used on non-Tensor variables. Custom checks like this are necessary if you are trying to maintain an explicit initialization check, but in general are not the right pattern to use. Usually, you should ensure that variables are assigned a value when they are created and then there is no need to check later.

**Example 3: Initializing Variables from External Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate loading data from an external source
external_data = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])

# Define a variable with a potentially different shape/data type initially
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3,3], dtype=tf.float32)) # This gives it a concrete initial value

# Assign the value from external data with a tf.Variable.assign method
W.assign(tf.convert_to_tensor(external_data, dtype=tf.float32))

# Now the tensor will be assigned the external data
print(W.numpy()) # Prints the external_data as a Numpy array
```

**Commentary:** Here, I'm demonstrating a scenario where an initial variable is created with one shape, and then assigned a value based on external data. There is no "uninitialized state", instead the initial data has simply been replaced by a new tensor assignment. Here you can see that the variable is initialized with a tensor of zeros, but immediately changes to hold the `external_data` when we use the `assign` method. Again, no `is_initialized` method is needed in this case.

For additional guidance and deeper understanding of TensorFlow 2.x best practices and variable management, I would suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections related to eager execution, variables, and tensor creation. Also, exploring practical examples in the TensorFlow tutorials will be beneficial. Finally, examining examples of real world TensorFlow models available in the TensorFlow Hub or GitHub repositories is helpful for seeing how they've managed variable creation and data loading.
