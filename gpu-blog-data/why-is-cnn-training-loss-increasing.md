A convolutional neural network (CNN) exhibiting increasing training loss is a clear indicator of problems within the training process itself, and typically not an inherent limitation of the model architecture. From my experience optimizing numerous image classification and object detection models, this issue often stems from a combination of factors related to data handling, network configuration, and the optimization algorithm. It’s critical to address these methodically, ruling out each potential culprit rather than attempting broad, unfocused changes.

The first, and often overlooked, potential cause for increasing training loss is problematic training data. This encompasses both errors in labeling and inadequate preprocessing. Incorrect labels essentially teach the model to associate features with the wrong class, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the underlying distribution. Further, inconsistent preprocessing steps applied between training and validation sets can create a training environment that the model simply cannot generalize beyond. It also becomes important to check for extreme outliers, such as corrupted images or very low/very high frequency content images which may skew the model’s focus. In one particular project involving medical image analysis, I discovered a subset of incorrectly segmented images, where the target object was either partially obscured or not present at all; this led to the model learning noise rather than true structural relationships and the training loss actually rose before I manually removed the corrupted examples.

Secondly, improper network configuration and initialization can lead to convergence issues. CNNs, particularly deep ones, rely on a balanced propagation of gradients during backpropagation. If the initial weights are too large or too small, the gradient values may explode or vanish, making it extremely difficult for the network to learn meaningful features. The specific layers used and their ordering also have a significant impact. Improper use of pooling or convolution operations could result in information loss, while having too few neurons within a given layer could limit the model’s capacity to represent complex relationships present in the training data. I encountered a situation where using ReLU activation functions without proper batch normalization led to a diminishing gradient; the subsequent updates became virtually zero, hindering further learning progress and loss started to go up because of no actual learning.

Thirdly, the optimization algorithm and its hyperparameters play a crucial role in the learning process. An inappropriately high learning rate can cause oscillations around the minima, and prevent smooth convergence; the loss will fluctuate wildly and sometimes even increase over an epoch. Alternatively, a learning rate that is too low will cause the learning progress to be very slow. Using the wrong optimizer or improperly configured hyperparameters can result in slow, inefficient convergence, or, worse still, divergence, where the loss continuously increases. Momentum-based optimizers, like Adam or SGD with momentum, are particularly sensitive to this. The selection of the batch size can also indirectly impact the loss since very small batch size leads to noisy gradient updates. I once worked on a video classification system and found that the default Adam settings were simply not ideal. After experimenting with different learning rate schedules, specifically a learning rate decay, the model started to converge and the loss stabilized.

To illustrate these points further, consider the following code examples:

**Code Example 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing Issues**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume we have an image loading function that returns an image and label

def load_image(image_path, label):
    image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
    image = tf.image.resize(image, [256, 256])
    image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0
    return image, label

# Assume we have lists of image paths and corresponding labels
image_paths = ['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg', ...]  # placeholder
labels = [0, 1, 0, ...] # placeholder

# Dataset definition
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((image_paths, labels))
dataset = dataset.map(load_image)

# The error here might be that the validation data is not processed with the same steps
validation_image_paths = ['val1.jpg', 'val2.jpg' ...]
validation_labels = [1, 0, ...]
validation_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((validation_image_paths, validation_labels))
validation_dataset = validation_dataset.map(load_image)

# This is also an example for not pre-shuffling the dataset. 
dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
validation_dataset = validation_dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
```
*Commentary*: This example demonstrates a common issue. It uses a data loading function using `tf.data` and `tf.image` functions, which is correctly applied to the training dataset. However, if `validation_dataset` is processed using a different loading or preprocessing function or with a different seed for the random operations, the validation set will be drastically different from the training set, and this discrepancy could lead to increasing loss during training. Further, if the `dataset` is not shuffled before batching and prefetching it, the model might be fed only with samples from the same class in the initial epochs, and this will affect the convergence.

**Code Example 2: Network Initialization and Layer Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Incorrect initialization, also no regularization.
model = create_cnn_model(input_shape=(256, 256, 3), num_classes=10)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate = 0.001) # Incorrect optimizer choices.
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy() # Incorrect loss choices.
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])
```

*Commentary*: This example illustrates a network configuration that, while functional, may not be optimal. The initialization of the model weights is done by default, and this might lead to unstable initial learning phase. More importantly, the absence of batch normalization layers after the convolutional layers may lead to vanishing gradient problems. Similarly, the choice of the optimizer and the learning rate is also important for stable learning. This example highlights why it is important to review every detail of the model and the optimizer configuration. Note that regularization techniques like dropout are also not used in this case.

**Code Example 3: Optimizer and Hyperparameter Settings**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.BatchNormalization(),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
        layers.BatchNormalization(),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
        layers.BatchNormalization(),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Model with batch normalization.
model = create_cnn_model(input_shape=(256, 256, 3), num_classes=10)

# Incorrect hyperparameter setting of optimizer and batch size.
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate = 1.0)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])

BATCH_SIZE = 1
dataset_with_batch = dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# train with this dataset: dataset_with_batch
```

*Commentary*: This example shows a model that includes batch normalization to help stabilize the learning process. However, using a learning rate of 1.0 with Adam is extremely high and will cause the model parameters to move too quickly and oscillate around the actual local minima. Additionally, using batch size 1 will result in highly unstable training because the gradients estimated per batch will be very noisy. This code demonstrates the crucial point that even when the model architecture seems correct, the training process will still not work with badly configured optimizer hyperparameters.

In conclusion, addressing increasing training loss requires a systematic debugging approach, starting with careful examination of data, network architecture, and optimization parameters. I would recommend resources from the Tensorflow documentation, as well as general materials on deep learning principles and optimization techniques for further investigation. Good resources can also be found in books covering the design of convolutional neural networks. The key is to experiment with small changes to isolate the source of the problem.
