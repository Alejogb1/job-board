Boolean indexing in PyTorch, particularly across multiple dimensions, requires a nuanced understanding of broadcasting and the resulting tensor shapes.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training routines has highlighted the crucial role efficient boolean indexing plays in data filtering and selective operations.  Failure to correctly manage tensor dimensions during this process leads to subtle, hard-to-debug errors.  Therefore, accurate dimension alignment and the use of appropriate broadcasting rules are paramount.

**1. Explanation of Multi-Dimensional Boolean Indexing in PyTorch**

PyTorch tensors, unlike NumPy arrays, inherently support multi-dimensional boolean indexing. This means you can select elements based on conditions applied across multiple axes simultaneously.  The key lies in creating boolean masks that have the same number of dimensions as the target tensor. The dimensionality of the boolean mask dictates which elements are selected.  If a boolean mask has fewer dimensions than the target tensor, PyTorch applies broadcasting rules to expand the mask's dimensions. If the dimensions don't align according to broadcasting rules, a `RuntimeError` will be raised.

Let's clarify broadcasting.  PyTorch attempts to match the dimensions of the boolean mask to the dimensions of the target tensor. If a dimension in the mask is 1, it's expanded to match the corresponding dimension in the target tensor.  If dimensions are not compatible (e.g., a dimension of 3 in the mask and a dimension of 4 in the tensor), broadcasting fails.

When applying boolean indexing, PyTorch returns a view of the original tensor containing only the elements where the corresponding mask element is `True`.  Crucially, this is a *view*, not a copy. Modifying the indexed tensor modifies the original tensor as well.  To create a copy, you must explicitly use `.clone()`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple 2D Boolean Indexing**

This example demonstrates basic boolean indexing on a 2D tensor. We'll create a mask where elements greater than 5 are `True`.

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 6, 3], [8, 2, 9], [4, 7, 5]])
mask = tensor > 5
indexed_tensor = tensor[mask]
print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"Boolean Mask:\n{mask}")
print(f"Indexed Tensor:\n{indexed_tensor}")
```

This code first creates a boolean mask `mask` using the comparison operator `>`. The `mask` has the same shape as `tensor`.  Subsequently, `tensor[mask]` selects elements where the corresponding mask element is `True`, resulting in a 1D tensor containing only values greater than 5.


**Example 2: Multi-Dimensional Indexing with Broadcasting**

This example showcases broadcasting. The mask will be 1D, but it will be correctly applied across rows of the 2D tensor.

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 6, 3], [8, 2, 9], [4, 7, 5]])
row_mask = torch.tensor([True, False, True]) # Only select rows 0 and 2
indexed_tensor = tensor[row_mask]
print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"Row Mask:\n{row_mask}")
print(f"Indexed Tensor:\n{indexed_tensor}")
```

Here, `row_mask` is a 1D tensor.  PyTorch broadcasts this along the column dimension, effectively selecting entire rows based on the `True` values in `row_mask`.


**Example 3:  Complex Multi-Dimensional Indexing with Advanced Masking**

This example involves creating a multi-dimensional boolean mask.  This showcases a scenario reflecting the complexity often encountered during real-world data processing.

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.randint(0, 10, (3, 4, 2)) # 3x4x2 tensor
row_mask = torch.tensor([True, False, True])
col_mask = torch.tensor([True, False, True, False])
depth_mask = torch.tensor([True, False])

# Reshape the masks to match tensor dimensions through broadcasting
row_mask = row_mask.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(2).expand(3,4,2)
col_mask = col_mask.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(2).expand(3,4,2)
depth_mask = depth_mask.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(1).expand(3,4,2)

combined_mask = row_mask & col_mask & depth_mask # Logical AND

indexed_tensor = tensor[combined_mask]
print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"Combined Mask:\n{combined_mask}")
print(f"Indexed Tensor:\n{indexed_tensor}")
```

This code demonstrates how to apply boolean indexing across all three dimensions.  Each mask (`row_mask`, `col_mask`, `depth_mask`) initially addresses a single dimension.  The use of `unsqueeze()` adds singleton dimensions to enable broadcasting.  `expand()` replicates the mask values across the appropriate dimensions.  Finally, `&` performs a logical AND, resulting in a multi-dimensional `combined_mask` where only `True` values across all three masks result in `True`.  The final result `indexed_tensor` will only contain values satisfying all specified conditions.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch tensors and boolean indexing, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation and tutorials.  Furthermore, a solid grounding in linear algebra principles will significantly aid in grasping broadcasting behaviors.  Finally, working through practical examples and carefully examining the resulting tensor shapes is essential for mastering this technique.  Thoroughly understanding the distinctions between views and copies in PyTorch is crucial for efficient memory management and preventing unintended side effects.
