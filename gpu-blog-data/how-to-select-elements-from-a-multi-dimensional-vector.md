Tensor indexing in PyTorch, particularly with multi-dimensional tensors and index tensors, often requires careful consideration of broadcasting and the nuances of different indexing methods.  My experience debugging complex neural network architectures highlighted a critical oversight many newcomers make:  failure to explicitly understand the dimensionality of both the target tensor and the indexing tensor, leading to unexpected and difficult-to-trace errors.  This directly impacts the shape of the resulting tensor, often leading to dimension mismatches in subsequent operations.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch offers several ways to index multi-dimensional tensors using index tensors.  The key lies in comprehending how broadcasting rules interact with the dimensionality of the index tensors.  A common scenario involves selecting elements based on a set of row and column indices.  Let's consider a tensor `A` with shape (M, N).  If we have a set of row indices `row_indices` and column indices `col_indices`, both potentially tensors themselves, we must ensure that the broadcasting rules produce a result consistent with our desired outcome.  There are primarily two approaches:  advanced indexing using multiple index tensors, and single index tensor using linear indexing.

**Advanced Indexing:** Using multiple index tensors allows for selective element access based on each dimension.  The key here is ensuring each index tensor has a shape compatible with the corresponding dimension of the target tensor *or* that broadcasting rules can resolve shape discrepancies.  In case of shape discrepancies, broadcasting rules dictate that the smaller dimensions are expanded to match the larger dimensions; the operation fails if the dimensions are not compatible for broadcasting.

**Linear Indexing:**  Linear indexing treats the multi-dimensional tensor as a flattened 1D array.  Therefore, a single index tensor provides the linear indices corresponding to the desired elements.  This requires calculating the appropriate linear index based on the original tensor's shape and the desired row and column indices. This is computationally expensive for large tensors. While simpler conceptually, it can be less efficient for frequent access, particularly when the index tensor is large and irregularly structured.  Furthermore, maintaining code readability becomes challenging when working with many dimensions.

Both methods can lead to efficient code depending on the problem structure and indexing pattern.   Advanced indexing is often easier to read and potentially more efficient for regular indexing patterns, while linear indexing offers more flexibility for irregular accesses, but at the cost of computational overhead.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Advanced Indexing with Broadcasting**

```python
import torch

# Target tensor
A = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print(f"Original Tensor A:\n{A}")

# Row and column indices
row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
col_indices = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])

# Advanced indexing: Note the broadcasting!
selected_elements = A[row_indices, col_indices]
print(f"Selected Elements:\n{selected_elements}")

# Example with broadcasting across dimensions
row_indices_broadcast = torch.tensor([0,1])
col_indices_broadcast = torch.tensor([[1,2],[1,2]])
selected_elements_broadcast = A[row_indices_broadcast, col_indices_broadcast]
print(f"Selected Elements with Broadcasting:\n{selected_elements_broadcast}")

```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the use of advanced indexing with broadcasting.  The `row_indices` and `col_indices` are each of shape (3,).  PyTorch broadcasts these indices to select elements (0,1), (1,2), and (2,3) from `A`. The second example illustrates broadcasting along an additional dimension.  The resulting `selected_elements` has a shape (3,) because the result of selecting elements takes the shape of the indices.  Observe in the broadcasting case, the index tensors are broadcast to match the shape (2,2), resulting in a selected elements tensor with a shape (2,2).  This behavior underscores the importance of understanding broadcasting semantics in multi-dimensional indexing.



**Example 2: Advanced Indexing with Non-Broadcasting Indices**

```python
import torch

A = torch.arange(24).reshape(4, 6)
print(f"Original Tensor A:\n{A}")

row_indices = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [2, 3]])  # shape (2, 2)
col_indices = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # shape (2, 2)

selected_elements = A[row_indices, col_indices]
print(f"Selected Elements:\n{selected_elements}") # shape (2,2)

```

*Commentary:* Here, both index tensors have the same shape (2,2), thus matching the selection criteria directly without broadcasting.  The resulting `selected_elements` tensor reflects this directly: selecting the (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4) values. This highlights how choosing indices of matching shapes can avoid unexpected broadcasting behaviors, potentially making the code more predictable.


**Example 3: Linear Indexing**

```python
import torch

A = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print(f"Original Tensor A:\n{A}")

row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
col_indices = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])

# Calculate linear indices
linear_indices = row_indices * A.shape[1] + col_indices

# Linear indexing
selected_elements = A.flatten()[linear_indices]
print(f"Selected Elements using Linear Indexing:\n{selected_elements}")

```

*Commentary:*  This example illustrates linear indexing. First, we calculate the linear indices based on the row and column indices and the shape of the tensor `A`.  Then, we flatten `A` into a 1D tensor and use `linear_indices` to select the corresponding elements. While conceptually simpler for certain cases, linear indexing requires explicit calculation of linear indices, increasing code complexity and potentially computational overhead, especially for high-dimensional tensors with large numbers of index combinations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections detailing tensor manipulation and advanced indexing, is indispensable.  Furthermore, thorough exploration of the broadcasting rules within the PyTorch framework is crucial for mastering this aspect of tensor operations.  Finally, reviewing examples and tutorials focusing on efficient tensor manipulation techniques within the context of deep learning applications can provide practical insights and best practices.  Practice is key to gaining proficiency with the complexities of PyTorch tensor indexing.
