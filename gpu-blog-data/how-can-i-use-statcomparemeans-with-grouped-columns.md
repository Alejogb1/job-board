The `stat_compare_means()` function within the `ggpubr` R package provides powerful capabilities for statistical comparisons, particularly when visualized within ggplot2 figures. It allows pairwise statistical tests and their display on plots. However, achieving bracket-style comparisons, especially when data is grouped by multiple columns, requires a nuanced understanding of its underlying mechanics and data structures.  I encountered this directly while analyzing gene expression data across different experimental conditions and cell types, a situation where traditional one-way comparisons proved insufficient.

The core challenge lies in effectively communicating to `stat_compare_means()` how to interpret multiple grouping variables and which specific comparisons should be generated. The function natively supports grouping, but the nuances arise when applying this within bracket-style annotations. Weâ€™re not simply comparing levels within a single grouping column; rather, we're frequently aiming to compare multiple combinations of levels *across* several such columns, essentially constructing specific pairings for statistical testing. This involves structuring the data and function parameters correctly to achieve these specific comparisons. It's often not a simple case of specifying a `group.by` argument; we need to be explicit about the desired pairings.

Let's examine three distinct scenarios, building in complexity, using fictional data of a simplified biological system involving treatment groups, timepoints, and expression of a biomarker. Each scenario will be accompanied by illustrative R code and detailed commentary.

**Scenario 1: Simple Grouped Comparison**

Initially, we explore the basic use of grouping with `stat_compare_means()`. Assume a dataset containing expression levels for a biomarker (numeric variable) across two treatment groups (Treatment A and Treatment B), measured at a single timepoint. The data is organized into columns: `treatment` (categorical) and `biomarker` (numeric). The goal is to compare the biomarker levels between the two treatments.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Fictional Data
set.seed(42)
data_simple <- data.frame(
  treatment = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 30)),
  biomarker = rnorm(60, mean = ifelse(rep(c(TRUE,FALSE), each = 30), 5, 3), sd = 1)
)

# Basic comparison with grouped data
p1 <- ggplot(data_simple, aes(x = treatment, y = biomarker)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_compare_means(method = "t.test", label = "p.signif")
print(p1)
```

Here, the `ggplot()` call sets up the basic plot with a boxplot for visualization. The core of the comparison lies in `stat_compare_means()`. We specify `method = "t.test"` for a two-sample t-test and `label="p.signif"` for displaying significance levels.  The function, by default, infers grouping based on the x-axis variable specified in `ggplot()` (`treatment`). This creates a single pairwise comparison of treatment A versus treatment B. We do not have to directly specify any group; the function infers the comparison appropriately.

**Scenario 2: Comparisons across levels of two grouping columns**

The next situation expands on the complexity.  Now, the experiment involves measuring biomarker expression at two timepoints (T1, T2) for each treatment (A, B).  Thus, the data comprises `treatment` (categorical), `timepoint` (categorical), and `biomarker` (numeric). The objective is to perform a set of pairwise comparisons: comparing treatment A vs B at time T1 and treatment A vs B at time T2 *separately*. This requires explicit specification of the comparison groups.

```r
# Fictional Data
set.seed(42)
data_complex <- data.frame(
  treatment = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 60)),
  timepoint = factor(rep(rep(c("T1", "T2"), each=30),2)),
  biomarker = rnorm(120, mean = ifelse(rep(c(TRUE,FALSE, TRUE,FALSE), each = 30), c(5, 3, 6, 4), 0), sd = 1)
)

# Explicitly specify comparisons
p2 <- ggplot(data_complex, aes(x = treatment, y = biomarker, fill= treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~timepoint) +
   stat_compare_means(
    method = "t.test",
    comparisons = list(c("A", "B")),
    label="p.signif"
  )
print(p2)
```

We use `facet_wrap(~timepoint)` to create distinct plots for each timepoint. Crucially, `comparisons = list(c("A","B"))` within `stat_compare_means()` explicitly defines the pairwise comparisons *within each facet* - that is, treatment A vs B at T1 and again at treatment A vs B at T2 . The result is two distinct brackets, one for each timepoint, each displaying the p-value of the A-B comparison at that specific timepoint. The function executes `t.test()` within each facet group. If `comparisons` is not specified, by default, the function attempts to compare *all* combinations which may not be what the user intends.

**Scenario 3: Comparisons with Custom Annotations (and a different dataset)**

Lastly, let us consider a scenario where the number of unique levels across columns is different, and a more complex and customized comparison is needed. Let us imagine we now have a situation with two cell types (`cell_type`: Type X and Type Y) and a two treatment groups (`treatment`, A and B). We measure biomarker level as before but now want to compare Type X to Type Y for both treatment groups. Additionally, instead of printing just a p-value, we want to include effect size (mean differences).

```r
# Fictional Data
set.seed(42)
data_custom <- data.frame(
  cell_type = factor(rep(c("X", "Y"), each = 60)),
  treatment = factor(rep(rep(c("A", "B"), each=30),2)),
    biomarker = rnorm(120, mean = ifelse(rep(c(TRUE,FALSE, TRUE,FALSE), each = 30), c(4, 6, 3, 5), 0), sd = 1)
)

# Custom comparisons with custom label
p3 <- ggplot(data_custom, aes(x = treatment, y = biomarker, fill = cell_type)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    stat_compare_means(
        method = "t.test",
        comparisons = list(c("X", "Y")),
        label = "mean.diff",
    label.x = 1.5
    ) +
    facet_wrap(~treatment)
 print(p3)
```

In this situation, the `ggplot()` is similar to the prior example. A key difference is within `stat_compare_means()`. The `comparisons` list now specifies to compare the first level to the second level of our `fill` aesthetic, within each treatment group as defined by `facet_wrap()`. The label is now `"mean.diff"`, printing the mean difference between the groups. We also used `label.x = 1.5` to move the label from over the center of the boxplot, so the effect size is easier to read. Again, we achieved custom comparison brackets by explicitly indicating that comparison with `comparisons`. If the user was not careful about the order of variables, a comparison of Y to X may be the result if the levels of `cell_type` are not structured as desired. This can be controlled by `levels` argument when declaring factors.

In summary, producing bracket-style comparisons with grouped data using `stat_compare_means()` hinges on a careful consideration of the experimental design, and explicit specification of pairings. Specifically, grouping based on `ggplot()` aesthetics alone is not always sufficient; one should use the `comparisons` parameter and the `facet_wrap()` option (as required by the design). Each scenario builds upon the other, moving from single level comparisons to two-group level comparisons, and finally, to customized comparisons.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of statistical tests, consult textbooks on introductory statistics and biostatistics.  For specific details on ggplot2, the official documentation and associated publications offer a comprehensive overview.  Finally,  explore the help files associated with `ggpubr` which provide specific explanations of function options, including parameters to `stat_compare_means()`.  Pay specific attention to examples associated with group comparisons and facetting. The StackOverflow community also offers invaluable insight, particularly on the subtleties of complex visualization scenarios. By consulting these, one can refine their understanding of this important function within the R ecosystem.
