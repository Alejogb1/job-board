The premise of the question is incorrect. CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model, works with both PyTorch and TensorFlow.  The perception of incompatibility likely stems from differences in implementation, ease of use, and the specific versions of libraries involved.  Over my years working on high-performance computing projects, involving both frameworks extensively, I’ve observed this confusion repeatedly.  The crucial point is understanding how each framework interacts with CUDA, not whether it fundamentally *can*.

**1.  Clear Explanation of CUDA Integration in PyTorch and TensorFlow:**

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow leverage CUDA for GPU acceleration through different approaches. PyTorch adopts a more imperative and Pythonic style.  CUDA operations are often integrated directly into the Python code using the `torch.cuda` module.  Tensor operations are implicitly moved to the GPU if the tensors reside on a CUDA device. This direct interaction provides a relatively straightforward path to GPU acceleration, albeit with potential performance overheads if not carefully managed.  Memory management is largely handled automatically, although manual control is possible for advanced optimization.

TensorFlow, on the other hand, initially followed a more graph-based computational model. Operations were defined as a computational graph, optimized, and then executed.  While the initial approach did offer potential for superior optimization, its abstraction could make debugging and understanding GPU utilization more challenging. However, TensorFlow 2.x introduced Eager Execution, making the experience significantly more Pythonic and similar to PyTorch's style.  Even with Eager Execution, TensorFlow still offers tools like `tf.config.set_visible_devices` and `tf.device` for explicitly placing operations on specific GPUs. TensorFlow's flexibility also extends to different backends beyond CUDA, supporting CPUs and other accelerators.

The difference boils down to the level of abstraction and the programming paradigm. PyTorch’s immediacy makes it easier for many users to integrate CUDA, while TensorFlow's historical emphasis on graph optimization necessitates a slightly steeper learning curve for optimal GPU utilization.  This difference, however, does not constitute incompatibility.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: PyTorch CUDA tensor operations:**

```python
import torch

# Check CUDA availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device) # Move tensor to GPU
    y = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)
    z = torch.matmul(x, y) # Matrix multiplication on GPU
    print(z.device) # Verify execution on GPU
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward nature of PyTorch's CUDA integration. The `torch.cuda.is_available()` check ensures compatibility, and `.to(device)` explicitly transfers the tensor to the GPU.  Operations on these tensors are implicitly performed on the GPU. The final `print` statement confirms the GPU execution.

**Example 2: TensorFlow CUDA tensor operations (Eager Execution):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check CUDA availability
if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("GPU available")
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Explicit GPU device placement
        x = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
        y = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
        z = tf.matmul(x, y)
        print(z.device) # Verify execution on GPU

else:
    print("GPU not available")
```

This TensorFlow example utilizes Eager Execution, making the code visually similar to the PyTorch example.  `tf.config.list_physical_devices` checks GPU availability.  `tf.device('/GPU:0')` explicitly places the tensor operations on GPU 0. The explicit device placement is a key difference from PyTorch's implicit behavior.


**Example 3:  Comparing Memory Management (Simplified):**

This example highlights a nuanced difference in how memory is managed.  This is not a direct CUDA comparison, but it underlines the different programming paradigms.

```python
import torch
import tensorflow as tf

# PyTorch: Automatic memory management (simplified)
x_torch = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
del x_torch # Python's garbage collection handles memory release

# TensorFlow (simplified)
x_tf = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
# Manual memory management might be needed for large tensors in some scenarios, using tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph() or other techniques.
```

PyTorch’s automatic memory management, while convenient, can lead to unexpected memory usage if not carefully monitored, particularly in complex models.  TensorFlow, especially in graph mode, previously required more manual memory management for optimal performance, though Eager Execution eases this aspect considerably.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA programming, I highly recommend exploring the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation.  For both PyTorch and TensorFlow, studying the official documentation regarding GPU acceleration and the specific APIs for CUDA integration is invaluable.  Finally, researching advanced optimization techniques within each framework, including memory management, will significantly improve performance.  Examining example code from the frameworks and their respective communities is also essential for gaining practical experience.  The learning curve for GPU programming can be steep, so consistent practice and debugging are crucial.
