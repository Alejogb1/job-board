TensorFlow models, even when trained on a GPU, can inadvertently load weights onto the CPU during inference if the resource placement isn't managed explicitly. This stems from TensorFlow's device placement strategy, where the default behavior is to place operations on available devices, often falling back to the CPU if a suitable GPU context isn't found or explicitly defined. As a data scientist with several years of TensorFlow model deployment experience, I've often seen this result in suboptimal performance when running inference, even when a GPU is present in the system.

The core issue revolves around two main areas: the absence of explicit device scoping and TensorFlow’s eager execution and graph modes. When training, TensorFlow automatically handles device placement based on the available CUDA-enabled GPUs. However, this implicit placement during training doesn't guarantee the same device mapping during inference. In particular, if the model loading code doesn't explicitly specify which device to use when constructing tensors with the loaded weights, TensorFlow can, depending on the execution mode (eager or graph), allocate those tensors on the CPU. This default CPU placement can become a significant bottleneck, rendering the performance advantages of GPU training futile during model utilization.

The primary mode of operation, eager execution, runs operations immediately as they are called, making debugging easier but lacking the performance optimizations available via graph execution. When a model is saved in SavedModel format using `tf.saved_model.save`, or when weights are saved separately with `model.save_weights`, the device information is typically not included directly within the saved artifacts. This can lead to a default placement of weight variables onto the CPU when the model is loaded and used for inference in eager mode. However, the graph mode, when using `tf.function`, can optimize for device placement and memory allocation, but even with graphs, relying on implicit device placement can still lead to issues if the available devices are not correctly identified or utilized.

To illustrate, consider the following scenarios with code examples. The first shows what happens with implicit device placement:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a model was trained previously and saved to 'saved_model'
# Define a placeholder to represent a single input image for inference
input_shape = (1, 28, 28, 3) # Example shape: Batch Size 1, 28x28 RGB images
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(input_shape)
# Load the saved model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('saved_model')
# Make a prediction; notice no explicit GPU specification
predictions = loaded_model(input_tensor)
# Determine the device that the predictions reside on
device_for_predictions = predictions.device

print(f"Device of predictions: {device_for_predictions}")
# The output will likely be CPU even if GPUs are available
```

In the example above, although the model was *trained* on the GPU, the inference calculation during prediction implicitly defaults to the CPU. The `predictions.device` would indicate '/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0', thus revealing the misallocation of compute resources.

The fix involves explicitly directing the model and its weights to the GPU during the inference phase. Here’s an example of how to accomplish this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a model was trained previously and saved to 'saved_model'
input_shape = (1, 28, 28, 3)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

# Load the saved model within the GPU scope
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('saved_model')

    # Make a prediction now the model is on the GPU
    predictions = loaded_model(input_tensor)

# Verify the device for predictions
device_for_predictions = predictions.device

print(f"Device of predictions: {device_for_predictions}")
# The output should now show a GPU device
```

By wrapping the loading and inference within `tf.device('/GPU:0')`, we force TensorFlow to allocate the model’s variables and execute the operations on the specified GPU. This prevents the previously noted CPU allocation. When multiple GPUs are available, one can use '/GPU:1', '/GPU:2' and so on. Additionally, if you are using Keras functional API (or subclassed models with weights), you can transfer each `tf.Variable` explicitly to the GPU via its `assign` method during loading:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume model is a tf.keras.Model subclass or functional model
# Assume saved weights are in saved_weights_path.
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('saved_model') # Assuming it also saved the model architecture.
# Or model = build_your_model() # if only the weights were saved.
# model.load_weights('saved_weights_path') #if separate weights.
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
  for layer in model.layers:
      for var in layer.variables: # iterate through all trainable variables in all layers.
          if isinstance(var, tf.Variable):
              new_var = tf.Variable(var.numpy(), trainable = var.trainable)
              var.assign(new_var) # assign the new var to the layer var, placing it on the device.
  input_shape = (1, 28, 28, 3)
  input_tensor = tf.random.normal(input_shape)
  predictions = model(input_tensor)
  device_for_predictions = predictions.device
  print(f"Device of predictions: {device_for_predictions}")

```

This approach iterates through all the layers of the model and explicitly assigns their weights to the specified GPU by creating new variables with the same data but allocating them on the designated device. This method can be particularly useful if `tf.saved_model.load` doesn't provide the expected device placement for various reasons.

Several best practices help avoid the issue. Firstly, be aware of TensorFlow's implicit device placement. Always explicitly specify the device using `tf.device()` when loading models and conducting inference, especially when not using `tf.function` or when a single inference run is critical. Secondly, when saving models, save the entire model architecture (`tf.keras.models.save_model`), not just weights, to aid in device placement during load. Using `tf.function` and creating inference graphs can improve device utilization and performance for repeated inference tasks by allowing the TensorFlow graph optimizer to handle the allocation, however, this is not a silver bullet, particularly when single predictions are performed. Finally, when debugging unexpected CPU usage, `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` helps identify if TensorFlow can see the GPUs and `tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)` can show which device computations are being assigned to.

For further exploration, I suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on device placement, eager execution, and `tf.function`. In addition, consulting examples provided in the official TensorFlow tutorials on model loading and saving strategies will further deepen the understanding of this device-related behavior. Finally, analyzing existing production codebases that leverage TensorFlow for GPU-accelerated deep learning inference can illuminate the best practices for managing resource allocation within a large framework. By understanding and correctly applying these concepts, a practitioner can ensure efficient and optimized GPU utilization for inference after having invested effort in GPU-accelerated training.
