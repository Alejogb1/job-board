The inherent computational complexity difference between summing array indices and summing array elements lies in the data access pattern.  Summing indices requires only arithmetic operations, its complexity being O(n), directly proportional to the array size. Summing elements, however, necessitates accessing each element's value in memory, adding a potential memory access overhead which can significantly impact performance, especially for large arrays or those stored in non-contiguous memory locations. This difference is often overlooked, yet understanding it is crucial for optimizing performance-critical applications dealing with extensive numerical computations.  My experience optimizing high-frequency trading algorithms has repeatedly highlighted the subtle but impactful performance gains achievable by carefully considering this distinction.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The sum of array indices is trivially calculated.  Given an array of size *n*, the sum of indices from 0 to n-1 is a simple arithmetic series:  n(n-1)/2.  This calculation is independent of the array's contents and executes in constant time, O(1), once *n* is known.  This contrasts sharply with summing the elements themselves.  Summing elements requires iterating through the array, reading each element's value from memory, and accumulating the sum. This process has a time complexity of O(n), linearly proportional to the array size. The constant factor in this O(n) operation, however, can vary substantially depending on factors such as data type, memory layout, cache behavior, and the underlying hardware architecture.  For instance, summing an array of doubles will likely be slower than summing an array of integers due to differences in data size and memory access patterns.

Furthermore, the sum of elements is susceptible to numerical instability for very large arrays or arrays containing extremely large or small values.  This instability can manifest as precision loss due to floating-point arithmetic limitations. The sum of indices, being purely integer arithmetic (assuming integer indexing), avoids this problem entirely.

In scenarios where both the sum of indices and the sum of elements are needed, optimizing involves prioritizing the sum-of-indices calculation due to its inherent computational advantage.  One can pre-compute this sum in O(1) time, storing it as a constant for repeated use, thereby reducing overall computational burden.  The sum of elements calculation remains O(n), but the overall algorithm is not dominated by this unless it's repeatedly performed with varying arrays.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Naive Implementation (Python)**

```python
import time

def sum_indices_naive(arr):
  """Calculates the sum of indices naively."""
  total = 0
  for i in range(len(arr)):
    total += i
  return total

def sum_elements_naive(arr):
  """Calculates the sum of elements naively."""
  total = 0
  for i in range(len(arr)):
    total += arr[i]
  return total


arr = list(range(1000000)) # Large array for demonstration

start_time = time.time()
sum_indices_naive(arr)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Naive index sum time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")


start_time = time.time()
sum_elements_naive(arr)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Naive element sum time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

```

This example demonstrates the naive approach, highlighting the difference in execution time for large arrays.  The `sum_indices_naive` function, although O(n), is generally faster than `sum_elements_naive` for large arrays due to the overhead of memory access for the latter.


**Example 2: Optimized Sum of Indices (C++)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <vector>

long long sum_indices_optimized(size_t n) {
  //Direct calculation, O(1)
  return (long long)n * (n - 1) / 2;
}

long long sum_elements(const std::vector<long long>& arr) {
    long long total = 0;
    for (long long val : arr) {
        total += val;
    }
    return total;
}

int main() {
  size_t n = 1000000;
  std::vector<long long> arr(n);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) arr[i] = i * 2; //Example values

  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  long long index_sum = sum_indices_optimized(n);
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);

  std::cout << "Optimized index sum: " << index_sum << ", Time taken: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << std::endl;

  start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  long long element_sum = sum_elements(arr);
  end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);

  std::cout << "Element sum: " << element_sum << ", Time taken: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This C++ example showcases the optimized approach for calculating the sum of indices using the mathematical formula.  The time difference becomes even more pronounced, emphasizing the O(1) versus O(n) complexity difference.


**Example 3:  Parallel Summation (Java)**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Long> {
    private final long[] arr;
    private final int lo, hi;

    SumTask(long[] arr, int lo, int hi) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.lo = lo;
        this.hi = hi;
    }

    protected Long compute() {
        if (hi - lo <= 1000) { //Threshold for sequential computation
            long sum = 0;
            for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i) {
                sum += arr[i];
            }
            return sum;
        } else {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            SumTask left = new SumTask(arr, lo, mid);
            SumTask right = new SumTask(arr, mid, hi);
            left.fork(); // Parallel execution
            long rightSum = right.compute();
            long leftSum = left.join();
            return leftSum + rightSum;
        }
    }
}

public class ParallelSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long[] arr = new long[10000000];
        Arrays.parallelSetAll(arr, i -> i * 2); //Initialize array with some values.

        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = new ForkJoinPool().invoke(new SumTask(arr, 0, arr.length));
        long end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Parallel element sum: " + sum + ", Time taken: " + (end - start) / 1e6 + "ms");

        start = System.nanoTime();
        long optimizedIndexSum = (long)arr.length * (arr.length -1) /2; //O(1)
        end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Optimized index sum: " + optimizedIndexSum + ", Time taken: " + (end - start) / 1e6 + "ms");


    }
}

```

This Java example utilizes the ForkJoinPool for parallel summation of array elements.  While this improves the performance of summing elements compared to sequential approaches for extremely large arrays, it still remains O(n) in terms of work done, whereas the index sum remains O(1).  The choice to parallelize depends on the hardware and array size, but it doesn't change the fundamental complexity advantage of summing indices.
