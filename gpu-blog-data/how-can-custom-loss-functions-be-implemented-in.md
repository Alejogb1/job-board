Implementing custom loss functions in TensorFlow 2.0 requires a precise understanding of the `tf.keras.losses` module and its underlying mechanics.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for high-frequency trading applications heavily involved crafting tailored loss functions to address specific market idiosyncrasies.  The key is to understand that a loss function in TensorFlow is ultimately just a callable object that takes predicted and true values as input and returns a scalar tensor representing the loss.  This scalar must be differentiable for gradient-based optimization to work effectively.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.keras.losses` module offers a flexible framework for creating custom losses.  Instead of relying solely on predefined losses like mean squared error (MSE) or categorical cross-entropy,  you can define functions that better capture the nuances of your problem. This is particularly crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets, specialized evaluation metrics, or complex relationships between predictions and ground truth.  The process generally involves defining a Python function that accepts `y_true` (ground truth labels) and `y_pred` (model predictions) as inputs and returns a tensor representing the loss. This function then needs to be incorporated into the model's compilation process.  Crucially, the function must adhere to TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities;  it should utilize TensorFlow operations rather than NumPy operations to ensure proper gradient calculation.  Failure to do so will result in `None` gradients, preventing model training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy**

This example showcases a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function, beneficial when dealing with class imbalance.  In my work, this was vital for predicting market crashes, where the 'crash' class represented a small fraction of the data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weight_pos=10.0):
  """
  Weighted binary cross-entropy loss function.

  Args:
    y_true: True labels (0 or 1).
    y_pred: Predicted probabilities (between 0 and 1).
    weight_pos: Weight applied to positive class (class 1).

  Returns:
    A scalar tensor representing the weighted binary cross-entropy loss.
  """
  bce = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
  weight = y_true * weight_pos + (1 - y_true)
  weighted_bce = bce * weight
  return tf.reduce_mean(weighted_bce)

model.compile(loss=weighted_binary_crossentropy, optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This code defines `weighted_binary_crossentropy` which adjusts the standard binary cross-entropy loss by multiplying it with a weight factor that emphasizes the positive class.  The `tf.reduce_mean` function ensures that a single scalar loss value is returned.  Note the use of TensorFlow operations for compatibility with automatic differentiation.

**Example 2:  Huber Loss for Robust Regression**

The Huber loss is a less sensitive alternative to MSE, particularly useful in situations with outliers which can heavily influence the MSE gradient.  I applied this extensively in my algorithmic trading strategy when dealing with noisy market data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0):
  """
  Huber loss function.

  Args:
    y_true: True values.
    y_pred: Predicted values.
    delta: Parameter controlling the transition between L1 and L2 loss.

  Returns:
    A scalar tensor representing the Huber loss.
  """
  error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
  quadratic = tf.minimum(error, delta)
  linear = error - quadratic
  loss = 0.5 * tf.square(quadratic) + delta * linear
  return tf.reduce_mean(loss)

model.compile(loss=huber_loss, optimizer='adam', metrics=['mae'])
```

Here, `huber_loss` calculates the loss using a piecewise function, transitioning from L2 (quadratic) to L1 (linear) loss as the error exceeds the `delta` threshold.  This mitigates the impact of outliers, making the model more robust.

**Example 3:  Custom Loss with Multiple Metrics**

This example shows how to combine multiple metrics into a single loss function, a technique I employed when balancing accuracy and precision in a fraud detection model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def combined_loss(y_true, y_pred, alpha=0.5):
    """
    Combines binary cross-entropy and precision into a single loss function.

    Args:
      y_true: True labels.
      y_pred: Predicted probabilities.
      alpha: Weighting factor for precision (0.0 to 1.0).

    Returns:
      A scalar tensor representing the combined loss.
    """
    bce = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    precision = tf.keras.metrics.Precision(name="precision")(y_true, tf.round(y_pred))

    #Ensure precision is a scalar and avoid nan values if precision is 0
    precision = tf.where(tf.math.is_nan(precision), tf.constant(0.0), precision)

    combined = bce + alpha * (1.0-precision)
    return tf.reduce_mean(combined)

model.compile(loss=combined_loss, optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy', 'precision'])

```

This function combines binary cross-entropy and a precision metric, weighted by `alpha`.  It demonstrates how to integrate existing Keras metrics within a custom loss function, providing greater control over the model's optimization objective. The conditional check ensures numerical stability, handling potential `NaN` values from a precision of zero.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow 2.0 documentation on custom losses and Keras's guide on creating custom layers and losses.  Furthermore,  a thorough understanding of gradient descent and automatic differentiation is vital.  Finally, studying advanced optimization techniques like Adam or RMSprop will enhance your ability to effectively utilize custom loss functions.  These resources provide extensive explanations and illustrative examples.
