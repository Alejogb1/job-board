The discrepancy between expected and actual LSTM output shapes often stems from a misunderstanding of the `return_sequences` and `return_state` parameters within the Keras `LSTM` layer, coupled with an imprecise understanding of the underlying temporal dependencies the LSTM processes.  In my experience debugging recurrent neural networks, this issue is surprisingly common, even amongst seasoned practitioners.  The key lies in recognizing that an LSTM's output reflects not only the final hidden state but also the hidden state at each time step, depending on how the layer is configured.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras `LSTM` layer possesses two crucial parameters influencing the output shape: `return_sequences` and `return_state`.  `return_sequences`, when set to `True`, returns the hidden state for *every* time step in the input sequence. This results in a three-dimensional output tensor with shape (samples, timesteps, units), where `samples` represents the batch size, `timesteps` the sequence length, and `units` the number of LSTM units. Conversely, if `return_sequences` is `False` (the default), only the hidden state of the *last* timestep is returned, yielding a two-dimensional output tensor of shape (samples, units).

The `return_state` parameter, on the other hand, controls whether the LSTM's internal cell state and hidden state are also returned. When set to `True`, it appends these states to the output. The cell and hidden states each have a shape of (samples, units).  Therefore, setting `return_sequences=False` and `return_state=True` will produce an output with three tensors: one representing the last hidden state (samples, units), one for the last cell state (samples, units), and one for the  output (samples, units). If you set both parameters to true, you get the hidden states for all timesteps, plus the final cell and hidden states.  Failure to account for this parameter combination often leads to shape mismatches.

A frequent oversight is assuming a single output vector when working with time series data where the LSTM needs to process sequential information.  The model's architecture needs to match the desired output;  if you anticipate a prediction at each timestep, `return_sequences=True` is mandatory. If only a final prediction is required, `return_sequences=False` is appropriate.  Furthermore, the input shape must always be consistent with the LSTM's expectations â€“ specifically (samples, timesteps, features), where features represent the dimensionality of the input at each timestep.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Single prediction based on the entire sequence.**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Define the LSTM model with return_sequences=False and return_state=False
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(10, 3), return_sequences=False, return_state=False),  # Input shape: (timesteps, features)
    Dense(1, activation='linear') # Output layer for a single prediction.
])

# Sample input data
X = np.random.rand(32, 10, 3) # Batch size = 32, timesteps = 10, features = 3

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions.shape) # Output shape: (32, 1) - one prediction per sample
```

This example showcases a standard scenario where the LSTM processes an entire sequence and outputs a single prediction per sample.  The `return_sequences=False` and `return_state=False` settings ensure that only the final hidden state is used for prediction, fed into a single Dense layer for regression.  Note the input shape is clearly defined.


**Example 2: Sequence-to-sequence prediction (many to many).**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(10, 3), return_sequences=True, return_state=False),
    Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

X = np.random.rand(32, 10, 3)

predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions.shape)  # Output shape: (32, 10, 1) - one prediction per timestep per sample
```

Here, `return_sequences=True` is essential. The LSTM produces a prediction for each timestep in the input sequence. The output shape reflects this: (samples, timesteps, units of output layer). This is crucial for tasks like time series forecasting where we aim to predict future values based on past sequences.  Again, input shaping is consistent.


**Example 3: Accessing the hidden state.**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(10, 3), return_sequences=False, return_state=True)
])

X = np.random.rand(32, 10, 3)

output, hidden_state, cell_state = model.predict(X) #Tuple unpacking the output.

print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Output shape: (32, 64)
print("Hidden state shape:", hidden_state.shape) # Hidden state shape: (32, 64)
print("Cell state shape:", cell_state.shape) # Cell state shape: (32, 64)
```

This demonstrates the use of `return_state=True`.  The model returns not only the final hidden state (`hidden_state`) and the final cell state (`cell_state`), but also the default output, which is the last hidden state. Note that `return_sequences` is set to `False` here; if set to `True`, you would have received a tuple containing the full sequence of hidden states plus the final hidden and cell states.  Understanding this tuple unpacking is vital for extracting relevant information.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly recommend reviewing the official Keras documentation on the `LSTM` layer. Pay close attention to the explanation of the `return_sequences` and `return_state` parameters.  Consult textbooks on deep learning, particularly those focusing on recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling.  Familiarize yourself with the mathematical underpinnings of LSTMs to grasp how the hidden and cell states evolve over time.  Finally, work through numerous practical examples to solidify your understanding.  Careful consideration of input and output shapes will minimize the possibility of encountering shape mismatches.
