TensorFlow 1's `tf.contrib.data` and the analogous TensorFlow 2 `tf.data` APIs present distinct approaches to dataset management, necessitating a conversion strategy when migrating table-based data.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the importance of efficient data loading, and this transition was a critical step in optimizing our pipelines.  The core issue lies not in the file format itself (assuming a standard format like CSV or TFRecord), but in how TensorFlow handles dataset construction and ingestion.  TensorFlow 1 relied heavily on placeholders and session management, whereas TensorFlow 2 employs eager execution and a more declarative approach with the `tf.data` API.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The migration process involves three primary phases:  data format verification, data loading using the appropriate TensorFlow 2 API, and potential data transformation steps to match the expectations of your TensorFlow 2 model.  If your data resides in a CSV file, the `tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset` function offers a direct path. For TFRecord files, you'll leverage `tf.data.TFRecordDataset`.  Both methods offer advantages over directly handling the files using lower-level Python libraries like `csv` or `tf.python_io.tf_record_iterator`, as they integrate seamlessly with TensorFlow's data pipeline optimization capabilities, including prefetching and parallelization.  Crucially, understanding your data schema—column names, data types, and the presence of missing values—is paramount to successful conversion.  Handling missing values during the loading process, often through imputation or filtering, prevents runtime errors and ensures data consistency.

The key difference lies in how you define and use the dataset.  In TensorFlow 1, you'd typically define a placeholder, feed data into the placeholder during session execution, and manage the data flow explicitly. TensorFlow 2's `tf.data` API constructs a dataset object that defines the data pipeline. This object is then iterated upon, and TensorFlow handles the efficient fetching and feeding of data during training or inference. This declarative style improves code readability and simplifies the management of complex datasets.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Converting a CSV file.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1 approach (Illustrative - avoid in production)
# with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
#     csv_data = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtype=tf.string) # Placeholder needed for feeding
#     dataset = tf.compat.v1.data.TextLineDataset([csv_filepath])  #Legacy Data API
#     ... (Further processing and feeding using sess.run) ...


# TensorFlow 2 approach
csv_filepath = 'my_table.csv'
dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
    csv_filepath,
    batch_size=32,  # Adjust batch size as needed
    label_name='target_column', # Specify the column containing labels
    num_epochs=1, # Set the number of epochs for dataset iteration
    header=True # Assuming a header row exists
)

for batch in dataset:
    features = batch[:-1]  # Extract features
    labels = batch[-1]  # Extract labels
    # Process each batch, perform model training/inference
    print(f"Feature batch shape: {features.shape}, Label batch shape: {labels.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates the significant shift from the explicit session management in TensorFlow 1 to the streamlined dataset creation and iteration in TensorFlow 2. The `make_csv_dataset` function handles much of the low-level file reading and parsing, simplifying the code considerably.  Error handling and data type specifications should be incorporated for robustness in a production setting.

**Example 2:  Converting a TFRecord file.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1 approach (Illustrative - avoid in production)
# reader = tf.python_io.tf_record_iterator(path)
# for example in reader:
#    features = tf.train.Example.FromString(example)
#    ...


# TensorFlow 2 approach
tfrecord_filepath = 'my_data.tfrecord'
dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(tfrecord_filepath)

def parse_function(example_proto):
  # Define features of the example protocol buffer
  feature_description = {
      'feature1': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32),
      'feature2': tf.io.VarLenFeature(tf.int64),
      'label': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64)
  }
  example = tf.io.parse_single_example(example_proto, feature_description)
  return example['feature1'], example['feature2'], example['label']


dataset = dataset.map(parse_function)
dataset = dataset.batch(32)
for features1, features2, labels in dataset:
    #Process the features and labels
    print(f"Features 1 shape: {features1.shape}, Features 2 shape: {features2.shape}, Labels shape: {labels.shape}")
```

This example showcases the use of `TFRecordDataset` and a custom `parse_function`. The `parse_function` is crucial for defining how each example within the TFRecord file should be deserialized into a usable format for your model.  The `feature_description` dictionary maps feature names to their TensorFlow data types.  Appropriate error handling and type validation should be implemented within the `parse_function`.

**Example 3: Handling Missing Values in CSV Data:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

csv_filepath = 'my_table.csv'

#Using pandas to handle missing values, then converting to a tf.data dataset
df = pd.read_csv(csv_filepath)
df.fillna(0, inplace=True) # Simple imputation – replace with a more sophisticated strategy as needed
csv_buffer = df.to_csv(index=False)


dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset([csv_buffer])

def csv_parser(line):
  fields = tf.io.decode_csv(line, record_defaults=[tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)] * df.shape[1])
  return fields


dataset = dataset.skip(1).map(csv_parser)
dataset = dataset.batch(32)

for batch in dataset:
    print(batch.shape) # Batch of processed data
```


This example utilizes pandas to pre-process the CSV data, handling missing values before creating the TensorFlow dataset.  This approach allows for more flexibility in handling missing data compared to relying solely on TensorFlow's built-in features. Consider more sophisticated imputation techniques (e.g., mean/median imputation, k-NN imputation) depending on your data's characteristics.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow 2 documentation on the `tf.data` API is an indispensable resource.  Additionally, books and online courses covering TensorFlow 2 and data preprocessing techniques are valuable supplementary materials.  For more advanced data manipulation and pre-processing beyond what's directly provided by TensorFlow, consult the documentation for NumPy and Pandas.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's data pipeline optimization strategies (e.g., caching, prefetching, parallelization) will prove beneficial for improving performance with large datasets. Remember to refer to official TensorFlow documentation for the most up-to-date information and best practices.
