PyTorch’s `Sampler` objects, when used in conjunction with a `DataLoader`, do not guarantee the same sequence of indices across multiple iterations unless explicitly configured to do so. This behavior stems from the core design of the `DataLoader`, which regenerates a new iterable of indices based on the `Sampler` on each epoch (i.e., when the `DataLoader` is re-iterated). This characteristic is fundamental for the training process, allowing for randomization of batches across epochs, but it can become a crucial point of consideration when reproducible results are required, or for certain debugging scenarios.

The core function of a `Sampler` in PyTorch is to provide a sequence of indices that define the order in which data is accessed by the `DataLoader`. The `DataLoader` leverages this sequence to retrieve the corresponding data samples from the dataset, grouping them into batches. The indices are not tied to a specific iteration of the `DataLoader`; rather, they are produced anew with each iteration using the sampler’s methods. Default Samplers such as `RandomSampler` (which shuffles the data each time) and `SequentialSampler` (which returns indices in order) are commonly used. The choice of sampler significantly impacts the data presentation during training.

The consequence of this design is that, by default, each iteration of the `DataLoader` using a `RandomSampler` will yield a different ordering of the dataset indices, and hence, different batches, which is vital for model generalization, preventing the model from learning spurious correlations within specific batch orderings. When a `SequentialSampler` is used however, the ordering will be preserved but the dataset will still be accessed multiple times if the number of dataloader iterations is more than the number of batches.

Here are three code examples illustrating these concepts:

**Example 1: Illustrating Randomized Indices with RandomSampler**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
from torch.utils.data.sampler import RandomSampler

# Dummy data
data = torch.arange(10)
dataset = TensorDataset(data)

# Create a DataLoader with RandomSampler
batch_size = 2
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, sampler=RandomSampler(dataset))

# Iterate the dataloader once
print("First iteration:")
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch)

# Iterate the dataloader again
print("\nSecond iteration:")
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch)
```

In this example, a `TensorDataset` is created, and a `DataLoader` uses `RandomSampler` for its sampling strategy. The output will clearly demonstrate that the order of batches is different in the two iterations. This is because the indices used to generate the batches are shuffled by the `RandomSampler` at each iteration of the `DataLoader`.

**Example 2: Demonstrating Sequential Ordering with SequentialSampler**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
from torch.utils.data.sampler import SequentialSampler

# Dummy data
data = torch.arange(10)
dataset = TensorDataset(data)

# Create a DataLoader with SequentialSampler
batch_size = 2
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, sampler=SequentialSampler(dataset))

# Iterate the dataloader once
print("First iteration:")
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch)

# Iterate the dataloader again
print("\nSecond iteration:")
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch)

```

Here, `SequentialSampler` is used. Notice that the order of batches within an iteration is the same, and they proceed through the dataset from the beginning each time. Each time the dataloader is iterated it uses the same ordering of indices but that the indices themselves are generated on each iteration. This is because the indices are produced anew with every iteration.

**Example 3: Ensuring Reproducibility via Seed and Manual Index Generation**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
from torch.utils.data.sampler import Sampler
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
data = torch.arange(10)
dataset = TensorDataset(data)

# Define a CustomSampler with a fixed seed to ensure consistent indices
class CustomSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_source, seed=42):
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.seed = seed

    def __iter__(self):
      generator = np.random.default_rng(self.seed)
      indices = generator.permutation(len(self.data_source))
      return iter(indices.tolist())

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data_source)


# Create a DataLoader with the custom sampler
batch_size = 2
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, sampler=CustomSampler(dataset))


# Iterate the dataloader once
print("First iteration:")
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch)

# Iterate the dataloader again
print("\nSecond iteration:")
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch)

```

This example demonstrates how to create a custom `Sampler` that ensures the same sequence of indices is produced with each iteration of the dataloader, even when those iterations occur multiple times. By passing a seed to a numpy random generator, the resulting indices will be consistent given the fixed seed. While not directly modifying the nature of the `DataLoader` it shows how to build a `Sampler` that provides more reproducible behavior across epochs.

To summarize the key point, the data passed through a dataloader when iterated multiple times is almost certainly not the same subset on each iteration. Unless you implement a custom `Sampler` it is not possible to have the same index ordering across different iterations of the `DataLoader`. While `SequentialSampler` will process data in the same order each time, the indices are generated anew with each iteration so the dataloader will iterate multiple times through the dataset if necessary.

For those seeking a deeper understanding of PyTorch data loading mechanisms, I recommend several resources. The official PyTorch documentation on data loading (`torch.utils.data`) provides an in-depth explanation of each component involved, including the `DataLoader`, various `Sampler` classes, and `Dataset`. The documentation clarifies how these pieces interact to provide data to the model during training or evaluation. There are also several tutorials covering data handling. In addition to the official documentation, there exist well-regarded practical guidebooks focused on deep learning. These usually have sections dedicated to data loading, explaining the various options and providing practical advice on common use cases. Finally, several community-driven websites and blogs offer specific use cases of custom samplers and more detailed information on specific topics that are often not covered by the documentation. These are very helpful for deeper understanding of less common scenarios and edge cases.
