Loading pre-trained weights into a TensorFlow Keras model is a critical step in leveraging transfer learning or deploying previously trained architectures.  The process hinges on aligning the structure of your model with the structure of the weights file, ensuring complete compatibility in terms of layer names, shapes, and data types.  Inconsistencies here will result in errors during the loading process. My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects has highlighted the importance of meticulous attention to these details.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The primary method for loading weights into a Keras model involves utilizing the `load_weights()` method. This function accepts a file path pointing to the weights file (typically a `.h5` file, although other formats are supported depending on the saving method).  However, the success of this operation is intrinsically tied to the architectural consistency between the model from which the weights were saved and the model into which they're being loaded.  Even a minor mismatch – a different number of layers, a change in layer activation function, or a discrepancy in layer output shapes – will prevent successful weight loading.

Keras uses a mechanism to map weights based on layer names. The `load_weights()` function sequentially compares the names of layers in the loaded model with the names in the weights file. A perfect match is required for each layer. If a layer name is present in the weights file but not in the loaded model, or vice-versa, the loading process will fail or produce incorrect results.  This makes careful naming conventions during model creation crucial.

Furthermore, the weights are loaded layer by layer. If a layer's shape in the loaded model differs from the shape in the saved weights, the loading process will halt with an error, specifying the incompatible layer. This highlights the significance of maintaining the same input shape, number of filters, kernel size, etc., throughout the architecture.  The data type of weights should also match between the saved weights and the loaded model.

Beyond `load_weights()`, there's the option of using `model.save()` and `load_model()`.  While `load_model()` offers the convenience of loading the entire model architecture and weights in one step, `load_weights()` provides more granular control, useful when you only need to load weights into a pre-existing model architecture.  This flexibility is especially valuable in transfer learning, where you might only want to load weights from certain layers, leaving others trainable from scratch.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Loading weights using `load_weights()` with a matching architecture:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model architecture.  Crucially, layer names must match the saved model.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), name='conv1'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='pool1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(name='flatten'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense')
])

# Load pre-trained weights.  Ensure the path is correct.
model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

# Verify weight loading – optional, but highly recommended.  Inspect the weights for some layers.
print(model.get_layer('conv1').get_weights())
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward loading of weights using `load_weights()`. The key is that the architecture defined here precisely mirrors the architecture from which `my_model_weights.h5` originated. Any deviation will lead to failure.


**Example 2: Handling potential exceptions:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') # Attempt to load the whole model
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    # Handle the exception appropriately – perhaps by creating a new model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([...]) # Define a new model if loading fails
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}")
    # Handle the case of mismatched layer names or shapes
    # Possible solutions: modify the architecture to match the weights or retrain the model
```

This improved example uses error handling to gracefully manage potential `OSError` (file not found) and `ValueError` (shape mismatch) exceptions, preventing abrupt program termination.  Robust error handling is essential in production environments.


**Example 3: Selective weight loading (transfer learning):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a new model with a different final layer, perhaps for a new task.
new_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), name='conv1'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='pool1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(name='flatten'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax', name='new_dense') # Different output layer
])

# Load weights from a pre-trained model.  Only weights for matching layers will be loaded.
pre_trained_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pre_trained_model.h5')
new_model.get_layer('conv1').set_weights(pre_trained_model.get_layer('conv1').get_weights())
new_model.get_layer('pool1').set_weights(pre_trained_model.get_layer('pool1').get_weights())

# The 'new_dense' layer weights will remain uninitialized.
#  They will be learned during training.
```

This example demonstrates the power of selective weight loading. We load weights only from specific layers of a pre-trained model, leaving others to be trained. This allows leveraging learned features from a related task while adapting the model to a new task.  Layer name consistency is still paramount.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on model saving and loading.  Thorough understanding of Keras layer naming conventions is crucial.  Consult introductory and advanced materials on deep learning and transfer learning for a broader context.  A well-structured deep learning textbook will cover these concepts in great depth.  Furthermore, exploring TensorFlow's tutorials and examples on GitHub will offer practical insights into various scenarios and techniques.  Finally, exploring community forums and Stack Overflow will expose you to a wealth of collective experience and troubleshooting strategies.
