The critical factor determining weight sharing across layers in a PyTorch network lies not in the network architecture's inherent structure, but in the explicit specification of the weight tensors used during the network's construction.  A standard sequential or module-based network, by default, does *not* share weights across layers.  Each layer independently instantiates its own weight parameters. This observation is rooted in my experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for image recognition tasks – instances where explicit weight sharing becomes a critical performance and memory optimization strategy.

My initial approach to addressing the weight-sharing question always centers on code inspection: specifically, examination of the `nn.Module` definition and how weight tensors are initialized and utilized across layers.  Let's clarify this with concrete examples.

**1.  No Weight Sharing (Default Behavior):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

# Example instantiation
net = MyNetwork(input_dim=10, hidden_dim=20, output_dim=5)
print(net.layer1.weight)
print(net.layer2.weight)

# Demonstrating distinct weight tensors
print(net.layer1.weight.data_ptr() == net.layer2.weight.data_ptr()) #False
```

In this example, `layer1` and `layer2` are independent `nn.Linear` layers. Each possesses its own unique weight tensor (`weight`) and bias tensor (`bias`), implicitly allocated by PyTorch. The final line explicitly demonstrates this by comparing the memory addresses of the weight tensors—they are distinct, confirming the lack of weight sharing. This is the typical, straightforward scenario.  In many applications, independent layers are preferred due to the capacity for learning diverse representations at each stage.

**2. Explicit Weight Sharing through Parameter Referencing:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.shared_weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_dim, input_dim))
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim, bias=False)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.layer1.weight = self.shared_weight

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

# Example instantiation
net = MyNetwork(input_dim=10, hidden_dim=20, output_dim=5)
print(net.layer1.weight)
print(net.layer2.weight)
print(net.layer1.weight.data_ptr() == net.shared_weight.data_ptr()) #True
print(net.layer1.weight.data_ptr() == net.layer2.weight.data_ptr()) #False

```

Here, weight sharing is explicitly enforced.  We create a `nn.Parameter` tensor, `shared_weight`, and then assign it to `layer1.weight`.  `layer2` retains its own independent weight.  This technique is advantageous when certain learned features should be consistently applied across layers, often seen in architectures leveraging a form of inductive bias. Importantly, note that only the weight is shared; biases remain independent. Directly manipulating the weight attribute in this manner requires careful consideration of gradients during backpropagation. The `bias=False` argument in `nn.Linear` is included to prevent an error related to mismatched dimensions in backpropagation.

**3. Weight Sharing Using a Single Layer with Repeated Forward Passes:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.shared_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.shared_layer(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.shared_layer(x)) #Apply shared layer again.
        x = self.output_layer(x)
        return x

# Example instantiation
net = MyNetwork(input_dim=10, hidden_dim=20, output_dim=5)
print(net.shared_layer.weight)
print(net.output_layer.weight)
print(net.shared_layer.weight.data_ptr() == net.output_layer.weight.data_ptr()) #False

```

This method achieves weight sharing indirectly by reusing a single layer multiple times within the `forward` pass.  Both passes through `shared_layer` utilize the same weight tensor, leading to the effective sharing of parameters.  This approach is memory-efficient but can limit the representational capacity of the network as the same weight matrix is used repeatedly.  The application depends heavily on the specific task and the degree of feature reusability desired.


In summary, while the underlying PyTorch framework does not inherently force weight sharing, it provides the necessary tools to implement it. Careful consideration of memory management, gradient flow, and architectural design choices are paramount when implementing explicit weight sharing. My experience suggests that while the concept is straightforward, the practical application requires detailed attention to avoid potential pitfalls during model training and inference.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The PyTorch documentation for `nn.Module` and related classes.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning architectures.  It should cover various optimization techniques.
*   A practical guide on implementing and optimizing neural networks using PyTorch.  Emphasis on the underlying mechanics of tensor operations and gradient computations would be beneficial.
