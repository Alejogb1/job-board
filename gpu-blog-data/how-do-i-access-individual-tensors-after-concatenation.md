The immutability of tensors post-concatenation necessitates a careful consideration of how to access the constituent tensors. Often, developers assume the concatenated tensor retains metadata about its origins, allowing direct indexing back into the source tensors. This is incorrect; concatenation creates a new, singular tensor without direct links to its components. The solution involves tracking the size and offsets of the original tensors before the concatenation occurs, using this information to programmatically slice the concatenated tensor.

Let's establish the fundamental principle: concatenation creates a new tensor by stacking the input tensors along a chosen dimension. Critically, this is a data operation; it does not preserve references to the original tensor structures. Instead, a unified block of memory is allocated, filled sequentially by the source tensor data. Therefore, subsequent access requires manual offset and size management of this new unified memory block.

Consider a scenario where I was building a time-series processing pipeline. I frequently concatenated batches of short time series observations into a larger time sequence for processing with a recurrent neural network. Initially, I made the mistake of assuming I could directly access the batches later by some clever indexing magic on the combined tensor. I was incorrect. It required me to revisit the data preprocessing strategy to store offsets.

To illustrate, letâ€™s examine a Python environment with a tensor library like PyTorch. The core issue stems from the fact that after:

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
concatenated_tensor = torch.cat((tensor1, tensor2), dim=0)

print(concatenated_tensor)
```

The output is a 4x2 tensor: `tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])`. There isn't a built-in mechanism to recover `tensor1` or `tensor2` directly from the concatenated tensor using an obvious method, such as a lookup function. Attempting `concatenated_tensor[0]` returns `tensor([1, 2])`, the first row, not the original `tensor1`. We must use offsets.

The solution involves meticulously tracking size information *before* concatenation. I achieve this by storing the cumulative size of tensors along the concatenation dimension. This allows us to calculate accurate start and end indices to slice the concatenated tensor and extract the desired constituent pieces.

Here's the first code example demonstrating this with a two-dimensional tensor:

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
tensor3 = torch.tensor([[9, 10], [11, 12]])


tensors_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]
concatenated_tensor = torch.cat(tensors_list, dim=0)

offsets = [0]
cumulative_size = 0

for tensor in tensors_list:
  cumulative_size += tensor.shape[0]
  offsets.append(cumulative_size)

print("Concatenated Tensor:\n", concatenated_tensor)
print("\nOffsets:", offsets)

extracted_tensors = []
for i in range(len(tensors_list)):
    start_index = offsets[i]
    end_index = offsets[i+1]
    extracted_tensors.append(concatenated_tensor[start_index:end_index])

print("\nExtracted Tensor 1:\n", extracted_tensors[0])
print("\nExtracted Tensor 2:\n", extracted_tensors[1])
print("\nExtracted Tensor 3:\n", extracted_tensors[2])
```

In this example, I initialize `offsets` with `0`, and then iterate through the input tensors, accumulating the size along the first dimension and append it to the offset list. This results in `offsets` of `[0, 2, 4, 6]`. Each of these represents the starting index of a tensor and the end of the last. Using slicing with `concatenated_tensor[offsets[i]:offsets[i+1]]` successfully extracts the original tensors.

The logic extends to higher dimensional tensors, but the axis along which we concatenate affects the indexing process. When I transitioned to processing image sequences in my work, the concatenation frequently occurred along the channel or the height dimension rather than the batch dimension. The logic for offset tracking and slicing needs to adapt accordingly.

Consider this second example, where concatenation is performed on a 3D tensor along the second dimension (width):

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
tensor2 = torch.randn(2, 2, 4)
tensor3 = torch.randn(2, 1, 4)

tensors_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]
concatenated_tensor = torch.cat(tensors_list, dim=1)


offsets = [0]
cumulative_size = 0

for tensor in tensors_list:
    cumulative_size += tensor.shape[1]
    offsets.append(cumulative_size)

print("Concatenated Tensor Shape:", concatenated_tensor.shape)
print("Offsets:", offsets)

extracted_tensors = []
for i in range(len(tensors_list)):
    start_index = offsets[i]
    end_index = offsets[i+1]
    extracted_tensors.append(concatenated_tensor[:, start_index:end_index, :])

print("\nExtracted Tensor 1 Shape:", extracted_tensors[0].shape)
print("Extracted Tensor 2 Shape:", extracted_tensors[1].shape)
print("Extracted Tensor 3 Shape:", extracted_tensors[2].shape)
```

Here, the `offsets` track the width dimension. I then slice by applying the offset to the second dimension by doing `concatenated_tensor[:, start_index:end_index, :]`, correctly extracting each of the original tensors, preserving the batch dimension and the depth.

Finally, the solution I found to this was to wrap this functionality into reusable functions and a custom data structure. This avoided errors and made the retrieval process a lot clearer to work with in a team environment.

Here is the final example demonstrating the use of a dictionary for more organized tracking of metadata for better long term maintainability. This approach was essential when the number of tensors to concatenate was variable.

```python
import torch

tensor1 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
tensor2 = torch.randn(2, 2, 4)
tensor3 = torch.randn(2, 1, 4)
tensor4 = torch.randn(2, 4, 4)


tensors_dict = {
    "tensor1": tensor1,
    "tensor2": tensor2,
    "tensor3": tensor3,
     "tensor4": tensor4
}

tensors_list = list(tensors_dict.values())
concatenated_tensor = torch.cat(tensors_list, dim=1)

offsets = {name: 0 for name in tensors_dict.keys()}
cumulative_size = 0

for name, tensor in tensors_dict.items():
    offsets[name] = cumulative_size
    cumulative_size += tensor.shape[1]

print("Concatenated Tensor Shape:", concatenated_tensor.shape)
print("Offsets:", offsets)

extracted_tensors = {}

for name, tensor in tensors_dict.items():
    start_index = offsets[name]
    end_index = start_index + tensor.shape[1]
    extracted_tensors[name] = concatenated_tensor[:, start_index:end_index, :]

print("\nExtracted Tensor 1 Shape:", extracted_tensors["tensor1"].shape)
print("Extracted Tensor 2 Shape:", extracted_tensors["tensor2"].shape)
print("Extracted Tensor 3 Shape:", extracted_tensors["tensor3"].shape)
print("Extracted Tensor 4 Shape:", extracted_tensors["tensor4"].shape)
```

In this version, I use a dictionary to track the offset and tensors, which makes it easier to identify tensors and maintain the code.

In practice, libraries provide utility functions to manage this explicitly for specific applications. These functions often track metadata implicitly while the user concatenates data. However, understanding the underlying manual method is important, particularly when dealing with novel data pipelines or custom models.

For further study, consider reading documentation on tensor manipulation libraries, specifically how they handle concatenation and data slicing. Also, reviewing best practices for data pre-processing and batching will highlight the importance of data provenance during processing pipelines. Understanding the mechanisms used in batching strategies will also aid in understanding this problem. Additionally, studying the design of custom data loading and processing pipelines in machine learning will deepen your intuition for how offsets and sizes are used in larger systems. These resources, though lacking explicit code demonstrations, offer a comprehensive overview of data handling in tensor processing contexts.
