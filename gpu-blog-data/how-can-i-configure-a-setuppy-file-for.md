Configuring a `setup.py` file for a package that depends on PyTorch involves careful management of dependencies and potential environment variations. My experience building and distributing several PyTorch-based deep learning libraries has shown that a naive approach can lead to installation failures, particularly when dealing with differing CUDA toolkits or CPU-only environments. The key lies in making the setup process both robust and flexible, handling both source and binary installations gracefully.

Specifically, the challenge is ensuring that the correct PyTorch package, potentially with CUDA support or its CPU-only counterpart, is installed as a dependency of your project. Further complexities arise when packaging for different operating systems and Python versions. Direct specification of `torch` in the `install_requires` field can lead to ambiguity, as it doesn’t differentiate between CPU and CUDA versions. Instead, the approach should be to infer the appropriate PyTorch package name based on the presence of CUDA or rely on environment variables for explicit control.

**Explanation of Best Practices**

The primary approach I advocate is leveraging the `torch` package’s `__version__` attribute to determine its installation status. This information helps us choose between a default CPU-only dependency, `torch`, and a CUDA-enabled one, such as `torch-cuda`, or any other platform-specific package. To achieve this, we employ a small snippet of code within `setup.py` that programmatically adjusts the dependency list before package installation.

The underlying concept is conditional package specification. If a CUDA-enabled PyTorch version is already installed, we might decide to explicitly depend on `torch-cuda` in the project's setup. Otherwise, we fall back to a CPU-only dependency. It's essential to note that simply specifying `torch` might not pull in the appropriate CUDA-enabled version automatically. It is better to manage these dependencies ourselves.

Additionally, it is important to account for cases where users might not have PyTorch pre-installed. In this scenario, it becomes crucial to specify a generic `torch` dependency to facilitate the installation of at least a CPU-only version. Furthermore, the approach I typically use also takes into account environment variables. For example, a variable like `TORCH_CUDA` can be employed to enforce a specific PyTorch variant regardless of whether CUDA is already present or not. This affords explicit user control over the dependency and avoids installation issues on machines where one does not need CUDA or, conversely, wants a specific CUDA version.

Beyond PyTorch dependency management, standard `setup.py` best practices should be adhered to, including defining package metadata, specifying the project's directory structure, and including non-Python files in the package. Package versioning should also follow semantic versioning and include development and release cycles appropriately. Finally, the `find_packages()` function is used to automatically locate all packages and subpackages within the project's directory structure, reducing manual setup effort.

**Code Examples with Commentary**

Below are three examples demonstrating how to configure `setup.py` files for PyTorch-dependent packages:

**Example 1: Basic Dependency Management (CPU-only)**

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
import os

def get_pytorch_dependency():
    try:
        import torch
        return ['torch'] # Only if torch is installed (CPU or CUDA)
    except ImportError:
        return ['torch']  # Provide the default CPU-only torch if missing


setup(
    name='my_pytorch_package',
    version='0.1.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=get_pytorch_dependency(),
    description='My PyTorch-based package.',
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
)

```

**Commentary on Example 1:**

This basic setup script uses a function `get_pytorch_dependency()` to check if PyTorch is already installed, using a simple `try/except` block. The return is the list containing `"torch"`. This ensures the user installs a basic `torch` package regardless of their hardware configuration. I generally start with this simple configuration when I am sure the package will be used mainly on CPUs, or when I am still testing the core functionality.

**Example 2: Dynamic CUDA Dependency Detection**

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
import os

def get_pytorch_dependency():
    try:
        import torch
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            return ['torch-cuda'] # Prefer CUDA variant if available
        else:
            return ['torch']  # Fallback to CPU variant
    except ImportError:
        return ['torch'] # Default to CPU variant


setup(
    name='my_pytorch_package',
    version='0.2.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=get_pytorch_dependency(),
    description='My PyTorch-based package with CUDA support.',
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
)
```

**Commentary on Example 2:**

This example introduces dynamic CUDA detection. The function `get_pytorch_dependency()` checks for the existence of CUDA by using `torch.cuda.is_available()`. If the function returns `True`, the function suggests `torch-cuda` as a dependency. This setup is useful for deploying a package that users with CUDA GPUs might benefit from. It handles cases where there is already an installed CUDA variant. I have found that this method is generally sufficient in most applications.

**Example 3: Environment Variable Control**

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
import os

def get_pytorch_dependency():
    if os.getenv('TORCH_CUDA', 'false').lower() == 'true':
       return ['torch-cuda']
    try:
        import torch
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
             return ['torch-cuda']
        else:
             return ['torch']
    except ImportError:
         return ['torch']


setup(
    name='my_pytorch_package',
    version='0.3.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=get_pytorch_dependency(),
    description='My PyTorch-based package with environment control.',
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
)

```

**Commentary on Example 3:**

This example demonstrates how to incorporate an environment variable to explicitly control which PyTorch package to install. The function `get_pytorch_dependency()` first checks for the presence of the `TORCH_CUDA` environment variable. If it is set to true, the CUDA variant, `torch-cuda` is suggested as dependency. Otherwise, the code runs the same logic as example 2 to attempt a CUDA install. The default still falls back to the CPU-only version. This allows for manual overriding in cases where the user needs a specific version, or when automatic CUDA detection fails. This approach is more complex but necessary when providing custom builds.

**Resource Recommendations**

To further enhance understanding and refine the package development process, consider exploring resources such as the official `setuptools` documentation. The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) provides detailed guidelines and best practices. The `torch` library's documentation also contains important details regarding installation and versioning. A close reading of those official sources, along with experimentation, will help improve PyTorch setup scripts. I have found that examining examples from other open-source PyTorch projects also provides valuable insights into the complexities and nuances of packaging.
