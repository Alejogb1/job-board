In TensorFlow Transform (tf.Transform), accurately estimating vocabulary size *before* applying the `tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary` function is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and computational efficiency. I've encountered several scenarios, particularly with large text datasets, where misjudging the vocabulary can lead to memory exhaustion during the transformation process or, conversely, wasteful pre-allocation of resources. The fundamental challenge lies in the deferred execution model of TensorFlow, where the actual computation, including vocabulary building, occurs during the execution of the TensorFlow graph, not during graph construction. Therefore, we cannot directly inspect the output of `tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary` or its internal operations to ascertain the vocabulary size beforehand. However, a few effective strategies exist to address this, each with its trade-offs.

The most common and generally applicable method involves utilizing `tf.data.Dataset` APIs to perform a preliminary scan of the data and count unique tokens. This approach operates outside the tf.Transform pipeline, allowing for a pre-computation step without affecting the transformation graph. This method requires an understanding of how your text data is tokenized which is an integral part of the transformation pipeline that needs to be specified and will directly impact the vocabulary size. The tokenizer chosen must align with that specified within the transform pipeline or be designed in such a way that the number of tokens will be the same as that computed by the tokenizer within the transform pipeline.  This can become complicated when using pre-built `tf.hub` text tokenizers where we would not want to build two separate and distinct tokenization pipelines. The approach provides a good initial estimate of the vocabulary, enabling informed decisions regarding vocabulary parameters during the tf.Transform phase.

Let me illustrate this with a code example. Assume we're dealing with a text dataset in a CSV file, where each line represents a document.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import csv
from collections import defaultdict

def estimate_vocabulary_size(filepath, delimiter=',', column_index=0, tokenizer=lambda text: text.split()):
  """Estimates vocabulary size from a text file.

  Args:
    filepath: Path to the input CSV file.
    delimiter: Delimiter character.
    column_index: Index of the text column.
    tokenizer: A function to tokenize the text.

  Returns:
    The estimated vocabulary size.
  """
  vocabulary = defaultdict(int)
  with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=delimiter)
    next(reader, None) # Skip header if present
    for row in reader:
      if row and len(row) > column_index:
        text = row[column_index]
        tokens = tokenizer(text)
        for token in tokens:
           vocabulary[token] +=1
  return len(vocabulary)

# Example usage:
FILE_PATH = 'my_text_data.csv' # Replace with your CSV file path
ESTIMATED_VOCAB_SIZE = estimate_vocabulary_size(FILE_PATH)
print(f"Estimated Vocabulary Size: {ESTIMATED_VOCAB_SIZE}")
```

In this code, the `estimate_vocabulary_size` function reads the CSV file, extracts the text column, and employs a provided tokenizer to break down the text into tokens. A defaultdict effectively keeps count of unique tokens encountered during the scan. The final length of the dictionary represents the estimated vocabulary size. This assumes a very simple tokenization scheme using `text.split()` but this would be easily updated to accommodate a different tokenization methodology. Critically, this estimation happens *before* any tf.Transform function is invoked. This allows us to iterate quickly and test the performance of tokenizers.

Another scenario frequently arises when working with extremely large datasets that do not fit into memory, making direct iteration impractical. For such cases, we can leverage `tf.data.Dataset` capabilities to create an efficient data pipeline, processing the data in chunks and only keeping track of the unique tokens using the hash function. This approach limits the data kept in memory while providing a reasonably accurate estimate of the vocabulary size. It can be less computationally intensive than iterating over large files directly when files are stored using the TFRecords format, which is the typical way of storing datasets for large-scale distributed training.

Here's a demonstration of how to implement this strategy:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import hashlib

def estimate_vocabulary_size_tf(filepath, batch_size=1000, column_index=0, tokenizer=lambda text: text.split()):
    """Estimates vocabulary size using tf.data.Dataset."""
    def _process_line(line):
       decoded_line = tf.io.decode_csv(line, [tf.string] * (column_index + 1))[column_index]
       tokens = tf.strings.split(decoded_line).to_tensor()
       return tokens
    
    dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset(filepath)
    dataset = dataset.skip(1)
    dataset = dataset.map(_process_line)
    dataset = dataset.unbatch()
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)

    vocabulary_set = set()
    for batch in dataset:
        for token in batch.numpy().flatten():
            hashed_token = hashlib.sha256(token).hexdigest()
            vocabulary_set.add(hashed_token)

    return len(vocabulary_set)


FILE_PATH = 'my_text_data.csv' # Replace with your CSV file path
BATCH_SIZE = 1000  # Adjust based on your resources
ESTIMATED_VOCAB_SIZE_TF = estimate_vocabulary_size_tf(FILE_PATH, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
print(f"Estimated Vocabulary Size (TF): {ESTIMATED_VOCAB_SIZE_TF}")
```

In this example, we leverage `tf.data.TextLineDataset` to read the data efficiently and in batches. The tokenization is performed using  `tf.strings.split`, which offers some optimizations for tensor operations. The unique tokens are captured as a hash string which are then placed into a Python `set` data type. Because the hash is an injective function, there is no collision of the strings. This is a common method for extracting unique data from massive text datasets. This approach scales well to large datasets and can be readily integrated into TensorFlow workflows. This method is also beneficial because it uses the `tf.string` operations which will ensure the tokenization method matches that computed in the `tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary` method, as long as the `tokenizer_fn` is set to use `tf.string.split` or something analogous.

Finally, in cases where an approximate estimate is sufficient and speed is prioritized over absolute accuracy, sampling can provide a reasonably close estimate with significantly reduced processing time. This method, while inherently probabilistic, can be very beneficial when exploring a dataset and determining hyperparameter ranges. The idea is to randomly sample a subset of your data and estimate the vocabulary from this subset. The resulting estimation can be biased, depending on how the samples are chosen. However, for very large datasets the approximation can be within an acceptable range for parameter selection.

Let us consider how that might look, again in code.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import random

def estimate_vocabulary_size_sample(filepath, sample_size=1000, column_index=0, tokenizer=lambda text: text.split()):
    """Estimates vocabulary size using a sample of the dataset."""
    
    lines = []
    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        next(file)
        for line in file:
            lines.append(line)

    if len(lines) == 0:
        return 0
            
    sampled_lines = random.sample(lines, min(sample_size,len(lines)))

    vocabulary = set()
    for line in sampled_lines:
        text = line.strip().split(',')[column_index] # Assumes csv
        tokens = tokenizer(text)
        vocabulary.update(tokens)
    return len(vocabulary)


FILE_PATH = 'my_text_data.csv' # Replace with your CSV file path
SAMPLE_SIZE = 1000  # Adjust as needed
ESTIMATED_VOCAB_SIZE_SAMPLE = estimate_vocabulary_size_sample(FILE_PATH, sample_size=SAMPLE_SIZE)
print(f"Estimated Vocabulary Size (Sample): {ESTIMATED_VOCAB_SIZE_SAMPLE}")
```

In this instance, we sample `sample_size` number of records from the text dataset and proceed to tokenize them, adding them to a `set` data structure. Because the sample is a subset of the data we should expect the vocabulary size to be an underestimate of the true vocabulary size. However, the approximation may be sufficient for determining whether or not the total vocabulary size will fit into the allotted memory.

For further exploration and refinement, I would recommend referring to documentation for `tf.data.Dataset`, focusing on the `TextLineDataset`, `map`, `batch`, and `unbatch` methods.  Detailed reading on the TensorFlow string operations, in particular `tf.strings.split` and the `tf.io` API will also be of value.  Lastly, researching various hashing techniques, and their performance, will help optimize the set-based extraction method if it is used. Each of these resources provides insight into effectively preprocessing and understanding your data before building a final production-ready pipeline. The methods described, while not providing an exact size, are useful for optimizing resources and preventing failures.
