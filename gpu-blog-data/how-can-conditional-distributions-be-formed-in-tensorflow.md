TensorFlow Probability (TFP) doesn't directly offer a single function to construct "conditional distributions" in the way one might intuitively imagine,  like a function taking a base distribution and a conditional statement. Instead, the approach involves leveraging TFP's tools for constructing joint distributions and then marginalizing or conditioning using its inference capabilities.  My experience working on Bayesian network models and time series forecasting heavily utilizes this approach, and understanding the underlying principles is crucial for effective application.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core concept rests on the fact that a conditional distribution, P(X|Y=y), is inherently a function of the observed value *y*.  We don't define it directly but rather derive it from the joint distribution, P(X, Y).  TFP facilitates this through the definition of joint distributions using either `tfp.distributions.JointDistributionSequential` or `tfp.distributions.JointDistributionNamed`. Once the joint distribution is defined, the conditional distribution emerges implicitly through sampling or inference methods.  Specifically, we can sample from the conditional distribution P(X|Y=y) by conditioning the joint distribution on the observation Y=y and then sampling from the remaining variables.  Alternatively, inference methods can approximate the conditional distribution by leveraging the joint distribution's properties. This is especially relevant for complex scenarios where direct analytical solutions are intractable.

The choice between `JointDistributionSequential` and `JointDistributionNamed` depends on the structure of your problem.  `JointDistributionSequential` is ideal for cases where the dependency structure is naturally sequential, while `JointDistributionNamed` offers greater flexibility for arbitrarily structured dependencies by using named variables. Both achieve the same underlying goal â€“ creating a mechanism to infer the conditional distribution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Gaussian Conditional**

This example demonstrates a simple conditional distribution where X is conditionally Gaussian given Y.  The joint distribution is defined using `JointDistributionSequential`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define the conditional distribution parameters.
mu_x_given_y = lambda y: 2.0 * y  # Mean of X given Y
sigma_x_given_y = lambda y: 1.0   # Standard deviation of X given Y
mu_y = 0.0
sigma_y = 1.0


def make_joint_distribution():
    return tfd.JointDistributionSequential([
        tfd.Normal(loc=mu_y, scale=sigma_y),  # Prior on Y
        lambda y: tfd.Normal(loc=mu_x_given_y(y), scale=sigma_x_given_y(y))  # Conditional on Y
    ])


joint_dist = make_joint_distribution()

# Sample from the joint distribution.
samples = joint_dist.sample(1000)
y_samples = samples[0]
x_samples = samples[1]


#Condition on a specific value of Y (e.g., Y=2)
conditioned_dist = joint_dist.experimental_pin(value={'tfd_normal_0': tf.constant(2.0)})


# Sample from the conditional distribution given Y=2
conditional_samples = conditioned_dist.sample(1000)

#Note: conditional_samples only contains the samples from X since Y is fixed.
```

This code defines a joint distribution where Y is a normal distribution, and X is a normal distribution whose mean depends linearly on Y.  By `experimental_pin`, we effectively "condition" the joint distribution on a specific value of Y, yielding samples from the conditional distribution of X given Y=2.


**Example 2:  Multivariate Gaussian with Covariance Matrix**

This extends the previous example to a multivariate Gaussian, demonstrating a more complex dependency structure. We'll use `JointDistributionNamed` for better clarity.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import numpy as np

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define the covariance matrix
cov = np.array([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 1.0]])
mean = np.array([0.0, 0.0])


def make_mvn_joint():
    return tfd.JointDistributionNamed({
        'x': tfd.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance(loc=mean, covariance_matrix=cov),
        'y': lambda x: tfd.Normal(loc=x, scale=1.0)
    })

joint_dist = make_mvn_joint()

# Sample from the joint distribution.
samples = joint_dist.sample(1000)
x_samples = samples['x']
y_samples = samples['y']

#Condition on a specific value of x (e.g., x = [1, 1])
conditioned_dist = joint_dist.experimental_pin(value={'x': tf.constant([1.0, 1.0])})

#Sample from the conditional distribution given x = [1, 1]
conditional_samples = conditioned_dist.sample(1000)

#Note: conditional_samples only contains the sample from y as x is fixed.
```
Here, the joint distribution consists of a bivariate normal distribution and a conditional normal distribution dependent on the first variable in the MVN. Conditioning is again achieved via `experimental_pin`.


**Example 3:  Discrete Conditional**

This example illustrates conditional distributions involving discrete variables, showcasing the flexibility of TFP.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a categorical distribution for Y
y_probs = tf.constant([0.3, 0.7])
y_dist = tfd.Categorical(probs=y_probs)

#Define conditional distributions for X given Y
def make_conditional_x(y):
  if tf.equal(y,0):
      return tfd.Bernoulli(probs=0.2)
  else:
      return tfd.Bernoulli(probs=0.8)

def make_joint_distribution():
    return tfd.JointDistributionSequential([
        y_dist,
        make_conditional_x
    ])

joint_dist = make_joint_distribution()

# Sample from the joint distribution
samples = joint_dist.sample(1000)
y_samples = samples[0]
x_samples = samples[1]

# Condition on Y=1
conditioned_dist = joint_dist.experimental_pin(value={'tfd_categorical_0': tf.constant(1)})
conditional_samples = conditioned_dist.sample(1000)
```

This demonstrates conditioning a Bernoulli distribution on a categorical variable. This highlights TFP's capability to handle various distribution types within a joint model.

In summary, forming conditional distributions in TFP involves defining joint distributions and leveraging the `experimental_pin` method to fix the values of specific variables. This allows for efficient sampling and inference from conditional distributions, even for complex, high-dimensional problems.  Remember to select the appropriate `JointDistribution` type based on your specific dependency structure.  The examples provided illustrate this process across various distribution families, highlighting the versatility of the approach.
