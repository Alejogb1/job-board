The inability of Keras symbolic tensors to directly compute their length stems from their fundamentally deferred execution nature.  Unlike NumPy arrays, which are immediately evaluated and stored in memory, Keras symbolic tensors represent computational graphs. Their shape and size aren't known until the graph is executed during the model's training or inference phase.  This is a core design principle facilitating automatic differentiation and efficient hardware acceleration.  In my experience developing large-scale NLP models at a major tech firm, grappling with this characteristic was a frequent occurrence, especially when dealing with variable-length sequences.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Keras employs a symbolic computation paradigm, relying on TensorFlow or Theano as backend engines.  A symbolic tensor isn't a concrete array of numbers; it's a placeholder representing a potential array.  Its shape is defined as a symbolic object, often involving placeholders or symbolic variables representing batch size, sequence length, or other dimensions.  These symbolic dimensions are not evaluated until the model is executed.  Attempting to determine the length of a symbolic tensor using standard Python `len()` or other similar functions will fail because these functions operate on concrete data structures, not symbolic representations.  The runtime environment, be it TensorFlow or Theano, needs to instantiate the tensor with concrete values before its length can be determined.

This deferred execution is crucial for several reasons:

* **Flexibility:** It allows Keras to handle variable-length sequences, a common requirement in natural language processing and time series analysis. The model can process batches of sequences with varying lengths without requiring padding to a fixed maximum length (although padding is often employed for optimization reasons).
* **Automatic Differentiation:** The symbolic representation enables efficient automatic differentiation, a cornerstone of deep learning optimization algorithms like backpropagation. The computational graph facilitates the calculation of gradients.
* **Hardware Acceleration:**  The symbolic representation allows for optimization and execution on specialized hardware, such as GPUs, where the operations are compiled and executed more efficiently.

Therefore, obtaining the length of a symbolic tensor requires triggering the execution of the computational graph, either implicitly by feeding data to a Keras model or explicitly using session-related functions (deprecated in more recent Keras versions).

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Attempt**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

input_tensor = K.placeholder(shape=(None, 10)) # Symbolic tensor with unknown batch size

try:
    length = len(input_tensor)
    print(f"Length: {length}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This code will result in a `TypeError` because `len()` expects a sequence-like object, not a Keras symbolic tensor.

**Example 2: Correct Approach using `tf.shape` (TensorFlow backend)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

input_tensor = K.placeholder(shape=(None, 10))
batch_size = tf.shape(input_tensor)[0] # Get batch size dynamically
# This is not the length of a single sample; it's the number of samples in the batch

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Need to feed data to execute the graph and obtain the batch size.
    batch_input = tf.random.normal((5, 10))  # Example batch of data
    batch_size_value = sess.run(batch_size, feed_dict={input_tensor: batch_input})
    print(f"Batch size: {batch_size_value}")

```

This example demonstrates getting the batch size, which is the number of samples, using `tf.shape`.  Note that it requires feeding sample data and executing the graph in a session. The session is necessary for evaluating tensor shapes. The approach is specifically tailored for TensorFlow.

**Example 3: Obtaining sequence length within a custom layer (assuming variable-length sequences)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class SequenceLengthLayer(Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Assuming inputs is a 3D tensor (batch_size, sequence_length, features)
        sequence_length = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
        return sequence_length

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(None, 10)), # Variable-length input sequences
    SequenceLengthLayer(),
    keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.cast(x, tf.int32)) # Ensure integer output
])

# Dummy data with varying sequence lengths
input_data = tf.ragged.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8,9]],dtype=tf.float32)
input_data = input_data.to_tensor(shape=[None,None,10], default_value=0)


result = model(input_data)
print(result) # Output tensor containing sequence lengths for each sample

```

This illustrates calculating the sequence length within a custom Keras layer.  It leverages `tf.shape` to obtain the length dimension of the input tensor.  This approach is particularly relevant when processing variable-length sequences where you need to compute sequence lengths for individual samples within the model itself. Note the use of ragged tensors and padding for variable-length input to a layer expecting 3D tensors.  The Lambda layer ensures the result is cast to the appropriate integer type.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I strongly suggest consulting the official TensorFlow and Keras documentation.  The Keras API reference provides detailed explanations of functions and layers.  Additionally, a good understanding of graph computation and TensorFlow's computational graph mechanism is highly valuable.  Exploring resources on symbolic computation and automatic differentiation will enhance your grasp of the underlying principles.  Finally, working through tutorials and examples involving variable-length sequence processing in Keras will reinforce your understanding of these concepts in practice.  These combined resources offer a robust foundation for comprehending the intricacies of Keras symbolic tensors.
