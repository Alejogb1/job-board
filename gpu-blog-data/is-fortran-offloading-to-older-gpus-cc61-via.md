The feasibility of offloading Fortran code to older Compute Capability 6.1 (CC61) GPUs using `nvfortran` hinges on specific compiler and driver versions, and limitations inherent in both the architecture and software.  My experience building and maintaining scientific computing codes reliant on GPU acceleration over the past decade has highlighted the challenges encountered when dealing with legacy hardware and their associated software support.  While `nvfortran` can target a range of GPU architectures, support for older generations, such as those with CC 6.1, is not universally guaranteed or consistently reliable.

The crucial consideration is the interplay between the compiler's target architecture, the CUDA toolkit version, and the specific driver installed on the system.  `nvfortran`, part of the NVIDIA HPC SDK, relies on CUDA to manage the low-level details of GPU execution. Compilers like `nvfortran` must be explicitly configured to target a particular architecture through compiler flags; using flags for newer architectures would generate machine code that is simply incompatible with the older CC 6.1 GPU, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Moreover, older GPU architectures are typically not tested in later NVIDIA HPC SDK and CUDA releases which increases the likelihood of unexpected compiler behaviors or bugs in the generated code. I will be addressing the specifics of how `nvfortran` might still be used, or not used, with a CC61 GPU, rather than a complete history of GPU architectures.

The primary limitation arises from the architectural differences between newer and older GPUs.  CC 6.1 GPUs, such as those based on the Pascal architecture, have a different instruction set and memory model compared to more recent architectures like Volta, Ampere, or Hopper.  This directly impacts how the compiler translates high-level Fortran code into GPU machine code.  While the basic concept of offloading via directives like `!$acc` or `!$omp` remains consistent, the underlying implementation differs. Newer CUDA releases may drop support for the generation of machine code for older architectures.  Specifically, newer `nvfortran` versions might no longer include the required back-end tools or library support for targeting the CC 6.1 architecture.

Let's illustrate with some concrete examples, beginning with a simple kernel that performs a vector addition, first with older compiler flags, and then how to see if modern compiler flags would work:

**Example 1: Targeting CC 6.1 using older `nvfortran` compiler flags (hypothetical, assumes `nvfortran` supports CC6.1 with old enough version)**

```fortran
program vector_add
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: n = 1024
  real, dimension(n) :: a, b, c
  integer :: i

  !$acc data copyin(a,b), copyout(c)
  !$acc parallel loop
  do i = 1, n
    c(i) = a(i) + b(i)
  end do
  !$acc end data

  print *, "Vector addition complete"

end program vector_add
```

The compilation command would need to explicitly specify the target architecture via compiler flags (assuming we could get this to work with an older compiler and libraries):

```bash
nvfortran -acc -gpu=cc61 -Minfo=accel vector_add.f90 -o vector_add_cc61
```

The `-acc` flag enables OpenACC directive processing, the `-gpu=cc61` flag instructs the compiler to generate code for the Compute Capability 6.1 architecture, and `-Minfo=accel` instructs the compiler to output information about generated code to the screen. If the compiler successfully targets CC 6.1, the output will contain messages confirming the offloading.

**Example 2: Attempting to Compile with Modern Flags, and the Failure Scenario**

Let's say I'm using a more modern compiler (let's say it is from the past two years) and we attempt to use this code:

```fortran
program vector_add_newer
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: n = 1024
  real, dimension(n) :: a, b, c
  integer :: i

  !$acc data copyin(a,b), copyout(c)
  !$acc parallel loop
  do i = 1, n
    c(i) = a(i) + b(i)
  end do
  !$acc end data

  print *, "Vector addition complete"

end program vector_add_newer
```
Attempting to compile with a modern `-gpu` flag:

```bash
nvfortran -acc -gpu=cc80 -Minfo=accel vector_add_newer.f90 -o vector_add_newer_cc80
```

In this case, even if the compilation is successful (and it might generate code for the host CPU), the generated code will not run on a CC 6.1 GPU. The architecture mismatch will cause a runtime error or failure to load the kernel onto the device. The compiler might output a warning or an error about unsupported or not applicable GPU capabilities or the absence of a suitable device at runtime.

**Example 3: Explicitly targeting a CPU fallback if CC 6.1 isn't feasible**

If the compiler or underlying CUDA support doesnâ€™t exist for CC 6.1, you'd need to implement a fallback mechanism to ensure the application still runs, albeit slower, on the CPU:

```fortran
program vector_add_fallback
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: n = 1024
  real, dimension(n) :: a, b, c
  integer :: i

  !$acc data copyin(a,b), copyout(c) if(present(.gpu))
  !$acc parallel loop if(present(.gpu))
  do i = 1, n
    c(i) = a(i) + b(i)
  end do
  !$acc end data if(present(.gpu))

  if(.not.present(.gpu)) then
     do i = 1, n
        c(i) = a(i) + b(i)
     end do
  end if

  print *, "Vector addition complete"
end program vector_add_fallback
```

Compilation with modern flags would still be attempted, but the runtime check `present(.gpu)` (a simplified version of runtime checking for GPU availability) dictates whether the CPU or GPU code path is taken.  Compilation:

```bash
nvfortran -acc -gpu=cc80 -Minfo=accel vector_add_fallback.f90 -o vector_add_fallback_cc80
```

This approach allows the program to function regardless of GPU availability, even if the primary acceleration mechanism is not accessible on the older GPU. We explicitly check to see if the GPU was used during runtime via the `.gpu` parameter.

**Recommendations and Further Considerations:**

Given the challenges and potential limitations of targeting older architectures, here are some recommendations based on my experiences:

1.  **Compiler Version Compatibility:**  Prioritize using older versions of the NVIDIA HPC SDK and matching CUDA Toolkit that explicitly supported CC 6.1 if you absolutely must target that hardware. Consult the release notes for the `nvfortran` compiler (which is part of the NVIDIA HPC SDK) and for CUDA toolkit to check which architectures are supported and the required driver versions.  The release notes will contain compatibility matrices, which is the definitive document to understand compiler support for target architectures.
2.  **Runtime Checks:** Implement conditional execution of GPU kernels using OpenACC clauses like `if(present(.gpu))` or OpenMP equivalents.  This is critical for ensuring fallback to a host CPU implementation when a suitable GPU target isn't available or when the user is running on machines without GPUs. Such checks are often coupled to runtime driver checks to ensure that the expected driver version has been loaded in the runtime environment.
3.  **Performance Benchmarking:** Be mindful that even if you can compile and run code on CC 6.1, performance might be significantly lower than on newer architectures due to the inherent hardware limitations. Conduct thorough benchmarking and performance analysis to identify bottlenecks and explore optimizations specific to the older architecture if you're dealing with high-performance scenarios. Often, a significant effort in GPU-based code is not about getting it to work on a single architecture but in achieving suitable levels of performance; this is a good reminder that one must benchmark.
4.  **Alternatives:** Evaluate if newer hardware is an option.  The cost/benefit ratio of supporting extremely old hardware is often unfavorable for production use, especially when newer GPUs offer both significant performance gains and improved software support. For personal or development work, it is often more pragmatic to upgrade rather than spend time troubleshooting legacy infrastructure.

In conclusion, while `nvfortran` has the potential to offload computations to CC 6.1 GPUs, achieving this reliably requires careful consideration of compiler versions, target architecture flags, and the underlying CUDA toolkit and driver support. If it is determined that there is no support for a specific architecture with a specific compiler, code will need to be reconfigured so that there is a fallback path.  A robust approach will almost certainly involve conditional execution paths and thorough testing, emphasizing the complexities of maintaining and deploying GPU-accelerated applications across various hardware generations.  The user should always seek out the compatibility matrix released by the software provider for an authoritative answer.
