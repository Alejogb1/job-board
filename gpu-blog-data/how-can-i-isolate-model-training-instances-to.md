Achieving evaluation accuracy exceeding 100% isn't inherently possible with standard classification metrics like accuracy.  Accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified instances;  a value above 100% is mathematically nonsensical.  The phrasing of the question suggests a misunderstanding of the metric itself or a problem with the data handling and evaluation methodology.  The goal should be to maximize accuracy within the 0-100% range, focusing on consistency and identifying sources of error that prevent reaching the desired level of performance. My experience working on similar challenges in medical image analysis – specifically, lesion detection in CT scans – revealed this frequently overlooked detail.  The key lies in rigorous data partitioning, robust validation techniques, and careful consideration of overfitting.


**1. Data Partitioning and Stratification:** Inconsistent evaluation accuracy points to potential issues with data splits. Random splitting, while seemingly simple, can introduce bias if the dataset isn't uniformly distributed across classes. This leads to some folds containing disproportionately more difficult or less representative samples.  Therefore, stratified sampling is crucial. This technique ensures that each fold maintains a similar class distribution to the overall dataset.  This is especially important with imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers others.

**2. Robust Validation Techniques:**  Simply splitting data into training, validation, and test sets is insufficient.  Employing cross-validation methods significantly reduces the risk of overfitting to a particular train-validation split.  K-fold cross-validation, for example, divides the data into K folds.  The model is trained K times, each time using a different fold for validation and the remaining K-1 folds for training.  The final performance metric is the average across all K folds. This approach provides a more robust estimate of model generalization capability.  I've found 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation to be quite effective in many scenarios, particularly with limited datasets.  Furthermore, using techniques like nested cross-validation can help further refine the model's hyperparameters and reduce bias.

**3. Addressing Overfitting and Underfitting:** Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including noise and peculiarities specific to that subset, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Conversely, underfitting implies the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data.  Regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping, are invaluable tools for combating overfitting.  Appropriate model complexity is equally vital.  A deeper or more complex model is not always superior.  Starting with a simpler architecture and gradually increasing complexity based on performance trends is a methodical approach.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation in Python (Scikit-learn):**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Generate sample data (replace with your actual data loading)
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=28*28, n_informative=20, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)
X = X.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) # Reshape for CNN input

# Define CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Stratified K-Fold
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
accuracies = []

for train_index, val_index in skf.split(X, y):
    X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), verbose=0)
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val, verbose=0)
    accuracies.append(accuracy)

print(f"Average accuracy across folds: {np.mean(accuracies)}")
```

This example demonstrates a basic CNN with stratified K-fold cross-validation.  Remember to replace the sample data generation with your own data loading and preprocessing.  The choice of epochs and other hyperparameters requires careful tuning.


**Example 2: Implementing L2 Regularization:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2

# Modify the CNN model from Example 1 to include L2 regularization:
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01), input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# ...rest of the code remains the same
```

This example adds L2 regularization to the convolutional and dense layers. The `kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)` argument adds a penalty to the loss function proportional to the square of the weight magnitudes, discouraging large weights and preventing overfitting. The regularization strength (0.01 in this case) is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned.


**Example 3: Early Stopping:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# ... (model definition from Example 1 or 2) ...

early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping], verbose=0)
# ...rest of the code remains the same
```

Early stopping is a powerful technique that monitors a validation metric (here, `val_loss`) and stops training when the metric stops improving for a specified number of epochs (`patience=3`).  `restore_best_weights=True` ensures that the model weights corresponding to the best validation performance are retained.

By implementing stratified data partitioning, robust cross-validation, and techniques to mitigate overfitting, you can significantly improve the consistency and accuracy of your CNN model's evaluation. Remember that exceeding 100% accuracy is impossible with standard metrics; focus on maximizing accuracy within its valid range.  Careful consideration of these factors based on your specific dataset and problem will yield much more reliable and meaningful results.
