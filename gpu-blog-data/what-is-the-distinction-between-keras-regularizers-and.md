The core difference between Keras regularizers and constraints lies in their application and impact on model weights during training.  Regularizers modify the loss function, indirectly influencing weight values through gradient descent, while constraints directly clip or project weight values after each gradient update.  This seemingly subtle distinction leads to significant differences in their practical application and effect on model generalization and performance.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition and natural language processing projects has highlighted these nuances repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras regularizers, such as L1 and L2 regularization, add penalty terms to the loss function. These penalties are proportional to the magnitude of the model's weights.  L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights (∑|w|), encouraging sparsity by driving some weights to zero. L2 regularization, conversely, adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights (∑w²), discouraging large weights and promoting smaller, more distributed weight values.  The impact of these penalties is indirect; they influence the gradient descent process, leading to smaller weight updates and ultimately a different set of learned weights than a model without regularization.

Keras constraints, on the other hand, operate directly on the weights after each gradient update.  They enforce specific bounds or conditions on the weights, regardless of the loss function.  Common constraints include `MinMaxNorm`, which clips weights to a specified range (e.g., between -1 and 1), `UnitNorm`, which normalizes the weights to have a unit norm (magnitude of 1), and `NonNeg`, which forces weights to be non-negative.  The constraints are applied deterministically, irrespective of the gradient's direction or magnitude.

The choice between regularizers and constraints depends on the specific problem and desired properties of the model. Regularizers are generally preferred for preventing overfitting by encouraging smaller and/or sparser weights, thereby reducing the model's complexity and improving generalization.  Constraints are more suitable when specific structural properties of the weights are required, such as non-negativity in certain applications or when preventing weights from becoming excessively large, leading to numerical instability.  Furthermore, combining both regularization and constraints can be effective in some scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: L2 Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(0.01), input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the use of L2 regularization on a dense layer.  The `kernel_regularizer` argument specifies the regularization term.  `keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)` applies L2 regularization with a regularization strength of 0.01.  This adds a penalty proportional to the sum of squares of the kernel weights to the loss function during training. The effect is to shrink the weights towards zero, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.  I've used this extensively in image classification tasks to mitigate the risk of overfitting to noisy training data.


**Example 2:  MinMaxNorm Constraint**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_constraint=keras.constraints.MinMaxNorm(min_value=-1.0, max_value=1.0), input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, a `MinMaxNorm` constraint is applied to the kernel weights of a dense layer.  `keras.constraints.MinMaxNorm(min_value=-1.0, max_value=1.0)` ensures that all weights remain within the range [-1, 1] after each training update.  This constraint is useful for stabilizing training and preventing weights from exploding, particularly in recurrent neural networks where unbounded weights can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients.  I've found this particularly helpful in dealing with instability in long sequence processing within NLP models.


**Example 3: Combining Regularization and Constraints**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l1(0.001), kernel_constraint=keras.constraints.NonNeg(), input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example combines L1 regularization with a `NonNeg` constraint. L1 regularization encourages sparsity, while the constraint forces all weights to be non-negative. This combination can be beneficial in scenarios where non-negative weights are desired (e.g., certain probabilistic models) and where sparsity is also beneficial for interpretability or computational efficiency.  I have successfully utilized this approach in recommender systems where the weights represent positive affinities between users and items, and sparsity aids in reducing computational load and enhancing the system's interpretability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly sections on layers and regularizers/constraints, provides a thorough explanation of their functionalities and usage.  Furthermore, standard machine learning textbooks that cover regularization techniques and neural network architectures would provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Finally, reviewing research papers focusing on specific applications of regularizers and constraints can offer valuable insights into practical considerations and best practices.
