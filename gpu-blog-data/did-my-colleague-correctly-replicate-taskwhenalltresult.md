The core functionality of `Task.WhenAll<TResult>` hinges on its ability to correctly handle exceptions thrown by constituent tasks.  A naive implementation might simply wait for all tasks to complete and then aggregate results, but this misses the crucial aspect of exception propagation and handling. In my experience debugging asynchronous operations across large-scale distributed systems, overlooking this nuance frequently led to unpredictable behavior and difficult-to-track errors.  Therefore, a correct replication must faithfully mirror this exception-handling behavior.

My colleague's implementation needs rigorous evaluation against several test cases to verify its accuracy.  Simply achieving functional equivalence for successful completions is insufficient; the crucial differentiator lies in how exceptions are managed.  The following analysis considers different scenarios and demonstrates the expected behavior using C#.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`Task.WhenAll<TResult>` accepts an array of `Task<TResult>` objects.  It returns a new `Task<TResult[]>` that represents the completion of all input tasks.  The returned task completes successfully only if all input tasks complete successfully.  Crucially, if *any* input task throws an exception, the returned task will transition to a faulted state, aggregating the exception(s).  This aggregated exception usually manifests as an `AggregateException`, containing the exceptions from all failed tasks.  The crucial distinction from a simple `await` loop over individual tasks is the centralized exception handling provided by `WhenAll`. A correct implementation must capture and re-throw or otherwise handle this `AggregateException` consistently.  Failure to do so represents a significant deviation from the intended behavior.  Furthermore, the order of exceptions within the `AggregateException` should generally reflect the order of the tasks in the input array, though the exact specification might vary slightly across .NET versions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: All Tasks Succeed**

```csharp
async Task Example1()
{
    var tasks = new[]
    {
        Task.FromResult(1),
        Task.FromResult(2),
        Task.FromResult(3)
    };

    try
    {
        var results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Results: {string.Join(", ", results)}"); // Output: Results: 1, 2, 3
    }
    catch (AggregateException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

This example showcases the basic functionality.  All tasks complete successfully, and `WhenAll` returns an array containing the results. The `try-catch` block is included for completeness, although it won't be executed in this scenario.  This is the baseline against which more complex scenarios must be compared.

**Example 2: One Task Fails**

```csharp
async Task Example2()
{
    var tasks = new[]
    {
        Task.FromResult(1),
        Task.FromException<int>(new InvalidOperationException("Task 2 failed")),
        Task.FromResult(3)
    };

    try
    {
        var results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Results: {string.Join(", ", results)}");
    }
    catch (AggregateException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}"); // Output: Exception: One or more errors occurred. (Inner exceptions may contain more details.)
        foreach (var innerException in ex.InnerExceptions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Inner Exception: {innerException.Message}"); // Output: Inner Exception: Task 2 failed
        }
    }
}
```

This is a critical test. One task throws an exception. The `WhenAll` task will transition to a faulted state, and the `catch` block will handle the `AggregateException`.  The crucial aspect here is that the `AggregateException` contains the `InvalidOperationException` from the failing task.  The colleague's implementation must accurately capture and expose this nested exception.

**Example 3: Multiple Tasks Fail**

```csharp
async Task Example3()
{
    var tasks = new[]
    {
        Task.FromResult(1),
        Task.FromException<int>(new ArgumentNullException("Task 2 failed")),
        Task.FromException<int>(new TimeoutException("Task 3 timed out"))
    };

    try
    {
        var results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"Results: {string.Join(", ", results)}");
    }
    catch (AggregateException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}"); // Output: Exception: One or more errors occurred. (Inner exceptions may contain more details.)
        foreach (var innerException in ex.InnerExceptions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Inner Exception: {innerException.Message}"); // Output: Inner Exception: Task 2 failed, Inner Exception: Task 3 timed out (order might vary slightly)
        }
    }
}
```

This extends the previous example to multiple failing tasks. A correct implementation should capture *all* exceptions and include them in the `AggregateException`.  The order of exceptions within `InnerExceptions` might vary slightly based on implementation specifics, but all exceptions must be present.  The lack of any exception or the presence of only a subset indicates a flawed replication.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in C#, I recommend consulting the official Microsoft documentation on tasks and asynchronous operations.  Thoroughly examining the source code of established asynchronous libraries can be invaluable.  Furthermore, comprehensive testing frameworks, specifically designed for asynchronous code, are essential for validating the correctness and robustness of any implementation.  Finally, exploring advanced exception handling techniques within the context of asynchronous programming will further enhance understanding.  These resources will allow for a detailed analysis of `Task.WhenAll`'s internal workings and exception management.

In conclusion, a correct replication of `Task.WhenAll<TResult>` demands meticulous attention to exception handling.  The three examples presented here provide a foundation for evaluating my colleague's implementation.  By carefully comparing the behavior of their implementation against the expected output under these scenarios – all tasks successful, one task failing, and multiple tasks failing – one can confidently assess the accuracy of their replication.  The absence of the appropriate `AggregateException` with all inner exceptions properly handled conclusively indicates a flawed implementation.  Thorough testing and a grasp of the intricacies of exception propagation within asynchronous operations are critical in building robust and reliable systems.
