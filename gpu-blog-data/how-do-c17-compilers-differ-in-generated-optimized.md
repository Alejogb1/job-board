The observed discrepancies in optimized assembly output across different C++17 compilers stem primarily from varying degrees of sophistication in their optimization passes and their underlying assumptions about target architecture capabilities.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has shown that even seemingly minor variations in source code can trigger drastically different optimization strategies, leading to significant performance variations across compiler implementations. This isn't necessarily a bug; rather, it reflects the inherent complexity of compiler optimization and the lack of a universally agreed-upon "optimal" code generation strategy.

**1. Explanation:**

Compiler optimization is a multi-stage process.  Initially, the compiler performs transformations based on well-defined language semantics, translating the high-level C++ code into an intermediate representation (IR). Subsequent optimization phases leverage sophisticated algorithms to transform this IR, aiming to improve performance metrics like execution speed, code size, and power consumption.  These optimizations can include:

* **Inlining:** Replacing function calls with the function's body, reducing function call overhead. The aggressiveness of inlining varies significantly across compilers; some aggressively inline even large functions, while others are more conservative.  The decision is influenced by factors such as function size, complexity, and potential for subsequent optimizations.

* **Loop unrolling:** Replicating loop iterations to reduce loop overhead.  Again, the degree of unrolling is often heuristic, depending on factors like loop size, predicted execution frequency, and the available register pressure.

* **Vectorization:** Exploiting Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities of the target architecture to perform operations on multiple data elements simultaneously.  Effective vectorization requires sophisticated data dependency analysis and understanding of the target architecture's SIMD instruction set.  Different compilers possess varying levels of competence in this area.

* **Constant propagation and folding:** Replacing variable uses with constant values where possible, eliminating unnecessary computations. This is a fundamental optimization but the efficiency with which compilers perform this and subsequent related steps differs based on algorithm implementations.

* **Dead code elimination:** Removing code sections that have no effect on the program's output.  This simple yet crucial optimization involves complex data-flow analysis to precisely identify unreachable or redundant code.

The differences observed in the final assembly output directly reflect the varying effectiveness and aggressiveness of these optimization passes. Factors like compiler version, optimization level (e.g., `-O2`, `-O3`), target architecture, and even the specific build system used can contribute to these variations.  In my experience, subtle differences in the source code, such as the order of operations or the use of specific data structures, can dramatically alter the compiler's optimization choices, leading to unexpected discrepancies in the generated assembly.  This is especially true when dealing with complex algorithms or heavily optimized code.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's consider three examples showcasing potential variations:

**Example 1: Loop Optimization**

```c++
#include <vector>

int sum_array(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Compilers might handle this differently.  One might unroll the loop extensively, resulting in many additions performed concurrently.  Another might opt for vectorization, using SIMD instructions to add multiple elements simultaneously.  A less sophisticated compiler might produce assembly code directly reflecting the original loop structure, leading to significantly worse performance.


**Example 2: Function Inlining**

```c++
int square(int x) { return x * x; }

int main() {
  int result = square(5);
  return result;
}
```

A compiler might inline the `square` function, resulting in a single multiplication instruction in the assembly code.  In contrast, a less aggressive compiler might retain the function call, incurring function call overhead. This seemingly minor difference can accumulate significantly in performance-critical sections.

**Example 3: Constant Propagation**

```c++
const int value = 10;
int calculate(int x) {
  return x * value;
}

int main() {
  return calculate(5);
}
```

Here, a sophisticated compiler will propagate the constant `value` and perform constant folding, resulting in the assembly directly calculating `5 * 10`.  A less optimized compiler might generate code that loads `value` from memory and then performs the multiplication, incurring unnecessary memory access.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of compiler optimization, I would recommend studying compiler design textbooks, focusing on intermediate representation (IR) transformations and optimization algorithms.  Exploring the documentation of specific compilers (such as GCC, Clang, and MSVC) is also crucial to understand their particular optimization strategies and flags.  Finally, examining the assembly output using a disassembler is invaluable for gaining practical insights into how different compilers translate C++ code into machine instructions.  Understanding the strengths and limitations of your chosen compiler's optimization capabilities is paramount for writing efficient C++ code.  Familiarizing oneself with profiling tools to analyze performance bottlenecks can further highlight areas where compiler optimization might be lacking or could be improved with different coding practices.
