The absence of `FromTensorSlicesClientData` in `tensorflow_federated` when using the `tff-nightly` package stems from a deliberate design choice in how federated datasets are handled in more recent versions of TensorFlow Federated (TFF).  Specifically, the reliance on `tf.data.Dataset` for client data manipulation has become significantly more pronounced. The `FromTensorSlicesClientData`, while present in earlier iterations, was a utility primarily intended to adapt existing TensorFlow tensor structures into a client-specific dataset abstraction used internally within the framework. Its direct exposure to the user became redundant and less efficient given the current methodology.

In my past work building federated learning simulations involving large, synthetic datasets, I encountered a similar discrepancy when upgrading from an older, stable TFF version to a nightly release. Initially, I also expected `FromTensorSlicesClientData` to be available.  My initial experiments involved loading data through custom `tf.Tensor` instances â€“ mimicking, in effect, the use case for that function. I soon realized the preferred approach involves constructing a `tff.simulation.ClientData` from a collection of `tf.data.Dataset` objects, one for each client. This new strategy optimizes dataset construction, allowing for a cleaner abstraction layer and greater control over performance.

The previous way, using `FromTensorSlicesClientData`, had implications for memory management and data access patterns. Creating client data directly from tensor slices was not as flexible, particularly when dealing with datasets that could be efficiently batched or prefetched using native `tf.data` functionalities. The current method promotes a more data-first mindset where pre-processing, shuffling, batching, and all of the efficient operations supported by `tf.data.Dataset` can be implemented in the dataset construction stage itself.  This allows TFF to utilize optimized execution paths for the datasets and reduces the conversion costs.

Let me demonstrate with three code examples that showcase how to correctly build and use a `tff.simulation.ClientData` without relying on the deprecated functionality. These examples will move progressively from very simple cases to slightly more complex scenarios reflecting how I encountered them in my work.

**Example 1: Simple Client Data with Static Tensor Inputs**

This example represents the simplest case, constructing a two-client federated dataset with manually defined tensor data. Note the complete absence of any attempts to use a `FromTensorSlicesClientData` type function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

# Define client datasets as tf.data.Dataset objects.
client1_data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    {'x': tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32),
     'y': tf.constant([0, 1], dtype=tf.int32)})

client2_data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    {'x': tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=tf.float32),
     'y': tf.constant([1, 0], dtype=tf.int32)})

# Create client data dict (client IDs as keys, datasets as values).
client_data_dict = {'client1': client1_data, 'client2': client2_data}

# Use from_datasets method to create the ClientData object.
client_data = tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData.from_datasets(client_data_dict)


# Verify operation - show client IDs and the first element of the first client's dataset
print(client_data.client_ids)
print(list(client_data.create_tf_dataset_for_client('client1').take(1)))

```

In this example, each client's data is encapsulated within a `tf.data.Dataset` directly from the outset. The `from_datasets` class method conveniently wraps the supplied dictionary into a `ClientData` abstraction. As illustrated in the final `print` call, we can retrieve data associated with a specific client. This approach is quite explicit compared to `FromTensorSlicesClientData`. We are working directly with `tf.data` structures from the beginning.

**Example 2: Client Data with Preprocessing and Batching**

This example shows how we can easily include preprocessing steps within the dataset creation itself before they're passed to TFF. In my past experiments, I frequently used techniques like normalization or feature selection within the dataset itself before the model training. This method is efficient, and the client data object can be thought of as a stream of processed training data ready to consume without requiring additional transforms after being wrapped by the tff client data object.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

# Define a preprocessing function
def preprocess(element):
    return {'x': tf.math.divide(element['x'], 10.0), 'y': element['y']} # Normalize x

client1_data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    {'x': tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32),
     'y': tf.constant([0, 1], dtype=tf.int32)}).map(preprocess).batch(1)

client2_data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    {'x': tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=tf.float32),
     'y': tf.constant([1, 0], dtype=tf.int32)}).map(preprocess).batch(1)

# Create client data dict.
client_data_dict = {'client1': client1_data, 'client2': client2_data}

# Use from_datasets method to create the ClientData object.
client_data = tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData.from_datasets(client_data_dict)

# Verify operation - shows the normalized and batched data of one of the clients
print(list(client_data.create_tf_dataset_for_client('client1').take(2)))
```

Here, `preprocess` is applied directly in the creation of the dataset. Each individual element in the dataset is subject to the normalization applied by the `preprocess` method, and subsequently grouped into individual batches via `.batch(1)`. These preprocessing steps occur within the scope of `tf.data.Dataset`, leveraging its optimized implementation. This demonstrates that the client datasets being passed to the client data object can have arbitrary logic and transformation steps in place without requiring any change in the way client data is managed by TFF.

**Example 3: Working with a Larger Dataset**

Finally, a slightly more realistic example, in which we're dynamically generating client datasets. This particular approach was used during my model testing phase. It became a robust alternative to handling complex in-memory tensors directly with legacy client data structures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff
import numpy as np

NUM_CLIENTS = 5
EXAMPLES_PER_CLIENT = 20

def create_dataset(client_id):
    features = np.random.rand(EXAMPLES_PER_CLIENT, 2).astype(np.float32)
    labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, EXAMPLES_PER_CLIENT).astype(np.int32)
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices({'x': features, 'y': labels}).batch(5)

client_datasets = {f"client_{i}": create_dataset(i) for i in range(NUM_CLIENTS)}

client_data = tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData.from_datasets(client_datasets)

print(client_data.client_ids)
for client_id in client_data.client_ids:
  print(f"first batch from {client_id}: {list(client_data.create_tf_dataset_for_client(client_id).take(1))}")

```
This final example dynamically creates a `ClientData` abstraction from a generated dataset, creating 5 clients each with 20 examples. It demonstrates how readily we can work with scalable and generated data. The output illustrates the successful generation and retrieval of data from each client. In many simulation workloads, it is common to rely on such dynamic dataset generation for various tasks.

**Recommendations**

When transitioning away from relying on the removed `FromTensorSlicesClientData`, I would emphasize reviewing the TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.data.Dataset`. A deep understanding of its various operations, such as `map`, `batch`, `shuffle`, and `prefetch`, can significantly enhance how your federated datasets are prepared. Furthermore, exploring the section on prefetching data for improved performance is highly valuable. The TensorFlow Federated documentation also contains numerous examples of using the `ClientData` class which can further solidify understanding and application of this method. Finally,  understanding how to adapt existing data pipelines to leverage `tf.data` fully will make the transition seamless and improve your development workflows. The previous `FromTensorSlicesClientData` approach has been fully superseded by the `tf.data` based approach. A shift in perspective towards `tf.data` will be paramount in developing robust TFF pipelines moving forward.
