The GCC compiler's linking of symbols for unreachable switch-case statements stems from its adherence to a strict interpretation of the C standard concerning compilation unit independence and the potential for optimization across compilation units.  My experience working on large-scale embedded systems projects, particularly those involving intricate state machines, highlighted this behavior repeatedly. While seemingly counterintuitive, it safeguards against unpredictable behavior and allows for more robust code optimization in certain scenarios.  The compiler cannot, at the compilation stage of a single `.c` file, definitively determine whether code branches are truly unreachable; this determination often requires inter-procedural analysis that only the linker can perform.

The C standard, in its definition of the `switch` statement, does not explicitly mandate the exclusion of unreachable `case` labels from the compiled output.  Instead, it focuses on the semantics of the `switch` itself – directing control flow based on the value of a controlling expression.  Whether a specific `case` label is ever reached depends on the value of the controlling expression and potentially on decisions made in other compilation units. The compiler's conservative approach in linking these symbols prevents unexpected failures and avoids premature optimization that could prove incorrect during linking.

Consider a scenario where a function containing a `switch` statement is compiled separately from a function that calls it and provides the controlling value. The calling function might modify its behavior through configuration or external input, making some `case` labels reachable in certain circumstances, even if they appear unreachable from a localized perspective within the `switch` function.  If the compiler aggressively removed the code for these unreachable `case` labels, the linker might encounter undefined references, particularly if those labels are accessed indirectly via function pointers or other dynamic mechanisms.

Let's illustrate this with examples.

**Example 1: Seemingly Unreachable Case**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void mySwitch(int val) {
    switch (val) {
        case 1:
            printf("Case 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Case 2\n");
            break;
        case 3: // Appears unreachable, but...
            printf("Case 3\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Default\n");
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    mySwitch(1); // Only case 1 is explicitly used here
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `case 3` appears unreachable within `main()`. However, imagine another function in a different compilation unit that calls `mySwitch(3)`.  The compiler, compiling `mySwitch()` in isolation, cannot know this.  Therefore, it includes the code for `case 3`, correctly anticipating that the linker may need it based on information from another compilation unit.  If it were to remove `case 3`, and a linking error would arise later.

**Example 2: Indirect Access Through Function Pointers**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void case1() { printf("Case 1\n"); }
void case2() { printf("Case 2\n"); }
void case3() { printf("Case 3\n"); }

int main() {
    void (*funcPtr)(void);
    int selector = 1; // Could be modified dynamically, e.g., by user input

    switch (selector) {
        case 1: funcPtr = case1; break;
        case 2: funcPtr = case2; break;
        case 3: funcPtr = case3; break; // Appears unreachable but may not be
        default: funcPtr = NULL; break;
    }

    if (funcPtr != NULL) { funcPtr(); }

    return 0;
}
```

This showcases indirect access.  The compiler, again, cannot definitively say `case 3` is unreachable without analyzing the entire program’s execution flow.  The value of `selector` might be changed externally, making `case 3` reachable at runtime.  Removing `case3` prematurely would lead to runtime errors.


**Example 3:  Conditional Compilation and Macros**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DEBUG
#define SELECTOR 3
#else
#define SELECTOR 1
#endif

void mySwitch(int val) {
    switch (val) {
        case 1:
            printf("Case 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Case 2\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Case 3\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Default\n");
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    mySwitch(SELECTOR);
    return 0;
}
```

This illustrates the role of preprocessor directives.  `case 3` might be compiled out if `DEBUG` isn’t defined, but the compiler cannot guarantee that it will always be. Different build configurations could enable `DEBUG`, thereby making `case 3` reachable. This further emphasizes the impossibility of statically determining reachability in all cases during compilation.


In summary, the decision by GCC to link symbols for seemingly unreachable `switch`-case statements is a conservative choice designed to enhance the robustness of the linking process and avoid unexpected errors arising from incomplete inter-procedural analysis during compilation. While it might lead to slightly larger binary sizes, it significantly improves the reliability of the compilation and linking process, especially when dealing with complex projects or those utilizing dynamic behavior.


**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  The relevant sections of the C standard concerning `switch` statements and their semantics.
2.  A compiler optimization guide, focusing on inter-procedural analysis and the limitations of static code analysis.
3.  Documentation on the GCC linker and its symbol resolution mechanisms.  This would delve into the details of how the linker resolves references across compilation units.
