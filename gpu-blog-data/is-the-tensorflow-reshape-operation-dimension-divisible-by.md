The TensorFlow `tf.reshape` operation does not inherently require that the product of the dimensions of the new shape be divisible by a specific number *N*. Instead, the crucial requirement is that the *total number of elements* in the tensor before reshaping must precisely match the total number of elements implied by the new shape. This principle applies irrespective of any divisibility rule concerning individual dimensions or their products. The operation reinterprets the underlying memory layout; it doesn’t add or remove data points.

My experience developing several image processing pipelines using TensorFlow has consistently reinforced this understanding. I’ve commonly reshaped image tensors, where the number of channels (for example, 3 for RGB) doesn't neatly divide the total pixel count or batch size. It’s the product of all dimensions that counts, the total count of data points must be preserved.

The function’s behavior is predicated on the following: Given a tensor with an initial shape (d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ), the total number of elements is calculated as d₁ * d₂ * ... * dₙ. When reshaping to a new shape (r₁, r₂, ..., rₘ), the equality d₁ * d₂ * ... * dₙ = r₁ * r₂ * ... * rₘ must be satisfied. If the element count does not match, the `tf.reshape` operation raises an error, preventing silent data corruption.

This differs significantly from a scenario where one might be concerned about divisibility by some *N* within a different context – for example, if one were partitioning data into batches or applying convolutions where the input size needs to align with the kernel size. But when solely considering `tf.reshape`, the divisibility by an arbitrary *N* for any dimension is not required. Only that the total count matches before and after the reshaping.

Here are three code examples illustrating valid reshaping operations that demonstrate this principle, followed by explanations:

**Example 1: Reshaping a 1D tensor into a 2D tensor.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial 1D tensor with 12 elements.
tensor_1d = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

# Reshaping to a 2D tensor with dimensions 3x4.
tensor_2d = tf.reshape(tensor_1d, [3, 4])

# Verify the resulting shape.
print("Reshaped Tensor:\n", tensor_2d.numpy())
print("Reshaped Tensor Shape:", tensor_2d.shape)

# Initial tensor had 12 elements (12=1*12)
# Reshaped tensor has 12 elements (3*4 = 12)
```

*Commentary:* In this example, a 1D tensor containing 12 elements is reshaped into a 2D tensor of shape (3, 4).  The crucial point is that the product of the dimensions in the original shape (1 * 12 = 12) is equal to the product of the dimensions in the new shape (3 * 4 = 12). Note, that neither the 3 or the 4 is divisible by any arbitrary number 'N' in our question if it was equal to, say, '5'. The operation was successfully executed because the element counts matched. The elements are re-arranged in the memory.

**Example 2: Reshaping a 3D tensor to a 2D tensor.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial 3D tensor with dimensions (2, 3, 2) - total of 12 elements
tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
                        [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]])

# Reshaping to a 2D tensor with dimensions (6, 2)
tensor_2d_2 = tf.reshape(tensor_3d, [6, 2])

# Verify the resulting shape and values
print("Reshaped Tensor:\n", tensor_2d_2.numpy())
print("Reshaped Tensor Shape:", tensor_2d_2.shape)

# Initial tensor had 12 elements (2*3*2 = 12)
# Reshaped tensor has 12 elements (6*2 = 12)
```

*Commentary:* Here, a 3D tensor is reshaped into a 2D tensor. The original tensor has dimensions 2, 3, and 2, resulting in 12 elements. The reshaped tensor has dimensions 6 and 2, also yielding 12 elements. Once again, no specific divisibility criteria for any individual dimension are enforced. It's the preservation of the overall element count that ensures the reshape operation’s validity. Again, note that a dimension like '6' or '2' is not necessarily divisible by a specific 'N' value, but the reshape still works perfectly because the element count remains consistent.

**Example 3: Using -1 as a placeholder dimension.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial 4D tensor with shape (2, 2, 3, 2) - total of 24 elements
tensor_4d = tf.constant([
    [[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]],
    [[[13, 14], [15, 16], [17, 18]], [[19, 20], [21, 22], [23, 24]]]
])

# Reshaping to a 3D tensor with shape (2, 6, -1).
# The -1 will infer the last dimension to be 2, such that the element count is still 24.
tensor_3d_2 = tf.reshape(tensor_4d, [2, 6, -1])

# Verify the resulting shape.
print("Reshaped Tensor:\n", tensor_3d_2.numpy())
print("Reshaped Tensor Shape:", tensor_3d_2.shape)


# Initial tensor had 24 elements (2*2*3*2 = 24)
# Reshaped tensor has 24 elements (2*6*2 = 24)
```

*Commentary:* This example introduces the use of `-1` as a placeholder dimension. The `-1` tells TensorFlow to infer the correct size based on the other dimensions and the total element count of the original tensor, such that that the product of all dimension continues to match the total number of elements. This is often used when you know some dimensions and need the remainder to complete the shape. Here, with original elements of 24, setting dimensions of [2, 6, -1], tensorflow correctly infers that the last dimension must equal 2.  Note the same lack of divisibility constraint for the new dimensions, '2', '6', and '2' respectively. The reshape functionality solely focuses on the overall element count not individual divisibility.

When debugging `tf.reshape` issues, I’ve found it useful to first calculate the total number of elements in the original tensor shape. This allows for a quick manual check against the product of the dimensions in the intended new shape. Common errors result from a miscalculation or misunderstanding of how many elements are expected after reshaping, rather than the violation of a divisibility rule.

For more thorough understanding, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, which provides comprehensive information on tensor operations and their behavior. The "TensorFlow in Action" series of books, although older, provides good insight into the core mechanics of the framework. Additionally, the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" offers a practical, albeit higher-level, view. Further exploration of linear algebra principles pertaining to reshaping can deepen your comprehension of how data is reinterpreted in memory.
