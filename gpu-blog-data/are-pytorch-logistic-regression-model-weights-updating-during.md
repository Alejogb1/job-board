The core mechanism underlying the training of a PyTorch logistic regression model hinges on the automatic differentiation capabilities of the framework.  Contrary to a naive implementation where one might manually compute gradients, PyTorch leverages computational graphs and backpropagation to automatically compute and apply updates to model weights.  In my experience optimizing models for large-scale classification tasks, understanding this automatic update process is crucial for debugging and achieving optimal performance.  Therefore, yes, PyTorch logistic regression model weights *are* indeed updated during training, and this process is orchestrated by the optimizer.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The training process involves iteratively feeding data into the model, calculating the loss function (often cross-entropy for logistic regression), and then using backpropagation to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters (weights and biases).  These gradients represent the direction and magnitude of the parameter adjustments needed to minimize the loss.  The optimizer, an algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop, then uses these gradients to update the model's weights.  The update rule is typically of the form:

`weight_new = weight_old - learning_rate * gradient`

where `learning_rate` is a hyperparameter controlling the step size of the update.  This iterative process continues for a predefined number of epochs or until a convergence criterion is met.  The automatic differentiation capabilities of PyTorch handle the computation of the gradients, making the implementation significantly simpler and more efficient than manual gradient calculations.  Failure to observe weight updates during training generally points to problems in data loading, model architecture, or optimizer configuration.  I've encountered issues stemming from incorrect data type conversions, inadvertently disabling gradient calculation (`requires_grad = False`), and utilizing optimizers improperly configured for the model.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Logistic Regression with SGD**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model
model = nn.Linear(input_dim, 1)  # Logistic regression is a single linear layer

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss() #handles sigmoid internally
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        # Zero the gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels.float()) #squeeze for correct dim

        # Backward pass and optimization
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        # Inspect weight changes (optional, for demonstration)
        for param in model.parameters():
            print(f"Weight values: {param.data}") #Observe changes across epochs


#Note: input_dim, num_epochs, and dataloader need to be defined beforehand based on data
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward logistic regression model trained using SGD.  Crucially, `optimizer.zero_grad()` resets gradients to zero before each iteration to prevent gradient accumulation.  The `loss.backward()` function performs backpropagation, and `optimizer.step()` updates the weights based on the computed gradients.  The commented-out `print` statement allows verification of weight updates.


**Example 2:  Using Adam Optimizer and Monitoring Weight Changes**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# ... (Model and data loading as in Example 1) ...

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

#Track weight changes explicitly
weight_history = []
for param in model.parameters():
    weight_history.append(param.data.clone())

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels.float())
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        new_weights = []
        for param in model.parameters():
            new_weights.append(param.data.clone())

        #Compare weights after each step
        for i in range(len(weight_history)):
          diff = np.linalg.norm(weight_history[i].numpy() - new_weights[i].numpy())
          print(f"Weight change in epoch {epoch}: {diff}")
        
        weight_history = new_weights #Update the weight history.

```

This example utilizes the Adam optimizer, known for its adaptive learning rates. The added functionality explicitly tracks the change in weights after each epoch using NumPy's linear algebra functions to calculate the Euclidean norm of weight differences for a quantifiable measure.


**Example 3: Handling potential gradient issues with requires_grad**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model and data loading as in Example 1) ...


#Ensure gradients are calculated
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)


# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels.float())
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        #Check for NaN values in the gradients or weights. This can indicate issues.
        for param in model.parameters():
            if torch.isnan(param.grad).any():
                print("NaN detected in gradients!")
                break
            if torch.isnan(param.data).any():
                print("NaN detected in weights!")
                break


```
This example explicitly sets `requires_grad = True` for all model parameters.  This is a crucial step, as accidentally setting this to `False` prevents gradient computation and hence weight updates. The added `NaN` checks help in identifying potential numerical instability issues during training.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation is an invaluable resource.  A thorough understanding of automatic differentiation and optimization algorithms is necessary.  Relevant texts on machine learning and deep learning provide the theoretical foundation.  Finally, carefully studying example code and tutorials focusing on logistic regression implementation in PyTorch is highly beneficial.  Reviewing discussions on relevant online forums helps in troubleshooting common issues.
