PyTorch's autograd system, the engine behind its automatic differentiation, operates on *functions* and not directly on the differentiable tensors themselves, even though tensors are the primary data containers. This distinction is crucial for understanding why we don’t see autograd tracking operations *within* a tensor's memory. Instead, autograd constructs a computational graph by tracking the *operations* performed on these tensors, not the modifications to the tensors themselves.

The core concept is that autograd's job is to calculate gradients. Gradients represent the sensitivity of a function's output with respect to its inputs. These gradients are necessary for training neural networks using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. To calculate these gradients effectively, PyTorch needs to record the operations (e.g., addition, multiplication, matrix multiplication) that are performed, along with the input tensors involved. These tracked operations and dependencies are then assembled into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) — the computation graph. It’s not about tracking individual changes in tensor memory, but the overall flow of operations which contribute to an output that needs to be differentiated.

I've encountered cases, particularly when implementing custom layers or complex loss functions, where this understanding is vital. If you think autograd is working at a tensor level, you might mistakenly try to modify a tensor in place and expect gradient tracking to automatically incorporate those changes; that will inevitably lead to incorrect gradient computations and broken training.

The differentiation is accomplished by using the chain rule. When you invoke `.backward()` on a tensor (typically the loss), PyTorch traverses the computation graph from the output node backwards to its inputs. During this backward pass, the gradient at each node is computed based on the gradients of its children nodes (those closer to the output) and the local derivative of the operation represented by the node itself. Crucially, the backward pass is possible only because the forward pass *recorded* the operations performed, not by tracking some 'diff-able' versions of tensors. The tensor storage may be updated during the operations but its memory management isn’t the core concern of autograd, what matters is the computation that led to a tensor.

The autograd system's design choice of operating on functions rather than on tensor storage directly provides several advantages. Firstly, it allows for a level of abstraction where PyTorch can optimize the computation graph. For instance, it can identify redundant computations and consolidate them. Secondly, this approach allows for custom `torch.autograd.Function` implementations which provide ultimate flexibility to define custom backward operations, and those backward implementations depend solely on the operations performed in forward. This flexibility wouldn't be possible if autograd tracked tensor-level manipulations directly. Thirdly, by managing the computational graph, PyTorch can avoid explicitly storing intermediate derivatives.

Here are a few examples illustrating the distinction, along with explanations to help demonstrate what is happening behind the scenes.

**Example 1: Simple Addition**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([3.0], requires_grad=True)
z = x + y

z.backward()

print(f"Gradient of x: {x.grad}")  # Output: Gradient of x: tensor([1.])
print(f"Gradient of y: {y.grad}")  # Output: Gradient of y: tensor([1.])

```

In this case, we have `x`, `y`, and `z` tensors. The critical thing is that `z = x + y` represents the *addition operation* which autograd records as part of computation graph, and not some modification to x or y's storage. During the backward pass when we call `.backward()` on `z`, PyTorch knows that `z` was the result of adding `x` and `y`. The derivative of z with respect to x is 1 and with respect to y is also 1. The calculated gradients for x and y are stored in `x.grad` and `y.grad` respectively. The actual tensor data held in `x`, `y`, and `z` never contained gradient information nor was it tracked at the memory level, the history of operations were the key to determine the gradient. The gradient `x.grad` and `y.grad` are separate from x and y tensors.

**Example 2: In-Place Operations with Explicit Tracking**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x + 1  # Operation recorded

x_copy = x.clone().detach().requires_grad_(True)  # Create a detached copy with grad requirement
y_copy = x_copy.add_(1) # In-place addition
try:
    y_copy.backward() # Raises error because modification made in place
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

y.backward()

print(f"Gradient of x: {x.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of x_copy : {x_copy.grad}")
```

Here, I’ve introduced an in-place addition using `add_()`. The attempt to call `.backward()` on `y_copy` raises a runtime error. Why? Because, the in-place `add_()` operation *modifies* the underlying data storage for `x_copy` and also doesn't leave any information that can be used to compute the gradient during backward pass. In other words, operations such as `add_` are not recorded into computational graph and PyTorch can't compute gradients via its chain rule implementation since the necessary operation has not been logged. With the usual `y = x + 1` case the operation is recorded in graph, so backward works.  In contrast, PyTorch's autograd system cannot automatically handle in-place modifications because they do not contribute to the computation graph in a manner suitable for differentiation. You must avoid in place operations when doing gradients with PyTorch. The key takeaway is that autograd tracks the *functions*, not direct memory manipulation of the tensors. In most cases you should never use in place operations on requires\_grad tensors.

**Example 3: Custom Autograd Function**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function

class MyReLU(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        return torch.clamp(x, min=0)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_x = grad_output.clone()
        grad_x[x <= 0] = 0
        return grad_x

x = torch.tensor([-1.0, 2.0, -3.0], requires_grad=True)
relu = MyReLU.apply

y = relu(x)
y.sum().backward()

print(f"Gradient of x: {x.grad}") # Output: Gradient of x: tensor([0., 1., 0.])
```

This example demonstrates a custom `autograd.Function`. Here, we define a custom ReLU function with its forward and backward passes. The `forward` method stores the input tensor `x` using `ctx.save_for_backward(x)`, which makes the forward computation available to its backward pass.  Crucially, `backward()` computes the local derivative, which is then multiplied by the incoming gradient to calculate `grad_x`.  Again, the key is that we’re implementing *functions* that operate on tensors but don't modify the tensors directly. The tensor data is changed by the forward pass but those changes are recorded as a series of operations, not a tracking of memory locations.

In summary, autograd does not track changes to tensor memory directly. Instead, it creates a dynamic computational graph based on operations that are performed on those tensors. This function-centric approach facilitates the calculation of gradients for neural network training efficiently and offers a necessary level of abstraction and flexibility for custom function implementations.

To deepen your understanding, I recommend reviewing the "Automatic differentiation package" documentation in the official PyTorch documentation. You can also benefit from reading research papers related to automatic differentiation techniques. Exploring community tutorials and examples, especially those covering custom `autograd.Function` implementations, would further clarify the underlying principles. Studying and understanding the `torch.autograd` package should be a priority when using PyTorch.
