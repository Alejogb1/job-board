TensorFlow 1's behavior regarding model training when the loss function is defined using Tensor operations hinges on the execution context.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects, specifically within the TensorFlow 1 ecosystem before its deprecation, highlighted this crucial nuance.  While TensorFlow 1 allows for a high degree of flexibility in defining loss functions, the mere presence of Tensor operations within the loss definition doesn't automatically trigger training.  The critical element is how this loss function is integrated into the optimization process via the `minimize()` method of an optimizer.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1 operates under a computational graph paradigm.  This means that the entire computation, including the forward pass (calculating predictions), the loss calculation, and the backward pass (calculating gradients), is defined as a graph before actual execution.  When a loss function is defined using Tensor operations, it simply represents a node within this graph.  This node's output—the scalar loss value—is a crucial input for the optimizer.  The optimizer, in turn, employs an algorithm (like gradient descent) to adjust model parameters based on the gradients calculated during the backward pass.  These gradients are derived via automatic differentiation through the computational graph, with the loss function serving as the starting point for this backpropagation.

Therefore, the model *does* train if and only if the loss Tensor is correctly used as the target for the optimizer's minimization operation.  If the loss Tensor is defined but not connected to the optimization process, the graph will execute the loss calculation, but the model parameters will remain unchanged. This is a frequent source of errors in TensorFlow 1 code. The error often stems from not correctly feeding the loss Tensor to the optimizer's `minimize()` function or a misconfiguration of the optimizer itself.

The distinction between *defining* a loss function using Tensors and *utilizing* that loss function for training is paramount. Defining it only constructs a computational node; using it within an optimizer's `minimize()` method initiates the backpropagation and parameter updates, thereby driving the training process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder for input data
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
# Placeholder for labels
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])

# Define weights and bias (simplified for brevity)
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))

# Define the model (a simple linear model)
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

# Define the loss function using Tensor operations
cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_, logits=y))

# Define the optimizer
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5).minimize(cross_entropy)

# ... (rest of the training loop including session initiation, data feeding, etc.)
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases a correct implementation. The `cross_entropy` Tensor, which is defined using TensorFlow operations (`tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` and `tf.reduce_mean`), is directly passed to the `minimize()` method of the `GradientDescentOptimizer`.  This explicitly connects the loss function to the training process, ensuring that the model parameters are updated during training.


**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation - Loss not used in Optimization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Placeholder definition, model definition as in Example 1) ...

# Define the loss function using Tensor operations
cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_, logits=y))

# INCORRECT: Loss is defined but not used for optimization
# train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5).minimize(some_other_tensor) # Hypothetical

# ... (Session initiation, data feeding, but model parameters won't change) ...
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates an incorrect implementation where the `cross_entropy` Tensor is defined but not used in the optimization step.  The `minimize()` method is called with a placeholder –  `some_other_tensor` – rather than the calculated loss.  While the loss will be computed during execution, the model parameters remain untouched; hence, no training occurs.  This is a common mistake. The model outputs will remain static across training iterations.


**Example 3: Incorrect Implementation –  Loss Calculation Error**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Placeholder definition, model definition as in Example 1) ...

# INCORRECT: Loss calculation error –  missing reduction
cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_, logits=y) # Missing tf.reduce_mean

# Define the optimizer (this will likely result in an error during execution)
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5).minimize(cross_entropy)

# ... (Session initiation, data feeding – execution will likely fail) ...
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights another potential issue.  While the loss Tensor is passed to `minimize()`, the loss calculation itself is flawed.  `tf.reduce_mean` is missing, resulting in a Tensor of shape `[batch_size, ]` instead of a scalar loss value. This will often lead to an error during training because optimizers expect a scalar loss for gradient calculation. This highlights the importance of checking the dimensionality of your loss tensor.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow 1 documentation (though now archived).
*  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering automatic differentiation and backpropagation.
*  Advanced tutorials focused on custom loss function implementation in TensorFlow.


In conclusion, the key takeaway is that the mere definition of a loss function using TensorFlow operations in TensorFlow 1 doesn't automatically trigger model training.  The crucial step is to explicitly incorporate this loss Tensor into the optimizer's `minimize()` method.  Failure to do so, or errors in the loss calculation itself, will prevent model parameters from being updated, resulting in ineffective or faulty training.  Careful attention to both the definition and the usage of the loss function is crucial for successful model training within the TensorFlow 1 framework.
