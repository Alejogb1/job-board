The seminal *GPU Gems* series showcased a breadth of GPU programming techniques, many of which remain relevant today, albeit often implemented with more sophisticated frameworks.  My experience working on real-time rendering for high-fidelity simulations and game development, particularly during the transition from fixed-function pipelines to programmable shaders, highlighted the enduring influence of these techniques.  While specific algorithms have evolved, the core principles of leveraging the parallel processing power of the GPU for complex visual tasks persist.  This response will detail several key areas of similarity, illustrated with code examples.

**1.  Advanced Shading Techniques:** *GPU Gems* devoted significant attention to extending the capabilities of the programmable shader model beyond simple lighting calculations. This included techniques like environment mapping, shadow mapping, and advanced surface shading models.  These concepts remain fundamental.  Modern implementations leverage advancements in shader languages (like HLSL or GLSL) and hardware features (like tessellation and geometry shaders) to achieve higher fidelity and efficiency.


**Code Example 1:  Deferred Shading (Conceptual)**

```glsl
// Fragment Shader (Deferred Lighting Pass)
#version 460
in vec3 vPosition;
in vec3 vNormal;
in vec2 vUV;
in vec4 gAlbedo; // Albedo from G-Buffer
in vec4 gNormal; // Normal from G-Buffer
in vec4 gPosition; // World Position from G-Buffer

uniform sampler2D gLightTexture; // Lighting data pre-computed to a texture

out vec4 FragColor;

void main() {
    vec3 lightDir = normalize(lightPos - gPosition.xyz); //Simplified light calculation for brevity
    vec3 normal = normalize(gNormal.xyz);
    float NdotL = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);

    vec3 finalColor = gAlbedo.xyz * NdotL * vec3(texture(gLightTexture, vUV)); //Apply lighting
    FragColor = vec4(finalColor, 1.0);
}
```

This example demonstrates deferred shading, a technique extensively covered in *GPU Gems*,  where geometry information is rendered to G-buffers, then processed in subsequent passes for lighting calculations.  This strategy improves performance over forward rendering by minimizing overdraw.  Modern implementations might incorporate techniques like clustered shading for further optimization, but the underlying principle remains the same.  The code is simplified for clarity; a full implementation requires careful management of G-buffer textures and light sources.


**2.  Image-Based Lighting and Global Illumination Approximations:**  *GPU Gems* explored computationally efficient methods for approximating global illumination effects.  Techniques like light probes, irradiance volumes, and screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) were heavily featured.  Many of these have become standard rendering techniques, frequently integrated into commercial game engines.  While more sophisticated methods exist now, the fundamental approaches – using pre-computed data or efficient screen-space approximations – are directly traceable to the insights presented in the book.

**Code Example 2:  Simplified Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)**

```glsl
// Fragment Shader (SSAO)
#version 460
in vec2 vUV;
in vec3 vPosition;
in vec3 vNormal;
uniform sampler2D depthTexture;
uniform sampler2D normalTexture;
uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;
uniform mat4 inverseProjectionMatrix;

out vec4 FragColor;

//Simplified SSAO calculation - details omitted for brevity

void main() {
  vec3 position = reconstructPosition(vUV, depthTexture, inverseProjectionMatrix);
  vec3 normal = texture(normalTexture, vUV).xyz;
  float occlusion = calculateOcclusion(position, normal, depthTexture);
  FragColor = vec4(vec3(occlusion), 1.0);
}
```

This demonstrates a basic SSAO approach, where depth and normal information are used to approximate ambient occlusion in screen space. The `reconstructPosition` and `calculateOcclusion` functions would involve complex calculations, including kernel sampling and depth comparisons – similar to those described in *GPU Gems*.  Modern SSAO implementations might use more advanced techniques like stochastic sampling or temporal filtering for noise reduction and quality improvement, but the core concept remains fundamentally the same.  Significant details are omitted for brevity.


**3.  Particle Systems and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on the GPU:**  *GPU Gems* showcased the use of GPUs for handling large-scale particle systems and simulating fluid dynamics.  The parallel nature of GPUs made them ideal for these computationally intensive tasks.  Modern applications utilize more advanced algorithms and data structures, but the fundamental principle of leveraging parallel processing remains a direct descendant of the techniques presented.  This allowed for increased realism in simulations.


**Code Example 3:  Simplified Particle Update (Conceptual)**

```glsl
// Compute Shader (Particle Update)
#version 460
layout(local_size_x = 64, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;
layout(std430, binding = 0) buffer ParticleBuffer {
    vec4 particles[];
};

uniform float deltaTime;

void main() {
    uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
    //Simple velocity update for brevity
    particles[index].xyz += particles[index].wxyz * deltaTime;  //Update positions based on velocities.
}
```

This conceptual compute shader illustrates how the GPU can efficiently update a large number of particles concurrently. Each workgroup processes a subset of particles independently.   Modern particle systems would incorporate more sophisticated force calculations and collision detection,  but this basic framework mirrors the ideas promoted in *GPU Gems* for utilizing the GPU's parallel processing capabilities to handle many simultaneous particle updates.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I would recommend revisiting the *GPU Gems* series itself, particularly focusing on chapters related to rendering techniques and simulation algorithms.  Further exploration into shader language specifications (HLSL and GLSL) and modern rendering pipelines would complement this understanding.  Consulting specialized literature on real-time rendering and high-performance computing will provide a more comprehensive overview of the field.  Finally, examining source code from open-source rendering engines can offer practical examples of contemporary implementations.


In conclusion, while the specific implementations and algorithms have advanced significantly, the core concepts and principles underlying many modern GPU techniques can be traced back to the foundational work presented in the *GPU Gems* series.  The examples provided demonstrate how these core principles continue to inform modern GPU programming, even as the underlying hardware and software environments have evolved considerably. My years of experience confirm that the fundamental insights from *GPU Gems* remain invaluable to this day.
