The root cause of Docker's failure to start a MySQL service frequently stems from inconsistencies between the Dockerfile's instructions, the exposed ports, and the host system's network configuration.  Over the years, I've debugged countless instances of this issue, and consistently, a careful review of these three areas resolves the problem.

**1. Explanation:**

Docker's functionality relies on a precise mapping between the container's internal environment and the host machine's resources.  When initiating a MySQL container, several critical aspects must align perfectly.  First, the Dockerfile must correctly install and configure MySQL.  This includes specifying the correct version, setting the root password, and ensuring the MySQL server is correctly initialized. Second, the `EXPOSE` directive in the Dockerfile merely *declares* which ports the application *intends* to use within the container. It does not automatically open these ports on the host machine.  This requires the use of the `-p` flag (or `--publish`) during the `docker run` command, establishing the port mapping between the container and the host. Finally, firewall rules on the host machine might block incoming connections to the exposed port, preventing external access even if the port mapping is correct.

The failure to start might manifest in various ways: the container might exit with a non-zero exit code, indicating an internal failure within the MySQL server itself; the container might report a successful start, but external connections fail due to improper port mapping or firewall issues; or the logs might reveal errors related to database initialization or configuration.  A systematic approach involving checking the Dockerfile, the `docker run` command, and the host's firewall rules is essential for effective troubleshooting.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Dockerfile leading to MySQL Initialization Failure**

```dockerfile
FROM mysql:8.0

# Incorrect: Missing root password setup
COPY my.cnf /etc/mysql/conf.d/

CMD ["mysqld_safe"]
```

This Dockerfile omits a crucial step: setting the MySQL root password. Without a password, MySQL initialization will fail, resulting in the container exiting with an error. The `my.cnf` file, while copied, is likely incomplete without password configuration.

**Corrected Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM mysql:8.0

ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecurepassword

COPY my.cnf /etc/mysql/conf.d/

CMD ["mysqld_safe"]
```

This corrected version sets the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable, crucial for MySQL's secure initialization.  The `my.cnf` file should still be appropriately configured.

**Example 2: Mismatched Port Mapping in `docker run` Command**

```bash
docker run -d --name mysql-instance mysql:8.0
```

This command launches a MySQL container but fails to map the MySQL port (typically 3306) to the host machine.  External connections will therefore fail, even if MySQL starts successfully inside the container.

**Corrected `docker run` command:**

```bash
docker run -d --name mysql-instance -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0
```

This corrected command uses the `-p` flag to map port 3306 on the host to port 3306 within the container.  This allows external connections to the MySQL server.

**Example 3: Firewall Blocking Connections**

Even with a correctly configured Dockerfile and `docker run` command, a firewall on the host machine might prevent access to the exposed port.  Consider the following scenario: a correctly running MySQL container and a proper port mapping, yet external connections still fail.

To verify, you would inspect the firewall rules (the specific commands depend on the operating system; examples include `iptables -L` on Linux and checking the Windows Firewall rules via the control panel).  If port 3306 is blocked, you need to add a rule to allow incoming connections on that port.  For example, on Linux using `iptables`:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
```

This command adds a rule to the INPUT chain, allowing TCP traffic on port 3306. Remember to save the firewall rules after making changes. This command is illustrative and might need adjustments based on your specific firewall setup and Linux distribution.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For more comprehensive understanding, I recommend consulting the official Docker documentation, focusing particularly on the sections related to networking, port mappings, and image building.  The MySQL documentation provides critical insights into the server's configuration and initialization process.  Finally, mastering the use of the `docker logs` command is paramount for diagnosing container issues.  Analyzing the logs often reveals the precise cause of the failure, eliminating trial and error.  The ability to meticulously review these resources and effectively interpret logs is more valuable than any single troubleshooting guide. Through years of experience, I've found this systematic approach ensures a swift resolution.
