TensorFlow 1.x's debugging capabilities, particularly concerning real-time value inspection during training, differ significantly from the more streamlined approaches available in TensorFlow 2.x.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models in TensorFlow 1.x highlighted the necessity for robust, yet minimally intrusive, debugging strategies.  Directly printing values within the training loop often proved inefficient, leading to performance bottlenecks.  The preferred methods relied on leveraging TensorFlow's session management and summary operations within a `tf.summary.FileWriter`.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Effective debugging in TensorFlow 1.x during training necessitates careful consideration of the computational graph.  Directly printing values within the training loop using `print()` statements will disrupt the graph execution, severely impacting performance, especially with complex models. Instead, TensorFlow's `tf.summary` module provides a mechanism to log scalar values, histograms, images, and other data to files during training. These logged values can then be visualized using TensorBoard, offering an effective way to monitor training progress and identify potential problems.  This avoids the overhead of frequent data transfers to the console and allows for asynchronous logging, maintaining training efficiency.  The key is to integrate these summary operations strategically within the graph, not disrupt the computational flow with explicit `print` calls within the training loop.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Logging Scalar Values (Loss and Accuracy)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition, optimizer, etc.) ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs/train', sess.graph) #Create summary writer

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch in range(num_batches):
            # ... (fetch training data) ...
            _, loss, accuracy = sess.run([train_op, loss_op, accuracy_op], feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y})

            # Create summaries for loss and accuracy
            loss_summary = tf.Summary(value=[tf.Summary.Value(tag="loss", simple_value=loss)])
            accuracy_summary = tf.Summary(value=[tf.Summary.Value(tag="accuracy", simple_value=accuracy)])


            # Write summaries to the log file
            writer.add_summary(loss_summary, epoch * num_batches + batch)
            writer.add_summary(accuracy_summary, epoch * num_batches + batch)

    writer.close()
```

This example demonstrates logging scalar values—loss and accuracy—during each training batch.  The `tf.Summary` protocol buffer is used to create summaries, which are then written to a log file using the `FileWriter`. The `tag` attribute allows us to distinguish between different scalars, making them easily identifiable in TensorBoard.  The step counter ensures correct chronological ordering.  Note the separation of summary operations from the core training steps – this minimizes performance impact.


**Example 2:  Visualizing Weight Histograms:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition, optimizer, etc.) ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs/train', sess.graph)

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... (training loop) ...

        # Log weight histograms for specific layers
        for var in tf.trainable_variables():
          if "layer1" in var.name: #Example - only layer1 weights
            with tf.name_scope("weight_histograms"):
              tf.summary.histogram(var.name, var)


        merged_summaries = tf.summary.merge_all() #Merge all created summaries.
        summary = sess.run(merged_summaries)
        writer.add_summary(summary, epoch)

    writer.close()
```

This example shows how to log histograms of trainable variables, specifically focusing on the weights of `layer1`.  `tf.summary.histogram` automatically creates a summary for the weight distribution.  The use of `tf.summary.merge_all()` simplifies the process of writing multiple summaries at once. This allows for visualizing the distribution of weights, aiding in detecting issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.  Again, notice the separation of histogram logging from the main training operation to prevent performance degradation.


**Example 3:  Inspecting Intermediate Activations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition, optimizer, etc.) ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs/train', sess.graph)

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch in range(num_batches):
          # ... (fetch training data) ...

          # Log activations of a specific layer using tf.summary.image
          activations = sess.run('layer2/activation:0', feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y}) # Replace with actual layer name

          # Reshape to (batch_size, height, width, channels) if necessary
          activations_reshaped = activations.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) #Example - adjust for your activation shape

          activations_summary = tf.Summary()
          activations_summary.value.add(tag='layer2_activations', image=tf.Summary.Image(encoded_image_string=tf.image.encode_png(activations_reshaped[0]).eval())) #Only shows first image in batch.

          writer.add_summary(activations_summary, epoch * num_batches + batch)

    writer.close()

```

This example demonstrates logging activations of a specific layer using `tf.summary.image`. This is particularly helpful in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to visualize feature maps.  It requires reshaping the activation output to a suitable format for image encoding.  Note that only the first image of the batch is logged for demonstration; in practice, you might need more sophisticated methods for handling multiple images or a sampling strategy to avoid overwhelming the logs.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation, particularly the sections on `tf.summary` and TensorBoard, are invaluable resources. Thoroughly understanding the concept of computational graphs and session management within TensorFlow 1.x is essential for effective debugging.  Books focusing on TensorFlow's fundamentals and practical applications provide more in-depth explanations and advanced techniques.  Finally, carefully reviewing examples from established repositories focusing on TensorFlow 1.x model building can provide valuable insights into practical debugging approaches.
