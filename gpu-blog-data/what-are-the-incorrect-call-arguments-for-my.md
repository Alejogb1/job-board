It's often the subtle mismatches in data shape and type that lead to silent failures when working with Recurrent Neural Networks for text generation, particularly those involving Keras or TensorFlow. I've spent considerable time debugging these nuances during the development of a text summarization module and have found argument discrepancies to be a frequent culprit. The problem frequently does not throw outright errors, leading to perplexing results rather than immediate crashes. This is because underlying numerical operations often proceed even when shape compatibility is not perfect, just producing garbage outputs.

The core issue revolves around the expected input and output formats of the various layers and functions used in the RNN pipeline. Typically, an RNN for text generation operates by taking a sequence of numerical tokens, usually encoded as integers, feeds these through embedding and recurrent layers, then uses a fully connected dense layer to output a probability distribution over the vocabulary. The problems with call arguments mostly manifest themselves around the input to embedding layers, the internal states of recurrent layers, and the final output for generation. These manifest as problems in several areas.

First, the embedding layer expects an input of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, containing integer indices representing the tokens. Incorrect input here includes feeding a single sequence of shape `(sequence_length,)`, or providing floating point values or one-hot encoded vectors. Feeding a single sequence forces the system to treat your tokens as the batch dimension, creating nonsense. Floating-point values will similarly cause the embedding lookup to return garbage, and feeding one-hot vectors, while a valid input, is the wrong way to represent tokens and is wasteful since this is what the embedding layer performs internally. Secondly, the output of the embedding layer will have shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension)`, where the embedding dimension is defined by the argument during layer creation. This output's shape and data type must be what the following recurrent layers expect. A mismatch here is that the recurrent layer expects the embedding's output not as a 2-dimensional matrix.

Thirdly, recurrent layers like `LSTM` or `GRU` expect input of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension)`, which would be the output of the embedding layer. Incorrect calls might include forgetting to include the embedding output. When stateful recurrent layers are used, the user is responsible for managing the state by creating a zero tensor to start it and saving/updating it after each call. The first call to the recurrent layer expects `initial_state` to be of shape `(batch_size, units)` where units is the number of recurrent cells. Incorrect management can include not specifying an initial state, or incorrectly dimensioning the state based on the number of units. It can also mean not updating the states between predictions, causing the model to use only the first state which might lead to repetitive and nonsensical outputs. Also, be aware that the return shape from RNN cells changes based on the argument `return_sequences`. If this is false, the output is the final state, if it is true then the output is the sequence of hidden states for every time-step.

Finally, the dense output layer requires an input of shape `(batch_size, units)` from the recurrent layer if the `return_sequences` is set to `False`, or `(batch_size, sequence_length, units)` if `return_sequences=True`, or in cases where a time-distributed layer is used to give the sequence of results. The dense layer outputs must be a probability distribution with the dimensions `(batch_size, vocabulary_size)`. Incorrect calls might include feeding the entire output sequence where the final layer only expects one prediction at a time, or in the case of the time-distributed dense, forgetting to specify the sequence length of the output that is equivalent to the length of the recurrent sequence. These dimensional errors can generate the most difficult to identify issues as the code may run but it may give garbage outputs which can only be fixed by tracing the dimensions.

Here are three code examples demonstrating typical incorrect argument usages, and their corrected counterparts:

**Example 1: Incorrect Embedding Layer Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assuming a vocabulary size of 10 and sequence length of 5
vocab_size = 10
seq_length = 5
embedding_dim = 16

# Incorrect input: single sequence
incorrect_input = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(seq_length))
incorrect_input = tf.convert_to_tensor(incorrect_input, dtype=tf.int32)

embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

try:
  incorrect_output = embedding_layer(incorrect_input)
  print("Embedding output shape (incorrect):", incorrect_output.shape) # this will output (5, 16) not (1,5,16)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error using incorrect tensor shape. {e}")


# Correct Input: batch of sequences
batch_size = 3
correct_input = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, seq_length))
correct_input = tf.convert_to_tensor(correct_input, dtype=tf.int32)

correct_output = embedding_layer(correct_input)
print("Embedding output shape (correct):", correct_output.shape)
```

**Commentary:** The initial code attempts to pass a single sequence of token indices to the embedding layer, which interprets it as a batch size. The corrected version provides a batch of sequences, resulting in the correct output shape `(batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim)`. The error occurs within TensorFlow/Keras not the python interpreter, this means that the error must be discovered by inspecting your code outputs.

**Example 2: Incorrect Recurrent Layer State Management**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

vocab_size = 10
seq_length = 5
embedding_dim = 16
rnn_units = 32
batch_size = 2

# Create embedding and lstm layers.
embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_state = True)


#Incorrect call:  no initial state is supplied.
input_seq = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, seq_length))
input_seq = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_seq, dtype=tf.int32)
embedded_input = embedding_layer(input_seq)
try:
  incorrect_lstm_output, incorrect_state_h, incorrect_state_c = lstm_layer(embedded_input)
  print("LSTM Output shape (incorrect)", incorrect_lstm_output.shape) # the output of the first call will be random as it defaults to a zero state and the following call will also have problems because the states are incorrect
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error during lstm state management. {e}")



# Correct call: manage initial state
initial_state_h = tf.zeros((batch_size, rnn_units))
initial_state_c = tf.zeros((batch_size, rnn_units))


correct_lstm_output, correct_state_h, correct_state_c = lstm_layer(embedded_input, initial_state=[initial_state_h, initial_state_c])
print("LSTM Output shape (correct)", correct_lstm_output.shape)
# For next sequence, feed the saved states
input_seq_2 = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, seq_length))
input_seq_2 = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_seq_2, dtype=tf.int32)
embedded_input_2 = embedding_layer(input_seq_2)
correct_lstm_output_2, correct_state_h_2, correct_state_c_2 = lstm_layer(embedded_input_2, initial_state=[correct_state_h, correct_state_c])
print("LSTM Output shape (correct, second call)", correct_lstm_output_2.shape) # This will give a much more consistent result
```

**Commentary:** The incorrect version omits the initial state argument for the LSTM layer. Stateful RNNs require managing these states between sequences for proper continuity. The corrected version initializes the necessary initial state as a zero vector, then uses the state outputs from each call of the lstm to give a continuous sequence. The lack of initial states causes the first result to be random, and subsequent results will also be random and non-sensical if the states are not saved and used again.

**Example 3: Incorrect Dense Output Layer Input Shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

vocab_size = 10
seq_length = 5
embedding_dim = 16
rnn_units = 32
batch_size = 2
lstm_return_seq = False

embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_sequences = lstm_return_seq)
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax')


input_seq = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, seq_length))
input_seq = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_seq, dtype=tf.int32)

embedded_input = embedding_layer(input_seq)
lstm_output = lstm_layer(embedded_input)


#Incorrect call: the lstm output is `(batch_size, units)` but is expected to be sequence
try:
    incorrect_output = dense_layer(lstm_output) # shape = (batch_size, vocab_size)
    print("Dense output shape (incorrect):", incorrect_output.shape)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error with dense layer input: {e}")



lstm_return_seq = True
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_sequences = lstm_return_seq)
lstm_output = lstm_layer(embedded_input)

try:
  incorrect_output = dense_layer(lstm_output)  # shape = (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
  print("Dense output shape (incorrect):", incorrect_output.shape)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error with dense layer input: {e}")

#Correct output: a single time step is given to dense
correct_output = dense_layer(lstm_output[:, -1, :]) #shape = (batch_size, vocab_size)
print("Dense output shape (correct):", correct_output.shape)

#Correct output: TimeDistributed used
time_distributed_dense = tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax'))
correct_output_distributed = time_distributed_dense(lstm_output) #shape = (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
print("Dense output shape (correct, time distributed):", correct_output_distributed.shape)
```

**Commentary:** The code above provides an example where the output of an RNN is incorrect based on the setting of the `return_sequences` parameter. In the first case `return_sequences` is False, and the output is only the last step of the RNN `(batch_size, units)`. However, the output is correct for this configuration. In the second case the `return_sequences` is True and the expected output would be the entire sequence of output states `(batch_size, sequence_length, units)`. The error here is that the dense layer only expects an input of `(batch_size, units)` if the `return_sequences=False`. The `(batch_size, units)` output of an RNN can be used to generate a single token. The correct output is achieved by taking the last index of the sequence, and passing it to the dense layer. Alternatively a `TimeDistributed` dense layer can be used if each step of the RNN sequence needs to be classified, such as is common in sequence-to-sequence models.

When debugging RNN text generation, careful examination of tensor shapes between each layer call is critical. The `tf.shape(tensor)` method can provide insight during development, and ensure shapes remain consistent. These types of errors can manifest without the program crashing, so the debugging process can be time-consuming. Ensure the types of tensors being given to the layers are what they expect as this is also a frequent cause of problems.

For further study, resources discussing RNN architectures for sequence modeling and the Keras API are beneficial. Look for documentation describing `Embedding`, `LSTM`, `GRU`, `Dense` and `TimeDistributed` layers. Tutorials on text generation using TensorFlow are also a good reference, with particular attention to code snippets illustrating tensor transformations and initial state management. Also, read the API documentation for the used libraries, as these are always the best way to understand function inputs and outputs, especially in the case of neural networks with their particular types and shapes.
