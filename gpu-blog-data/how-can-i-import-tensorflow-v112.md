TensorFlow 1.12's import process differs significantly from later versions due to its reliance on a now-deprecated `tf` namespace and the absence of the eager execution paradigm prevalent in TensorFlow 2.x.  This necessitates a distinct approach involving specific installation methods and import statements.  My experience troubleshooting compatibility issues within legacy projects heavily utilized this version compels me to emphasize the importance of environment isolation and careful dependency management.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Successfully importing TensorFlow 1.12 necessitates several steps:  Firstly, ensure the correct version is installed within a Python environment isolated from any TensorFlow 2.x installations. This prevents version conflicts that commonly lead to `ImportError` exceptions.  Virtual environments (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) are crucial for managing these discrepancies.

Secondly, the import statement itself requires explicit specification of the TensorFlow 1.x namespace.  Unlike TensorFlow 2.x which encourages direct imports (e.g., `import tensorflow as tf`), version 1.12 mandates `import tensorflow as tf`.  While seemingly trivial, omitting this detail is a frequent source of import errors, particularly when working with codebases initially developed under TensorFlow 1.x.

Finally, ensuring all associated dependencies are compatible is vital. TensorFlow 1.12's compatibility is inherently restricted, unlike more recent versions with broader package support.  Carefully examining the `requirements.txt` file (if available) of the project requiring TensorFlow 1.12 allows the identification of potentially conflicting packages needing attention.  Using `pip freeze` within the isolated environment will reveal installed packages, aiding in identifying any such conflicts.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Import and Tensor Creation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check TensorFlow version (crucial for verification)
print(tf.__version__)

# Create a simple tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(tensor)

# Session initiation (mandatory in TF1.x for execution)
sess = tf.Session()
result = sess.run(tensor)
print(result)
sess.close()
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the fundamental import and the instantiation of a simple tensor. Note the explicit use of `tf.Session()` for executing the operation; this was essential in TensorFlow 1.x and is absent in TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution model. The `sess.close()` call is crucial for resource management, preventing potential memory leaks.  Verification of the installed TensorFlow version is a best practice.

**Example 2: Placeholder and Variable Usage:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 3])

# Define a variable
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))

# Define the operation
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

# Initialize all variables
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# Session initiation
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)

# Feed data to the placeholder and run the session
input_data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
output = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: input_data})
print(output)
sess.close()
```

*Commentary:*  This exemplifies the use of placeholders and variables – core components of computational graphs in TensorFlow 1.x.  Placeholders serve as inputs, while variables store model parameters.  The `tf.global_variables_initializer()` function is critical; it initializes all variables before execution.  The `feed_dict` argument supplies data to the placeholder during session execution. Again, the session must be explicitly closed.  This pattern is distinctly different from TensorFlow 2.x, which handles variable initialization and execution more implicitly.


**Example 3:  Simple Neural Network with TF1.12:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model
n_features = 10
n_classes = 2

X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_features])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_classes])

W = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([n_features, n_classes]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_classes]))

# Define the prediction
pred = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(X, W) + b)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
cost = tf.reduce_mean(-tf.reduce_sum(y * tf.log(pred), reduction_indices=1))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(cost)

# Training parameters
training_epochs = 100
display_step = 10

# Generate some sample data (replace with your actual data)
n_samples = 100
X_data = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)
y_data = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(n_samples, n_classes))
y_data = np.eye(2)[y_data] # One-hot encoding


# Initialize the variables
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# Launch the session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init)

    for epoch in range(training_epochs):
        _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={X: X_data, y: y_data})

        if (epoch + 1) % display_step == 0:
            print("Epoch:", '%04d' % (epoch+1), "cost=", "{:.9f}".format(c))

    print("Optimization Finished!")

```

*Commentary:* This example showcases a rudimentary neural network implemented using TensorFlow 1.12.  It demonstrates how to define a model, specify a loss function (cross-entropy), choose an optimizer (Gradient Descent), and conduct training.  Note the use of placeholders for input (X) and output (y) data and the generation of sample data for illustrative purposes. The `with tf.Session() as sess:` context manager elegantly handles session management, automatically closing the session upon exiting the block.  This practice is strongly recommended for efficient resource utilization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation for version 1.12 (if still archived),  "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili, and "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron offer valuable insights into TensorFlow 1.x concepts and best practices.  Focusing on materials specific to TensorFlow 1.x is vital as later publications may not address the nuances of this version.  Furthermore, exploring archived Stack Overflow discussions relating to TensorFlow 1.12 can provide solutions to specific encountered challenges.  Consulting the documentation of any ancillary libraries used in conjunction with TensorFlow 1.12 is also crucial.
