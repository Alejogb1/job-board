Cosine similarity, a measure of the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors, finds extensive application in information retrieval and natural language processing.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems at a previous employer highlighted the crucial role of efficient cosine similarity calculations within TensorFlow for handling high-dimensional data.  Direct computation using the standard formula becomes computationally expensive for large datasets, necessitating optimized approaches leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

Cosine similarity is computed by taking the dot product of two vectors and dividing it by the product of their magnitudes.  In mathematical notation:

`Cosine Similarity(A, B) = A . B / (||A|| * ||B||)`

where A and B are vectors, `.` represents the dot product, and `|| ||` denotes the magnitude (Euclidean norm).  The result ranges from -1 (perfect dissimilarity) to +1 (perfect similarity), with 0 indicating no linear correlation.  Calculating this directly in TensorFlow for large vectors is inefficient.  TensorFlow's optimized linear algebra operations offer significant performance gains.  Specifically, using `tf.tensordot` for the dot product and `tf.norm` for the magnitudes provides a more efficient approach compared to manual calculations with loops.  Furthermore, for large-scale computations, leveraging TensorFlow's GPU acceleration significantly reduces processing time.  For sparse vectors, which are prevalent in text processing applications, specialized techniques like using sparse matrices within TensorFlow are necessary to minimize memory usage and improve calculation speed.  This consideration is particularly important when dealing with extremely high-dimensional data common in areas like document similarity analysis or user preference modeling.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Cosine Similarity Calculation:** This example demonstrates a straightforward implementation suitable for smaller vectors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cosine_similarity_basic(vector_a, vector_b):
  """Calculates cosine similarity between two TensorFlow tensors.

  Args:
    vector_a: A TensorFlow tensor representing the first vector.
    vector_b: A TensorFlow tensor representing the second vector.

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow scalar representing the cosine similarity.  Returns NaN if either vector has zero magnitude.
  """
  dot_product = tf.tensordot(vector_a, vector_b, axes=1)
  magnitude_a = tf.norm(vector_a)
  magnitude_b = tf.norm(vector_b)
  similarity = tf.divide(dot_product, magnitude_a * magnitude_b, name="cosine_similarity")
  return similarity


vector_a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
vector_b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
similarity = cosine_similarity_basic(vector_a, vector_b)
print(similarity) # Output will be a TensorFlow scalar representing the cosine similarity.

```

**Example 2:  Cosine Similarity with Batch Processing:** This example shows how to efficiently compute cosine similarity for multiple vector pairs using TensorFlow's batching capabilities. This is vital for large datasets.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cosine_similarity_batch(matrix_a, matrix_b):
  """Calculates cosine similarity between batches of vectors.

  Args:
    matrix_a: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (N, D) where N is the number of vectors and D is the dimension.
    matrix_b: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (N, D) where N is the number of vectors and D is the dimension.

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor of shape (N,) containing the cosine similarity for each pair of vectors. Returns NaN if a vector has zero magnitude.
  """

  dot_products = tf.reduce_sum(matrix_a * matrix_b, axis=1)
  magnitude_a = tf.norm(matrix_a, axis=1)
  magnitude_b = tf.norm(matrix_b, axis=1)
  similarity = tf.divide(dot_products, magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
  return similarity

matrix_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
matrix_b = tf.constant([[7.0, 8.0, 9.0], [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]])
similarities = cosine_similarity_batch(matrix_a, matrix_b)
print(similarities) # Output will be a TensorFlow tensor of shape (2,)

```

**Example 3: Handling Sparse Vectors:** This example demonstrates a more advanced approach using sparse tensors, critical for efficiency with high-dimensional sparse data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cosine_similarity_sparse(sparse_a, sparse_b):
    """Calculates cosine similarity between two sparse TensorFlow tensors.

    Args:
        sparse_a: A sparse TensorFlow tensor representing the first vector.
        sparse_b: A sparse TensorFlow tensor representing the second vector.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow scalar representing the cosine similarity. Returns NaN if either vector has zero magnitude.
    """

    dot_product = tf.sparse.reduce_sum(tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul(tf.sparse.expand_dims(sparse_a, 1), tf.sparse.expand_dims(sparse_b, 0)))
    magnitude_a = tf.norm(sparse_a)
    magnitude_b = tf.norm(sparse_b)
    similarity = tf.divide(dot_product, magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
    return similarity


indices_a = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2,2]]
values_a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
shape_a = [3, 3]
sparse_a = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=indices_a, values=values_a, dense_shape=shape_a)


indices_b = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2,2]]
values_b = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
shape_b = [3, 3]
sparse_b = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=indices_b, values=values_b, dense_shape=shape_b)


similarity = cosine_similarity_sparse(sparse_a,sparse_b)
print(similarity)
```

3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on linear algebra operations and sparse tensor manipulation, are invaluable resources.  Furthermore, exploring publications on large-scale similarity search and vector databases can provide additional insights into optimized methods and best practices.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra fundamentals is also crucial for effectively utilizing and understanding these techniques.  Finally,  reviewing research papers focusing on efficient similarity calculations for high-dimensional data will enrich your understanding of advanced approaches.
