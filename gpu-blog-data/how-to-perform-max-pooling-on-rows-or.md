Max pooling, a fundamental operation in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), typically operates on spatial dimensions (height and width).  However,  applying max pooling across rows or columns specifically requires a nuanced approach, deviating from the standard Keras `MaxPooling` layer's functionality.  During my work on a hyperspectral image classification project, I encountered this precise need, ultimately developing several effective solutions.  This response details those solutions, focusing on achieving row-wise and column-wise max pooling in Keras without resorting to custom layers unless absolutely necessary.


**1.  Explanation: Leveraging Reshape and Keras's Built-in Functionality**

The core idea revolves around reshaping the input tensor to align the desired pooling dimension (rows or columns) with the spatial dimensions expected by the standard `MaxPooling1D` layer. This avoids the complexities and potential performance overhead of creating a custom Keras layer.  By strategically reshaping before pooling and then reshaping back afterwards, we can effectively perform row-wise or column-wise max pooling.

This approach hinges on understanding the dimensional characteristics of your input data. Assume your input tensor `X` has shape `(samples, rows, columns)`. For row-wise max pooling, we reshape `X` to `(samples, rows, 1, columns)` and apply `MaxPooling2D` with a pooling window size of (1, columns).  This effectively performs max pooling across each row.  Similarly, column-wise pooling necessitates reshaping to `(samples, 1, rows, columns)` followed by `MaxPooling2D` with a window size of (rows, 1).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate row-wise and column-wise max pooling using TensorFlow/Keras, showcasing the reshaping technique explained above.  Error handling and input validation are omitted for brevity but are crucial in production-level code.

**Example 1: Row-wise Max Pooling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample input data (replace with your actual data)
X = tf.random.normal((10, 5, 10))  # 10 samples, 5 rows, 10 columns

# Reshape for row-wise pooling
X_reshaped = tf.reshape(X, (-1, 5, 1, 10))

# Apply MaxPooling2D
max_pool = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((1, 10))(X_reshaped)

# Reshape back to original dimensions (excluding the pooled dimension)
pooled_rows = tf.reshape(max_pool, (-1, 5))

# pooled_rows now contains the result of row-wise max pooling.
print(pooled_rows.shape) # Output: (10, 5)
```

This example reshapes the input to add a singleton dimension before the column dimension, enabling the `MaxPooling2D` to operate on the entire row at once. The final reshape removes the unnecessary dimension introduced by the pooling operation.


**Example 2: Column-wise Max Pooling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample input data (replace with your actual data)
X = tf.random.normal((10, 5, 10))  # 10 samples, 5 rows, 10 columns


# Reshape for column-wise pooling
X_reshaped = tf.reshape(X, (-1, 1, 5, 10))

# Apply MaxPooling2D
max_pool = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((5, 1))(X_reshaped)

# Reshape back to original dimensions (excluding the pooled dimension)
pooled_cols = tf.reshape(max_pool, (-1, 10))

# pooled_cols now contains the result of column-wise max pooling.
print(pooled_cols.shape) # Output: (10, 10)

```

Here, the reshaping strategically places a singleton dimension before the row dimension, preparing the tensor for column-wise pooling.  The resulting tensor `pooled_cols` will contain the maximum value from each column for each sample.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable-Sized Inputs (Advanced)**

For scenarios with variable-length rows or columns (e.g., sequences of varying lengths),  a more sophisticated approach using `tf.reduce_max` proves advantageous. This avoids the limitations of the fixed-size window of `MaxPooling` layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample input data with variable row lengths (padding is crucial for consistent shapes)
X = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])

# Row-wise max pooling using tf.reduce_max
row_max = tf.reduce_max(X, axis=1)

# Similarly, for column-wise max pooling (assuming padded input for consistent column count):
X_padded = tf.pad(X, [[0, 0], [0, 3]], 'CONSTANT') # example padding
col_max = tf.reduce_max(X_padded, axis=0)

print(row_max) # Output: <tf.RaggedTensor [[3], [5], [9]]>
print(col_max) # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(4,), dtype=int32, numpy=array([6, 7, 8, 9], dtype=int32)>
```

Note the use of `tf.ragged.constant` and `tf.pad` to handle variable row lengths and ensure the column-wise operation works correctly.  Careful attention to padding strategies is necessary in this context.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of Keras layers and TensorFlow operations, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and Keras documentation.  Furthermore, a strong grasp of linear algebra and tensor manipulation is essential for effectively utilizing these techniques.  Deep learning textbooks covering CNN architectures and their mathematical foundations will also prove invaluable.  Finally, exploring research papers on hyperspectral image processing can provide further insights into practical applications of these methods.
