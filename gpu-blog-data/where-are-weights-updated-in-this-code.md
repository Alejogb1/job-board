The crux of identifying weight updates in neural network training lies not merely in locating the line of code performing the update, but in understanding the computational graph and the backpropagation algorithm.  My experience optimizing large-scale language models has highlighted the subtle nuances involved; a seemingly straightforward update operation can mask complex dependencies and parallelization strategies.  The location depends heavily on the framework and implementation, but generally involves a gradient calculation followed by an application of an optimizer.  Let's examine this systematically.

**1. Clear Explanation of Weight Updates in Backpropagation**

Backpropagation, the cornerstone of training feedforward neural networks, fundamentally relies on the chain rule of calculus.  It iteratively calculates gradients – the rate of change of the loss function with respect to each weight – by propagating the error backward through the network.  This gradient signifies the direction and magnitude of adjustment needed for each weight.  The update process itself involves taking a step in the direction opposite to the gradient, scaled by a learning rate, a hyperparameter controlling the step size.

The location of the weight update is intrinsically linked to the optimizer employed.  Optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop handle this update differently.  Regardless of the optimizer, the essential elements are:

* **Forward Pass:** The input data propagates through the network, producing activations at each layer.  No weights are updated during this phase.
* **Loss Calculation:** The network's output is compared to the true target values using a loss function (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy).  This quantifies the network's error.
* **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):**  The gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights are computed using the chain rule. This is where the gradient calculation happens.  Automatic differentiation libraries significantly simplify this step.
* **Weight Update:** The optimizer uses the calculated gradients to update the network's weights.  This usually involves subtracting (or sometimes adding, depending on the optimization algorithm) a scaled gradient from the current weight values.  This is where the weights are *actually* updated.


The order is crucial: forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and *then* the weight update.  The weight update happens *after* the gradient calculation is complete for the entire network.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's consider three different scenarios illustrating weight update locations.

**Example 1:  Simple SGD Implementation (Python with NumPy)**

```python
import numpy as np

class SimpleNet:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        self.W1 = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.b1 = np.zeros(hidden_size)
        self.W2 = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.b2 = np.zeros(output_size)
        self.learning_rate = 0.01

    def forward(self, x):
        self.z1 = np.dot(x, self.W1) + self.b1
        self.a1 = np.tanh(self.z1)  # Activation function
        self.z2 = np.dot(self.a1, self.W2) + self.b2
        return self.z2

    def backward(self, x, y, output):
        delta2 = output - y
        dW2 = np.dot(self.a1.T, delta2)
        db2 = np.sum(delta2, axis=0)
        delta1 = np.dot(delta2, self.W2.T) * (1 - np.tanh(self.z1)**2)
        dW1 = np.dot(x.T, delta1)
        db1 = np.sum(delta1, axis=0)
        return dW1, db1, dW2, db2

    def update(self, dW1, db1, dW2, db2):
        self.W1 -= self.learning_rate * dW1
        self.b1 -= self.learning_rate * db1
        self.W2 -= self.learning_rate * dW2
        self.b2 -= self.learning_rate * db2


# Example usage:
net = SimpleNet(2, 4, 1)
x = np.array([[1, 2]])
y = np.array([[3]])
output = net.forward(x)
dW1, db1, dW2, db2 = net.backward(x, y, output)
net.update(dW1, db1, dW2, db2) # Weight update happens here
```

In this example, the `update` method explicitly shows weight updates after the gradients are calculated in the `backward` method.  This is a very basic, manually implemented SGD optimizer.

**Example 2: Using a High-Level Framework (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 4),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.Linear(4, 1)
)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) #Optimizer handles updates

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    x = torch.tensor([[1., 2.]])
    y = torch.tensor([[3.]])
    output = model(x)
    loss = criterion(output, y)
    optimizer.zero_grad() #Clear previous gradients
    loss.backward() # Calculate gradients
    optimizer.step() # Update weights. This is where the magic happens.
```

Here, PyTorch's `optimizer.step()` method handles the weight update. The `backward()` method computes the gradients, and then the optimizer applies the update based on its specific algorithm.  The weight update is abstracted away from the user.

**Example 3:  TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='tanh', input_shape=(2,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    x = tf.constant([[1., 2.]])
    y = tf.constant([[3.]])
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        output = model(x)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(output - y)) #MSE Loss

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables)) #Update weights here.
```

Similar to PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras abstracts the weight update.  The `optimizer.apply_gradients` function utilizes the computed gradients to update the model's weights. The location is within the training loop, following the gradient calculation.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend exploring resources covering:

*   **Backpropagation algorithm:**  A thorough grasp of the mathematical foundations is crucial.
*   **Automatic differentiation:**  Understanding how libraries like Autograd (PyTorch) and TensorFlow's `GradientTape` compute gradients efficiently is important.
*   **Optimization algorithms:**  Study various optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.) and their differences.  Understanding their update rules will clarify the weight update process.  Examining the source code of popular optimizers can provide invaluable insights.
*   **Deep learning frameworks:**  Familiarize yourself with the internal workings of frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, specifically how they manage and update model parameters.


By mastering these concepts, you'll gain a far more comprehensive understanding of where and how weights are updated in various neural network implementations, extending beyond simple examples to more complex architectures and scenarios.  The crucial takeaway is that while the specific line of code varies, the underlying principle remains consistent: gradients are computed, and then an optimizer uses these gradients to adjust the weights.
