The fundamental difference between Keras and TensorFlow hyperparameters lies in their scope and level of abstraction.  While TensorFlow encompasses a broader range of hyperparameters governing lower-level operations like optimization algorithms and graph execution, Keras primarily exposes a higher-level, model-specific set that impacts the training process of the neural network itself.  This distinction stems from Keras' role as a higher-level API built on top of TensorFlow (or other backends like Theano or CNTK).  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects extensively utilizing both frameworks highlighted this crucial difference repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, at its core, is a numerical computation library with a focus on building and executing computational graphs. Its hyperparameters directly influence how these graphs are constructed and optimized. This includes parameters controlling the gradient descent algorithm (learning rate, momentum, etc.), the choice of optimizer (Adam, SGD, RMSprop), session configuration (inter-op and intra-op parallelism), and memory management strategies. These are low-level settings that affect computational efficiency and resource utilization.  You're essentially configuring the engine itself.

Keras, however, abstracts away much of this low-level complexity.  You specify the model architecture (layers, activation functions, etc.), and Keras handles the translation of this specification into an underlying TensorFlow graph.  The hyperparameters in Keras are primarily related to the training process of the model you've defined. This includes parameters such as the batch size, the number of epochs, the choice of loss function, and various regularization techniques (dropout rate, L1/L2 regularization strength).  You are adjusting the vehicle, not its engine.

Therefore, TensorFlow hyperparameters influence the *how* of computation, whereas Keras hyperparameters predominantly influence the *what* of model training. While some overlap exists (e.g., the choice of optimizer can be specified in both), Keras often provides a simplified interface, hiding the underlying TensorFlow settings and prioritizing ease of use and experimentation with model architecture and training.  Over the years, I've found this distinction crucial for managing the complexity of large models â€“ Keras helps me focus on the high-level architecture and training, leaving the finer computational details to the underlying TensorFlow.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow Optimizer Hyperparameters**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow optimizer hyperparameters
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-07)

# ...rest of the TensorFlow model definition...

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the direct specification of Adam optimizer hyperparameters within TensorFlow. `learning_rate`, `beta_1`, `beta_2`, and `epsilon` are all directly controlled. This level of granular control is typical for TensorFlow and allows for fine-tuning the optimization process.  I frequently leveraged this level of detail when working on models requiring highly specific optimization strategies.

**Example 2: Keras Model Hyperparameters**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Keras model hyperparameters
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates how Keras handles hyperparameters.  `epochs` and `batch_size` directly influence the training loop.  The optimizer (`'adam'`) is specified, but the underlying hyperparameters of the Adam optimizer are not directly controlled; Keras uses its defaults. The focus is on the model's architecture and training process. During my development of a convolutional neural network for medical image analysis, this simplified interface was invaluable for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different architectural configurations.


**Example 3:  Overlapping Hyperparameters and Customizing in Keras**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Customizing Adam optimizer within Keras
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0005, beta_1=0.95) # Overriding default values.

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64)
```

*Commentary:*  This example shows how, even in Keras, you can access and modify some hyperparameters associated with the underlying TensorFlow optimizers.  Instead of relying on the Keras default Adam settings, we instantiate an Adam optimizer object with adjusted `learning_rate` and `beta_1` values. This bridges the gap, offering greater control within the simplified Keras environment. My experience suggests that this approach is helpful when fine-tuning performance requires adjustments beyond the basic Keras settings but avoids the significant overhead of directly managing TensorFlow's lower-level configurations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals, I recommend the official TensorFlow documentation and the accompanying tutorials.  For a more practical and application-oriented approach to Keras, I suggest exploring the Keras documentation and several well-regarded books on deep learning, focusing on sections devoted to practical model building and hyperparameter tuning.  Finally,  familiarity with numerical optimization algorithms is essential for a thorough grasp of the underlying mechanisms involved.  A strong mathematical background, particularly in linear algebra and calculus, is beneficial for understanding the impact of these hyperparameters.
