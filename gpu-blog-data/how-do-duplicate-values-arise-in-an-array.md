Duplicate values in an array after CUDA computations frequently stem from a combination of thread-level parallelism and the nature of memory access patterns, particularly when dealing with data-dependent writes to shared or global memory without careful synchronization mechanisms. It’s less about inherent CUDA problems and more about how concurrent operations from multiple threads can interfere with each other during update steps. I've spent a considerable amount of time debugging these issues across various scientific simulations and data processing pipelines.

A core aspect to understand is that threads in a CUDA kernel execute concurrently on the GPU. If multiple threads are tasked with modifying the same memory location without proper coordination, a race condition can occur. Let’s say, for instance, that you're performing a reduction operation – summing array elements – a common operation in many CUDA programs. If each thread adds its local sum to the same shared memory location without proper locking or atomic operations, some increments might be lost due to overwriting. This lack of guaranteed atomicity can lead to data loss and consequently, duplicate final results where we expected individual distinct contributions. Further complicating this, when allocating arrays on the GPU, it is important to ensure correct bounds, sizes, and data types are used, or memory corruption can result and lead to repeated incorrect values.

To illustrate this more concretely, consider an example where we attempt to implement a simplistic parallel accumulation on an array. We will divide the array into parts for each block, and each block sums a part and saves the final sum to a global array indexed by the block id. The below first example depicts the initial problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void bad_accumulation(float *input, float *output, int size) {
    int blockId = blockIdx.x;
    int threadId = threadIdx.x;

    int start = (blockId * blockDim.x);
    int end = start + blockDim.x;
    
    float localSum = 0;
    for (int i = start + threadId; i < end; i+= blockDim.x) {
        if (i < size){
            localSum += input[i];
        }
    }
    
    output[blockId] = localSum; //Potential race condition here
}


int main() {
    int size = 100;
    int blocksize = 16;
    int gridsize = (size+blocksize-1)/blocksize;


    float *h_input = new float[size];
    float *h_output = new float[gridsize];

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        h_input[i] = (float)(i + 1); // Initializing input array with distinct values
    }

    float *d_input, *d_output;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, gridsize * sizeof(float));
    cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_output, h_output, gridsize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    bad_accumulation<<<gridsize, blocksize>>>(d_input, d_output, size);
    cudaMemcpy(h_output, d_output, gridsize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Print the results
    for (int i=0; i<gridsize; i++){
        std::cout << "Block: " << i << " sum " << h_output[i] << std::endl;
    }


    cudaFree(d_input);
    cudaFree(d_output);
    delete[] h_input;
    delete[] h_output;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, each thread computes its local contribution to the sum, which is correct and has no duplicate values in its intermediate result. However, when each block stores its local sums in `output`, all threads in a block may write concurrently to the `output[blockId]` location if it is not thread 0. The result is that the value written is unpredictable and will be some mix of the different results the threads in a block attempted to store. When this value is copied back, we may see that multiple blocks have the same values because their output was randomly overwritten during the operation.

To mitigate this, we need to implement synchronization within each block to ensure that only one thread writes to memory at a time. A common way to achieve this is to use shared memory. We can allocate shared memory per block, sum in shared memory per block, and then have one designated thread write the final block sum to global memory after the shared memory sums are complete. Here’s how we would modify our example with shared memory.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void shared_memory_accumulation(float *input, float *output, int size) {
    int blockId = blockIdx.x;
    int threadId = threadIdx.x;
    
    extern __shared__ float s_sum[]; // Declare shared memory

    int start = (blockId * blockDim.x);
    int end = start + blockDim.x;
    float localSum = 0;

    for (int i = start + threadId; i < end; i+= blockDim.x) {
        if (i < size){
            localSum += input[i];
        }
    }
    s_sum[threadId] = localSum;
    __syncthreads();
    
    if(blockDim.x>1)
    {
        for(int offset=blockDim.x/2; offset>0; offset = offset/2)
        {
            if(threadId < offset)
            {
                s_sum[threadId] += s_sum[threadId + offset];
            }
            __syncthreads();
        }
    }
    
    if(threadId == 0) {
        output[blockId] = s_sum[0];
    }
}


int main() {
    int size = 100;
    int blocksize = 16;
    int gridsize = (size+blocksize-1)/blocksize;


    float *h_input = new float[size];
    float *h_output = new float[gridsize];

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        h_input[i] = (float)(i + 1); // Initializing input array with distinct values
    }

    float *d_input, *d_output;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, gridsize * sizeof(float));
    cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_output, h_output, gridsize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    shared_memory_accumulation<<<gridsize, blocksize,blocksize*sizeof(float)>>>(d_input, d_output, size);
    cudaMemcpy(h_output, d_output, gridsize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

     // Print the results
    for (int i=0; i<gridsize; i++){
        std::cout << "Block: " << i << " sum " << h_output[i] << std::endl;
    }
    cudaFree(d_input);
    cudaFree(d_output);
    delete[] h_input;
    delete[] h_output;
    return 0;
}
```

In this revised code, each thread contributes to the sum within shared memory. After a barrier synchronization (`__syncthreads()`), the block's data in shared memory is summed using a reduction pattern. This ensures the correct accumulation. Then finally, thread 0 of each block writes to global memory. This avoids the race condition in the previous example and will have distinct sums. The size of the shared memory is passed as the third template argument of the kernel call.

Another situation in which duplicate values can appear is if an algorithm attempts to concurrently write to the same location. For example, if an algorithm maps each input element to some index in an output array, and more than one input element maps to the same output index, then a race condition can occur. Using atomic operations such as atomicAdd, one can avoid the overwrite problem and ensure correct results, but the result may still exhibit the same values.  Here is an example of writing the frequency of elements in an array to an output array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void count_elements(int *input, int *output, int size, int maxValue) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if(i < size) {
       int idx = input[i];
       if (idx >= 0 && idx < maxValue)
         atomicAdd(&output[idx], 1); // atomic operation to avoid race conditions when writing
    }
}


int main() {
    int size = 100;
    int maxValue = 10;
    int blocksize = 32;
    int gridsize = (size+blocksize-1)/blocksize;

    int *h_input = new int[size];
    int *h_output = new int[maxValue];
    for(int i =0; i< size; i++){
       h_input[i] = i%maxValue; // Initializing input with a repeating pattern
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < maxValue; ++i) {
        h_output[i] = 0;
    }

    int *d_input, *d_output;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, maxValue * sizeof(int));

    cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_output, h_output, maxValue * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    count_elements<<<gridsize, blocksize>>>(d_input, d_output, size,maxValue);


    cudaMemcpy(h_output, d_output, maxValue * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Print results
    for(int i = 0; i < maxValue; ++i) {
       std::cout << "Index: " << i << " Count: " << h_output[i] << std::endl;
    }

    cudaFree(d_input);
    cudaFree(d_output);
    delete[] h_input;
    delete[] h_output;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the output array stores the frequency of each value in the input array. While atomic operations are used to avoid race conditions, many values can map to the same output location, therefore, the same value may be observed in more than one location in the output, but this is not a result of race conditions, but expected behavior of the operation.

To summarize, duplicate values post-CUDA computation often arise from data races or incorrect indexing. It is critical to address these by:

1. **Employing proper synchronization:** Using `__syncthreads()` within blocks and carefully structured reduction algorithms.

2. **Utilizing shared memory:** Reduce global memory conflicts by performing computations in fast shared memory when possible.

3. **Understanding atomic operations:** If different threads must update the same location, use atomic operations like `atomicAdd` or `atomicMin`.

4. **Correctly dimensioning and indexing arrays:** Careful planning on the memory layouts and index bounds is critical to preventing overwriting and read/write issues.

5. **Double checking copy operations**: Ensure that data is copied correctly between host and device and that no corruption has occurred.

For further understanding, I recommend consulting textbooks on parallel computing, CUDA programming guides, and online resources such as the NVIDIA developer documentation. Books focusing on high-performance computing can also provide more theoretical context on these parallel memory management issues. Thoroughly examining each step of a CUDA program where shared or global memory is being modified will help identify potential areas where duplicates could occur. Careful planning and implementation of concurrency is key to avoiding this particular issue.
