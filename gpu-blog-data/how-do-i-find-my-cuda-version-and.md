Determining the CUDA version and subversion involves inspecting several system components, primarily focusing on the CUDA toolkit installation and the driver itself.  In my experience troubleshooting GPU compute issues across diverse Linux and Windows systems, inconsistencies between driver and toolkit versions have been a recurring source of errors.  Therefore, a multi-pronged approach is crucial.

**1.  Locating CUDA Toolkit Version Information:**

The primary method relies on the `nvcc` compiler, a core component of the CUDA Toolkit. This compiler, if correctly installed, provides crucial version information through its command-line interface.  Executing `nvcc --version` directly displays the CUDA toolkit's version number. This output typically adheres to a format such as "CUDA version 11.8.1". This number consists of three parts: major version (11), minor version (8), and patch version (1). The subversion, often omitted in basic displays like this, contains details about specific bug fixes and minor feature updates within the given minor release.  It’s essential to understand that while `nvcc --version` provides the major and minor release information directly, obtaining the full subversion number requires a more detailed approach, such as inspecting files within the CUDA installation directory.

**2. Examining the Driver Version:**

The NVIDIA driver, distinct from the CUDA toolkit, is equally critical.  A mismatch between driver and toolkit versions can lead to unpredictable behavior, including compiler errors and runtime failures. To determine the driver version, several methods exist, dependent on the operating system.  On Linux systems, I've found using the `nvidia-smi` command to be the most reliable. This command-line utility provides extensive information about the NVIDIA driver and the GPU itself.  The output explicitly states the driver version, usually presented in a similar three-part major.minor.patch format to the CUDA toolkit. Windows users can access this information via the NVIDIA Control Panel, usually found in the system tray. The "Help" section typically contains driver version details.

**3.  Inspecting CUDA Installation Files:**

While the `nvcc` and `nvidia-smi` commands provide readily accessible version information, a more comprehensive subversion number might require examining specific files within the CUDA installation directory.  This directory’s location varies based on the operating system and installation choices, but it often resides within a program files or similar location.  Within this directory, header files or configuration files sometimes contain embedded version strings that provide a more granular view of the subversion.  The exact file and location would vary according to the CUDA toolkit's specific release, however, searching the directory structure for text containing the version numbers will yield the most complete results. Note that this method is less convenient, but it is crucial for those encountering subtle issues that may be traced to a specific subversion level.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Determining CUDA Toolkit Version (Linux/Windows)**

```bash
nvcc --version
```

This command, executable from the command line (Bash, PowerShell, etc.), directly outputs the CUDA toolkit's version. The output clearly shows the major, minor, and patch level:

```
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Wed_Oct_11_21:09:06_PDT_2023
Cuda compilation tools, release 11.8.1, V11.8.1
Build cuda_11.8.1_local_r46566951
```

This exemplifies a clean and simple method for retrieving the primary version details.  However, more detailed subversion information is not directly present.


**Example 2: Retrieving Driver Version (Linux)**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Executing `nvidia-smi` provides comprehensive information about the GPU and its driver. The driver version will be explicitly stated. A relevant snippet from the output would be:

```
Driver Version:             535.10.04    
CUDA Version:               11.8
```

Note that the CUDA version reported here might not perfectly match the version reported by `nvcc` due to toolkit and driver version compatibility considerations.

**Example 3:  (Illustrative –  Requires System-Specific Path Adjustment)**

This example provides a theoretical illustration.  The actual path and file names would differ based on your OS and CUDA installation.

```python
import os

cuda_path = "/usr/local/cuda"  # Replace with your actual CUDA installation path
version_file = os.path.join(cuda_path, "include", "cuda_version.h") # Hypothetical file

if os.path.exists(version_file):
    with open(version_file, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            if "#define CUDA_VERSION" in line:
                version_string = line.split()[2]
                print(f"CUDA Version from header file: {version_string}")
                break
else:
    print("CUDA version header file not found at specified location.")
```

This Python script attempts to extract the version from a hypothetical header file.  The path to `cuda_version.h` and the format of the header file need to be appropriately adjusted to match the specifics of the CUDA installation. This approach is less standardized than the `nvcc` method but sometimes provides a more detailed version string.  Remember to adapt this code to your specific system.


**Resource Recommendations:**

NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Documentation, NVIDIA Driver Documentation, NVIDIA Developer Website.  These resources provide comprehensive information on CUDA installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.  Furthermore, consult the documentation pertaining to your specific CUDA toolkit version for complete and precise information.  Pay close attention to the release notes for your version of the CUDA Toolkit and the corresponding driver, as these often highlight significant updates and potential incompatibilities.  In case of issues, review NVIDIA's forums and community support channels for assistance.  Thorough reading of the documentation is essential for resolving version-related problems.
