Feeding both memory and carry states to a TensorFlow 1.x `LSTMCell` requires a nuanced understanding of the internal LSTM mechanics and the limitations of the `call` method.  My experience implementing recurrent neural networks in TensorFlow 1.x for sequence-to-sequence modeling, particularly in natural language processing tasks, highlighted the necessity of precise state management.  The `LSTMCell`'s `call` method doesn't directly accept separate memory and carry states as inputs; instead, it accepts a single state tensor encompassing both. This understanding is critical for correct state propagation.

The internal structure of an LSTM cell involves four gates: input, forget, output, and cell state. The cell state (often referred to as the "carry state" or "memory state" in less formal contexts) represents the long-term memory of the network. The hidden state (often referred to as the "memory state" less formally) is a transformation of the cell state, acting as the output of the LSTM cell at a given time step. While the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the distinction is crucial for understanding state manipulation.  It's the cell state that truly maintains the long-term memory and is passed directly through the cell.  The hidden state is a filtered version, ready for the next layer or output.

To effectively manage both "memory states," we need to understand how TensorFlow 1.x constructs and handles the state vector.  The `LSTMCell`'s state is a concatenated tensor: `[hidden_state, cell_state]`. Thus, supplying pre-defined states necessitates building this combined tensor and passing it correctly to the `call` method.  Failure to do so will result in the network ignoring your input states and initializing its own, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The key is to explicitly construct the concatenated state tensor. This tensor's dimensions depend on your `LSTMCell`'s `num_units`.  If `num_units` is N, the combined state tensor will have a shape of `[2*N]`.  The first N elements represent the hidden state, while the remaining N elements represent the cell state. To feed pre-defined states, you must create this tensor, using NumPy or TensorFlow operations, then pass it as the `state` argument within the `call` method. The output of the `call` method will then return the updated hidden and cell states as a tuple. This tuple, containing both the updated hidden and cell states, must be used as the input state for the next time step.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic State Passing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define LSTM cell
lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units=128)

# Define initial states (hidden and cell)
initial_hidden_state = np.zeros((1, 128), dtype=np.float32)  #Batch size of 1
initial_cell_state = np.zeros((1, 128), dtype=np.float32)
initial_state = np.concatenate((initial_hidden_state, initial_cell_state), axis=1)

# Input data (example)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 1, 10) # Batch size 1, timestep 1, input features 10


# Convert to Tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant(input_data, dtype=tf.float32)
initial_state_tensor = tf.constant(initial_state, dtype=tf.float32)

# Create a session (necessary for TensorFlow 1.x)
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

# Run LSTM cell
output, final_state = lstm_cell(input_tensor, initial_state_tensor)

# Print output and final states
print("Output Shape:", output.eval().shape)
print("Final State Shape:", final_state.eval().shape)
sess.close()
```

This example demonstrates the basic procedure:  creating initial hidden and cell states, concatenating them, converting to tensors, and passing them to the `LSTMCell`.  The `output` tensor represents the LSTM's output at this time step, and `final_state` contains the updated hidden and cell states.


**Example 2:  State Propagation Through Multiple Time Steps:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units=64)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 5, 10) #Batch of 1, 5 timesteps, 10 features
initial_state = np.zeros((1, 2*64), dtype=np.float32)
initial_state_tensor = tf.constant(initial_state, dtype=tf.float32)
input_tensor = tf.constant(input_data, dtype=tf.float32)

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

state = initial_state_tensor
for i in range(input_data.shape[1]):
    output, state = lstm_cell(input_tensor[:,i,:], state)
    print(f"Timestep {i+1}: Output shape {output.eval().shape}, State shape {state.eval().shape}")

sess.close()
```

This example iterates through multiple time steps, correctly propagating the state (`state`) from one step to the next.  The `state` tensor, updated in each iteration, ensures that the LSTM's memory persists across the sequence.


**Example 3: Handling Batched Inputs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units=32)
batch_size = 4
input_data = np.random.rand(batch_size, 3, 5) #Batch of 4, 3 timesteps, 5 features

initial_state = np.zeros((batch_size, 2*32), dtype=np.float32)
initial_state_tensor = tf.constant(initial_state, dtype=tf.float32)
input_tensor = tf.constant(input_data, dtype=tf.float32)

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

state = initial_state_tensor
for i in range(input_data.shape[1]):
    output, state = lstm_cell(input_tensor[:, i, :], state)
    print(f"Timestep {i+1}: Output shape {output.eval().shape}, State shape {state.eval().shape}")

sess.close()
```

This example expands upon the previous one to handle a batch of input sequences simultaneously.  The initial state now has a shape reflecting the batch size, allowing parallel processing of multiple sequences.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow 1.x's RNN capabilities, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation (specifically the sections dedicated to RNNs and LSTMs), and exploring the documentation for `tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell`.  Examining well-documented open-source projects utilizing TensorFlow 1.x for sequence modeling would be particularly valuable.  A strong foundation in linear algebra and the underlying principles of recurrent neural networks will greatly enhance your comprehension.  Furthermore, exploring research papers on LSTM architectures and applications will deepen your expertise.
