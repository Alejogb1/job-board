TensorFlow's Eager execution significantly alters the weight update process compared to the graph-based approach.  My experience debugging a large-scale recommendation system highlighted the crucial difference:  Eager execution updates weights immediately after each operation, offering direct access and control over the gradient calculations. This contrasts sharply with graph execution where the computation graph is constructed and executed only later. This immediate feedback is both a strength and requires careful consideration of computational efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Updating weights in TensorFlow Eager execution fundamentally relies on the `tf.GradientTape` context manager and the `optimizer.apply_gradients` method.  `tf.GradientTape` records operations for automatic differentiation.  Within its context, we perform a forward pass, calculating the loss.  The `gradient` method then computes the gradients of this loss with respect to the trainable variables (weights and biases).  Finally, an optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) applies these gradients to update the weights. The process is iterative, repeating for each batch of data in an epoch.  Crucially, the lack of a pre-constructed computation graph means the operations and updates happen sequentially and immediately, allowing for dynamic control flow, debugging, and interactive experimentationâ€”features that were significantly more difficult to implement in the graph mode which I relied upon earlier in my career.  This is particularly helpful during research and experimentation as you can check intermediary variables and computations without needing to resort to TensorBoard visualization alone.

Unlike graph execution, where the gradients are calculated as part of a larger graph execution, Eager execution calculates gradients on-demand within each step of the training loop. This immediacy necessitates a well-structured training loop that manages memory effectively, especially when dealing with large models or datasets.  During my work on the recommendation system, neglecting this aspect led to out-of-memory errors until I implemented proper resource management and batching techniques.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Linear Regression with Gradient Descent**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop
for i in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = W * X_train + b # X_train is assumed to be defined
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_train - y_pred)) # y_train is assumed to be defined

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W, b]))
```

This example showcases a basic linear regression model.  The `tf.GradientTape` context records operations.  The loss is calculated as mean squared error. `tape.gradient` computes gradients w.r.t. `W` and `b`. `optimizer.apply_gradients` updates the weights based on these gradients.  This style, while straightforward, becomes less manageable for more complex models.  Note the assumption that `X_train` and `y_train` are appropriately defined earlier in the script, representing the training features and targets respectively.  This is a simplification for clarity; in a real-world setting, data loading and preprocessing would be included.

**Example 2:  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Adam Optimizer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

for epoch in range(10):
  for batch in training_dataset:  # Assumes training_dataset is a tf.data.Dataset
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(batch['features'])  # Assumes 'features' key in batch
      loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(batch['labels'], predictions) # Assumes 'labels' key in batch
      loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example demonstrates a more complex MLP using Keras layers within the Eager execution context.  The training loop iterates over a `tf.data.Dataset` for efficiency, processing data in batches.  The `categorical_crossentropy` loss is suitable for multi-class classification.  This approach effectively leverages Keras's high-level API while maintaining the fine-grained control offered by Eager execution. The use of a `tf.data.Dataset` highlights efficient data handling, a critical element I learned to prioritize for performance in larger projects.  Again, the assumed structure of the `training_dataset` is for brevity. A robust implementation would involve explicit data loading and preprocessing.


**Example 3: Custom Training Step with Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Model definition and optimizer as before ...

for epoch in range(10):
  for batch in training_dataset:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(batch['features'])
      loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(batch['labels'], predictions))

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    # Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
    gradients = [(tf.clip_by_norm(grad, 1.0)) for grad in gradients]
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example incorporates gradient clipping, a crucial technique I encountered while dealing with instability in RNN training. Exploding gradients can hinder training.  Gradient clipping limits the norm of each gradient, preventing excessively large updates and improving stability. This illustrates how Eager execution facilitates the implementation of advanced training techniques, modifying the gradient update process directly.  The `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss is used, assuming the labels are represented as integers.  Again, the context of `training_dataset` and its structure is simplified for clarity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on Eager execution and automatic differentiation, are essential.  A thorough understanding of automatic differentiation techniques is critical. Books on deep learning, focusing on the practical implementation details rather than solely the theoretical aspects, prove invaluable. Finally, working through progressively complex examples, starting from simple models and then extending to more intricate architectures, offers significant practical experience in handling various training scenarios and challenges.  This iterative approach was key to mastering the nuances of weight updates in Eager execution.
