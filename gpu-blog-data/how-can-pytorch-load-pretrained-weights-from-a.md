Pretrained weights in deep learning are typically stored in formats optimized for efficient numerical access, such as PyTorch's `.pth` or `.pt` files, not human-readable formats like JSON. Loading directly from JSON requires careful data structure interpretation and matching the JSON fields to model layers. This is possible, but less common than using a standard weight storage format, often arises when working with custom or legacy systems. My experience implementing a multi-modal model integration that used JSON to store weight parameters for a text module is informing my approach here. The core issue is that JSON stores structured data (dictionaries, lists) which must be translated into PyTorch Tensors compatible with the model’s parameter shapes and layer hierarchy.

The process is not automatic like PyTorch’s standard `load_state_dict` function. Instead, you will extract numeric data from the JSON structure and explicitly assign them to the appropriate weight parameters within your model. This requires a deep understanding of how the model’s parameters are organized and how that structure is represented within the JSON file. This typically involves several steps: parsing the JSON file, verifying data integrity, reshaping data as required, and then assigning to the model parameters. You will need a meticulous approach to ensure each parameter of your model receives the correct value from the correct location in the parsed JSON.

First, I'll start by parsing the JSON. Python’s `json` library makes this straightforward:

```python
import json
import torch

def load_weights_from_json(json_path, model):
  """Loads weights from a JSON file into a PyTorch model.

  Args:
    json_path: Path to the JSON file containing the weights.
    model: The PyTorch model instance.
  """
  try:
    with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
      weights_data = json.load(f)
  except FileNotFoundError:
     raise FileNotFoundError(f"JSON file not found at: {json_path}")
  except json.JSONDecodeError:
      raise ValueError("Invalid JSON format.")

  # Further weight assignment implementation goes here
```

This initial section handles file opening and error checking. The `try-except` blocks provide robustness against typical file handling issues, which is a critical step before attempting data parsing. Within the `load_weights_from_json` function, `weights_data` now holds the parsed dictionary or list depending on the JSON structure. Note that without a defined schema, the data structure inside `weights_data` can be arbitrary, which highlights one of the problems when using JSON compared to more structured formats like .pth. 

Next, we need to iterate through the model's parameters and match them with their values found within the JSON structure. Let's assume for demonstration that the JSON contains a top-level dictionary whose keys match the parameter names from your model (`model.named_parameters()`). The values associated with these keys are assumed to be lists of numerical data representing tensor values.

```python
  for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if name in weights_data:
        try:
            json_values = weights_data[name]
            tensor_values = torch.tensor(json_values, dtype=param.dtype)

            if tensor_values.shape != param.shape:
               tensor_values = tensor_values.reshape(param.shape)
            param.data.copy_(tensor_values)
        except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError) as e:
            print(f"Error loading {name}: {e}")
            continue
    else:
         print(f"No weights found in JSON for parameter: {name}")
```

This code snippet iterates through each named parameter in the model. If the parameter name exists in the `weights_data` dictionary, it attempts to create a tensor from the JSON value. An additional reshape step is included in case dimensions did not match and a `copy_` is used so that the model parameters are updated with the proper values. Error handling is added to ensure that processing will still complete for other weights even if one encounters an error. Additionally, the implementation provides a warning when weights for a certain parameter can not be found in the JSON, assisting in debugging.

Finally, let's consider a different scenario, where the JSON file has a nested structure containing layer information along with the weights, instead of directly corresponding to parameter names. This example presumes a single sequential block with two linear layers and uses a nested structure.

```python
  import json
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ExampleModelNested(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

def load_weights_from_nested_json(json_path, model):
    try:
        with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
            weights_data = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"JSON file not found at: {json_path}")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
      raise ValueError("Invalid JSON format.")


    for layer_name, layer_data in weights_data.items():
        try:
            layer = getattr(model, layer_name)

            for param_name, param_values in layer_data.items():
                  param = getattr(layer, param_name)
                  tensor_values = torch.tensor(param_values, dtype = param.dtype)
                  if tensor_values.shape != param.shape:
                      tensor_values = tensor_values.reshape(param.shape)
                  param.data.copy_(tensor_values)
        except (KeyError, AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError) as e:
            print(f"Error loading parameter {layer_name}.{param_name}: {e}")
            continue
        
model_nested = ExampleModelNested()
sample_nested_json_data = {
    "fc1": {
        "weight": [[0.1 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(20)],
        "bias": [0.2 for _ in range(20)],
    },
    "fc2": {
        "weight": [[0.3 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(5)],
        "bias": [0.4 for _ in range(5)],
    }
}
with open("nested_weights.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(sample_nested_json_data,f)
load_weights_from_nested_json("nested_weights.json",model_nested)
print("Nested loading complete")

```

In this version, the JSON structure is designed with keys such as "fc1" and "fc2," which correspond to layer names of the model. Each layer has nested "weight" and "bias" parameters.  The code retrieves the layer using `getattr(model, layer_name)`, then iterates over each parameter within that layer. This nested iteration allows the correct weights to be loaded into corresponding layer attributes. Note that this is a very specific case for a nested structure; in practice the JSON structure will vary, and the loading method will need to be adjusted to match. This approach, while functional, is also much more vulnerable to changes in the JSON structure as it relies more heavily on hard coded conventions.

When working with JSON weights in a practical context, remember that this approach is generally less efficient and less flexible than native formats. The primary benefit of JSON is its human readability and interoperability, particularly in cases when a custom schema is required. However, these advantages often come at a cost of added parsing and conversion overhead. If possible, it's always better to switch to or to generate native PyTorch weight files rather than processing JSON data.

For further study of loading and saving models in PyTorch, I suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation’s section on saving and loading models. The various sections covering checkpointing and loading pre-trained models will provide a more holistic understanding of model state management. Additionally, reviewing the core PyTorch classes such as `torch.nn.Module`, `torch.Tensor`, and related utility functions will enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanism of model building and manipulation. I’d also recommend exploring tutorials or blogs posts that discuss the use of JSON for configuration file management in machine learning projects as it provides additional context of where JSON could be used in a ML pipeline context, although generally not for weight storage.
