Hashlib objects in Python, specifically those generated by functions like `hashlib.sha256()`, do not possess a `startswith` method because their primary purpose is cryptographic hashing, a process fundamentally different from string manipulation. Hashes are fixed-size, one-way representations of input data, designed to be computationally infeasible to reverse, and not to be searched or pattern matched. String-like operations are conceptually mismatched for the output of a hashing function, which aims for data integrity verification and not text-based analysis.

Fundamentally, a hashlib object is a stateful object that internally manages the ongoing hash calculation. It exposes methods like `update()` to feed data into the hashing algorithm, and `digest()` or `hexdigest()` to finalize and retrieve the resulting hash as a byte string or a hexadecimal string, respectively. The core function of this process is not to produce an object that resembles a string but to yield a unique and consistently reproducible "fingerprint" of the input data. If I were to perform `startswith()` on the *result* of the hashing operation, that would make sense on the string output, but not the object.

To understand further, consider the typical usage of hash objects. Initially, one creates a hash object (e.g., `sha256 = hashlib.sha256()`). Then, you feed the data through `sha256.update(data)`. The internal state is being updated with the data you’re providing, and that state is not string based, but algorithmic. Finally, you retrieve the resultant hash with `sha256.digest()` (a byte string) or `sha256.hexdigest()` (a hex string). This process highlights that it’s not the hash object that should have the `startswith` method, but the resultant string or bytes. Therefore, the design rationale behind `hashlib` does not include string methods within its objects, as that would represent a significant misdirection of its core purpose.

Now, let's examine some code examples to solidify this.

**Example 1: Incorrect Attempt**

```python
import hashlib

# Attempting to use startswith on a hashlib object will lead to an AttributeError
try:
    sha256 = hashlib.sha256()
    print(sha256.startswith("a"))
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

#Correct way to use it on the result
sha256.update(b"Hello, World!")
hex_digest = sha256.hexdigest()

if hex_digest.startswith("2a"):
    print("Hex digest starts with '2a'")
else:
    print ("Hex digest does not start with '2a'")
```

*Commentary:* The first part of this example demonstrates the core issue. Attempting to use `startswith` directly on the `sha256` hash object triggers an `AttributeError`, confirming that the method is not defined for the object. This is because `sha256` is not a string, it's an internal state machine calculating a hash. In the second part of the example, we correctly use `startswith` on the resulting hex string, after updating and finalizing the hash. This clarifies that string manipulation operations only make sense after the hashing process has completed.

**Example 2: Demonstrating the Digest Output**

```python
import hashlib

text_data = "This is some sample text."
byte_data = text_data.encode('utf-8')

md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
md5_hash.update(byte_data)
md5_digest_bytes = md5_hash.digest()
md5_digest_hex = md5_hash.hexdigest()

sha1_hash = hashlib.sha1()
sha1_hash.update(byte_data)
sha1_digest_bytes = sha1_hash.digest()
sha1_digest_hex = sha1_hash.hexdigest()


print(f"MD5 Byte Digest: {md5_digest_bytes}")
print(f"MD5 Hex Digest: {md5_digest_hex}")
print(f"SHA1 Byte Digest: {sha1_digest_bytes}")
print(f"SHA1 Hex Digest: {sha1_digest_hex}")

#Checking if the hex digest starts with a certain character
if md5_digest_hex.startswith('37'):
    print("MD5 hex digest starts with '37'")

if sha1_digest_hex.startswith('b4'):
    print("SHA1 hex digest starts with 'b4'")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the usage of `digest()` and `hexdigest()` to obtain the result of the hash computation. `digest()` returns a raw byte string, while `hexdigest()` returns a more human-readable hexadecimal string representation. Neither of the `hashlib` objects possess `startswith`, and we must use `startswith` on the `md5_digest_hex` or `sha1_digest_hex` to achieve desired string-like operations. It highlights the two formats in which hashes are generally output. This allows a user to determine if they want the raw bytes for specific uses or the hex representation that is often used in displays or config files.

**Example 3: Real-world Application with String Operation**

```python
import hashlib
import os

# Example: verifying file integrity by using the startswith method on resultant string

def check_file_signature(filepath, expected_signature_prefix):
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        return False

    hasher = hashlib.sha256()

    try:
        with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
             while True:
                chunk = file.read(4096)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                hasher.update(chunk)
        hex_digest = hasher.hexdigest()
        return hex_digest.startswith(expected_signature_prefix)
    except Exception as e:
        print (f"An error has occurred: {e}")
        return False

# Example usage:
file_path = 'my_document.txt'
signature_prefix = "af47"

# Create a dummy file if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
  with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write("This is a sample file.")

if check_file_signature(file_path, signature_prefix):
    print(f"File signature for {file_path} is correct.")
else:
    print(f"File signature for {file_path} does not match expected prefix.")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a real-world scenario, verifying the integrity of a file by comparing the beginning of a hash to an expected signature. The function reads the file in chunks, feeds it to the `sha256` hash object, finalizes and converts the hash to a hexadecimal string, and then uses `startswith()` to see if the string matches the expected value. This shows that the `startswith()` method is applied to the string representation of the hash, and not the `hashlib` object itself, thus preventing the AttributeError from occurring.

In terms of recommended resources, delving into materials that cover the fundamentals of cryptographic hashing would be highly beneficial. Texts or online courses focusing on data structures and algorithms can further clarify why these design choices were made. Specifically, studying the practical applications of hash functions, especially within the context of data integrity and security, should broaden one’s understanding. Finally, studying Python's official documentation and source code for the `hashlib` module provides detailed information into the class structure and design decisions. Exploring the concept of stateful objects, as opposed to purely functional ones, within the paradigm of cryptographic functions is also helpful. These resources collectively can provide a more in-depth understanding as to why these design decisions are implemented.
