TensorFlow's ability to distribute computations across multiple devices, like CPUs and GPUs, significantly accelerates model training and inference. This distribution relies on several key components: device placement, data parallelism, and model parallelism. I’ve spent considerable time optimizing deep learning workflows and have found understanding these concepts to be crucial for effective use of TensorFlow at scale.

**Device Placement**

TensorFlow, at its core, operates by constructing a computational graph. Each node in this graph represents an operation, and these operations are then assigned to specific devices during execution. Device placement can be implicit, where TensorFlow automatically chooses devices based on availability and operation types, or explicit, using device context managers or directives. Implicit placement is often sufficient for single-GPU scenarios, but more control is necessary for distributed training.

Explicit device placement lets us specify that certain operations should run on a particular CPU or GPU. This is vital in complex setups where specific parts of the model, such as input preprocessing, may benefit more from CPU processing while the core calculations are done on GPUs. The strategy becomes increasingly complex as we consider multi-GPU or distributed training across multiple machines.

**Data Parallelism**

Data parallelism is a common technique that distributes training data across multiple devices. In essence, each device holds a replica of the model, and a subset of the training data is fed to each replica for gradient calculations. After processing each mini-batch, the gradients calculated on each device are synchronized and combined before updating the model's parameters. This synchronization can be implemented using techniques like all-reduce. This pattern has served me well in tasks such as large-scale image classification where data volumes are significant.

The effectiveness of data parallelism is directly tied to efficient communication between devices. The overhead in synchronizing gradients can become a bottleneck, especially when the number of devices increases or when the model parameters are very large. Therefore, optimal network conditions are necessary and different strategies for performing gradient averaging are available.

**Model Parallelism**

Model parallelism, on the other hand, distributes different parts of the model across multiple devices. This approach is often necessary when the model itself is too large to fit on a single device, a frequent situation with transformer models. A simple example might involve splitting the layers of a neural network across two GPUs. Input tensors flow through the assigned layers on each GPU sequentially.

Model parallelism adds significantly to implementation complexity. Carefully designing the placement of individual layers on devices and managing the transfer of data between devices is crucial. Optimizing this data flow for minimum overhead is key to achieving acceptable performance. The synchronization and data transfer management can be a serious bottleneck if not addressed properly. I’ve experienced firsthand how poor device placement can negate any performance gain from increased device capacity.

**Code Examples**

Let us look at practical code examples to illustrate these concepts.

**Example 1: Explicit Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two devices, CPU and GPU(if available)
devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
cpu_device = '/CPU:0'
gpu_device = '/GPU:0' if any(d.device_type == 'GPU' for d in devices) else cpu_device

# Perform operations with device placement.
with tf.device(cpu_device):
    cpu_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,100))

with tf.device(gpu_device):
    gpu_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,100))
    
with tf.device(gpu_device):
    # Perform some calculation using GPU
    result_gpu = tf.matmul(gpu_tensor, gpu_tensor, name='matmul_gpu')
    
with tf.device(cpu_device):
    # Perform operation with CPU
    result_cpu = tf.reduce_sum(cpu_tensor, name = 'reduce_sum_cpu')

print(f"Result on GPU : {result_gpu.shape}")
print(f"Result on CPU: {result_cpu}")
```
In this example, we create two tensors, one on the CPU and one on the GPU. Then, we perform a matrix multiplication on the GPU and sum reduction on the CPU. We use `tf.device` context manager to execute the associated operations on the desired devices. By looking at the print output, we can confirm that the respective operations ran as desired on their respective devices. In a production environment, this level of explicit control over execution can fine-tune performance.

**Example 2: Data Parallelism with MirroredStrategy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Setup mirrored strategy for distributed training
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# Place training and model definition inside scope of strategy.
with strategy.scope():
    model = create_model()
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
    
# Create synthetic training data
x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 100))
y_train = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform(shape=(1000,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), 10)

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(32)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(5):
    for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset:
       with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
           y_pred = model(x_batch)
           loss = loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred)
       
       grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
       optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
       
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, loss={loss.numpy()}")
```
This snippet demonstrates data parallelism using the `MirroredStrategy`. This strategy replicates the model across all available GPUs (or CPU if no GPU is available) and distributes the input data across these replicas. We create a simple dense neural network and then train the model using gradient descent. The `strategy.scope()` is crucial. It encapsulates model creation, loss function definition, and optimizer creation. The strategy takes care of handling the parallel computations, gradient aggregation and updates. The output confirms successful training across mirrored copies of the model.

**Example 3: A Simplified Model Parallelism Example**
This example uses a model divided across two GPUs. It provides a minimal example to illustrate the conceptual steps:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
gpu_devices = [d for d in devices if d.device_type == 'GPU']

if len(gpu_devices) < 2 :
   print("At least 2 GPUs needed for model parallelism. Please configure.")
   exit()

gpu1 = gpu_devices[0].name
gpu2 = gpu_devices[1].name


def first_layer(inputs):
    with tf.device(gpu1):
        layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        outputs = layer(inputs)
        return outputs

def second_layer(inputs):
    with tf.device(gpu2):
        layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        outputs = layer(inputs)
        return outputs

# Sample input
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(64, 100))

# Perform model parallelism and pass data between GPUs
output_1 = first_layer(input_tensor)
output_2 = second_layer(output_1)
print(f"Output shape: {output_2.shape}")

```
Here, we split the model into two layers and place each layer on a separate GPU. The input tensor flows through the two layers. Note that there is not any training involved here, but this illustrates a basic architecture for model parallelism. We confirm the expected shape of the output. Building a proper implementation of model parallelism can be challenging in practice. Note that model parallelism can become necessary when a large model cannot fit in a single device memory.
