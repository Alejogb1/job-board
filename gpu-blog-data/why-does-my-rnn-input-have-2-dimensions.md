The discrepancy you're observing – a two-dimensional RNN input where a three-dimensional input is expected – stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how recurrent neural networks process sequential data.  In my experience debugging sequence models, this almost always boils down to an incorrect handling of batch size, timesteps, and features.  The RNN expects data in the form (batch_size, timesteps, features), and a two-dimensional array indicates a missing dimension, typically the batch size or timesteps, depending on the structure of your data.

Let's clarify the three dimensions:

1. **Batch Size:** This represents the number of independent sequences processed simultaneously.  For example, if you're analyzing 32 sentences, your batch size would be 32. Each sentence is treated as an individual sequence.  A batch size of 1 implies processing sequences one at a time.

2. **Timesteps:** This denotes the length of a single sequence. In the case of text, this would be the number of words in a sentence.  For time series data, it's the number of time points.  Irregular-length sequences require padding or truncation to a consistent timestep length.

3. **Features:**  This specifies the dimensionality of each element within a sequence. If your sequence consists of word embeddings, each word is represented by a vector (e.g., a 100-dimensional Word2Vec embedding), making the feature dimension 100.  If you are dealing with simple numerical data (like stock prices), the feature dimension might be 1.


**Explanation:**

The core issue is likely in how you're preparing your data before feeding it into the RNN.  If you're directly feeding a single sequence (e.g., a single sentence represented as a sequence of word vectors) into the RNN layer, you'll only have two dimensions: (timesteps, features).  The batch size is implicitly 1.  The RNN layer, however, expects a batch of sequences, even if that batch contains only one sequence.

This often happens when one mistakenly assumes the model handles single-sequence inputs naturally.  The model's architecture is designed to efficiently process multiple sequences in parallel to leverage vectorization and improve training speed.  Therefore, it fundamentally requires the three-dimensional structure.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three examples using Python and Keras:

**Example 1: Correctly shaping data for an RNN**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data: 3 sequences, each with 5 timesteps, and 2 features
data = np.random.rand(3, 5, 2)  # (batch_size, timesteps, features)

# Define a simple RNN model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=32, input_shape=(5, 2)),  # Input shape specified
    keras.layers.Dense(units=1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(3,1), epochs=10)
```

This example correctly shapes the input data as a three-dimensional array. The `input_shape` parameter in the `SimpleRNN` layer explicitly defines the expected shape of the input sequences (timesteps, features).  The batch size is inferred from the first dimension of the input data.  I've observed countless times that ignoring the `input_shape` or providing an incorrect shape leads to dimension mismatch errors.


**Example 2: Handling a single sequence and expanding dimensions**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Single sequence with 5 timesteps and 2 features
single_sequence = np.random.rand(5, 2)  # (timesteps, features)

# Expand dimensions to add the batch size (batch_size = 1)
reshaped_sequence = np.expand_dims(single_sequence, axis=0) # (1, timesteps, features)


# Define and train the model (same as Example 1, but with reshaped data)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=32, input_shape=(5, 2)),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_sequence, np.random.rand(1,1), epochs=10)

```

This demonstrates how to handle a single sequence.  The `np.expand_dims` function is crucial here; it adds a new dimension at the beginning, effectively creating a batch of size one.  In my early days working with RNNs, I often missed this step, resulting in the same dimension mismatch error.


**Example 3:  Padding sequences of varying lengths**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sequences of varying lengths
sequences = [
    np.random.rand(3, 2),
    np.random.rand(5, 2),
    np.random.rand(2, 2)
]

# Pad sequences to the maximum length
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=5, padding='post', dtype='float32')

# Reshape to (batch_size, timesteps, features)
reshaped_padded = np.expand_dims(padded_sequences, axis=0)

#The model remains unchanged, but now input_shape must account for variable-length padding:

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units=32, input_shape=(5, 2)),  # Input shape specified
    keras.layers.Dense(units=1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_padded, np.random.rand(1,1), epochs=10)

```

This example addresses sequences of unequal lengths, a common scenario.  The `pad_sequences` function from Keras handles padding to ensure all sequences have the same length. The padding type ('post' in this case) and data type are specified for clarity.  Remember that you'll need to adjust the `input_shape` in the model accordingly to reflect the padded length.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Comprehensive textbooks on deep learning, including chapters dedicated to recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling.
*   Official documentation of deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch), focusing on RNN APIs and data handling.
*   Research papers focusing on various RNN architectures and their applications to different sequence-based tasks.


Addressing the dimensionality issue requires a thorough understanding of how RNNs process sequential data and careful preparation of your input data. By correctly managing batch size, timesteps, and features, you can effectively utilize RNNs for various sequence modeling tasks.  Remember to always check the expected input shape of your RNN layer and ensure your data matches that specification.  This attention to detail prevents many common errors when working with RNNs.
