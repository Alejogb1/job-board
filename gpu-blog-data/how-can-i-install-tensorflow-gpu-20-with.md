TensorFlow 2.0 GPU installation via conda after a PyTorch installation that downgraded TensorFlow to 1.13.0 requires careful management of conda environments and package dependencies.  My experience resolving similar conflicts involved understanding the intricacies of CUDA toolkit versions, cuDNN, and the subtle interactions between these libraries and various deep learning frameworks.  The core issue stems from potential CUDA version mismatches and conflicting library installations across environments. A clean approach is crucial to avoid persistent conflicts.

**1. Understanding the Problem and Solution Strategy**

The downgrade to TensorFlow 1.13.0 after installing PyTorch strongly suggests that PyTorch's conda package implicitly or explicitly depends on a specific CUDA toolkit and cuDNN version incompatible with TensorFlow 2.0's requirements.  TensorFlow 2.0, especially the GPU version, has stricter dependencies on these libraries. Attempting to directly upgrade TensorFlow within the same environment risks further conflicts due to library version inconsistencies. The optimal solution involves creating a separate conda environment specifically for TensorFlow 2.0 GPU, isolating its dependencies and avoiding clashes with the existing PyTorch environment. This ensures both frameworks coexist without interference.

**2.  Code Examples and Explanations**

The following examples illustrate a robust workflow for installing TensorFlow 2.0 GPU in a separate conda environment, preserving the existing PyTorch environment:


**Example 1: Creating a New Conda Environment**

```bash
conda create -n tf2_gpu python=3.7 # Choose a Python version compatible with TensorFlow 2.0
conda activate tf2_gpu
```

This command creates a new environment named `tf2_gpu` with Python 3.7.  Choosing a compatible Python version is paramount; TensorFlow 2.0 has specific version requirements. I've encountered issues in the past due to version mismatches, leading to cryptic error messages during the CUDA initialization phase. Activating the environment isolates subsequent installations within this specific space.


**Example 2: Installing CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN (Pre-requisites)**

Before installing TensorFlow, the correct CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions must be installed.  This step is crucial, and its omission often leads to installation failures.  Determining the correct versions requires checking TensorFlow 2.0's official documentation for compatibility with your NVIDIA GPU.  Installing these prerequisites directly from NVIDIA's website is usually more reliable than using conda channels.  Once downloaded, install them accordingly, following the NVIDIA instructions meticulously.  Then, proceed with TensorFlow installation.  Note:  Incorrect CUDA versions were a significant source of errors in my past projects, highlighting the critical nature of this step.

**(Note:  This example omits the explicit CUDA and cuDNN installation commands as they are system and GPU-specific and depend on the downloaded installers. The process involves running `.run` or `.sh` installers, which are not easily representable within a simple bash script.)**


**Example 3: Installing TensorFlow 2.0 GPU**

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-gpu==2.0 # Or latest compatible version
```

After ensuring the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are correctly installed and the system environment variables are properly set (a common source of overlooked errors), this command installs TensorFlow 2.0 GPU within the newly created environment. Specifying `tensorflow-gpu` ensures the GPU-enabled version is installed.  Using `conda-forge` as the channel is generally recommended for better package management and compatibility.  I've found that using other channels can sometimes lead to dependency conflicts. If 2.0 is no longer supported consider installing the latest version compatible with your CUDA toolkit.  Always verify the TensorFlow version after installation:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

This command verifies the TensorFlow installation and displays its version number, confirming the installation's success and providing crucial debugging information should errors arise.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, and the cuDNN documentation provide essential information on installation procedures, compatibility matrices, and troubleshooting common issues.  Thoroughly reviewing this documentation before, during, and after installation greatly improves the likelihood of success and enables efficient debugging.  I always advocate meticulously reading documentation rather than solely relying on online forums, especially for intricate tasks involving low-level libraries and drivers.  Consulting the conda documentation for managing environments also helps streamline the process.



**Conclusion**

Installing TensorFlow 2.0 GPU after a PyTorch installation that modified existing TensorFlow installations necessitates a methodical approach.  Creating a separate conda environment prevents conflicts, while carefully verifying CUDA toolkit and cuDNN installations ensures compatibility.  The examples presented, along with a careful review of the recommended resources, should enable a successful installation. Remember that meticulous attention to detail during each stage—environment creation, prerequisite installation, and TensorFlow installation—is critical for avoiding conflicts and ensuring the stability of the deep learning framework environment. Ignoring these details often leads to protracted debugging sessions and unnecessary frustration.
