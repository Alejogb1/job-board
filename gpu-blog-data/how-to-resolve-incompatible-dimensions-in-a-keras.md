In my experience working with Keras LSTMs on time-series forecasting and natural language processing tasks, the most common source of incompatible dimension errors stems from a mismatch between the expected input shape and the actual shape of the data fed into the layer.  This discrepancy often arises from overlooking the inherent three-dimensional structure expected by Keras LSTMs: (samples, timesteps, features).  Understanding and correctly managing this three-dimensional structure is paramount to avoiding these errors.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A Keras LSTM layer anticipates an input tensor of shape (samples, timesteps, features). Let's dissect each dimension:

* **Samples:** This represents the number of independent data instances in your dataset.  For instance, in a time-series forecasting problem, each sample might be a separate time series. In NLP, each sample could be a sentence.

* **Timesteps:**  This dimension reflects the sequential nature of data processed by LSTMs. It represents the length of each individual sequence within a sample.  For a time series, it would be the number of time points; for an NLP task, it would be the number of words in a sentence.  Note that all samples *must* have the same number of timesteps.  Padding or truncation is necessary to ensure uniformity.

* **Features:** This dimension specifies the number of features associated with each timestep.  In a univariate time series, this would be 1 (just the value of the time series at each time point).  For multivariate time series or NLP tasks using word embeddings, this would be greater than 1, representing multiple features at each timestep.

Incompatible dimension errors occur when the shape of your input data deviates from this (samples, timesteps, features) structure.  Common causes include:

* **Incorrect Data Reshaping:**  Failing to reshape your data to the required three-dimensional format. Your data might be stored as a simple array or a matrix, but the LSTM needs a tensor.

* **Inconsistent Timestep Lengths:**  Having sequences of varying lengths within your dataset.  This necessitates padding shorter sequences with zeros or truncating longer sequences to match the length of the shortest sequence.

* **Misunderstanding Feature Representation:**  Incorrectly representing your features, leading to an incorrect number of features in the third dimension.  For example, if you're working with word embeddings and use a dimensionality of 100, your feature dimension should be 100.

* **Incorrect Input Data Preprocessing:** Failure to adequately normalize or standardize input data can lead to unintended dimensional changes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correctly Shaping Data for a Univariate Time Series**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample univariate time series data (10 samples, 5 timesteps, 1 feature)
data = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
    [21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    [26, 27, 28, 29, 30],
    [31, 32, 33, 34, 35],
    [36, 37, 38, 39, 40],
    [41, 42, 43, 44, 45],
    [46, 47, 48, 49, 50]
]).reshape((10, 5, 1)) # Reshaping to (samples, timesteps, features)

# Define the LSTM model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(5, 1)), # Input shape explicitly defined
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model (simplified for brevity)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(10,1), epochs=10) # Placeholder target data

```

This example demonstrates the crucial step of reshaping the input data using `.reshape()` to the required (samples, timesteps, features) format.  The `input_shape` parameter in the LSTM layer explicitly specifies the expected shape.


**Example 2: Handling Variable-Length Sequences with Padding**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample sequences with varying lengths
sequences = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6, 7],
    [8, 9]
]

# Pad sequences to the length of the longest sequence
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')

# Reshape for LSTM input
reshaped_data = padded_sequences.reshape((len(sequences), padded_sequences.shape[1], 1))

# Define and train the LSTM model (similar to Example 1)
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(padded_sequences.shape[1], 1)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.rand(len(sequences), 1), epochs=10) #Placeholder target

```

Here, `pad_sequences` handles variable-length sequences by padding shorter sequences with zeros.  The reshaping step ensures compatibility with the LSTM layer.  Note the use of `padded_sequences.shape[1]` to dynamically determine the timestep length.


**Example 3:  Multivariate Time Series with Word Embeddings (NLP analogy)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Embedding, Dense

# Assume word embeddings of dimension 50
embedding_dim = 50

# Sample data (3 sentences, max 4 words, 50-dimensional embeddings)
data = np.random.rand(3, 4, embedding_dim)

# Define the model with Embedding layer for word embeddings
model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=4), #Example vocabulary size of 1000
    LSTM(100),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(3, 1), epochs=10) # Placeholder target

```

This illustrates the use of an embedding layer, a common technique in NLP.  The input dimension of the embedding layer represents the vocabulary size.  The crucial point is that the output of the embedding layer will have a shape compatible with the LSTM's (samples, timesteps, features) requirement, with the feature dimension being the embedding dimensionality.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation itself provides extensive detail on the LSTM layer and its usage.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of NumPy for data manipulation and reshaping is essential.  Finally, consulting textbooks and online tutorials focusing on deep learning with Keras and LSTMs will provide further insight into advanced techniques like handling missing data and optimizing model performance.  Exploring research papers on sequence modeling will offer deeper perspectives on architectural choices and data preprocessing methodologies.
