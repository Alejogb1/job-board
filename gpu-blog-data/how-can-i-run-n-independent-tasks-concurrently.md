The core challenge in concurrently executing *n* independent tasks, each requiring a single GPU, lies in the efficient management of GPU resources and inter-task communication.  My experience optimizing high-throughput simulations for large-scale weather modeling has highlighted the critical need for robust task scheduling and resource allocation strategies when dealing with multiple GPUs.  Directly accessing and managing individual GPUs necessitates operating at a level below the abstraction offered by many higher-level frameworks. This requires a deeper understanding of system-level interactions and potentially necessitates custom solutions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution hinges on leveraging the underlying capabilities of CUDA or OpenCL, depending on the GPU architecture.  These APIs provide low-level control over GPU resources, allowing for the precise assignment of individual GPUs to individual tasks.  A high-level approach using task queues and process management is insufficient because it relies on the operating system scheduler, which lacks the granularity needed for direct GPU assignment. The strategy involves several key components:

* **GPU Discovery and Selection:**  Firstly, the system must identify available GPUs. This often involves interacting with the CUDA runtime API (e.g., `cudaGetDeviceCount`) or equivalent OpenCL functions.  Each available GPU is then assigned a unique identifier.

* **Process or Thread Creation:**  For each of the *n* tasks, a separate process or thread is created.  This allows for independent execution. The choice between processes and threads depends on the complexity of the tasks and potential memory sharing needs.  Processes offer stronger isolation, while threads enable simpler communication but can be prone to data races if not carefully managed.

* **GPU Assignment:**  This is the critical step.  The created process or thread must be explicitly bound to a specific GPU. This is achieved by setting the CUDA device context or OpenCL device using the appropriate API calls before initiating any GPU computations.  Failing to do this will lead to unpredictable GPU utilization and potential contention.

* **Task Execution:**  Once the GPU is assigned, each task can then execute its GPU-accelerated code using CUDA kernels or OpenCL kernels.

* **Synchronization (if necessary):** If inter-task communication is required, techniques such as CUDA streams or OpenCL queues can be employed for efficient synchronization to avoid deadlocks or race conditions. However, for truly *independent* tasks, this step is not necessary.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate the core concepts using Python and the `subprocess` module for process management and assuming CUDA is the underlying GPU technology.  Error handling and more robust resource management would be required in production-ready code.

**Example 1: Simple process-based approach (Python with subprocess):**

```python
import subprocess
import os

def run_gpu_task(task_id, gpu_id):
    os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_id)  # Assign GPU
    command = ["python", "task.py", str(task_id)] # task.py contains the GPU computation
    subprocess.Popen(command)

num_gpus = 4 # Replace with actual GPU count
num_tasks = 4 # Number of tasks to run

if num_tasks > num_gpus:
    raise ValueError("More tasks than available GPUs")

for i in range(num_tasks):
    run_gpu_task(i, i)

```

This code creates a separate process for each task and sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to restrict each process to a single GPU. `task.py` would contain the CUDA code specific to each task.


**Example 2: Illustrative CUDA kernel launch (within `task.py`):**

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
import numpy as np

# ... (CUDA kernel definition) ...

# Allocate memory on the device
x_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(x.nbytes)
y_gpu = cuda.mem_alloc(y.nbytes)

# Copy data to the device
cuda.memcpy_htod(x_gpu, x)

# Launch the kernel
kernel(x_gpu, y_gpu, grid=(grid_size,1,1), block=(block_size,1,1))

# Copy results back to the host
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(y, y_gpu)

# ... (rest of the task processing) ...

```

This snippet shows a basic kernel launch using PyCUDA.  The crucial step is the allocation of GPU memory and kernel execution on the device, following the GPU assignment in the main script.


**Example 3:  Handling GPU failures (conceptual):**

```python
#... (GPU discovery and process creation as in Example 1) ...

import signal

def handle_gpu_failure(signum, frame):
    print(f"GPU task failed. Cleaning up...")
    # Add code to handle resource release, error logging, or retry mechanisms.

for i in range(num_tasks):
    process = run_gpu_task(i, i)
    process.wait() # Wait for the process to finish
    if process.returncode != 0: # Check for errors
        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_gpu_failure)

```

This example demonstrates handling potential failures.  Robust error handling is essential to avoid leaving resources tied up.  The `signal` module allows for graceful handling of process failures. Note that implementation details of handling failures are highly context-dependent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **CUDA Programming Guide:**  This provides comprehensive documentation on CUDA programming techniques and best practices.
*   **OpenCL Programming Guide:**  The equivalent resource for OpenCL.
*   **Process and Thread Management Documentation (for your OS):**  Understanding the system-level mechanics of process/thread creation and management is crucial.
*   **A good book on parallel and distributed computing:** This will offer broad context beyond GPU-specific implementation.
*   **Debugging tools for CUDA/OpenCL:**  Profiling tools are vital for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing resource usage.

In summary, effectively running *n* independent tasks concurrently on a multi-GPU system demands precise control over GPU resource allocation.  Employing low-level APIs like CUDA or OpenCL, along with robust process management and error handling, is paramount for achieving efficient and reliable parallel execution. The presented examples offer a starting point; adapting them to specific needs requires a thorough understanding of GPU architecture and parallel programming paradigms.  Remember that thorough testing and profiling are essential for optimization.
