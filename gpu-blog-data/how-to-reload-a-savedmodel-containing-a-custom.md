The core challenge in reloading a SavedModel containing a custom normalizer function for `tf.feature_column.numeric_column` lies in the serialization limitations of TensorFlow's saving mechanisms.  Standard TensorFlow saving procedures do not inherently preserve arbitrary Python functions embedded within feature columns.  This necessitates a more strategic approach involving custom serialization and deserialization to maintain the functional integrity of the model across saving and loading operations.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems, specifically dealing with highly customized preprocessing pipelines, led me to this realization and ultimately the solutions presented below.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem stems from the fact that `tf.saved_model.save` primarily focuses on serializing the model's weights and computational graph.  Custom functions, like normalizer functions within `numeric_column`, are not automatically handled within this process.  They exist outside the core TensorFlow graph structure.  Therefore, to reload the model successfully, we must explicitly save and restore these custom functions alongside the model's weights.  This typically involves creating a custom serialization mechanism that encodes the function's definition (potentially using `pickle` or a more robust serialization library like `cloudpickle`) and then reconstructing it during the model's loading phase.  The critical aspect is ensuring the reloaded function is identical to the original, including its dependencies and environment.  Failure to do so will lead to runtime errors or, worse, incorrect model behavior.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `pickle` for Simple Normalization**

This example demonstrates a simple custom normalizer using `pickle` for serialization. It's suitable for relatively straightforward functions without complex external dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pickle

def my_normalizer(x):
  return (x - 10) / 20 # Example normalization

feature_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(
    'my_feature', normalizer_fn=my_normalizer
)

# ... model building ...

# Save the model and the normalizer function
model_path = 'my_model'
tf.saved_model.save(model, model_path)
with open(model_path + '/normalizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(my_normalizer, f)

# ... later, during loading ...

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(model_path)

# Load the normalizer function
with open(model_path + '/normalizer.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_normalizer = pickle.load(f)

# Recreate the feature column with the loaded normalizer
reloaded_feature_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(
    'my_feature', normalizer_fn=loaded_normalizer
)

# Verify that the loaded normalizer functions correctly
assert my_normalizer(10) == loaded_normalizer(10) # Test equivalence

# ... use reloaded_feature_column with loaded_model ...
```

**Commentary:** This code explicitly saves the `my_normalizer` function using `pickle` and then reloads it.  The assertion step provides a basic check for equivalence. This approach is straightforward but may fail if `my_normalizer` has complex dependencies or relies on external state.


**Example 2: Handling Dependencies with `cloudpickle`**

`cloudpickle` offers enhanced serialization capabilities, handling more complex objects and dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import cloudpickle

class MyNormalizer:
    def __init__(self, mean, std):
        self.mean = mean
        self.std = std

    def __call__(self, x):
        return (x - self.mean) / self.std

normalizer = MyNormalizer(mean=10, std=20)
feature_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(
    'my_feature', normalizer_fn=normalizer.__call__
)

# ... model building ...

# Save the model and normalizer using cloudpickle
model_path = 'my_model_cloudpickle'
tf.saved_model.save(model, model_path)
with open(model_path + '/normalizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    cloudpickle.dump(normalizer, f)

# ... during loading ...

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(model_path)

# Load the normalizer using cloudpickle
with open(model_path + '/normalizer.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_normalizer = cloudpickle.load(f)

# Recreate the feature column
reloaded_feature_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(
    'my_feature', normalizer_fn=loaded_normalizer.__call__
)

# ... use reloaded_feature_column with loaded_model ...

```

**Commentary:** This example leverages a class for the normalizer, making dependency management more robust.  `cloudpickle` handles the serialization of the class instance, including its internal state (mean and std).  This approach is more resilient to issues arising from complex dependencies or custom class structures.


**Example 3:  Function Definition String and `eval()` (Use with Caution)**

This example uses string representation of the function for serialization.  This is generally discouraged due to security risks associated with `eval()`.  I'm including it solely for completeness and to illustrate an alternative that should be avoided in production systems due to inherent vulnerabilities.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_normalizer(x):
    return (x - 10) / 20

feature_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(
    'my_feature', normalizer_fn=my_normalizer
)

# ... model building ...

#Save the model and the function definition as a string.
model_path = 'my_model_string'
tf.saved_model.save(model, model_path)
with open(model_path + '/normalizer.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(my_normalizer.__code__.co_consts[0]) #Extract Function Code

# ... during loading ...

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(model_path)

# Load the normalizer function definition.
with open(model_path + '/normalizer.txt', 'r') as f:
  function_string = f.read()
loaded_normalizer = eval(function_string)

# Recreate the feature column
reloaded_feature_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(
    'my_feature', normalizer_fn=loaded_normalizer
)

# ... use reloaded_feature_column with loaded_model ...
```


**Commentary:** This method is highly discouraged due to security risks inherent in using `eval()` on untrusted input.  It is presented here only for illustrative purposes to contrast with safer methods.  It's crucial to prioritize secure and robust serialization techniques in real-world applications.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models.
*   `cloudpickle` documentation.
*   A comprehensive guide on Python serialization techniques.


Remember to choose the serialization method appropriate for your function's complexity and security requirements. The use of `cloudpickle` is generally recommended over `pickle` for its improved handling of complex objects and dependencies.  However,  always prioritize security and avoid the use of `eval()` for deserializing function definitions in production environments.  Thorough testing is essential to validate the successful reconstruction and functionality of your custom normalizer after loading the SavedModel.
