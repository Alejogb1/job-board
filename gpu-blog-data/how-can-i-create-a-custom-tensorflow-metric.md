TensorFlow's flexibility allows for the construction of custom metrics beyond its pre-defined set, enabling precise performance analysis tailored to specific models. Specifically, it’s possible to combine two existing output tensors into a new scalar value representing a composite metric. This involves defining a function that performs the desired operations on the tensors and registering it as a custom metric within TensorFlow's evaluation framework.

I've frequently found that standard metrics fall short when working with specialized neural network architectures. For example, a model might produce two outputs: a classification probability distribution and a bounding box regression. To evaluate these jointly, a custom metric reflecting both accuracy and bounding box overlap may be more relevant than examining them independently. The crucial steps involve: defining the custom metric function using TensorFlow operations; integrating the function within the Keras model evaluation process; and understanding how batching and aggregation affect the final metric calculation.

The core of a custom metric is a function that accepts two input tensors and returns a single scalar tensor. These input tensors will typically be the model's output tensors related to your chosen criterion. Within the function, you can apply any available TensorFlow operation. It is essential to ensure that the operations are differentiable if you plan to use this custom metric during gradient descent optimization, although for metrics, you typically care only about computation and not derivatives. Let's consider three distinct examples for clarity.

**Example 1: Ratio of Two Outputs**

Assume we have two outputs: `output_a` representing the total number of predicted object occurrences within an image, and `output_b` representing the total number of ground truth objects. A useful metric could be their ratio. Here’s how to define this in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ratio_metric(output_a, output_b):
  """Computes the ratio of two tensors, handling division by zero."""
  output_a = tf.cast(output_a, dtype=tf.float32)
  output_b = tf.cast(output_b, dtype=tf.float32)
  safe_denominator = tf.maximum(output_b, tf.keras.backend.epsilon())  # Prevent division by zero
  ratio = output_a / safe_denominator
  return ratio

class RatioMetric(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
  """Wraps the ratio calculation function into a tf.keras.Metric class."""

  def __init__(self, name='ratio_metric', **kwargs):
    super(RatioMetric, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
    self.ratio_accumulator = self.add_weight(name='ratio_accumulator', initializer='zeros')
    self.count = self.add_weight(name='count', initializer='zeros')

  def update_state(self, output_a, output_b, sample_weight=None):
    ratio_val = ratio_metric(output_a, output_b)
    self.ratio_accumulator.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(ratio_val))
    self.count.assign_add(tf.cast(tf.size(ratio_val), dtype=tf.float32))


  def result(self):
    return self.ratio_accumulator / self.count

  def reset_state(self):
    self.ratio_accumulator.assign(0)
    self.count.assign(0)
```

**Commentary:**
*   The `ratio_metric` function performs the core computation. Note the cast to `tf.float32` to ensure proper division and the use of `tf.maximum` combined with `epsilon` to prevent division by zero.
*   The `RatioMetric` class inherits from `tf.keras.metrics.Metric`, defining the necessary methods for integration within Keras: `__init__`, `update_state`, `result`, and `reset_state`.
*   `update_state` aggregates the batch-wise computed ratios and counts. This ensures we're computing an average across all batches. The `sample_weight` argument is included as it's part of the Keras Metric contract, but not utilized here for simplicity.
*   `result` calculates the average ratio. The `tf.reduce_sum` in `update_state` is essential for properly accumulating the sum of the ratio values if the `output_a`, `output_b` are more than a single value.
*   `reset_state` resets the accumulator and count variables at the start of each epoch.

**Example 2: Weighted Sum of Classification and Regression Errors**

Consider a scenario where a model produces classification probabilities (`output_cls`) and a bounding box regression (`output_bbox`). We want to create a metric that combines the classification accuracy and the IoU (Intersection over Union) for the bounding box, weighted differently. We use a simple cross-entropy loss for classification and an L1 loss for the bounding box coordinates, then weigh them by some scalar value:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_loss_metric(output_cls, output_bbox, target_cls, target_bbox, classification_weight=0.5, regression_weight=0.5):
  """Computes a weighted sum of cross-entropy and L1 loss."""

  loss_cls = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(target_cls, output_cls)
  loss_bbox = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(target_bbox - output_bbox), axis=-1)
  combined_loss = classification_weight * loss_cls + regression_weight * loss_bbox
  return combined_loss


class WeightedLossMetric(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    """Wraps the weighted loss function into a tf.keras.Metric class."""
    def __init__(self, name='weighted_loss', classification_weight=0.5, regression_weight=0.5, **kwargs):
        super(WeightedLossMetric, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        self.weighted_loss_accumulator = self.add_weight(name='weighted_loss_accumulator', initializer='zeros')
        self.count = self.add_weight(name='count', initializer='zeros')
        self.classification_weight = classification_weight
        self.regression_weight = regression_weight

    def update_state(self, output_cls, output_bbox, target_cls, target_bbox, sample_weight=None):
      loss_val = weighted_loss_metric(output_cls, output_bbox, target_cls, target_bbox, self.classification_weight, self.regression_weight)
      self.weighted_loss_accumulator.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(loss_val))
      self.count.assign_add(tf.cast(tf.size(loss_val), dtype=tf.float32))

    def result(self):
        return self.weighted_loss_accumulator / self.count
    def reset_state(self):
      self.weighted_loss_accumulator.assign(0)
      self.count.assign(0)
```
**Commentary:**
*   The `weighted_loss_metric` computes the loss based on the provided weights and the output of cross-entropy loss for the classes and L1 loss for the bounding box coordinates.
*   The `WeightedLossMetric` class integrates this metric function with the Keras `Metric` structure, much like the previous example.
*   Notice that this implementation takes both model outputs *and* ground truth inputs. This underscores that a custom metric may take in labels as well.
*   The `classification_weight` and `regression_weight` hyperparameters are passed on to the calculation function and will be provided at metric instanciation.

**Example 3: Averaging Values Across Channels**

Suppose a model produces a multi-channel output tensor `output_multi`, and we want to compute the average value across all channels as a scalar metric:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def average_across_channels_metric(output_multi):
  """Computes the average value across channels."""
  averaged_value = tf.reduce_mean(output_multi, axis=-1) # Average across the channel dimension
  return averaged_value

class AverageChannelMetric(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    """Wraps the average across channels function into a tf.keras.Metric class."""
    def __init__(self, name='average_channel_metric', **kwargs):
        super(AverageChannelMetric, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        self.channel_accumulator = self.add_weight(name='channel_accumulator', initializer='zeros')
        self.count = self.add_weight(name='count', initializer='zeros')


    def update_state(self, output_multi, sample_weight=None):
        average_val = average_across_channels_metric(output_multi)
        self.channel_accumulator.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(average_val))
        self.count.assign_add(tf.cast(tf.size(average_val), dtype=tf.float32))


    def result(self):
        return self.channel_accumulator / self.count

    def reset_state(self):
      self.channel_accumulator.assign(0)
      self.count.assign(0)
```

**Commentary:**

*   The `average_across_channels_metric` calculates the average of all the channels of the input tensor.
*   The `AverageChannelMetric` handles the metric integration and accumulation across batches.
*   Here, the `tf.reduce_mean` is performed in the function, and the `tf.reduce_sum` in the update_state method sums over the batch dimension of the average value, which is important for averaging all the batch average values.

To use these custom metrics in a Keras model, one needs to instantiate the classes and pass them to the model's `compile` method, in the `metrics` parameter. For example:
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=[RatioMetric(), WeightedLossMetric(classification_weight=0.7, regression_weight=0.3), AverageChannelMetric()])

```
When evaluating or training, these custom metrics will be calculated along with the loss. The training loop updates the accumulation based on the batch results, and the results will be properly averaged across the entire dataset.

For further exploration, I suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on custom layers and metrics. Additionally, a good grasp of `tf.keras.backend` and different TensorFlow loss functions is beneficial when constructing complex metrics. Exploring the implementation details of pre-defined TensorFlow metrics can provide insights into effective metric design strategies. Studying literature on specialized metrics used in specific domains (e.g., medical imaging, natural language processing) can also inspire new approaches. Finally, practical experience constructing metrics for diverse model architectures proves invaluable.
