Defining a Python operation with a gradient in TensorFlow 2 requires a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities.  My experience working on large-scale physics simulations, specifically within the context of fluid dynamics modeling, heavily involved leveraging custom gradient definitions within TensorFlow.  Crucially, straightforward `tf.function`-decorated Python functions aren't automatically differentiable; TensorFlow needs explicit instructions on how to compute gradients for your custom operations. This is achieved through `tf.custom_gradient`.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`tf.custom_gradient` is the core mechanism. It allows you to define a function and its gradient function explicitly.  The function you define is your custom operation; the gradient function specifies how TensorFlow should compute the gradient with respect to the operation's inputs.  The key is understanding the flow: your custom operation takes inputs, performs computations, produces outputs, and the gradient function uses these outputs and possibly the inputs to calculate gradients for those inputs.  This calculated gradient is then used in the backpropagation process during training.  Crucially, this approach necessitates considering the mathematical derivatives of your custom operation.  A common mistake is overlooking the chain rule – particularly when composing multiple custom operations.

Several factors influence gradient calculation complexity.  The mathematical properties of your operation significantly impact the difficulty in deriving the gradient function.  Operations involving non-differentiable components require careful handling, potentially employing subgradients or approximations where exact derivatives are unavailable.  Furthermore, the computational cost of evaluating the gradient function should be optimized to prevent bottlenecks during training.  If the gradient computation is excessively complex, it can severely impact training speed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A simple custom square operation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def custom_square(x):
  """Computes the square of a tensor and defines its gradient."""
  y = tf.square(x)

  def grad(dy):
    """Computes the gradient of the square operation."""
    return 2 * x * dy

  return y, grad

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = custom_square(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Custom square of {x.numpy()}: {y.numpy()}")
print(f"Gradient of custom square: {dy_dx.numpy()}")
```

This demonstrates a straightforward case. The `custom_square` function defines the forward pass (squaring the input). The nested `grad` function calculates the gradient (2x). This is a fundamental illustration of the `tf.custom_gradient` decorator.


**Example 2:  Handling non-differentiable elements (ReLU with a twist):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def custom_relu(x):
  """Custom ReLU with a modified gradient for negative values."""
  y = tf.nn.relu(x)

  def grad(dy):
    # Modified gradient: small negative slope for negative inputs
    return tf.where(x < 0, dy * 0.01, dy)

  return y, grad

x = tf.Variable([-1.0, 1.0, -2.0, 3.0])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = custom_relu(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Custom ReLU output: {y.numpy()}")
print(f"Custom ReLU gradient: {dy_dx.numpy()}")
```

This example shows how to manage non-differentiable points.  The standard ReLU has a zero gradient for negative inputs. This version introduces a small, non-zero gradient for negative values to avoid vanishing gradients and enable learning even in regions where the standard ReLU's gradient is zero.  This modification is crucial in contexts where gradient stagnation is a concern.


**Example 3: A more complex scenario – a custom softmax with stability improvements:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def stable_softmax(x):
  """Softmax with numerical stability enhancements."""
  x_max = tf.reduce_max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  exp_x = tf.exp(x - x_max)
  sum_exp_x = tf.reduce_sum(exp_x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  y = exp_x / sum_exp_x


  def grad(dy):
    """Gradient calculation for numerically stable softmax."""
    grad_x = y * (dy - tf.reduce_sum(dy * y, axis=-1, keepdims=True))
    return grad_x

  return y, grad

x = tf.Variable([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = stable_softmax(x)
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y,x)
print(f"Stable softmax output:\n{y.numpy()}")
print(f"Stable softmax gradient:\n{dy_dx.numpy()}")

```

This example addresses a frequent numerical instability issue in the standard softmax implementation, especially with large input values. By subtracting the maximum value before exponentiation, we mitigate potential overflow errors.  The gradient function is derived considering this modification. This showcases a more sophisticated application where understanding both the forward pass and its associated derivative is crucial for producing a numerically stable and correctly differentiable function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections detailing `tf.custom_gradient` and automatic differentiation, are invaluable.  Supplement this with a solid understanding of calculus, particularly the computation of partial derivatives and application of the chain rule.  A good textbook on numerical methods will prove helpful for dealing with potential numerical instability issues inherent in certain operations.  Furthermore, carefully studying example implementations from established machine learning libraries and research papers can offer insights into implementing complex custom gradients.  Reviewing literature on numerical stability in deep learning will help avoid pitfalls in gradient calculations.
