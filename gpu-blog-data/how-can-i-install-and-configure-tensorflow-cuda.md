The successful integration of TensorFlow with CUDA and cuDNN on Ubuntu hinges critically on matching versions.  Inconsistent versions across these three components often lead to cryptic errors and frustrating debugging sessions.  My experience troubleshooting this for high-performance computing projects emphasizes the importance of meticulous version control and adherence to the official NVIDIA documentation.  Failure to do so results in hours, if not days, of wasted effort.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The installation process involves three distinct stages: installing the NVIDIA driver, installing CUDA, and finally, installing cuDNN.  Each stage has specific dependencies and version compatibility requirements.  Before commencing, verifying your system's hardware compatibility with CUDA is paramount.  Ensure your GPU is listed in NVIDIA's CUDA GPUs support list.  Further, determining the compute capability of your GPU is crucial for selecting the appropriate CUDA toolkit version.  This information is typically accessible through the NVIDIA-SMI command-line utility.

The NVIDIA driver provides the low-level interface between your GPU and the operating system. CUDA acts as the middleware, allowing developers to leverage GPU capabilities for general-purpose programming.  cuDNN, the CUDA Deep Neural Network library, is specifically optimized for deep learning tasks, offering significant performance improvements over using CUDA alone for TensorFlow.  Each component builds upon the previous one; therefore, a strict installation order must be maintained.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Installing the NVIDIA Driver**

The installation of the NVIDIA driver is heavily dependent on the specific model of your graphics card. Download the correct .run file from the NVIDIA website corresponding to your Ubuntu version (20.04 in this case) and your GPU.  Execute the following commands in a terminal after making the downloaded file executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.103.01.run  # Replace with your file name
sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.103.01.run  # Replace with your file name
sudo reboot
```

This process involves a series of interactive prompts.  Carefully follow the instructions provided during the installation.  Post-reboot, verify successful driver installation using:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

This command should display information regarding your GPU and its current driver version.  Failure to see this output indicates an issue during driver installation requiring further investigation and potentially re-installation.  Consult NVIDIA's documentation for detailed troubleshooting steps specific to your driver version.

**Example 2: Installing CUDA Toolkit**

The CUDA Toolkit installation is significantly streamlined via the runfile method provided by NVIDIA.  After downloading the correct `.run` file (ensure compatibility with your driver and GPU compute capability!), the installation proceeds as follows:

```bash
sudo chmod +x cuda_11.8.0_525.85.05_linux.run # Replace with your file name and version.
sudo ./cuda_11.8.0_525.85.05_linux.run # Replace with your file name and version.
```

The installer presents options for customized installation.  I typically choose the default options unless specific needs dictate otherwise.  During my experience, custom installations often led to path-related configuration issues.  Post-installation, verifying the installation is crucial.  Navigate to the CUDA installation directory (usually `/usr/local/cuda`) and execute the sample code provided in the `samples` directory to confirm that CUDA is functioning correctly.  Furthermore, adding the CUDA paths to your environment variables is necessary.  Edit your `.bashrc` file (or equivalent) to include:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```

Remember to source your `.bashrc` file afterwards using `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

**Example 3: Installing cuDNN**

The cuDNN installation is less straightforward than CUDA.  It requires downloading the cuDNN library from the NVIDIA website after logging in with an NVIDIA developer account.  The downloaded archive contains a set of files that need to be extracted and copied to the correct CUDA directories.  The specific location depends on your CUDA installation path.  Assuming a standard installation, the process might look like this:

```bash
tar -xzvf cudnn-11.x-linux-x64-v8.6.0.163.tgz # Replace with your file name and version.
sudo cp cudnn-11x-linux-x64-v8.6.0.163/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include/
sudo cp cudnn-11x-linux-x64-v8.6.0.163/cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
sudo ldconfig
```

This copies the necessary header files and libraries to the CUDA installation directory.  `ldconfig` updates the dynamic linker cache to ensure the system recognizes the newly added libraries.  Failure to run `ldconfig` can lead to runtime errors when TensorFlow attempts to utilize cuDNN.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

NVIDIA's official CUDA documentation.  The TensorFlow documentation, specifically the section on GPU support and installation.  The Ubuntu documentation on package management and system configuration.  These resources provide comprehensive information and troubleshooting guidance.  Consulting them proactively, before any issues arise, is highly recommended.

In closing, remember to meticulously document each step, including version numbers.  This aids in troubleshooting and ensures reproducibility.  The intricacies of this process necessitate careful attention to detail and rigorous version management.  Approaching the installation with a systematic and well-documented approach is crucial for achieving a successful and stable environment.  Ignoring this advice will almost certainly lead to compatibility issues and considerable debugging time, which, based on my experience, is best avoided.
