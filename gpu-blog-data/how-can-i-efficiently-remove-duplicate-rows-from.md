The absence of an index on a table significantly complicates the process of removing duplicate rows efficiently. Without the typical speed boost provided by an index, methods rely on scanning substantial portions or the entirety of the table, making careful algorithm selection critical for minimizing computational cost and execution time. My experience in high-throughput data processing environments has underscored the need for such optimization, particularly when dealing with legacy systems or situations where indexing is not an immediate option.

The challenge arises because traditional approaches using methods like `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY` for duplicate identification often internally leverage indexes for performance. Without one, these methods will revert to full table scans, which is not scalable for larger datasets. The approach I've found most consistently effective involves leveraging temporary tables and row numbering based on the desired columns for uniqueness. This method allows us to identify and target duplicates without relying on indexed lookups.

The underlying strategy is to first enumerate each row within a grouped set of potential duplicates. We achieve this by partitioning our dataset based on the columns that define a duplicate. Then, within each partition, we assign a sequential number. Duplicates, by definition, will have the same value within the partition and therefore receive a number greater than 1. This numbered set is then used to identify the first occurrence, which is retained, and others which are discarded.

Here's a breakdown of the process and accompanying code examples:

**1. Row Numbering and Temporary Table Creation:**

First, we create a temporary table. This table mirrors the structure of our source table and includes an additional column: `row_num`. The purpose of this `row_num` column is to keep track of the sequence of each duplicate group.  The numbering is assigned using a window function such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, which is partitioned by the specified columns which determine if a row is a duplicate. The insert statement will copy all rows from the original table with the added `row_num`.

```sql
-- Assume the table is named 'original_table' with columns col1, col2, col3

CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_table AS
SELECT
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY col1, col2, col3 ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) as row_num
FROM original_table;

-- Verification of temporary table schema
-- SELECT * FROM temp_table LIMIT 10;
```

The `PARTITION BY` clause is critical. It's followed by the specific columns that, when combined, define a unique row. The `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)` is used because we only need to enumerate within the group without a specific order. The `SELECT NULL` ensures we do not sort by an unnecessary column. The `SELECT *` ensures that all data in the original table is transferred to the temp table. Using temporary tables is generally preferable to permanent tables in this situation as they are automatically dropped at the end of a session and will not leave artifacts behind.

**2. Selecting Unique Rows:**

Now that we have a temporary table with assigned row numbers, selecting the unique rows becomes trivial. We simply query the temporary table, filtering for rows where `row_num` equals 1. These rows represent the first occurrence of each unique set of values for our chosen columns.

```sql
-- Select unique rows from the temporary table
CREATE TEMP TABLE unique_table AS
SELECT *
FROM temp_table
WHERE row_num = 1;

-- Verification of unique rows
-- SELECT * FROM unique_table LIMIT 10;

```

We're essentially performing a selection by checking if the row number is 1. The rows with other numbers have already been identified as duplicates and can be safely ignored. The `unique_table` now holds one copy of each distinct set of columns that defined a duplicate row.

**3. Replacing the Original Table:**

Finally, we replace the content of the original table with the unique rows stored in our `unique_table`. This involves first truncating the `original_table` to remove its content, and then re-inserting the selected rows from our temporary table. This will effectively remove all duplicate rows while preserving only unique entries in the original table.

```sql
-- Truncate the original table
TRUNCATE TABLE original_table;

-- Insert unique rows into the original table
INSERT INTO original_table
SELECT col1, col2, col3
FROM unique_table;

--Verification of final data in original table
-- SELECT * from original_table;
```
It's important to truncate the table instead of deleting all rows because truncation is faster. Also, remember to insert only the required columns and avoid inserting the `row_num` column. The process is now complete, and the original table contains only the unique rows based on the chosen columns.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Large Tables:** For extremely large tables, performance might still be a concern. In such cases, consider batching the insertion into the temporary table or breaking up the temporary table creation into multiple smaller partitions for performance optimization.
*   **Data Types:** The `PARTITION BY` clause is sensitive to data type mismatches. Ensure that data types are handled appropriately. Implicit type casting may introduce performance degradation in some database systems.
*   **Transaction Management:** For critical operations, always encapsulate the entire process within a transaction. This ensures that either all changes are committed or none are, maintaining data consistency.
*   **Disk Space:** The temporary tables will use disk space during the process. Be mindful of disk space limitations when working with exceptionally large tables.
* **Column Considerations:** In certain situations, the definition of a "duplicate row" might rely on a subset of the table columns. Adjust the `PARTITION BY` clause accordingly to specify only those columns to evaluate for a duplicate.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further study and optimization, consult resources focusing on:

*   Window function performance in different database systems
*   Temporary table best practices
*   Transaction management for data modification operations
*   Optimizing query execution plans for large datasets

These resources provide a more in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics used for row operations, and further detail options for optimizing the operation for a variety of scenarios. They also offer options for when the `ROW_NUMBER()` approach might not be most appropriate, such as when a specific ordering within the duplicate set needs to be maintained.  Understanding these mechanics and how they apply to specific database solutions provides invaluable tools for optimizing data manipulation tasks.
