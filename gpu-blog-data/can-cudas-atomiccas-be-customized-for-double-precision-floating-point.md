CUDA's atomicCAS (Compare-and-Swap) operation, as implemented in the CUDA toolkit, does not directly support double-precision floating-point types.  This stems from the fundamental hardware limitations of atomic operations on many GPU architectures.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving financial modeling and large-scale simulations has consistently highlighted this limitation. While atomic operations on integers are generally well-supported at the hardware level, the atomicity guarantee for floating-point types, especially double-precision, often requires significantly more complex and less efficient software emulation.

**1. Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the granularity of atomic operations supported by the underlying hardware.  Most GPUs offer efficient atomic operations on 32-bit integers.  Extending this atomicity to 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers necessitates either more complex hardware instructions or software-based synchronization mechanisms.  Direct hardware support for atomic double-precision operations is not universally available across all GPU architectures, even in modern generations.  Attempting to use atomicCAS with a `double` type will likely either result in a compilation error, depending on the compiler's strictness, or, worse, produce unpredictable behavior due to race conditions. The compiler might attempt to implicitly cast the double to an integer type, leading to data corruption and erroneous results.

The challenge isn't simply the increased data size.  Floating-point numbers have a more complex internal representation than integers, introducing additional complexities when ensuring atomic updates.  Maintaining atomicity requires ensuring that no intermediate states of the floating-point value are visible to other threads during the update process.  This is considerably more intricate to guarantee with floating-point numbers compared to integers.

Software solutions to emulate atomic double-precision operations exist, but they inherently introduce overhead.  These often rely on techniques like mutexes or other forms of synchronization primitives, negating much of the performance advantage typically associated with atomic operations. The significant performance penalty incurred often outweighs the benefits of attempting to achieve atomicity in this way, especially in highly parallel workloads.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Attempted (Incorrect) Usage:**

```c++
__global__ void incorrectAtomicDouble(double* data, int index, double newValue) {
  atomicCAS(data + index, 0.0, newValue); // Incorrect!
}
```

This code snippet attempts to use `atomicCAS` directly with a double-precision variable.  This is incorrect and will likely lead to compiler errors or undefined behavior.  The compiler will probably complain about type mismatch, but even if it compiles without error, the results will not be atomic.


**Example 2: Mutex-Based Synchronization (Correct, but slow):**

```c++
__global__ void mutexAtomicDouble(double* data, int index, double newValue, mutex* m) {
  m[index].lock(); // Acquire lock for this specific element
  data[index] = newValue;
  m[index].unlock(); // Release lock
}
```

This approach uses a mutex array (one mutex per double-precision element) to ensure atomicity.  Each thread acquires a lock before modifying the corresponding double-precision value.  While functionally correct in achieving atomicity, this approach introduces significant overhead due to the locking mechanism.  The contention for mutexes can become a significant performance bottleneck, especially with a large number of concurrent threads. This method sacrifices the performance advantages of atomic operations for correctness.


**Example 3: Atomic Operations on Integer Representation (Advanced, error-prone):**

```c++
__global__ void atomicIntegerRep(long long* dataInt, int index, double newValue) {
  long long newValueInt = reinterpret_cast<long long&>(newValue); //Potentially unsafe conversion
  atomicExch(dataInt + index, newValueInt); //Atomic operation on long long
}
```

This example attempts to leverage the atomic operations available for `long long` integers. The double-precision floating-point number is interpreted as a `long long` integer.  While this achieves atomicity, it is extremely risky.  The interpretation of the bit pattern depends on the floating-point representation used and is highly susceptible to errors and platform-dependent behavior. The accuracy of the result after the reinterpret cast cannot be guaranteed and this approach should be avoided unless you are fully aware of the consequences and the platform specific details.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and the relevant documentation for your specific GPU architecture are crucial resources.  A thorough understanding of concurrency and synchronization primitives within the CUDA programming model is essential.  Consult advanced texts on parallel programming and GPU computing for in-depth knowledge of atomic operations and their limitations.  Focusing on efficient algorithms that minimize the need for atomic operations on floating-point numbers is a superior strategy for high-performance computing on GPUs.  Careful consideration of data structures and algorithmic choices often presents more effective solutions than attempting to force atomic operations on unsupported data types.
