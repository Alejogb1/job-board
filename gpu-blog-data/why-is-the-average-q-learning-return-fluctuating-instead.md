The core reason a Q-learning agent's average return fluctuates, rather than consistently increasing during training, stems from the inherent exploration-exploitation dilemma and the non-stationarity of the Q-function estimates. Specifically, the updates to the Q-table, especially in early stages and in environments with sparse rewards or large state-action spaces, can destabilize the learning process.

Q-learning, at its heart, is an off-policy temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm. It seeks to learn an optimal action-value function, denoted as Q(s, a), which estimates the expected cumulative reward of taking action 'a' in state 's' and following the optimal policy thereafter. This function is typically represented as a table for discrete state and action spaces, or approximated by a neural network for continuous spaces. During training, we iteratively refine these estimates based on observed transitions – <state, action, reward, next state>. The update rule, shown below, is where fluctuations often originate:

```
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α * (r + γ * max Q(s', a') - Q(s, a))
```
Where:

*   `Q(s, a)` is the current estimate of the action-value function.
*   `α` is the learning rate, determining how much of the error term is used to update the current estimate.
*   `r` is the immediate reward received after taking action 'a' in state 's'.
*   `γ` is the discount factor, weighing future rewards relative to immediate rewards.
*   `max Q(s', a')` is the maximum estimated future reward from the next state 's''.

The `max` operator itself contributes to instability. It tends to overestimate the action-values during the initial learning phases, as early estimates are unreliable. The agent selects the maximum estimated value, which could well be a randomly initialized or inaccurate estimate. As the Q-values are updated based on these overestimates, a cascade effect can occur, leading to fluctuations rather than consistent progress. Furthermore, the non-stationarity is evident in that the `Q(s, a)` estimates are constantly changing, and the data the algorithm is learning from is drawn from a policy that is also changing. In contrast, other methods like monte carlo learning would be more stationary.

Consider an environment where the reward signal is sparse, such as navigating a simple grid world to a distant goal. Early exploration, driven by an epsilon-greedy policy, might lead to random actions for a prolonged time. As the agent stumbles upon a reward, it starts updating Q-values along the successful path. But the agent hasn’t fully explored and doesn't have enough information to ensure consistent performance. Before the agent reliably exploits the path, it might venture into poorly understood areas based on inaccurate Q-value estimates, resulting in a drop in the average return. In these early stages, the learning process is essentially noisy, leading to variability in performance, which is a cause of the fluctuations in the return.

Another contributor to the issue is the learning rate, `α`. A large learning rate can lead to quick, but unstable learning, where significant updates can cause wild oscillations in the Q-values and, consequently, the performance. A small learning rate can make the learning process very slow and potentially trap the learning in a suboptimal local solution. There is a delicate balance between convergence speed and stability in parameter tuning.

Here are some code examples to demonstrate how these fluctuations can manifest, written using Python and numpy for clarity:

**Example 1: Basic Q-Learning in a Small Grid World**

```python
import numpy as np

class GridWorld:
  def __init__(self, size=5):
      self.size = size
      self.agent_position = (0, 0)
      self.goal_position = (size - 1, size - 1)

  def reset(self):
      self.agent_position = (0, 0)
      return self.agent_position

  def step(self, action):
      x, y = self.agent_position
      if action == 0 and x > 0: x -= 1 # Up
      if action == 1 and x < self.size-1: x += 1 # Down
      if action == 2 and y > 0: y -= 1 # Left
      if action == 3 and y < self.size-1: y += 1 # Right
      self.agent_position = (x,y)
      if self.agent_position == self.goal_position:
        return self.agent_position, 1, True
      return self.agent_position, 0, False


def epsilon_greedy(Q, state, epsilon):
  if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
    return np.random.choice(4)
  else:
    return np.argmax(Q[state])


def q_learning(env, episodes=500, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.5):
    Q = np.zeros((env.size, env.size, 4))
    epsilon_decay_rate = epsilon / episodes
    all_returns = []

    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = epsilon_greedy(Q, state, epsilon)
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
            next_state_index = tuple(next_state)
            state_index = tuple(state)
            Q[state_index][action] = Q[state_index][action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state_index]) - Q[state_index][action])
            total_reward += reward
            state = next_state

        all_returns.append(total_reward)
        epsilon = max(epsilon - epsilon_decay_rate, 0.1) #Decrease epsilon
    return Q, all_returns


env = GridWorld(size=5)
Q, returns = q_learning(env)
print(f"Average return: {sum(returns) / len(returns)}") # this value is not representative
print(f"Last 10 returns: {returns[-10:]}")

```

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of Q-learning in a simple grid world. The `q_learning` function contains the training loop. The return is calculated over an entire episode. Notice that despite learning, the returns may not monotonically increase, due to the reasons mentioned previously.

**Example 2: Impact of Learning Rate**

```python
import numpy as np

# Example code similar to above, but modified to show the effect of different learning rates
def run_experiment(alpha):
    env = GridWorld(size=5)
    Q, returns = q_learning(env, alpha=alpha)
    return returns


alphas = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5]
all_returns_by_alpha = []
for alpha in alphas:
    returns = run_experiment(alpha)
    all_returns_by_alpha.append(returns)
    print(f"Average return for alpha {alpha}: {sum(returns) / len(returns)}")
```
This code snippet compares the average returns of three different learning rates by running the q-learning algorithm in a GridWorld. You'll see that smaller learning rates may result in slower progress, whereas larger values could produce unstable results. This helps highlight the impact of different hyperparameters on return.

**Example 3: Epsilon decay schedule**

```python
import numpy as np
# Example code similar to above, but modified to show the effect of decay of epsilon
def q_learning_decay(env, episodes=500, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.5):
    Q = np.zeros((env.size, env.size, 4))
    all_returns = []
    epsilon_schedule = np.linspace(epsilon,0.1, episodes)

    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0
        done = False
        epsilon = epsilon_schedule[episode]

        while not done:
            action = epsilon_greedy(Q, state, epsilon)
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
            next_state_index = tuple(next_state)
            state_index = tuple(state)
            Q[state_index][action] = Q[state_index][action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state_index]) - Q[state_index][action])
            total_reward += reward
            state = next_state

        all_returns.append(total_reward)
    return Q, all_returns

env = GridWorld(size=5)
Q, returns = q_learning_decay(env)
print(f"Average return: {sum(returns) / len(returns)}")
print(f"Last 10 returns: {returns[-10:]}")
```
This final example demonstrates how a time-varying epsilon exploration strategy can impact return. We are using `np.linspace` to create a schedule for epsilon value that decays from initial to a minimum value of 0.1 linearly. The code is very similar to example 1 except for how we set the exploration rate. This example is also helpful to illustrate the role of randomness in the learning process.

To mitigate these fluctuations and improve learning stability, consider the following:

1. **Double Q-Learning:** Reduces the overestimation bias of Q-learning by using two Q-value functions. This decoupling of action selection and evaluation stabilizes learning.
2. **Adjusting Hyperparameters:** Tuning the learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon exploration rate can significantly impact learning performance. Techniques like decaying epsilon over time can help balance exploration and exploitation.
3. **Experience Replay:** Storing previous experiences in a buffer and replaying them during training breaks the temporal correlation of the experiences and facilitates more stable learning by sampling.
4. **Target Networks:** Using a separate 'target' network for calculating TD errors can also improve stability. The target network's parameters are only updated periodically by copying the main network's weights.

For further theoretical and practical knowledge, I recommend reviewing material on reinforcement learning algorithms from academic sources. Also, practical deep learning textbooks that explain experience replay are beneficial. Reading about the exploration/exploitation tradeoff and its implications on reinforcement learning is very helpful. Finally, consider studying the practical effects of hyperparameter tuning on convergence speed and stability, including different strategies for setting the learning rate, such as step decay.
