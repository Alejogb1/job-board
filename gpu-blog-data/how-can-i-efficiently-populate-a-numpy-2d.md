Populating NumPy 2D arrays efficiently hinges primarily on avoiding Python loops whenever possible, instead leveraging NumPy’s vectorized operations and optimized memory management. My experience developing high-throughput simulation tools underscores how critical this efficiency is; inefficient array initialization can easily become a performance bottleneck. The underlying issue arises from the fact that looping in Python incurs significant overhead due to its dynamic typing and interpreted nature, whereas NumPy functions execute highly optimized, compiled code.

The most straightforward, yet often least performant, approach involves using nested Python loops to assign values to individual array elements. This method, while conceptually simple, becomes computationally expensive as the array dimensions grow. Consider the following scenario, where we aim to populate a 1000x1000 array with values based on the sum of their row and column indices.

```python
import numpy as np

def populate_array_loops(rows, cols):
    arr = np.zeros((rows, cols))
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            arr[i, j] = i + j
    return arr

rows = 1000
cols = 1000
array_loops = populate_array_loops(rows, cols)
```

In this example, `populate_array_loops` initializes a 2D array of zeros, then iterates through each row and column using nested loops to compute and assign the value. The overhead associated with Python's loop interpreter makes this approach unacceptably slow for larger datasets. This method also fails to take advantage of NumPy’s efficient internal structure.

A substantial improvement comes from utilizing NumPy’s `fromfunction` method. This function allows us to create an array by applying a specific function across its indices without explicit loops. The function, taking row and column indices as inputs, returns the desired value for each location in the array.

```python
import numpy as np

def populate_array_fromfunction(rows, cols):
    arr = np.fromfunction(lambda i, j: i + j, (rows, cols), dtype=int)
    return arr


rows = 1000
cols = 1000
array_fromfunction = populate_array_fromfunction(rows, cols)
```

Here, `populate_array_fromfunction` leverages `np.fromfunction` to execute the lambda function over all array indices. The crucial element is that this operation is performed internally by NumPy’s optimized routines rather than in Python, thus significantly improving performance. The `dtype=int` parameter ensures the array holds integers, saving memory and optimizing calculations further. This method is far superior to the nested loop approach, especially for large arrays, because it vectorizes the computation of values.

A further efficiency gain can be achieved through broadcasting and mathematical operations on NumPy arrays directly. Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays with different shapes under certain rules. When working with arrays of different but compatible shapes, NumPy will extend smaller arrays automatically to conform to larger arrays, avoiding the need for loops to perform element-wise operations. For instance, consider the use of row and column vectors to construct the desired array.

```python
import numpy as np

def populate_array_broadcast(rows, cols):
    row_indices = np.arange(rows)
    col_indices = np.arange(cols)
    arr = row_indices[:, None] + col_indices
    return arr

rows = 1000
cols = 1000
array_broadcast = populate_array_broadcast(rows, cols)
```
In this example, `populate_array_broadcast` generates one-dimensional arrays representing row and column indices, respectively. The core operation, `row_indices[:, None] + col_indices`, uses broadcasting to expand the dimensions correctly to perform the element-wise sum without any explicit loops. This approach is typically the fastest because it directly leverages NumPy's optimized operations without the intermediate calls required for fromfunction. The `[:, None]` indexing adds a new axis, turning the `row_indices` vector into a column vector, allowing the subsequent addition with `col_indices` which produces the desired two dimensional array. This example highlights that careful manipulation of array shapes can lead to very optimized code.

For situations involving non-trivial computations beyond simple addition, `fromfunction` often remains the best choice. When applicable, leveraging broadcasting is preferable for numerical operations where explicit vectorized operations are available, such as simple arithmetic, comparisons, or logical operations. Furthermore, when constructing arrays that adhere to a regular pattern, consider functions like `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, or `np.meshgrid` and array manipulation functions like `reshape` and indexing to build the desired array structure. For instance, creating sequences of numbers is significantly faster with `arange` than manual loop-based construction. Pre-allocating memory with the correct datatype using `np.empty` or `np.zeros` can be critical if you need to populate array with more complex logic as they provide optimal memory layout, but care must be taken not to overwrite other arrays by accident. When working with highly structured arrays, creating them using logical masks and boolean indexing can prove more readable and performant.

In summary, efficiency in NumPy 2D array population stems from utilizing NumPy's vectorized operations and avoiding Python loops as much as possible. Broadcasting and `fromfunction` are powerful tools for this purpose. For further knowledge on these topics, I would recommend exploring NumPy documentation detailing array creation, indexing, broadcasting, and functions like `fromfunction`. Also, resources that provide deep dives into NumPy's internal memory model and optimization will prove beneficial. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the concept of vectorized operations within linear algebra, forms the theoretical backbone of these operations and a worthwhile endeavor to explore.
