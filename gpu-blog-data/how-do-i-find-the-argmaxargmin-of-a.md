In PyTorch, identifying the indices of the maximum or minimum values within a tensor, while restricting the search to a defined subset of indices, requires careful manipulation of masking and index selection. This isn't directly supported by a single built-in function; instead, a combination of operations is necessary to achieve the desired outcome efficiently. Having worked extensively with model training on complex datasets, I've frequently encountered this requirement, especially when dealing with padded sequences or masked attention mechanisms.

The core challenge stems from the need to prevent the argmax or argmin function from considering elements outside the specified index set. Naively applying these functions on a slice of the tensor might seem intuitive but doesn't maintain the original tensor's index space. The solution involves creating a mask that effectively nullifies values outside the considered indices before applying the argmax or argmin operation. This approach preserves the original index context, ensuring that the resulting index is referenced against the whole tensor, not just the selection.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

First, we establish a boolean mask with the same shape as the tensor, where `True` indicates indices that should be considered and `False` signifies those to be ignored. This mask is typically derived from some logical condition or explicitly provided as a separate tensor. We then apply this mask to the input tensor to produce a masked tensor. The unmasked elements remain their original values, while the masked elements are either set to negative or positive infinities, depending on whether you are seeking the argmax or argmin, respectively. When performing the `argmax` or `argmin` function, this replacement ensures that the masked elements will be ignored, because infinite values will always be the min or max.

Following the application of the mask, we can perform a global `argmax` or `argmin` operation as usual; the infinities won't influence the result. The resulting index is relative to the original tensor's shape, as the masking operations do not modify the tensor's dimensions.

Let’s look at examples:

**Example 1: Finding the argmax with a simple mask**

```python
import torch

# Assume this is our tensor, for example, log probabilities.
tensor = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.9, 0.2, 0.6])

# Specify indices we want to consider (e.g., first 3 elements)
valid_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])

# Create a mask with true values on valid indices
mask = torch.zeros_like(tensor, dtype=torch.bool)
mask[valid_indices] = True

# Convert the boolean mask to floating point
float_mask = mask.float()

# Create a masked tensor where invalid elements have large negative value
masked_tensor = tensor * float_mask + (1 - float_mask) * float("-inf")

# Find the argmax of the masked tensor.
argmax_index = torch.argmax(masked_tensor)

print(f"Original tensor: {tensor}")
print(f"Mask: {mask}")
print(f"Masked tensor: {masked_tensor}")
print(f"Argmax index (within the masked indices): {argmax_index}")
```

In this example, the `valid_indices` tensor defines which elements are considered during the `argmax` calculation. Elements at other indices are ignored. The resulting `argmax_index` points to the element with the highest value *within* the selected set. The boolean mask is converted to a float representation as tensors must have numeric types for element-wise multiplication. The masked tensor assigns `-inf` to the elements that are outside the range of valid indices. These very low values are subsequently ignored by the `torch.argmax` function.

**Example 2: Finding the argmin with a mask based on a condition**

```python
import torch

# Example tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4])

# Create a mask that considers only elements greater than 3
mask = tensor > 3

# Convert the boolean mask to floating point
float_mask = mask.float()

# Create a masked tensor where invalid elements have large positive value
masked_tensor = tensor * float_mask + (1 - float_mask) * float("inf")

# Find the argmin of the masked tensor.
argmin_index = torch.argmin(masked_tensor)

print(f"Original tensor: {tensor}")
print(f"Mask: {mask}")
print(f"Masked tensor: {masked_tensor}")
print(f"Argmin index (within the mask): {argmin_index}")
```

Here, the mask is generated dynamically based on the values of the input tensor itself, selecting only elements greater than 3. The process then identifies the index containing the minimum value among the unmasked elements. We apply a positive infinity to ensure that `argmin` will not pick an element that does not meet the criteria specified in the mask.

**Example 3: Batch processing with multiple masks**

```python
import torch

# Example batch of tensors
batch_tensor = torch.tensor([
    [1, 7, 3, 9, 2],
    [8, 4, 6, 5, 1],
    [3, 9, 2, 7, 8]
])

# Example batch of masks
batch_masks = torch.tensor([
    [True, False, True, True, False],
    [False, True, True, False, True],
    [True, True, False, False, True]
], dtype=torch.bool)


# Convert the boolean mask to floating point
float_masks = batch_masks.float()

# Masked tensors
masked_batch_tensor = batch_tensor * float_masks + (1 - float_masks) * float("-inf")

# Argmax along dimension 1 (rows)
argmax_indices = torch.argmax(masked_batch_tensor, dim=1)


print(f"Batch tensor: \n{batch_tensor}")
print(f"Batch masks: \n{batch_masks}")
print(f"Masked Batch Tensor: \n{masked_batch_tensor}")
print(f"Argmax indices (per row, with masking): {argmax_indices}")
```

This example illustrates batch processing, handling a set of tensors and masks simultaneously. Each mask corresponds to a tensor in the batch, and the argmax is computed for each tensor row, respecting the row’s individual mask. The operation is dimension aware, using `dim = 1` to compute the argmax within each row and return a vector of indices for each row. This is essential in situations such as batch processing sequences.

Regarding resources for further exploration, I recommend focusing on documentation and tutorials provided by PyTorch itself. Specifically, the official PyTorch documentation on tensor operations, masking, indexing, and the `torch.argmax` and `torch.argmin` functions provides the most reliable and comprehensive information. Additionally, tutorials focused on attention mechanisms in transformers or sequence processing often demonstrate similar techniques using masking in conjunction with argmax operations, which offer valuable use case examples. Research papers discussing masked loss functions or reinforcement learning may also demonstrate similar patterns of masked index selection. Finally, the source code for open-source deep learning libraries often provides insights into how masking is applied in practice for various tasks.

In summary, the process for finding the argmax/argmin of a PyTorch tensor with specified indices relies on creating a mask, applying this mask to nullify unwanted values using infinities, and then performing the argmax or argmin function. This technique is a powerful tool for controlling which elements of a tensor are considered during these operations, allowing for flexible and specific index selection within tensor computations. This masking method is not only efficient but also maintains the crucial relationship between the returned index and the original tensor's index space.
