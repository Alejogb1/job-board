`cudaMemcpy2D` errors, particularly those arising with large arrays, often stem from subtle misconfigurations of the memory copy parameters rather than fundamental GPU hardware issues. Having wrestled with this exact problem during a large-scale image processing project utilizing a custom CUDA kernel, I've found the root causes typically involve incorrect pitch calculations, insufficient allocated memory on the destination, or data type mismatches. These issues tend to become more pronounced with large datasets due to the increased likelihood of cumulative errors.

The most frequent culprit is an inaccurate `pitch` value. In CUDA, the `pitch` represents the byte-aligned width of a row in a 2D memory allocation. This is crucial because GPU memory isnâ€™t always arranged contiguously as a simple array. Instead, it's often padded for optimal memory access performance by the GPU's memory controllers. Failing to account for this padding, and hence not providing the correct `pitch` value, will lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes, manifesting as a `cudaMemcpy2D` error when copying data. Specifically, if the source or destination `pitch` is smaller than the actual row width in memory, only a portion of the data row will be copied. Consequently, if your intention is to copy the whole image or matrix, there will be an error. If the pitch is larger than necessary there can be performance issues, because the data will be further apart than it needs to be, making reading slower.

Second, the allocated memory on either the source or the destination might be insufficient, especially in instances where sizes are calculated on the fly without stringent boundary checks. For example, if you allocate memory based on a computed value for the number of rows, but then fail to account for the correct pitch, your allocation could be smaller than necessary for a successful transfer, leading to memory overwrites. The `cudaMemcpy2D` function expects that both source and destination regions, described by their respective pointers, widths, heights, pitches, and the offset, have sufficient memory to facilitate the copy, and, if they do not, an error will be raised.

A less frequent, but equally problematic issue is the data type mismatch. CUDA requires the source and destination memory to have compatible data types. If a copy is attempted from a source allocated with `float` to a destination allocated with `int` (or vice versa), or more generally, the types are not equivalent in size and representation, then, while `cudaMemcpy2D` may appear to run without immediate errors, the copied data will be corrupted. It may later manifest as a runtime error when the data is used. It is critical to review how the memory was allocated in both locations and make sure the types are identical.

Furthermore, it's important to consider the coordinate offsets and how they interact with the pitch. Errors are often the result of mixing up the interpretation of the x and y origin coordinates within the memory region. Incorrect origins or offsets will result in out-of-bounds errors.

To illustrate, let's examine several code examples focusing on these specific issues.

**Example 1: Correct `pitch` Calculation**

This example demonstrates a typical scenario where the correct pitch is calculated and used in the `cudaMemcpy2D` call. It involves copying a grayscale image.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

// Assuming a simple grayscale image
struct Image {
    int width;
    int height;
    unsigned char* data;  // Raw image data (host)
};

bool copy_image_to_device(const Image& host_image, unsigned char** device_data) {
    size_t width = host_image.width;
    size_t height = host_image.height;
    size_t pitch = 0;

    // Allocate device memory using cudaMallocPitch which returns the pitch
    cudaError_t err = cudaMallocPitch((void**)device_data, &pitch, width * sizeof(unsigned char), height);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMallocPitch failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return false;
    }


    err = cudaMemcpy2D(*device_data, pitch, host_image.data, width * sizeof(unsigned char),
                       width * sizeof(unsigned char), height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
         std::cerr << "cudaMemcpy2D failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(*device_data);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}


int main() {
    int width = 512;
    int height = 512;
    unsigned char* host_image_data = new unsigned char[width * height];
    for (int i = 0; i < width * height; ++i) {
        host_image_data[i] = (unsigned char)(i % 256); // Some dummy data
    }

    Image host_image;
    host_image.width = width;
    host_image.height = height;
    host_image.data = host_image_data;


    unsigned char* device_image_data = nullptr;
    if (copy_image_to_device(host_image, &device_image_data)) {
         std::cout << "Image successfully transferred." << std::endl;
    }
    else{
        std::cout << "Image Transfer failed" << std::endl;
    }
    
    cudaFree(device_image_data);
    delete[] host_image_data;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `cudaMallocPitch` is used, not `cudaMalloc`. It returns the optimal `pitch` value for memory access on the GPU, and the same pitch is then provided in the `cudaMemcpy2D` call. The width parameter in cudaMemcpy2D is, in this case, equivalent to `width * sizeof(unsigned char)` which is the same value that was passed to `cudaMallocPitch`.

**Example 2: Incorrect `pitch` Leading to Errors**

This snippet shows the error that occurs when the calculated pitch is incorrect.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

// Assuming a simple grayscale image
struct Image {
    int width;
    int height;
    unsigned char* data;  // Raw image data (host)
};

bool copy_image_to_device_bad_pitch(const Image& host_image, unsigned char** device_data) {
    size_t width = host_image.width;
    size_t height = host_image.height;

    // Incorrect: Assume no padding for pitch
    size_t pitch = width * sizeof(unsigned char);

    // Allocate memory with cudaMalloc, using width*height as the total size
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void**)device_data, pitch * height);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMalloc failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return false;
    }


    err = cudaMemcpy2D(*device_data, pitch, host_image.data, width * sizeof(unsigned char),
                       width * sizeof(unsigned char), height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
     if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMemcpy2D failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(*device_data);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int width = 512;
    int height = 512;
    unsigned char* host_image_data = new unsigned char[width * height];
    for (int i = 0; i < width * height; ++i) {
        host_image_data[i] = (unsigned char)(i % 256); // Some dummy data
    }

    Image host_image;
    host_image.width = width;
    host_image.height = height;
    host_image.data = host_image_data;


    unsigned char* device_image_data = nullptr;
    if (copy_image_to_device_bad_pitch(host_image, &device_image_data)) {
        std::cout << "Image successfully transferred (but may be corrupt)." << std::endl;
    }
    else{
        std::cout << "Image Transfer failed" << std::endl;
    }

    cudaFree(device_image_data);
    delete[] host_image_data;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `pitch` is calculated as the width of a row in bytes, without accounting for padding. This will lead to errors due to potential out-of-bounds access. The error may not always be immediately obvious, especially for small arrays.

**Example 3: Type Mismatch**

This demonstrates how data type mismatches may cause errors.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

bool copy_type_mismatch(int* host_data, float** device_data, size_t size){
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void**)device_data, size * sizeof(float));
    if(err != cudaSuccess){
        std::cerr << "cudaMalloc failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return false;
    }

    err = cudaMemcpy(*device_data, host_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    if(err != cudaSuccess){
        std::cerr << "cudaMemcpy failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(*device_data);
        return false;
    }
    return true;

}

int main(){
    size_t size = 1024;
    int* host_data = new int[size];
    for(int i = 0; i<size; i++){
        host_data[i] = i;
    }

    float* device_data = nullptr;
    if(copy_type_mismatch(host_data, &device_data, size)){
         std::cout << "Data copied, but types do not match." << std::endl;
    }
    else{
       std::cout << "Data copy failed" << std::endl;
    }
   
    cudaFree(device_data);
    delete[] host_data;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the host data is an array of `int` while the device memory is allocated to hold `float`. Although `cudaMemcpy` is used (not `cudaMemcpy2D`), type mismatch is the issue and this is directly applicable to `cudaMemcpy2D` too. The call will complete without an error, but subsequent usage of the device data will result in corrupted data due to type incompatibility. This may result in a silent error that can be very difficult to track down.

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying the CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections on memory management and data transfer functions. Resources on CUDA best practices often contain detailed explanations about `pitch` and other parameters relevant to `cudaMemcpy2D`.  Additionally, examining code samples provided by NVIDIA can be invaluable. Furthermore, exploring the literature around the details of GPU memory architecture may be useful for truly understanding why alignment is important. Understanding the hardware architecture will allow users to write more efficient code.

In conclusion, `cudaMemcpy2D` errors with large arrays are seldom caused by the GPU hardware but rather the result of programming missteps, notably incorrect pitch values, insufficient allocated memory, or type mismatches. Thorough error checking and careful attention to detail in memory allocation and data transfer are crucial to prevent these issues.
