`output.data` in PyTorch, prior to version 1.7, represented the underlying tensor data held within a `torch.Tensor` object.  It provided a means to access and manipulate the raw numerical values stored within the tensor, separate from the tensor's metadata.  This distinction is crucial for understanding how PyTorch manages tensor operations and memory.  My experience working with PyTorch's internals during the development of a large-scale image classification model highlighted this separation's importance, particularly in optimizing memory usage and fine-tuning gradient computations.  Since PyTorch 1.7, accessing the underlying data directly through `.data` is deprecated and generally discouraged.  This response will detail its previous functionality and implications, alongside the recommended modern alternatives.

**1. Explanation of `output.data` (Pre-PyTorch 1.7)**

Before the deprecation, `output.data` acted as a pointer to the raw data buffer of a tensor.  The `torch.Tensor` object itself encapsulates both this data and various metadata, including:

* **Data type:**  Specifies the numeric type of the tensor elements (e.g., `torch.float32`, `torch.int64`).
* **Shape:** Defines the dimensions of the tensor.
* **Device:** Indicates where the tensor is stored (CPU or GPU).
* **Requires gradient:** A boolean flag determining if automatic differentiation should track gradients for this tensor.

Accessing `output.data` allowed for direct manipulation of the tensor's numerical values without modifying metadata such as the requires_grad flag. This was particularly useful in scenarios demanding low-level control over tensor operations or when optimization techniques required bypassing the automatic differentiation framework.

A critical consequence of using `.data` was the potential for unintended side effects. Modifying `output.data` directly could lead to inconsistencies if the tensor was used in subsequent computations that relied on the original metadata.  The automatic differentiation system might not accurately track changes made via `.data`, resulting in incorrect gradient calculations during backpropagation. Furthermore, directly manipulating `output.data` could potentially lead to memory leaks or data corruption if not handled with extreme care. This is because the memory management was not always handled through the standard PyTorch mechanisms.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Demonstrating the difference between modifying a tensor directly and via `.data` (Pre-PyTorch 1.7)**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
print(f"Original x: {x}")
print(f"x.requires_grad: {x.requires_grad}")

# Modifying directly
x[0] = 10.0
print(f"x after direct modification: {x}")
print(f"x.requires_grad: {x.requires_grad}")

# Modifying via .data (deprecated)
x.data[1] = 20.0
print(f"x after .data modification: {x}")
print(f"x.requires_grad: {x.requires_grad}")

y = x.sum()
y.backward()
print(f"x.grad: {x.grad}")

```

This illustrates that modifications via direct indexing update the gradients, while modifications via `.data` might not, depending on the surrounding PyTorch operations.  The gradients calculated would be potentially incorrect in the latter case. This behaviour highlights the need for caution while utilising `.data`.


**Example 2:  Illustrating a potential memory issue (Pre-PyTorch 1.7).**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
x.requires_grad = True
y = x.clone() # Creates a copy, essential for safety
z = x.data # Obtain a reference to the raw data.

# Perform a large operation:
#  Note:  This is an illustration, not a typical use case.
for i in range(100):
    z += torch.randn(1000, 1000)

# Incorrect handling.
# ... (Code that fails to release the memory occupied by z) ...

```

This example (a simplified, contrived scenario) shows how careless handling of `x.data` could lead to potential memory leaks in scenarios with extensive computations, especially with large tensors.


**Example 3: The recommended modern approach (PyTorch 1.7 and later)**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
print(f"Original x: {x}")

# Recommended method for in-place operations
x.copy_(torch.tensor([10.0, 20.0, 30.0])) # Overwrites the data
print(f"x after copy_: {x}")

# Recommended method for creating a modified tensor
y = torch.tensor([100.0, 200.0, 300.0])
x = torch.add(x,y)  # Element wise addition
print(f"x after addition: {x}")

z = x.sum()
z.backward()
print(f"x.grad: {x.grad}")
```

This example demonstrates the preferred methods for in-place modification and creating new tensors containing updated values.  The `.copy_()` method directly modifies the underlying tensor, ensuring that gradients are still correctly calculated.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation thoroughly.  Consult advanced tutorials focusing on automatic differentiation and memory management.  Pay close attention to the sections on tensor operations and best practices for optimizing code for performance and stability. Examining source code of well-established PyTorch projects can offer valuable insights into effective tensor manipulation techniques.  Finally, a comprehensive understanding of linear algebra principles underlying tensor operations is beneficial.
