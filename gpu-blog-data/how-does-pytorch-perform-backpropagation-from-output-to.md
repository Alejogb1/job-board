The core mechanism of backpropagation in PyTorch relies on the automatic differentiation capabilities built into its computational graph.  This isn't simply a recursive application of the chain rule; rather, it leverages a sophisticated system of computational nodes and gradient tracking to efficiently compute gradients across complex neural networks.  My experience working on large-scale NLP models has underscored the importance of understanding this process for optimization and debugging.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's autograd system tracks operations performed on tensors.  Each tensor with `requires_grad=True` is treated as a node in a computational graph. When operations are performed on these tensors, the autograd system automatically constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sequence of operations.  This DAG isn't explicitly stored as a separate data structure; instead, it's implicitly represented through a system of references between tensors and their associated operations.

The backward pass, or backpropagation, traverses this DAG in reverse topological order.  This ensures that gradients are computed only after all necessary dependencies have been evaluated.  For each operation, its gradient function (computed automatically based on the operation type) is applied. This function calculates the gradient of the output tensor with respect to its input tensors.  These individual gradients are then chained together according to the chain rule, ultimately yielding the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter in the network.

A crucial aspect is that PyTorch efficiently manages memory by using the concept of computational graphs.  Gradients are not computed for entire layers simultaneously. Instead, the gradient computation proceeds layer by layer, releasing the memory associated with intermediate activations once their contribution to the gradient calculation is complete. This is vital for managing the memory footprint, especially in deep networks with numerous layers and large tensors. This process minimizes redundant computations and avoids unnecessary memory allocation.

The final result of backpropagation is a set of gradients for each parameter (weight and bias) in the network.  These gradients are then used by the chosen optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) to update the network's parameters through gradient descent or a related optimization algorithm.  The accuracy of these gradient calculations directly impacts the network's ability to learn effectively.  Errors in the backpropagation process can manifest as slow convergence or unstable training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import torch

# Input features
x = torch.randn(10, 1, requires_grad=True)
# Weights and bias
w = torch.randn(1, 1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
# Target values
y = torch.randn(10, 1)

# Forward pass
y_pred = torch.matmul(x, w) + b
# Loss function (Mean Squared Error)
loss = torch.mean((y_pred - y)**2)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Print gradients
print("Gradient of w:", w.grad)
print("Gradient of b:", b.grad)
```

This example demonstrates the basic backpropagation process in a simple linear regression setting.  `requires_grad=True` enables gradient tracking for `x`, `w`, and `b`. `loss.backward()` triggers the automatic differentiation process, and the gradients are subsequently accessible via `.grad`.

**Example 2:  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the MLP
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(5, 1)
)

# Input data
x = torch.randn(100, 10)
y = torch.randn(100, 1)

# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = criterion(y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

This example showcases backpropagation within a more complex MLP architecture. The `torch.nn` module simplifies the definition of the network, and `torch.optim` provides convenient optimization routines. `optimizer.zero_grad()` resets gradients before each iteration, preventing gradient accumulation.

**Example 3: Custom Autograd Function**

```python
import torch

class MyFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        return x**2

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        return 2*x*grad_output

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = MyFunction.apply(x)
loss = y.mean()
loss.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

This example demonstrates advanced control over the backpropagation process by defining a custom autograd function.  This allows for implementing operations with custom gradient calculations, extending PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities.  `ctx.save_for_backward` ensures the necessary intermediate values are retained for the backward pass.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on autograd and neural network modules, provides a comprehensive understanding of the framework.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra and calculus is essential for comprehending the underlying mathematical principles.  Studying optimization algorithms such as gradient descent and its variants is also highly recommended.  Finally, reviewing resources on computational graphs and their applications in deep learning will provide additional context and depth.
