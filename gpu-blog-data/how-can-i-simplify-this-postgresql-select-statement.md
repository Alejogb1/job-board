The core inefficiency in many complex PostgreSQL `SELECT` statements stems from unnecessary subqueries and correlated joins.  My experience optimizing database queries for high-throughput financial applications has repeatedly shown that rewriting these using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and judicious indexing dramatically improves performance.  This approach enhances readability and allows the query planner to generate more efficient execution plans.

Let's analyze simplification strategies with specific examples.  A poorly structured query often involves retrieving data from multiple tables, potentially with nested loops or inefficient joins.  This leads to increased I/O operations and longer query execution times.  The optimal approach is to break down the query into smaller, more manageable components, leveraging CTEs to organize the logic and improve the overall structure.

**1.  Explanation: Deconstructing Complex Queries with CTEs**

Complex `SELECT` statements, frequently built iteratively over time, tend to accumulate redundant calculations and convoluted joins.  A systematic approach is required for simplification.  This involves:

* **Identifying Subqueries:** Pinpoint all subqueries within the main `SELECT` statement. Determine if these can be replaced with CTEs.  Frequently, a subquery performing a distinct selection or aggregation can be efficiently encapsulated within a CTE.

* **Rewriting Joins:** Examine the join conditions.  Inefficient `LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN` operations can often be streamlined with more specific joins or by pre-filtering data within CTEs.

* **Applying CTEs:** Create CTEs for each logically distinct data retrieval or processing step.  This allows for modularization, making the query easier to understand, maintain, and optimize. The query planner can then process each CTE independently, potentially finding more efficient execution paths.

* **Indexing:** After refactoring, ensure appropriate indexes exist on the columns used in `JOIN` conditions and `WHERE` clauses.  Proper indexing is critical for performance gains, especially in large datasets.

* **Aggregation and Filtering:**  Shift data filtering and aggregation steps into their respective CTEs.  This often results in smaller intermediate result sets, thus reducing the overall processing burden.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate these principles with three progressively complex scenarios.

**Example 1: Simplifying a Nested Subquery**

Consider a query retrieving order details, including customer information nested within multiple subqueries:

```sql
-- Inefficient Query
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    (SELECT c.customer_name FROM customers c WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id) as customer_name,
    (SELECT SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) FROM order_items oi WHERE oi.order_id = o.order_id) as total_amount
FROM orders o;
```

This can be dramatically improved using CTEs:

```sql
-- Efficient Query using CTEs
WITH
    CustomerDetails AS (
        SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers
    ),
    OrderTotals AS (
        SELECT order_id, SUM(quantity * price) as total_amount FROM order_items GROUP BY order_id
    )
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    cd.customer_name,
    ot.total_amount
FROM orders o
JOIN CustomerDetails cd ON o.customer_id = cd.customer_id
JOIN OrderTotals ot ON o.order_id = ot.order_id;
```

The CTEs `CustomerDetails` and `OrderTotals` pre-calculate the customer name and order total, respectively.  The main query then performs efficient joins, avoiding repeated subquery executions for each row in `orders`.


**Example 2: Optimizing Correlated Subqueries**

Correlated subqueries, where the inner query depends on the outer query's data, are notoriously inefficient. Consider this scenario:

```sql
-- Inefficient Query with Correlated Subquery
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.product_id = p.product_id) as order_count
FROM products p;
```

This repeatedly executes the inner query for every product.  A CTE-based approach offers a significant improvement:

```sql
-- Efficient Query using CTE
WITH
    ProductOrderCounts AS (
        SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) as order_count FROM orders GROUP BY product_id
    )
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    COALESCE(poc.order_count, 0) as order_count
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN ProductOrderCounts poc ON p.product_id = poc.product_id;
```

The `ProductOrderCounts` CTE aggregates order counts per product once, resulting in a far more efficient query.  The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even products with no orders are included in the result set, handling the case where `order_count` might be NULL.


**Example 3:  Simplifying Complex Joins and Filtering**

A query involving multiple joins and complex filtering conditions can be challenging to read and optimize:

```sql
-- Inefficient and Complex Query
SELECT
    i.invoice_id,
    c.customer_name,
    i.invoice_date
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN payments p ON i.invoice_id = p.invoice_id
WHERE i.invoice_date >= '2023-01-01' AND p.payment_status = 'paid'
AND c.country = 'USA';
```

This can be simplified and made more efficient by applying appropriate filtering in CTEs:

```sql
-- Efficient Query using CTEs and Filtering
WITH
    USCustomers AS (
        SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA'
    ),
    PaidInvoices AS (
        SELECT invoice_id FROM payments WHERE payment_status = 'paid'
    )
SELECT
    i.invoice_id,
    c.customer_name,
    i.invoice_date
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id AND c.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM USCustomers)
JOIN PaidInvoices pi ON i.invoice_id = pi.invoice_id
WHERE i.invoice_date >= '2023-01-01';
```

Here, `USCustomers` and `PaidInvoices` pre-filter the data, reducing the size of the join operations and making the main query more concise and efficient.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding of PostgreSQL query optimization, I recommend consulting the official PostgreSQL documentation, particularly the sections on query planning, indexing, and Common Table Expressions.  Additionally, a good book on SQL optimization and database design would be beneficial.  Finally, practical experience working with performance profiling tools will significantly aid your development of efficient database queries.
