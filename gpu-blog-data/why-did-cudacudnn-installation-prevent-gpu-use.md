A mismatch in CUDA driver and toolkit versions, particularly when compounded by an incompatible cuDNN library, is the most frequent reason an intended GPU workload fails to utilize the hardware, reverting to CPU execution. I've encountered this precise issue repeatedly across various systems, from personal workstations to cloud-based instances, often after seemingly routine updates or library installations. The interplay of these three components – driver, toolkit, and cuDNN – is critical, and inconsistencies can silently derail GPU computations.

The core problem arises because CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform, needs precise interfaces to function correctly. The CUDA driver, installed as part of the system’s graphics driver package, exposes the low-level API to the hardware. The CUDA toolkit contains the libraries and tools, including the compiler (nvcc), necessary to build CUDA applications. Finally, cuDNN, the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library, provides highly optimized primitives for deep learning workloads. Each of these components is versioned, and strict compatibility requirements exist. The toolkit must be compatible with the driver, and cuDNN needs to be specifically built for a particular CUDA toolkit version. Failure to meet these compatibility checks prevents applications from offloading computations to the GPU.

Often, the issue manifests without explicit error messages. Applications might run, but the processing will be on the CPU, dramatically increasing execution time. This is because CUDA APIs can still be called, but the runtime will detect that the appropriate driver and toolkit combination is not present, thereby ignoring the request to compute on the GPU and fallback to CPU computation. This fall-back mechanism can lead to user misdiagnosis, since the software appears to operate without generating an obvious error.

Let's examine some practical scenarios.

**Scenario 1: Driver-Toolkit Incompatibility**

Assume a system has NVIDIA driver version 525.x installed, while the CUDA toolkit installed is version 11.x. Version 11.x of the CUDA toolkit was not explicitly built and tested against driver version 525.x. This can manifest during application runtime, even if the application was compiled successfully. The application would be compiled, linked, and loaded into memory, but instead of processing on the GPU, it will fall back to CPU.

```cpp
// Example CUDA code (simplified)
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount = 0;
    cudaError_t error = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    if(deviceCount == 0){
        std::cout << "No CUDA-enabled devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
        
    std::cout << "Number of CUDA devices: " << deviceCount << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code example, a simple CUDA program attempts to query the number of available CUDA devices. With a driver/toolkit mismatch, a user might expect `deviceCount` to return a value greater than zero, but may, in fact, see the message “No CUDA-enabled devices found”, even with a capable GPU installed and properly drivered. This is because `cudaGetDeviceCount`, like all other CUDA calls, is dispatched to a driver component that is not compatible with the Toolkit. While it appears to run without error, it does not function correctly, causing a failure to detect the GPU.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect cuDNN Version**

Suppose the CUDA toolkit is correctly installed (e.g. version 11.8), but the cuDNN library being used is designed for a different toolkit version, for instance 11.2. The application, especially deep learning applications, may link without obvious errors, but at runtime, CUDA calls related to cuDNN will likely fail, or cause other silent errors within the application. Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, may fail during initialization, or they may execute without GPU acceleration.

```python
# Example with PyTorch (simplified)
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA is available! Using GPU.")
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    # Perform some computations on GPU
    a = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    b = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    c = torch.matmul(a,b)
    print("Resulting Tensor on GPU:", c)
else:
    print("CUDA is NOT available. Using CPU.")
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    a = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    b = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    c = torch.matmul(a,b)
    print("Resulting Tensor on CPU:", c)

```
In this example, a PyTorch script checks if CUDA is available and performs matrix multiplication on either the GPU or CPU. With a cuDNN version mismatch, the output would likely show "CUDA is NOT available. Using CPU.", even if the correct driver and toolkit were installed. This is because the high level PyTorch library is making calls into cuDNN to achieve fast calculations using the GPU, but if the underlying cuDNN library is incompatible, the initialization of the GPU will fail and the application will fallback to using the CPU.

**Scenario 3: Environment Variable Configuration**

Even with compatible driver, toolkit, and cuDNN versions installed, if the environment variables required for the CUDA toolkit are not correctly set or are pointing to incorrect locations, the system might fail to detect the GPU. This commonly happens when users have multiple CUDA installations, and the environment variables are incorrectly pointing to an old installation, or not at all. These variables such as `CUDA_HOME`, `PATH`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, specify the paths to the CUDA installation and its libraries. If these variables are misconfigured, the applications will be unable to locate the CUDA components, and the system will revert to CPU calculations.

```bash
#Example of setting CUDA environment variables for a shell (bash). These variables need to be set
# appropriately for the specific CUDA installation.
#Note: These are just example paths.
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8
export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
In a system where the actual CUDA installation is located at `/usr/local/cuda-12.2`, but the environment variables are set as above to point to `/usr/local/cuda-11.8`, any CUDA programs will not be able to properly use the GPU. While the installation may appear functional, the program will not be using the correct toolkit version. A key to troubleshooting involves verifying these environment variables.

Troubleshooting these problems, therefore, requires systematic checking. First, confirm the installed NVIDIA driver version using system tools or the `nvidia-smi` command. Then, determine the CUDA toolkit version installed using the `nvcc --version` command. The next step would be verifying the cuDNN version associated with the CUDA toolkit installation. In Linux, one can locate the cuDNN library (`libcudnn.so.*`) in the lib directory of the CUDA toolkit install path and then examine its filename to understand the compatible toolkit version. With multiple toolkits present, this requires careful diligence.

To resolve compatibility issues, I typically follow these steps: I start by downloading compatible driver and toolkit versions from NVIDIA's developer website and perform a clean installation (uninstalling old ones), followed by downloading and installing the correct cuDNN library specific for the CUDA toolkit I chose. I also verify the environment variables are set correctly. A key step is to test using the provided CUDA samples from the toolkit, which includes a device query tool which can quickly verify the availability of the GPU and the correctness of the installation. A second validation is to run one of the simpler CUDA programs shown above.

For further guidance, NVIDIA's documentation provides detailed compatibility matrices outlining the required combinations. The CUDA toolkit documentation covers the specific installation instructions for each supported platform. For cuDNN, I always refer to NVIDIA’s cuDNN release notes. Finally, forums and knowledge bases dedicated to CUDA development can be beneficial, particularly when facing unusual behavior.

I've found that taking the time to understand and carefully check the version compatibility among these three core components is essential to prevent GPU underutilization and is crucial for successful CUDA application execution.
