The fundamental mechanism governing the generation of 16 output features from 6 input features in a convolutional layer lies in the application of multiple distinct filters.  Each filter, a learned weight matrix, acts as a feature detector, extracting specific patterns from the input.  The number of filters directly determines the number of output feature maps, hence the 16 output features result from employing 16 distinct filters. This is distinct from a fully connected layer, where the mapping is performed by a weight matrix relating all inputs to all outputs; in convolutions, the spatial relationships are preserved.  My experience designing and optimizing CNN architectures for image recognition tasks heavily relies on this principle, particularly when dealing with limited input data and the need to efficiently extract high-level features.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The convolutional layer is the core building block of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Its operation can be dissected into several steps.  Firstly, each of the 16 filters is applied to the 6 input feature maps through a process called convolution.  This involves sliding the filter across the input feature map, performing element-wise multiplication between the filter's weights and the corresponding input values, and summing the results.  This single operation produces a single value at a specific location in the output feature map.  This process is repeated for every possible location within the input feature map, resulting in a new feature map of the same spatial dimensions (minus potential border effects determined by the filter size and padding strategy).  This is done for every input feature map and every filter.

Secondly, the results from the convolutions are then summed across the input features.   The filter, while applied individually to each input feature map, produces intermediate results.  These results are aggregated across the input features. This aggregation step is implicit in most CNN frameworks and is crucial for enabling the convolutional layer to capture interactions across multiple input channels.  Consequently, one filter generates one output feature map. Since we have 16 filters, we obtain 16 output feature maps, representing 16 distinct extracted features.

Finally, a bias term is often added to each output feature map, further enriching the learned representation. This bias is a single scalar value, specific to each filter and added to every element within the corresponding output feature map.  This biases the activation function applied next, leading to improved model performance in many cases. The choice of activation function is significant; ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a common choice, introducing non-linearity to the model and permitting representation of complex relationships between input and output features.  The entire process is thus described as: Convolution -> Summation Across Inputs -> Bias Addition -> Activation Function.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples use a simplified representation to illustrate the core principles.  Real-world implementations typically leverage optimized libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

**Example 1:  Illustrative Python code (without libraries):**

```python
# Input features (simplified representation - 6 channels, 3x3 spatial dimension)
input_features = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
                 [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]],
                 [[19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27]],
                 [[28, 29, 30], [31, 32, 33], [34, 35, 36]],
                 [[37, 38, 39], [40, 41, 42], [43, 44, 45]],
                 [[46, 47, 48], [49, 50, 51], [52, 53, 54]]]

# One filter (3x3 kernel)
filter_1 = [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]]

# Convolution operation for one filter and one input feature map
output_feature_map_part = 0
for i in range(len(input_features[0]) - 2):
    for j in range(len(input_features[0][0]) - 2):
        for k in range(len(input_features)):
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i][j]*filter_1[0][0]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i][j+1]*filter_1[0][1]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i][j+2]*filter_1[0][2]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i+1][j]*filter_1[1][0]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i+1][j+1]*filter_1[1][1]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i+1][j+2]*filter_1[1][2]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i+2][j]*filter_1[2][0]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i+2][j+1]*filter_1[2][1]
            output_feature_map_part += input_features[k][i+2][j+2]*filter_1[2][2]

print(output_feature_map_part)

```

This code snippet demonstrates a single convolution operation.  Extending this to 16 filters and handling the full process necessitates more complex iteration and aggregation.  Note this example omits crucial components like bias and activation functions.


**Example 2: Conceptual illustration using matrix notation (for a simplified case):**

Imagine a simplified scenario with 2 input features (maps) and 2 output features, each 2x2.  We could represent this conceptually (without specifying exact operation details):


```
Input Features (2x2x2):  [[[1,2],[3,4]], [[5,6],[7,8]]]

Filter 1 (2x2): [[a,b],[c,d]]
Filter 2 (2x2): [[e,f],[g,h]]

Output Features (2x2x2):  [[[Output1_1,1_2],[1_3,1_4]], [[2_1,2_2],[2_3,2_4]]]
```


The output values (`Output1_1`, `Output1_2` etc.) are computed by the convolution of the filters with the input features and summation across input features as described above.

**Example 3:  High-level conceptualization using TensorFlow/PyTorch (pseudo-code):**

```python
# TensorFlow/PyTorch pseudo-code

import tensorflow as tf # Or PyTorch

# Input tensor: shape (batch_size, height, width, 6)  - 6 input features
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 6))

# Convolutional layer: 16 filters, 3x3 kernel size
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')

# Output tensor: shape (batch_size, height', width', 16) - 16 output features
output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)

print(output_tensor.shape) # Output tensor shape will show 16 output features
```

This pseudo-code demonstrates the high-level usage of convolutional layers in established deep learning frameworks.  The actual computation is handled internally by highly optimized routines. The `filters` parameter in `Conv2D` directly specifies the number of output feature maps.
