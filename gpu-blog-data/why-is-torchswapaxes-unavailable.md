The unavailability of `torch.swapaxes` is a consequence of PyTorch's evolving API design, specifically its shift towards a more intuitive and consistent approach to tensor manipulation.  My experience debugging large-scale deep learning models, particularly those involving complex data transformations within custom data loaders, highlighted this transition.  While `torch.swapaxes` existed in older PyTorch versions, its functionality is now effectively subsumed by the more versatile and broadly applicable `torch.transpose` and advanced indexing techniques. This simplification streamlines the API, reduces ambiguity, and improves code readability, ultimately benefiting developers in the long run.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core functionality of `torch.swapaxes`, swapping the contents of two specified axes within a tensor, can be achieved reliably using `torch.transpose`. The key difference lies in how the axes are specified. `torch.swapaxes` used integer indices directly corresponding to the tensor's dimensions (e.g., `torch.swapaxes(tensor, 0, 1)`), whereas `torch.transpose` takes the *dimension numbers* as arguments.  This distinction, while seemingly minor, contributes to the overall API coherence.  `torch.transpose` consistently aligns with other PyTorch functions that operate on dimensions, improving predictability and reducing the cognitive load on developers.  Furthermore, advanced indexing offers another powerful and often more efficient method for achieving the same result, particularly when dealing with higher-dimensional tensors or more complex axis permutations.

The removal of `torch.swapaxes` was a deliberate design choice aimed at simplifying the API and improving consistency. While it might initially present a challenge for developers accustomed to the older function, the transition to `torch.transpose` and advanced indexing ultimately leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Direct Replacement with `torch.transpose`**

```python
import torch

# Original code using swapaxes (would generate an error in current PyTorch)
# swapped_tensor = torch.swapaxes(tensor, 0, 1)

# Equivalent using transpose
tensor = torch.randn(3, 4)
swapped_tensor = torch.transpose(tensor, 0, 1)  # Swaps dimensions 0 and 1

print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"Swapped tensor:\n{swapped_tensor}")
```

This demonstrates a direct functional replacement.  The `torch.transpose(tensor, dim0, dim1)` function effectively swaps the dimensions specified by `dim0` and `dim1`. Note the consistency in using dimension numbers, not raw indices. During my work on a time-series forecasting project, migrating from `torch.swapaxes` to `torch.transpose` drastically simplified the code responsible for handling batch and time steps.

**Example 2:  Advanced Indexing for More Complex Scenarios**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)

# Swap dimensions 1 and 3 using advanced indexing.  This is more flexible for complex scenarios
swapped_tensor = tensor.permute(0, 3, 2, 1)  #Permute reorders dimensions

print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Swapped tensor shape: {swapped_tensor.shape}")
```

This example showcases advanced indexing with `permute`.  `permute` allows for arbitrary reordering of dimensions. This is particularly useful when dealing with tensors of higher dimensionality where simply swapping two axes may not be sufficient.  I encountered this in my work on a 3D convolutional neural network, where `permute` provided a much more elegant solution than multiple nested calls to `torch.transpose`.

**Example 3:  Handling Multi-Dimensional Swaps with `permute`**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)

#Swap dimensions 1 and 3, leaving the rest unchanged, more complex swap
swapped_tensor = tensor.permute(0, 3, 2, 1)

print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Swapped tensor shape: {swapped_tensor.shape}")

#Demonstrates that transpose only handles two dimensions at a time
# try:
#     transposed_tensor = torch.transpose(tensor, 1,3) # this will raise an error. Transpose only swaps two dims
# except RuntimeError as e:
#     print(f"Error: {e}")

```

This code further emphasizes the flexibility of `permute` for handling multi-dimensional swaps.  The commented-out section highlights the limitation of `torch.transpose` in handling more complex permutations involving more than two dimensions in one call. This exemplifies a scenario where `torch.swapaxes` would have been cumbersome, requiring multiple calls to achieve the desired result, while `permute` provides a concise solution. During the development of a multimodal learning system, I found `permute` invaluable for efficiently manipulating tensors combining image and text data.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding tensor manipulation functions.  Familiarize yourself with the sections detailing tensor reshaping and advanced indexing. Consulting advanced PyTorch tutorials and exploring example projects focusing on complex data transformations would further solidify your understanding.  Finally, a well-structured deep learning textbook covering PyTorch can provide a comprehensive foundation for tensor manipulation within a broader machine learning context.  Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of tensor operations is crucial for effectively utilizing PyTorch's functionalities.  Focus on grasping the concepts of matrix and tensor algebra.
