The error, a `ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (64, 100) for Tensor 'dense_1_input:0', which has shape '(?, 784)'`,  typically arises from a mismatch between the input data shape and the expected input shape of the first dense layer in a Keras sequential model.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on image recognition projects, often stemming from a failure to pre-process the input data correctly.  The error message explicitly states that the model expects a 784-dimensional input vector (likely flattened 28x28 images), but it's receiving a (64, 100) shaped tensor. This indicates that either the input data is incorrectly formatted or the model's input layer is defined improperly.

**1. Explanation:**

The root cause is a discrepancy between the dimensions of the input data fed to the Keras model and the dimensions the model is designed to handle.  The `(?, 784)` shape represents a batch of unspecified size (`?`) where each sample is a 784-dimensional vector.  The `(64, 100)` shape represents a batch of 64 samples, each with 100 features.  This incompatibility triggers the `ValueError`.  This often arises from one of three primary sources:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:**  The input data might not be preprocessed to match the model's expectations.  For image data, this frequently involves flattening the image arrays (converting a 28x28 image into a 784-element vector) or reshaping the data to a consistent format.  Failure to perform this step leads to the shape mismatch.

* **Incorrect Model Definition:** The input layer of the Keras model might be incorrectly defined, specifying an incorrect input shape.  The `input_shape` argument in the first layer should explicitly reflect the expected input dimensionality.

* **Data Loading Issues:** Errors in the data loading process, such as inadvertently loading only a subset of the features or applying unintended transformations during loading, can result in the input data having an unexpected shape.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

This example demonstrates the correct way to handle MNIST-like data, assuming 28x28 grayscale images.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Assume 'x_train' is your training data (e.g., MNIST images)
# and 'y_train' is the corresponding labels.  'x_train' should be a NumPy array.

model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Correct input shape for 28x28 grayscale images
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Assuming 10 classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** The `Flatten` layer is crucial here. It converts the 28x28x1 (height, width, channels) image into a 784-dimensional vector, aligning the input with the subsequent `Dense` layer.  The `input_shape` parameter explicitly sets the expected input size.  Failure to include or misconfigure this will lead to the `ValueError`.


**Example 2:  Error Caused by Incorrect Input Shape**

This demonstrates a scenario where the input shape isn't explicitly defined, leading to the error.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Incorrect input shape definition, will throw ValueError
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu'), # Missing input_shape
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# x_train is still a (60000, 28, 28, 1) array.
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) # This will fail
```

**Commentary:** This code fails because the first `Dense` layer lacks an `input_shape` argument.  Keras cannot infer the correct input shape without this specification, resulting in the `ValueError` when it attempts to process the data.


**Example 3: Error from Incorrect Data Preprocessing**

This example illustrates an error where the data is not flattened, leading to the shape mismatch.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# x_train_incorrect shape is (60000, 28, 28, 1) instead of flattened
model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train_incorrect, y_train, epochs=10) # This will likely fail.
```

**Commentary:** Even with the `Flatten` layer, this code might fail if `x_train_incorrect` has not been correctly reshaped to (60000, 784).  If `x_train_incorrect` retains its original 4D shape, the `Flatten` layer will still produce an incorrect output shape, potentially triggering the error or another related shape mismatch downstream. The data needs to be pre-processed properly; this example showcases a potential error within the data-handling pipeline rather than the model's definition.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras model building and data preprocessing, I would recommend consulting the official Keras documentation.  The TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on data handling and model construction, will be extremely beneficial.  Furthermore, exploring introductory machine learning texts focusing on neural networks and deep learning will provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Lastly, working through numerous tutorials and practical examples on popular datasets like MNIST will provide invaluable hands-on experience in debugging these types of issues.  Thorough review of error messages, along with careful attention to data shapes and model architecture, is critical for successful implementation.
