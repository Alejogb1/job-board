Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Keras, particularly those constructed using the `keras.layers.SimpleRNN`, `keras.layers.LSTM`, or `keras.layers.GRU` layers, fundamentally handle input data by iterating through sequences, maintaining an internal state that is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous state. This sequential processing distinguishes them from feedforward networks, allowing them to model temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data.

The core mechanism involves passing each element of an input sequence, one at a time, through the recurrent layer. At each step, the layer combines the current input with the hidden state from the previous time step. This combined information is then transformed through a non-linear activation function, producing both an output and an updated hidden state. This updated hidden state is then passed forward to the next time step, carrying accumulated information about the preceding sequence. Consequently, the model’s output at each step is not only a function of the current input, but also of all prior inputs, albeit with diminishing influence depending on the network’s architecture and learned weights.

The input data for an RNN layer in Keras is expected to be a 3D tensor with the shape `(batch_size, timesteps, features)`. The `batch_size` represents the number of independent sequences processed in parallel. The `timesteps` represent the length of each sequence, or the number of elements in the sequence. The `features` represent the dimensionality of each individual element of the sequence. For example, in the case of natural language processing, these features might be word embeddings or one-hot encoded tokens; for time series, they might be sensor readings or price points.

Internally, during the forward pass, the RNN performs the following computation for each time step `t`, where `x_t` is the input vector at time `t`, and `h_(t-1)` is the hidden state from the previous step, and `h_t` is the current hidden state:

1. **Input Transformation:** The input vector `x_t` is transformed through a weight matrix, `W_x`.
2. **Hidden State Transformation:** The previous hidden state `h_(t-1)` is transformed through another weight matrix, `W_h`.
3. **Combination:** The transformed input and hidden state are combined, typically using a simple addition.
4. **Activation:** The combined result is passed through an activation function (e.g., `tanh`, `relu`, `sigmoid`) which introduces non-linearity, producing the new hidden state `h_t`. This operation can be expressed as: `h_t = activation(W_x * x_t + W_h * h_(t-1) + b)` where `b` is the bias vector.
5. **Output Calculation:** The new hidden state `h_t` is then used to calculate the output at time step `t`. This output can be simply `h_t` itself, or it may be transformed using another weight matrix, `W_o` and a bias vector `b_o`. Thus, the output at time t, `y_t`, can be calculated as: `y_t = W_o * h_t + b_o`.  The weights, `W_x`, `W_h`, `W_o`, and biases, `b` and `b_o`, are learnable parameters of the network.

The choice of recurrent unit (SimpleRNN, LSTM, GRU) primarily influences how the hidden state is updated and how long-term dependencies are captured. SimpleRNNs, for instance, have a basic structure prone to vanishing and exploding gradient issues, making them less effective for longer sequences. LSTMs and GRUs introduce gating mechanisms that regulate information flow and allow for more robust learning of long-term dependencies, although they also have more parameters and computational overhead.

Here are three code examples demonstrating the use of RNN layers in Keras, illustrating input shapes and basic configurations:

**Example 1: SimpleRNN for sequence classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example input data (batch_size=3, timesteps=10, features=5)
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(3, 10, 5))

# Define a SimpleRNN layer with 32 hidden units, returning only the final output.
rnn_layer = layers.SimpleRNN(32, return_sequences=False)

# Connect the input data to the RNN
output = rnn_layer(input_data)

# Output shape will be (batch_size, hidden_units), here (3, 32)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)

# Add a dense layer for binary classification
classifier = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(output)

# Resulting classifier shape will be (3, 1)
print("Classifier output shape", classifier.shape)
```

In this example, a `SimpleRNN` layer is configured to return only the output corresponding to the final time step by setting `return_sequences=False`. This is typically useful for sequence classification tasks, where the entire sequence is used to make a prediction. The output of the RNN is then fed to a `Dense` layer for classification. The input is a 3D tensor with `(3, 10, 5)` shape, while the RNN outputs a tensor with `(3, 32)` and the `Dense` classifier generates the binary classification output with shape `(3, 1)`.

**Example 2: LSTM for sequence prediction (many-to-many)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example input data (batch_size=2, timesteps=20, features=10)
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 20, 10))

# Define an LSTM layer with 64 hidden units, returning the output for each time step.
lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)

# Pass input data to the LSTM
output = lstm_layer(input_data)

# Output shape will be (batch_size, timesteps, hidden_units), here (2, 20, 64)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)

# A dense layer that will output features for each time step
dense_output = layers.Dense(10)(output)

# Resulting output shape will be (2, 20, 10)
print("Dense output shape", dense_output.shape)
```

This example demonstrates how to use an `LSTM` layer to produce a sequence of outputs, one for each time step in the input sequence. The `return_sequences=True` argument ensures that the output tensor retains the temporal dimension. The output tensor shape will be `(2, 20, 64)` and is then passed through a dense layer to output a shape `(2, 20, 10)`, which indicates one prediction for every time step in the original sequence. This is typical for tasks like machine translation or video analysis.

**Example 3: GRU for time-series forecasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example input data (batch_size=4, timesteps=30, features=1)
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(4, 30, 1))

# Define a GRU layer with 48 hidden units, returning only the final output.
gru_layer = layers.GRU(48, return_sequences=False)

# Connect the input data to the GRU
output = gru_layer(input_data)

# Output shape will be (batch_size, hidden_units), here (4, 48)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)

# Add a dense layer to output a single value
forecast = layers.Dense(1)(output)

# Resulting output will have shape (4, 1)
print("Forecast shape:", forecast.shape)
```

Here, a `GRU` layer is used for a time-series forecasting task, where only a single future value is predicted given the input sequence. The `return_sequences=False` parameter is used again, so that only the last time step output is returned, before passing to a `Dense` layer for the forecast. The input data is a single-feature time series with 30 time steps.

For further understanding and detailed information on specific concepts within RNNs, I recommend consulting academic sources such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, and research papers on recurrent neural networks from conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML. Additionally, the Keras documentation itself provides comprehensive examples and explanations for each layer, specifically the sections covering `keras.layers.SimpleRNN`, `keras.layers.LSTM`, and `keras.layers.GRU`. I also recommend studying practical tutorials that demonstrate the usage of these layers for various applications.
