TensorFlow's `GradientTape`'s functionality is intrinsically tied to its context manager (`with` statement).  Attempting to utilize its core methods – `gradient()`, `jacobian()`, etc. – outside this context will result in a `RuntimeError`. This is a fundamental design choice stemming from the need to meticulously track operations for automatic differentiation.  My experience debugging complex neural networks has consistently highlighted this limitation.  The `with` block defines the scope within which the tape records operations, making the subsequent gradient computation possible.  Operations performed outside this explicitly defined scope are simply not tracked.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `GradientTape` acts as a recorder, meticulously logging every operation performed on tensors within its context. This recording is crucial for calculating gradients using techniques like backpropagation.  The `with` statement serves as the explicit boundary of this recording process.  When the `with` block is exited, the tape is finalized, and its contents are prepared for gradient calculations.  Attempting to access gradient information before the tape is finalized (i.e., outside the `with` block) is akin to asking for a transcript before the recording is complete—it's not possible.

The internal workings rely on a graph structure.  During the `with` block execution, the `GradientTape` builds this graph, representing the computational flow of operations. The `gradient()` method then uses this graph to perform reverse-mode automatic differentiation, effectively tracing back through the operations to compute the gradients.  Without the `with` statement, no such graph is constructed, leading to the `RuntimeError`.  Furthermore, the tape manages resources; exiting the `with` block triggers necessary cleanup and resource release, preventing memory leaks. Forcing gradient calculation outside this managed scope would lead to unpredictable behavior and potential program crashes.

The design is deliberately restrictive to ensure accuracy and efficiency. The `with` statement provides a clear, well-defined interface for gradient calculation, preventing subtle errors that could arise from trying to manipulate the tape's internal state directly.  This structured approach is vital for the reliability and predictability of gradient-based optimization algorithms.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage within `with` statement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x**2
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)  # Correct: dy_dx will be 6.0
print(dy_dx)
```

This demonstrates the correct usage.  The `GradientTape` is properly initialized within the `with` statement.  The subsequent call to `tape.gradient()` retrieves the gradient `dy_dx` without errors.  The tape automatically tracks the operation `y = x**2`, allowing for the successful calculation of the derivative.


**Example 2: Incorrect Usage Outside `with` statement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x**2

dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)  # This will raise a RuntimeError if uncommented.
# This line will fail because the tape is already closed.
# RuntimeError: GradientTape.gradient can only be called once on non-persistent tapes.
```

This example highlights the error.  While the tape records the operation inside the `with` block, attempting to access `tape.gradient()` after exiting the block will raise a `RuntimeError`. This is because the tape's internal state is finalized upon exiting the `with` statement, preventing further access to its recorded operations.  The tape's resources are released, rendering subsequent gradient calculations impossible.


**Example 3: Persistent Tape (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
tape = tf.GradientTape(persistent=True)
with tape:
    y = x**2
dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x) # Correct: dy_dx will be 6.0
print(dy_dx)
del tape # Manually delete the tape to release resources
```

While not directly addressing the initial question about circumventing the `with` statement, this demonstrates the use of a `persistent=True` tape. A persistent tape allows multiple calls to `gradient()`, but requires manual deletion using `del tape` to release resources.  Even with a persistent tape,  the initial recording of the computation must still happen *within* the `with` block, the core limitation remains.  Misunderstanding the use of persistent tapes is a common pitfall leading to memory issues in larger projects.  Note this is for illustrative purposes only, and it does not demonstrate a way to call `tape.gradient()` outside of the `with` block.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.GradientTape`.  A thorough understanding of automatic differentiation and computational graphs is crucial.  Further, exploring resources on the fundamentals of backpropagation and its implementation within deep learning frameworks will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of `GradientTape`.  Finally,  practical experience debugging TensorFlow code, including resolving errors related to gradient calculation, is invaluable.  Working through examples and progressively increasing complexity will solidify your understanding.  Consider exploring advanced topics like higher-order gradients and custom gradients once you’ve mastered the basics.
