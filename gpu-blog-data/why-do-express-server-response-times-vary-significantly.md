Express.js server response time variability stems primarily from I/O-bound operations and the inherent non-deterministic nature of asynchronous programming.  My experience building high-throughput microservices highlighted this repeatedly.  While synchronous code offers predictable execution flow,  asynchronous operations, crucial for scalability, introduce complexities that manifest in inconsistent response times and out-of-order results if not managed carefully.

**1.  Understanding the Sources of Variability:**

Express.js, while inherently efficient for handling requests, relies heavily on Node.js's event loop. This single-threaded architecture means all operations, including network requests, database queries, and file system access, ultimately contend for the same thread.  When a request initiates an I/O-bound operation (an operation that waits for an external resource), the event loop doesn't block but instead registers a callback function.  The request handler continues processing other requests.  The variability stems from the unpredictable nature of these external resources.  A slow database query, a network timeout, or even contention on a shared resource like a file system can significantly extend the time before the callback is executed and the response is sent.  Furthermore, the scheduling of these callbacks by the event loop is non-deterministic, meaning the order of execution may not correspond to the order of invocation.

**2. Async/Await and Out-of-Order Results:**

`async/await` is syntactic sugar over Promises, simplifying asynchronous code readability. However, it doesn't inherently solve the problem of unpredictable I/O operation durations or guarantee ordered execution. While it makes asynchronous code appear more synchronous, the underlying asynchronous nature remains. If multiple `async/await` calls rely on independent I/O operations with varying completion times, the results will be returned in the order of completion rather than the order of invocation.  This often leads to seemingly out-of-order results.  Consider the case of fetching data from multiple APIs: an API with a faster response time might complete later than a slower one due to network conditions, leading to the data being processed and returned in an unexpected sequence.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these concepts with three examples.

**Example 1: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Database Queries:**

```javascript
// Synchronous (blocking) - Predictable, but not scalable
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const db = require('./db'); // Fictional database module

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  const data = db.syncQuery('SELECT * FROM users'); // Blocking call
  res.json(data);
});

//Asynchronous (non-blocking) - Scalable, but order can be unpredictable if multiple calls are made concurrently.
app.get('/asyncData', async (req, res) => {
    try{
        const data = await db.asyncQuery('SELECT * FROM users');
        res.json(data);
    } catch(err){
        console.error("Database error", err)
        res.status(500).send("Database error");
    }

});

```

This example contrasts a synchronous database query (blocking the event loop) with an asynchronous one (non-blocking). The synchronous version is simple but will lead to poor performance under load. The asynchronous version is more efficient but if multiple requests hit this endpoint concurrently, the order of responses might not reflect the order of requests.

**Example 2:  Illustrating Out-of-Order Async Operations:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const axios = require('axios'); // Fictional API call library

app.get('/api-data', async (req, res) => {
  const [data1, data2] = await Promise.all([
    axios.get('/api/slow'), // Simulates a slow API
    axios.get('/api/fast'), // Simulates a fast API
  ]);
  res.json({ data1, data2 }); // Order might be unexpected
});
```

Here, `Promise.all` executes two API calls concurrently.  While `Promise.all` resolves when *all* promises resolve, the order in which the individual promises resolve and their results are available is not guaranteed.  `data1` might contain the result from `/api/fast` even if `/api/slow` was called first.

**Example 3:  Implementing Ordered Execution with Async/Await:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const axios = require('axios');

app.get('/ordered-api-data', async (req, res) => {
  const data1 = await axios.get('/api/slow');
  const data2 = await axios.get('/api/fast');
  res.json({ data1, data2 }); // Guaranteed order, but less efficient.
});
```

This example demonstrates how to enforce a specific order.  However, this approach sacrifices concurrency, making it less efficient than the parallel approach in Example 2.  The key takeaway is that enforcing order comes at the cost of performance, highlighting the trade-off inherent in asynchronous programming.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

To further investigate these issues, I recommend consulting the official Node.js documentation, focusing on the event loop mechanics and asynchronous programming paradigms.  Additionally,  exploring advanced concepts like worker threads in Node.js for CPU-bound tasks and message queues for managing asynchronous communication across multiple services will provide a more comprehensive understanding of optimizing server response times in high-load environments.  Finally, a thorough grasp of profiling tools and techniques is essential for diagnosing performance bottlenecks in your Express.js applications.  These tools can pinpoint the specific operations responsible for slow response times, providing crucial insights for optimization.
