The fundamental impact of a convolutional filter on a color image tensor stems from its inherent spatial locality and the application of element-wise multiplication across the filter's receptive field.  This process, repeated across the entire image, leads to a systematic transformation of the tensor's dimensions, dependent on the filter's size, stride, and padding.  My experience optimizing image processing pipelines for high-resolution satellite imagery has underscored the critical importance of understanding this interplay.

**1.  Explanation:**

A color image is typically represented as a three-dimensional tensor. The dimensions represent height, width, and color channels (usually Red, Green, Blue â€“ RGB).  For instance, a 256x256 pixel image in RGB format has a tensor shape of (256, 256, 3).  A convolutional filter, also a tensor, slides across this input tensor, performing element-wise multiplication between its values and the corresponding receptive field in the input.  The results of these multiplications are then summed to produce a single value in the output tensor.  The crucial parameters governing this operation are:

* **Filter Size:** This defines the spatial extent of the receptive field. A 3x3 filter examines a 3x3 region of the input. Larger filters capture more context but require more computation.

* **Stride:** This parameter determines how many pixels the filter moves in each step across the input. A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time, resulting in an output with overlapping receptive fields.  A larger stride (e.g., 2) leads to a smaller output tensor.

* **Padding:** Padding involves adding extra pixels (usually zeros) around the border of the input image. This prevents the output tensor from shrinking excessively, particularly with larger filters and strides.  Common padding strategies include "same" padding (output height and width are the same as the input) and "valid" padding (no padding, resulting in a smaller output).

The output tensor's shape is directly affected by these parameters.  Let's denote the input tensor shape as (H_in, W_in, C_in), the filter size as (F_h, F_w), the stride as (S_h, S_w), and the padding as (P_h, P_w).  Then, the output tensor shape (H_out, W_out, C_out) can be calculated as:

* **H_out = floor((H_in + 2P_h - F_h) / S_h) + 1**
* **W_out = floor((W_in + 2P_w - F_w) / S_w) + 1**
* **C_out = Number of filters** (this is often different than C_in; a single filter produces one channel)


Note that the floor function is used because the output dimensions must be integers. The number of output channels, C_out, is determined by the number of convolutional filters applied.  Each filter learns a different feature representation, generating an independent output channel.  Therefore, using multiple filters results in a deeper output tensor.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the effect of filter size, stride, and padding using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

**Example 1:  Basic Convolution with 3x3 filter and stride 1**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (grayscale image for simplicity)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1)) # Batch size 1, 28x28 image, 1 channel

# 3x3 filter, stride 1, no padding
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='valid', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
])

output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 26, 26, 1) - note the reduction in size.
```

This example shows a simple convolution with a 3x3 filter.  The output is smaller than the input due to the "valid" padding (no padding).


**Example 2:  Convolution with padding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) # 28x28 RGB image

# 3x3 filter, stride 1, same padding
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', input_shape=(28, 28, 3))
])

output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 28, 28, 16) - output maintains input spatial dimensions
```

Here, "same" padding ensures the output spatial dimensions match the input.  Notice the increase in the number of channels to 16 due to 16 filters being used.

**Example 3:  Convolution with stride > 1**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) # 28x28 RGB image

# 3x3 filter, stride 2, no padding
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=8, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2), padding='valid', input_shape=(28, 28, 3))
])

output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 13, 13, 8) - significant size reduction due to stride 2.
```

This example demonstrates the effect of stride.  A stride of 2 significantly reduces the output size.  Combining larger strides with smaller filters is a common technique for downsampling images within a convolutional neural network.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper dive into the mathematics behind convolutions, I recommend consulting standard digital image processing textbooks.  Furthermore, exploring the documentation for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch will provide practical insights and examples.  Finally, reviewing academic papers on convolutional neural networks will offer advanced perspectives on various architectural designs and their impact on tensor shapes.  Understanding the concept of feature maps, as generated by convolutional layers, is crucial in grasping how the shape of the tensor evolves.  Pay particular attention to how pooling layers further influence this shape.
