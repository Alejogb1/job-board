The assertion that softmax activation in binary classification always outputs a vector summing to 1 is correct, but the implication that each element will be 1 is incorrect.  In binary classification, softmax doesn't *always* output [1, 0] or [0, 1]. Instead, it outputs a probability distribution over two classes, ensuring the probabilities sum to one, reflecting the inherent exclusivity of binary classification. The apparent paradox arises from a misunderstanding of softmax's function within the context of binary classification and the potential for numerical instability in specific implementations.

My experience working on high-throughput anomaly detection systems exposed this subtle issue frequently.  Initially, we used a naive implementation of softmax, leading to occasional unexpected results. This prompted a thorough investigation into the underlying mathematics and numerical considerations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Softmax, given a vector of arbitrary real numbers  `z = [z1, z2, ..., zn]`, transforms it into a probability distribution `p = [p1, p2, ..., pn]` where:

`pi = exp(zi) / Î£j exp(zj)`

In the binary case (n=2), this simplifies to:

`p1 = exp(z1) / (exp(z1) + exp(z2))`
`p2 = exp(z2) / (exp(z1) + exp(z2))`

Observe that `p1 + p2 = (exp(z1) + exp(z2)) / (exp(z1) + exp(z2)) = 1`. This mathematically guarantees the output is a probability distribution; the sum of probabilities will always equal one.  However, individual probabilities `p1` and `p2` will only approach 1 or 0 depending on the relative magnitudes of `z1` and `z2`.  If `z1` is significantly larger than `z2`, `p1` will approach 1, and `p2` will approach 0. The converse is true if `z2` is significantly larger.  The values will only be exactly 1 and 0 in the limiting case where the difference between `z1` and `z2` approaches infinity.  In practice, this ideal scenario is extremely rare due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic.

The misconception often stems from the intuitive understanding of a binary classifier as a simple threshold function. While the *decision* made by the classifier might be binary (class 0 or class 1), the softmax output provides a *probability* of belonging to each class.  The classifier then typically selects the class with the highest probability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Standard Softmax Implementation (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(z):
  """Standard softmax function."""
  exp_z = np.exp(z)
  return exp_z / np.sum(exp_z)

z = np.array([10, 1]) #Large difference
p = softmax(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}, sum(p): {np.sum(p)}")

z = np.array([1, 1]) # Equal values
p = softmax(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}, sum(p): {np.sum(p)}")


z = np.array([-10, 0]) # Large difference other way
p = softmax(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}, sum(p): {np.sum(p)}")
```

This demonstrates the output of the softmax function for different input vectors.  Even with large differences in input values, the probabilities sum to 1.


**Example 2:  Numerical Stability Improvement (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax_stable(z):
    """Softmax with numerical stability improvements."""
    z = z - np.max(z) # subtract the maximum value for stability
    exp_z = np.exp(z)
    return exp_z / np.sum(exp_z)

z = np.array([1000, 1])  # Example with potential overflow
p = softmax_stable(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}, sum(p): {np.sum(p)}")

z = np.array([-1000, 0]) #Example with potential underflow
p = softmax_stable(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}, sum(p): {np.sum(p)}")
```
This example showcases a common technique to address numerical instability caused by extremely large or small exponential values. Subtracting the maximum value from the input vector before exponentiation prevents potential overflow errors.


**Example 3:  Sigmoid as a Special Case of Softmax (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(z):
    """Sigmoid function."""
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

z = np.array([2])
p = sigmoid(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}")


z = np.array([-2])
p = sigmoid(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}")

z = np.array([0])
p = sigmoid(z)
print(f"z: {z}, p: {p}")

```

In binary classification, the sigmoid function can be considered a special case of softmax where we only care about the probability of one class.  The sigmoid output represents the probability of class 1, while 1-sigmoid(z) represents the probability of class 0.  This clarifies that while it doesn't explicitly produce a two-element probability vector summing to 1, it implicitly defines the full distribution.

* A numerical analysis textbook focusing on floating-point arithmetic and its implications.
*  Advanced deep learning materials that detail the nuances of activation functions and their implementations.


In conclusion, softmax in binary classification always outputs a probability distribution summing to 1, a direct consequence of its mathematical definition.  The perceived anomaly of outputs always being [1, 0] or [0, 1] is a misunderstanding: the outputs are probabilities, not deterministic classifications, and numerical precision limitations prevent reaching those exact values except in limiting cases.  Careful consideration of numerical stability is crucial for robust implementation.
