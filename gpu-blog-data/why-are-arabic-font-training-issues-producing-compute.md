The “Compute CTC targets failed” error during Arabic font training using systems like TensorFlow or PyTorch commonly indicates a mismatch between the text transcription provided and the expected output format generated by the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function. This error is not specific to Arabic but manifests more frequently due to the complexities in its orthography and the specific requirements of CTC. Specifically, the error often stems from an inadequate mapping between Arabic glyphs and the character representation used within the training pipeline, leading to an incompatibility between the acoustic model output and the expected label sequences.

Fundamentally, CTC requires a blank token in addition to the set of characters to handle the situations when the acoustic model outputs a repeated symbol or where no character is present at all in a frame. The sequence of characters produced by the acoustic model is then aligned with the expected character sequences, allowing a probabilistic model to produce its likelihood.

The root cause, in my experience, usually resides in incorrect processing of the Arabic script, where contextual forms (initial, medial, final, isolated) of the same letter are not treated identically, or when the necessary pre-processing steps are skipped.

Arabic text, unlike English, often employs contextual forms, ligatures, and diacritics which alter the representation and pronunciation. Within the training process for speech-to-text or OCR, we typically tokenize the text at the character level, aiming for a one-to-one mapping between tokens in the transcription and the target character label. However, if this tokenization is handled naïvely, it results in either an expanded vocabulary size (treating each context-dependent form as a unique token) or inconsistent token assignments. This, in turn, misaligns the target sequence expected by the CTC loss with the sequence produced by the acoustic model. Furthermore, incorrect Unicode normalization of the input text can also introduce discrepancies, leading to the same characters being treated as different tokens during training.

Here are some typical scenarios and their corresponding solutions, each demonstrating potential sources of the 'Compute CTC targets failed' error:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Unicode Normalization**

The Unicode standard offers multiple ways to represent the same character. For example, combining characters (base character + diacritic) can be represented with a single, precomposed character. If the text transcription uses composed characters (NFC) but the tokenizer expects decomposed (NFD), this can lead to a mismatch. In this instance, we should ensure consistent normalization.

```python
import unicodedata

def normalize_arabic_text(text, normalization_form='NFC'):
    """Normalizes Arabic text to a consistent Unicode form."""
    return unicodedata.normalize(normalization_form, text)

#Example
transcription_composed = "أَ" #Precomposed Alef with Fatha
transcription_decomposed= "ا"+"َ" #Decomposed Alef and Fatha

normalized_composed = normalize_arabic_text(transcription_composed, 'NFD')
normalized_decomposed = normalize_arabic_text(transcription_decomposed, 'NFD')

print(f"Decomposed Normalization of composed: {normalized_composed}")
print(f"Decomposed Normalization of decomposed: {normalized_decomposed}")

if normalized_composed == normalized_decomposed:
    print("Normalization is consistent.")
else:
    print("Normalization inconsistency persists.")


```

In this Python example, we demonstrate that normalizing to a specific form makes composed and decomposed representations of the same character equal. This ensures the tokenizer processes equivalent inputs correctly. In training, prior to tokenization, ensuring normalization of the transcribed text is crucial and failure to perform this step is a common source of CTC errors. The `normalize_arabic_text` function is simple but emphasizes the necessity of consistently employing either 'NFC' or 'NFD'. If your tokenization expects NFD, both composed and decomposed inputs should be normalized using `unicodedata.normalize(text, 'NFD')` before tokenizing.

**Scenario 2: Ignoring Contextual Forms**

Another common issue arises from tokenizing based on the raw Unicode codepoints, ignoring context. For instance, the letter "ه" can appear in initial, medial, final, and isolated forms, each encoded differently in Unicode. If the tokenizer sees them as distinct characters, but the acoustic model is trained on a simpler character set (e.g., mapping all variants of “ه” to a single token), “Compute CTC targets failed” errors are inevitable.

```python
def simplistic_tokenizer(text):
    """Naive tokenizer treats every code point as a token."""
    tokens = list(text)
    return tokens


def contextual_aware_tokenizer(text, context_map):
    """Context aware tokenizer uses mappings to normalize chars"""
    tokens = []
    for char in text:
        if char in context_map:
            tokens.append(context_map[char])
        else:
             tokens.append(char)
    return tokens

#Example
text = "هههـه"  # initial, medial, final, isolated "h" characters
simplistic_tokens = simplistic_tokenizer(text)

context_map = {
    "ه": "h", # isolated
    "هـ": "h", # initial
    "ـه": "h", # final
    "ـهـ": "h", # medial
}

context_tokens = contextual_aware_tokenizer(text, context_map)

print(f"Simplistic Tokens: {simplistic_tokens}")
print(f"Context Aware Tokens: {context_tokens}")
```

The `simplistic_tokenizer` produces an inconsistent result because each "h" variant is treated as a unique token, whereas the `contextual_aware_tokenizer` maps these variants to a single token, “h”. In reality, mapping can be more complex and may require lookups within the dataset character inventory. This example highlights the necessity of using context-aware tokenization, especially for Arabic. Employing a context map ensures a consistent internal representation and removes a source of mismatch between the acoustic model output and transcription.

**Scenario 3: Incorrectly Handling Diacritics**

Diacritics in Arabic modify the pronunciation but might not be explicitly present in the transcription or might be represented inconsistently. If a transcription contains diacritics but the acoustic model only focuses on the base characters, or diacritics are inconsistently applied, the expected output of CTC will mismatch. We can remove diacritics or train a separate model to recognize them, but consistency is crucial.

```python
import re
def remove_diacritics(text):
    """Removes Arabic diacritics using a regex. """
    diacritic_pattern = re.compile(r'[\u064B-\u0652\u06D4]')
    return re.sub(diacritic_pattern, '', text)


#Example
text_with_diacritics = "كِتَابٌ"  # Example word with diacritics
text_without_diacritics = remove_diacritics(text_with_diacritics)

print(f"Text with diacritics: {text_with_diacritics}")
print(f"Text without diacritics: {text_without_diacritics}")
```

In this example, the `remove_diacritics` function strips away all Arabic diacritical marks. The decision on whether to include or remove diacritics must align with how the acoustic model is trained. The primary takeaway is the requirement for consistency and clarity within the training process.

In addition to the above, ensure that the number of tokens, including the blank token, aligns with the number of labels expected by your CTC implementation. Ensure the batch size during training does not produce unexpected errors. Furthermore, examine dataset labels for inconsistencies, encoding errors, and erroneous data that can also trigger the “Compute CTC targets failed” error.

For resolving these issues, I recommend consulting resources such as the Unicode Standard documentation, specifically concerning Unicode normalization forms and the handling of complex scripts. Explore research papers on Arabic character encoding and tokenization, which discuss solutions to these common problems in more detail. Finally, examine the documentation for the specific deep learning frameworks you are using (TensorFlow or PyTorch), paying special attention to their CTC implementation details and the data preparation process. I have also found that carefully reviewing tokenizers employed by publicly available model resources can provide additional insights.
