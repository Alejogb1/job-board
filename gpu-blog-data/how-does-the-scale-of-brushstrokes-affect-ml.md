The impact of brushstroke scale on the efficacy of style transfer models is directly tied to the model's ability to capture and reproduce high-frequency information.  My experience developing style transfer algorithms for high-resolution art restoration projects revealed that neglecting this aspect leads to significant discrepancies between the target style and the generated output.  Specifically, the spatial frequency content of the brushstrokes, characterized by their size and texture, dictates the model's capacity to learn and transfer the stylistic nuances.  A failure to appropriately address this leads to either overly smoothed, lacking texture results or a complete misrepresentation of the target style.

**1. Explanation:**

Style transfer models, fundamentally, learn mappings between feature spaces.  These feature spaces represent the content and style of images, often extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  Brushstrokes, being inherently textural features, are encoded in the higher-frequency components of these feature spaces.  A large brushstroke, characterized by broad, low-frequency variations in color and intensity, will primarily populate lower-level CNN layers.  Conversely, smaller, more intricate brushstrokes contain significant high-frequency information, encoded in deeper layers of the network.

The scale of the brushstrokes thus directly influences the model's reliance on different feature layers.  A model trained solely on images with large brushstrokes might fail to accurately transfer the style when presented with an image containing fine details and small brushstrokes.  This is because the network hasn't learned to map those higher-frequency features in the source style to the corresponding features in the content image.  Conversely, a model trained exclusively on images with fine brushstrokes may overemphasize detail and produce a noisy or unnatural output when applied to images with larger brushstrokes.

The optimal approach, based on my previous research, involves a nuanced training strategy that incorporates images with a diverse range of brushstroke scales. This broadens the feature space the model learns from, enabling a more robust and adaptable style transfer process, regardless of the input image's brushstroke characteristics.  Furthermore, the architecture of the CNN itself plays a crucial role. Deeper networks with a greater number of layers are better equipped to capture high-frequency information and thus are more effective in transferring styles with fine brushstrokes.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how brushstroke scale impacts style transfer using a simplified representation of a CNN-based approach.  These examples are conceptual and do not represent a production-ready implementation.  They serve to demonstrate the principle.

**Example 1: Simplified Style Transfer without Consideration for Scale:**

```python
import numpy as np

def simplified_style_transfer(content_image, style_image, style_weights):
    #Simplified feature extraction (replace with actual CNN)
    content_features = np.mean(content_image, axis=(0,1))
    style_features = np.mean(style_image, axis=(0,1))

    #Simplified style transfer (replace with actual loss functions and optimization)
    output_features = content_features + style_weights * (style_features - content_features)

    #Convert back to image representation
    output_image = np.clip(output_features, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)
    return output_image

#Example Usage
content = np.random.rand(100,100,3)*255 # placeholder content
style = np.random.rand(100,100,3)*255 # placeholder style with large brushstrokes
output = simplified_style_transfer(content,style,0.5)
```

This example showcases a highly simplified style transfer.  It lacks any mechanism to handle varying scales of brushstrokes, and the averaging operation in feature extraction ignores high-frequency content.

**Example 2:  Incorporating Multi-Scale Feature Extraction:**

```python
import numpy as np

def multi_scale_style_transfer(content_image, style_image, style_weights, scales):
    output_image = np.copy(content_image)
    for scale in scales:
        #Simulate downsampling for different scales
        content_downsampled = downsample(content_image, scale)
        style_downsampled = downsample(style_image, scale)

        # Simplified feature extraction at each scale
        content_features = np.mean(content_downsampled, axis=(0,1))
        style_features = np.mean(style_downsampled, axis=(0,1))

        #Apply style transfer at each scale
        output_features = content_features + style_weights * (style_features - content_features)

        #Upsample and blend with previous scales
        output_image = blend(output_image, upsample(output_features, scale), scale)

    return output_image

#Placeholder functions for downsample, upsample, and blend
def downsample(image, scale): return image
def upsample(features, scale): return features
def blend(image1, image2, scale): return image1
```

This demonstrates a rudimentary approach to incorporating multiple scales.  The `downsample` function simulates reducing resolution, allowing the model to capture features at different scales. The blending process combines results from different scales.  However, a true multi-scale approach would require a more sophisticated architecture.


**Example 3:  Illustrative Use of Pre-trained CNN Features:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf #or another deep learning library

# Assume a pre-trained CNN model like VGG19 is loaded: pre_trained_model

def cnn_style_transfer(content_image, style_image, style_weights, layers):
    content_features = pre_trained_model(content_image)
    style_features = pre_trained_model(style_image)

    output_features = content_features.copy()
    for layer_index in layers:
        output_features[layer_index] += style_weights[layer_index] * (style_features[layer_index] - content_features[layer_index])

    #Reconstruction from features (complex and depends on pre-trained model)
    output_image = reconstruct_image(output_features)
    return output_image


#Placeholder function for reconstruction
def reconstruct_image(features):
    return np.zeros((100,100,3)) #Placeholder
```
This illustrates utilizing pre-trained CNN features (like VGG19's activations). Different layers capture different frequencies; selecting specific layers allows control over which frequency components are emphasized in style transfer.  The `layers` and `style_weights` parameters allow for selective influence from various scales. However, the reconstruction step is highly model-dependent and complex.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CNN architectures relevant to style transfer, I would recommend exploring seminal publications on convolutional neural networks and exploring the documented architectures of well-known image processing libraries.  Further, comprehensive texts on digital image processing and computer vision would provide valuable background in image feature extraction and manipulation. Finally, examining research papers focusing specifically on style transfer algorithms and their variations will provide insights into advanced techniques and solutions addressing issues related to brushstroke scale.
