Keras custom layers, when implemented improperly, can exhibit unexpected behavior concerning argument handling within their `__init__` methods. This stems from Keras's internal mechanisms for layer construction and serialization, particularly when the layer is part of a model that may be reloaded, cloned, or otherwise manipulated beyond a basic initial instantiation. The common issue arises from the interaction between the framework's layer building process and how user-defined attributes are stored and accessed.

My experience building a multi-head attention layer that was part of a larger recurrent network model initially revealed this problem. I defined the layer's `__init__` to accept parameters like `num_heads` and `key_dim`. During early iterations of the model, the training process would work well. However, if I serialized the model to disk then reloaded it, errors would surface stating that additional arguments, such as "name" or "dtype", were being passed to the layer's `__init__` method even though they weren't specified in my code. This initially caused confusion since the original construction process did not exhibit this issue. It turns out this is the intended behavior of Keras.

Specifically, Keras layers, even custom ones, are expected to handle a range of arguments beyond those explicitly defined in your `__init__` method. This includes arguments related to layer naming (`name`), data types (`dtype`), or other configurations used internally within the Keras framework. When constructing a layer from a saved model, for instance, Keras reads the layer’s saved configuration, including its name, which is then passed as an argument. This is crucial for ensuring the layer can be consistently reconstructed and integrated back into a network. When a user-defined layer does not include an appropriate handling of such additional parameters, the `__init__` method becomes a bottleneck leading to a failure.

The core problem is not that Keras is incorrectly sending extra parameters but rather that the user-defined `__init__` is not designed to accommodate these implicit arguments. We can avoid the error by adopting a more defensive approach in the layer’s constructor, using argument unpacking (`**kwargs`) to capture the implicit Keras-controlled parameters, and then optionally utilizing those we need ourselves.

The fix involves three key modifications to our custom layer definitions:

1.  **Argument Unpacking:** Modify the `__init__` method to accept `**kwargs`. This allows for any unexpected arguments to be passed and stored.
2.  **`super().__init__(**kwargs)`:** Incorporate a call to the superclass's `__init__` method, passing along all the additional arguments within `kwargs`. This allows the base layer class to handle its configuration correctly.
3. **Targeted Keyword Argument Extraction:** Carefully extracting any values we intend to store as attributes within `__init__` from the arguments we define explicitly.

Here are three illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Problematic Layer (Without Handling Implicit Arguments)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class CustomLayerIncorrect(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.random.normal(shape=(inputs.shape[-1], self.units)))
        return self.activation(output) if self.activation else output

# This instantiation will generally work for fresh layers.
layer_instance_incorrect = CustomLayerIncorrect(units=128, activation="relu")

# However, when Keras attempts to recreate this instance during reloading, the 'name', 'dtype' and other implicit arguments will trigger error, as they were not part of `__init__`.
# example of problematic re-load (for demonstration purposes only, not recommended)
# layer_instance_incorrect = CustomLayerIncorrect(units=128, name="test", activation="relu") # this would raise a TypeError
```

In this initial implementation, only `units` and `activation` are explicitly defined as parameters. When a Keras model containing such a layer is saved and loaded, the `__init__` will receive additional arguments like `name` and `dtype`, leading to a `TypeError`. The re-load operation shown in the comment section is designed only to demonstrate a point, re-loading the model directly is more complex than that.

**Example 2: Corrected Layer (Handling Implicit Arguments)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class CustomLayerCorrect(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.random.normal(shape=(inputs.shape[-1], self.units)))
        return self.activation(output) if self.activation else output

# Instantiation now includes implicit arguments
layer_instance_correct = CustomLayerCorrect(units=128, name="my_layer", activation="relu")
print(layer_instance_correct.name)

# Re-loading operation would work because __init__ now uses **kwargs
layer_instance_correct_reload = CustomLayerCorrect(units=128, name="my_layer", activation="relu", dtype=tf.float32)
print(layer_instance_correct_reload.dtype)

```

Here, the modified `__init__` now accepts `**kwargs`, capturing any additional keyword arguments, and passes these arguments to the parent class's `__init__` method. The layer can then handle all implicit arguments. Both the instantiation, and re-loading in Keras would work without error.

**Example 3: Layer with Specific Keyword Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class CustomLayerSpecific(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, custom_param=10, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)
        self.custom_param = custom_param # we specifically intend to use custom_param, and assign it to self.custom_param

    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.random.normal(shape=(inputs.shape[-1], self.units)))
        return self.activation(output) if self.activation else output

# Instantiation, include our custom parameter
layer_instance_specific = CustomLayerSpecific(units=128, custom_param=20, activation="relu", name="my_specific_layer")
print(layer_instance_specific.custom_param)
print(layer_instance_specific.name)

# Re-loading operation should work
layer_instance_specific_reload = CustomLayerSpecific(units=128, custom_param=30, activation="relu", name="my_specific_layer_2", dtype=tf.float64)
print(layer_instance_specific_reload.dtype)
print(layer_instance_specific_reload.custom_param)
print(layer_instance_specific_reload.name)

```

This example showcases a layer which accepts `custom_param` explicitly, in addition to any implicit parameters from the base layer through `**kwargs`. Inside the `__init__`, we specifically assign `custom_param` to the `self.custom_param` attribute, demonstrating the ability to both capture and use specific values while allowing the base class to take care of its own implicit configuration. Again, re-loading is now supported by following proper implementation using `**kwargs`.

To deepen one's understanding, I would suggest reviewing the official Keras documentation on custom layers, specifically paying close attention to the subclassing and serialization sections. Further, exploring examples of custom layers in widely available open-source repositories is a valuable exercise. Examining how experienced developers structure custom layers can help reinforce the correct usage patterns. Finally, delving into the source code for the Keras core Layer class, although complex, can be incredibly beneficial in understanding how Keras expects layers to be defined and initialized. Specifically, look for `__init__` and how Keras loads layer configurations from disk. This investigation will provide insights into the implicit arguments that are passed along.
