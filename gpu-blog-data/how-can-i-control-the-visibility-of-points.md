Controlling point visibility in Altair charts hinges on leveraging the power of its encoding system and data manipulation capabilities.  My experience working on large-scale data visualization projects for financial modeling has shown that directly manipulating the data before chart construction is often the most efficient and maintainable approach, compared to relying solely on Altair's built-in conditional rendering mechanisms.  This strategy allows for better performance, especially when dealing with substantial datasets, and provides more granular control over the visual representation.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

Altair doesn't offer a direct "visibility" attribute for individual points. Instead, we control point visibility indirectly through encoding channels.  The most straightforward method involves encoding point visibility using a categorical or quantitative field in your data.  This field will determine whether a particular data point is rendered or omitted from the chart.  If a point's value in this field meets a predefined condition, it will be visible; otherwise, it will be invisible.  This conditional rendering is achieved through strategic use of Altair's `transform_filter` function, or, more efficiently for large datasets, by pre-filtering your data using Pandas or another data manipulation library before passing it to Altair.

This approach has several advantages:

* **Efficiency:** Pre-filtering significantly improves performance, especially with large datasets, by reducing the amount of data Altair needs to process.
* **Control:**  Provides granular control over which points are visible, allowing for complex conditional logic based on multiple data attributes.
* **Maintainability:** Separates data manipulation from chart construction, resulting in cleaner and more understandable code.

The alternative—using Altair's `transform_calculate` and conditional statements within the chart specification—is possible, but quickly becomes unwieldy with increasing complexity. It also burdens Altair's rendering engine, potentially leading to performance issues with substantial datasets.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Pre-filtering with Pandas**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': range(10),
    'y': range(10, 20),
    'visibility': [True, True, False, True, False, True, True, False, True, True]
})

# Filter data before passing to Altair
filtered_data = data[data['visibility']]

# Create Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(filtered_data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
)

chart.show()
```

This example demonstrates the most efficient approach. We use Pandas to filter the data based on the `visibility` column before creating the Altair chart.  Only rows where `visibility` is `True` are included in the chart.  This keeps the Altair specification concise and improves performance.  Note the `:Q` specifying quantitative data types; this is crucial for correct encoding.


**Example 2:  Using `transform_filter`**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data (same as Example 1)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': range(10),
    'y': range(10, 20),
    'visibility': [True, True, False, True, False, True, True, False, True, True]
})


chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
).transform_filter(
    alt.datum.visibility
)

chart.show()
```

This example utilizes Altair's `transform_filter`. While functional, it’s less efficient than pre-filtering for large datasets because Altair performs the filtering operation during chart rendering.  The logic is simpler to read directly in the Altair specification, but performance suffers for large datasets.  The core difference lies in when the filtering happens: before or during chart creation.


**Example 3: Conditional Visibility based on a Quantitative Field**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': range(10),
    'y': range(10, 20),
    'value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 12, 30, 18, 22, 28, 17]
})

# Filter data based on a threshold
filtered_data = data[data['value'] > 20]

# Create Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(filtered_data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
)

chart.show()
```

This example demonstrates conditional visibility based on a quantitative field (`value`).  Points with a `value` greater than 20 are visible; others are not.  This showcases the flexibility of the approach—conditional logic can be based on any relevant field in your data.  Again, pre-filtering through Pandas before passing the data to Altair ensures optimal performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would suggest reviewing the official Altair documentation thoroughly.  Pay close attention to the sections on encoding, data transformations, and the use of Pandas for data manipulation.  Furthermore, exploring examples in the Altair gallery will provide valuable insights into practical applications of these techniques.  A comprehensive guide on Pandas data manipulation will be helpful to master efficient data pre-processing.  Finally,  a good introduction to data visualization principles will aid in understanding the best practices for presenting data effectively.  These resources will equip you to handle a wide range of data visualization challenges effectively.
