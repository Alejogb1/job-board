PyTorch, utilizing its autograd engine, simplifies the computation of gradients, a crucial aspect of training neural networks. While the core concepts remain consistent, executing this operation on a GPU necessitates careful consideration of tensor placement and operations. I’ve frequently encountered scenarios where neglecting these factors led to significant performance bottlenecks or even incorrect gradient calculations during my time optimizing models for medical imaging. Therefore, achieving efficient gradient computation on a GPU requires a firm grasp of how PyTorch handles tensor movement and automatic differentiation.

Fundamentally, the process involves these key steps: creating tensors on the GPU, performing forward computations, calculating a scalar loss, and then invoking backward propagation to obtain the gradients. It is important to ensure that all tensors involved in the computation chain reside on the same device. If not, PyTorch will throw a runtime error indicating mismatched devices, usually on CUDA tensors. The primary mechanism, `torch.Tensor.backward()`, computes the gradient of the tensor with respect to the graph's leaves (i.e., input tensors with `requires_grad=True`).

Let’s consider a scenario where we're building a simple linear regression model. The input is a tensor `X` with shape `(N, features)`, the weights are a tensor `W` with shape `(features, 1)`, and the bias is a tensor `b` with shape `(1, 1)`. The output `Y` is `X @ W + b`. The crucial part is to enable gradient tracking for `W` and `b` by setting their `requires_grad` attribute to `True`. Here is how we accomplish this and subsequently compute the gradients.

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression Gradient**

```python
import torch

# Define the tensors on the GPU.
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

N = 100
features = 2
X = torch.randn(N, features, device=device)
W = torch.randn(features, 1, device=device, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, 1, device=device, requires_grad=True)

# Compute the output
Y = X @ W + b

# Define a loss function (MSE)
Y_target = torch.randn(N, 1, device=device)
loss = torch.mean((Y - Y_target)**2)

# Calculate the gradients
loss.backward()

# Access the gradients for W and b
W_grad = W.grad
b_grad = b.grad

print(f"Gradient of W:\n{W_grad}")
print(f"Gradient of b:\n{b_grad}")
```

In this example, the `device` variable determines if a GPU is available and sets the execution device accordingly. All tensors, including `X`, `W`, and `b`, are created on the specified device. Crucially, `W` and `b` are initialized with `requires_grad=True`, which signals PyTorch to track operations involving these tensors and record the necessary information to compute gradients. The `loss.backward()` call triggers the backward pass, and the gradients are subsequently stored in the `grad` attribute of the corresponding tensors. The output will show the computed gradient tensors. A common mistake is neglecting to call `loss.backward()` on a single scalar loss. Failing to do this will result in no gradients being computed.

The next example demonstrates how to compute gradients when the output is not directly used as a loss. Consider a scenario where we are using a hidden activation within a network. We still need to calculate the gradients of that hidden activation with respect to its input.

**Example 2: Gradient of a Hidden Activation**

```python
import torch

# Define the device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Input tensor
N = 10
input_size = 3
X = torch.randn(N, input_size, device=device, requires_grad=True)

# Transformation
W = torch.randn(input_size, 5, device=device, requires_grad=True)
hidden = X @ W

# Activation function
activated_hidden = torch.relu(hidden)

# Perform backpropagation (assuming a loss depending on activated_hidden
# We use a dummy loss just for the example
dummy_loss = torch.mean(activated_hidden**2)

dummy_loss.backward()

# Gradients with respect to the input X.
X_grad = X.grad
W_grad = W.grad

print(f"Gradient of X:\n{X_grad}")
print(f"Gradient of W:\n{W_grad}")
```

In this case, the gradient is computed for both the input tensor `X` and the weight matrix `W`.  I want to emphasize that the `backward` call on `dummy_loss` computes the gradients with respect to all tensors used in the forward operation that have `requires_grad=True`. If the backward call was performed on `activated_hidden`, the gradient would be equal to one, whereas the gradient of `X` or `W` would not be automatically calculated. Furthermore, gradients are accumulated by default. When performing an optimization step, it is important to zero the gradients using `tensor.grad.zero_()` before performing `loss.backward()`, otherwise they will sum with each other.

Finally, consider a more complex scenario involving multiple operations. This example shows how to get gradients through multiple layers and activation functions, akin to a mini-neural network.

**Example 3: Multi-Layer Network Gradients**

```python
import torch

# Device configuration
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Input tensor
N = 50
input_size = 10
X = torch.randn(N, input_size, device=device, requires_grad=True)

# First layer
W1 = torch.randn(input_size, 20, device=device, requires_grad=True)
b1 = torch.randn(1, 20, device=device, requires_grad=True)
hidden1 = torch.relu(X @ W1 + b1)

# Second layer
W2 = torch.randn(20, 1, device=device, requires_grad=True)
b2 = torch.randn(1, 1, device=device, requires_grad=True)
output = hidden1 @ W2 + b2

# Loss
target = torch.randn(N, 1, device=device)
loss = torch.mean((output - target)**2)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Print out the gradients
print(f"Gradient of W1:\n{W1.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of b1:\n{b1.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of W2:\n{W2.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of b2:\n{b2.grad}")
```

Here, the autograd engine seamlessly computes the gradients through multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions (`torch.relu`).  The backpropagation algorithm is automatically employed. The key here is ensuring all tensors participating in computations reside on the same device, thus enabling efficient GPU execution. The `backward()` call implicitly propagates the gradient back through all operations and populates the `.grad` attributes of `W1`, `b1`, `W2`, and `b2`.

Regarding further learning, I recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation, focusing specifically on topics related to `torch.autograd`, tensor operations, and GPU utilization. The book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" provides an in-depth treatment of these concepts with a practical focus. For more conceptual understanding, academic papers on automatic differentiation provide a theoretical framework. Finally, engaging with open-source PyTorch repositories offers insight into real-world implementations of backpropagation within larger projects. A sound theoretical understanding coupled with practice will make backpropagation on a GPU a routine part of your PyTorch workflow.
