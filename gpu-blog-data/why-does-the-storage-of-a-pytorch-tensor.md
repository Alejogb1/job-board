Resizing a PyTorch tensor can alter its underlying storage, not merely its shape. Specifically, resizing may trigger a change in the contiguousness and, consequently, the memory layout of the tensor's data. This behavior stems from PyTorch’s optimization strategy, where memory allocation is prioritized for efficiency over maintaining the exact same memory block across all shape changes.

I've observed this firsthand several times when developing deep learning models involving dynamic input sizes. What might appear as a straightforward reshaping operation can actually involve a costly memory reorganization under the hood. Understanding why this occurs is vital for predicting performance bottlenecks and debugging unexpected behavior.

Fundamentally, PyTorch tensors store data in a contiguous block of memory. The shape of the tensor dictates how this block is interpreted, essentially providing a multi-dimensional view into the underlying one-dimensional data array. When you resize a tensor, PyTorch attempts to reuse the existing memory block. However, the target shape might require a different layout that makes it impossible to preserve contiguity.

Contiguous memory is crucial for efficient computation. Operations such as element-wise addition, matrix multiplication, and other core operations are significantly optimized when tensors are contiguous in memory. This means that data is stored in the same order that it's accessed by these operations, allowing for rapid memory access. When a tensor is non-contiguous, the operation may involve accessing scattered memory locations, significantly slowing down the computation.

When resizing a tensor, if the new shape preserves the same linear ordering of elements with respect to the original contiguous data, the resizing operation can be carried out without modifying the underlying storage. However, if the change in dimensions causes a reordering of memory accesses for efficient processing, PyTorch will allocate a new block of memory that reflects the new shape and its required contiguity and copy the data over. This can lead to scenarios where seemingly simple resizing operations become computationally expensive. This allocation and data copy also contributes to a change in the tensor's underlying storage object.

To illustrate this behavior, let us consider three code examples.

**Example 1: Preserving Contiguity**

```python
import torch

# Create a 2x3 tensor
original_tensor = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Original Tensor is Contiguous:", original_tensor.is_contiguous())

# Reshape to 3x2 (preserves the linear order)
reshaped_tensor = original_tensor.reshape(3, 2)
print("Reshaped Tensor:\n", reshaped_tensor)
print("Reshaped Tensor is Contiguous:", reshaped_tensor.is_contiguous())

# Check if they share the same storage
print("Shared Storage:", original_tensor.storage().data_ptr() == reshaped_tensor.storage().data_ptr())

```

In this first example, I create a tensor with shape (2, 3) containing sequential integer values from 0 to 5. Subsequently, I reshape it to (3, 2). Critically, both these shapes interpret the underlying data such that the ordering of the linear memory representation is preserved. The reshaped tensor remains contiguous and the two tensors share the same storage as evidenced by the identical memory pointers returned by `storage().data_ptr()`. Therefore, no memory copy or new storage object is triggered, and the underlying data remains unmodified during this resizing. This type of reshaping is generally efficient and has low overhead.

**Example 2: Creating Non-Contiguity and Forced Memory Reallocation**

```python
import torch

# Create a 2x3 tensor
original_tensor = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Original Tensor is Contiguous:", original_tensor.is_contiguous())

# Transpose to 3x2 (does NOT preserve the linear order)
transposed_tensor = original_tensor.transpose(0, 1)
print("Transposed Tensor:\n", transposed_tensor)
print("Transposed Tensor is Contiguous:", transposed_tensor.is_contiguous())

# Reshape to 6x1 (will re-arrange the data layout)
reshaped_transposed_tensor = transposed_tensor.reshape(6, 1)
print("Reshaped Transposed Tensor:\n", reshaped_transposed_tensor)
print("Reshaped Transposed Tensor is Contiguous:", reshaped_transposed_tensor.is_contiguous())

# Check if the original and final storage are the same
print("Shared Storage:", original_tensor.storage().data_ptr() == reshaped_transposed_tensor.storage().data_ptr())
```

Here, I initially construct a similar 2x3 tensor.  The key difference is the introduction of a transpose operation.  Transposing the tensor changes its view, such that the data is no longer laid out contiguously in memory with respect to the standard row-major order. This makes the transposed tensor not contiguous. Crucially, when the non-contiguous transposed tensor is then reshaped, PyTorch must allocate a new contiguous block of memory to represent the 6x1 tensor and copy the data over to that new storage. This is reflected in the output with `is_contiguous()` returning `True`, and the final tensor's storage pointer being different from the original. This shows that a simple reshape after a non-contiguity operation causes allocation of a different storage.

**Example 3: Resizing and Implicit Memory Copy**

```python
import torch

# Create a 2x3 tensor
original_tensor = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Original Tensor is Contiguous:", original_tensor.is_contiguous())

# Reshape to a larger tensor that doesn't preserve contiguity
resized_tensor = torch.empty(3, 4)
resized_tensor[:2, :3] = original_tensor
print("Resized Tensor:\n", resized_tensor)
print("Resized Tensor is Contiguous:", resized_tensor.is_contiguous())


# Check if they share the same storage
print("Shared Storage:", original_tensor.storage().data_ptr() == resized_tensor.storage().data_ptr())
```

In this third example, I demonstrate resizing to a larger tensor. Here, I create an empty 3x4 tensor and then copy the data from the original 2x3 tensor into the top-left sub-portion of the new tensor. In this case, even though the copied data values are still represented sequentially, a new tensor has to be allocated to accommodate the new larger dimension, so the pointer comparison will show a different storage being used by resized tensor. This scenario is very common in padding and other preprocessing steps. The point is that the resizing from (2,3) to a partially populated (3,4) involves a non-trivial change to the storage allocation.

The change in storage during resizing isn't an arbitrary choice. It's driven by a need to optimize for performance. While it introduces the complexity of memory reallocation, this trade-off is often worthwhile for maximizing the execution speed of PyTorch operations. The potential drawback is that unexpected memory copies during resizing can negatively impact performance when not carefully considered.

For further exploration into PyTorch tensor operations, I would suggest referring to the official PyTorch documentation. It provides extensive details on all the tensor manipulations, contiguity, and memory management. In addition, several textbooks and online resources dedicated to deep learning also often cover these specifics. Specifically, those resources that focus on model optimization and understanding performance bottlenecks would be beneficial. Exploring the concepts of "view," "storage," and "stride" in the PyTorch documentation is also particularly important. They provide the theoretical understanding behind the practical observations I’ve discussed. Lastly, profiling tools within PyTorch can often give you additional information on the memory allocation and data movement costs of your model operations.
