The unavailability of a 'summary' function, assuming we're discussing its absence within a specific context – for instance, a custom-built data processing pipeline or a particular library's API – frequently stems from a missing or improperly implemented summarization component.  My experience troubleshooting such issues over the past decade, primarily within large-scale financial data applications, has consistently highlighted this fundamental cause.  The "summary" functionality isn't a universally guaranteed feature; rather, it represents a specific design choice reflecting the system's capabilities and intended usage.

1. **Clear Explanation:**  The lack of a 'summary' function usually indicates one of several scenarios. Firstly, the underlying data structures might not be designed to support efficient summarization.  Raw data, such as unstructured text or arbitrarily formatted log files, necessitates pre-processing steps before a meaningful summary can be generated.  Secondly, the software architecture may simply omit summarization as a feature.  This is often a design decision based on performance considerations, resource constraints, or the lack of a relevant summarization algorithm within the system's purview.  Finally, a crucial dependency, such as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library or a statistical analysis package, might be absent or incorrectly configured.  Error handling within the software might not be reporting the missing dependency clearly, resulting in seemingly cryptic behavior.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Missing Dependency in Python**

```python
import pandas as pd  # Assume pandas is NOT installed

try:
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    summary = data.describe()  # This line will fail if pandas is not installed
    print(summary)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}.  Pandas library is required for summary generation.")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}.  Input data file not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

*Commentary:* This example illustrates a common scenario where a core dependency (Pandas) is missing.  The `try-except` block is essential for robust error handling.  The specific error message provides valuable diagnostic information for the user. The use of a more general `Exception` catch-all provides a final layer of protection against unanticipated errors.  Note that merely catching the `ImportError` would be insufficient if file reading failed.


**Example 2:  Unstructured Data Requiring Preprocessing in Python**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.probability import FreqDist

nltk.download('punkt') # download Punkt Sentence Tokenizer if not already available
nltk.download('stopwords') # download stopwords list

text = """This is a long and rambling text.  It contains many sentences.  Some are relevant, others are not. We need to summarize it."""

sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

words = []
for sentence in sentences:
    words.extend([word.lower() for word in nltk.word_tokenize(sentence) if word.isalnum() and word.lower() not in stop_words])

fdist = FreqDist(words)
most_frequent = fdist.most_common(3) # Summarize using top 3 frequent words

print(f"Summary (based on most frequent words): {', '.join([word for word, count in most_frequent])}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the need for pre-processing unstructured text data.  The code tokenizes sentences, removes stop words, and calculates word frequencies.  A simple summarization is then produced using the most frequent words.  It highlights that a "summary" is a contextual concept and needs to be tailored to the nature of the data.   The use of `nltk.download` shows proactive handling of missing resources, a best practice for production-level code.


**Example 3:  Custom Summary Function in JavaScript**

```javascript
function generateSummary(data, numSentences) {
  if (!data || !data.length) {
      return "No data provided for summarization.";
  }
  if (isNaN(numSentences) || numSentences <=0 || numSentences > data.length) {
    return "Invalid number of sentences requested.";
  }
  //Assuming data is an array of sentences
  return data.slice(0, numSentences).join('. ');
}


const text = ["This is the first sentence.", "This is the second sentence.", "This is the third sentence."];
const summary = generateSummary(text, 2);
console.log(summary); // Output: This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.


const emptyText = [];
const emptySummary = generateSummary(emptyText, 2);
console.log(emptySummary); //Output: No data provided for summarization

const invalidSentenceCount = generateSummary(text, 5);
console.log(invalidSentenceCount); //Output: Invalid number of sentences requested.
```

*Commentary:* This JavaScript example showcases a simple custom function that takes an array of sentences and returns a summary by extracting the first `numSentences`. The inclusion of error handling prevents unexpected behaviors when inputs are malformed, demonstrating robust code design.  This is a rudimentary example, and more sophisticated methods would be needed for truly informative summarization of complex data.  The emphasis here is on demonstrating a well-structured function designed to handle various scenarios, illustrating the fundamental point: a 'summary' function requires explicit definition and implementation.

3. **Resource Recommendations:**

For Python-based summarization, consult documentation and tutorials on the `nltk` and `spaCy` libraries.  For more advanced techniques, explore research papers on extractive and abstractive summarization methods.  In JavaScript, look into libraries specializing in text processing and NLP to handle complex summarization tasks.  Consider exploring statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for improved summarization quality in any language.  Remember to always verify the license compatibility of any external libraries before deploying to a production environment.
