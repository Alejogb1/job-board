The core principle governing concurrent execution of multiple blocks within a CUDA stream lies in the hardware architecture itself: the multi-processor (MP) scheduling.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for years has consistently highlighted the critical role of understanding this underlying mechanism.  Blocks are not directly scheduled onto the MPs; rather, the scheduler within each MP dynamically assigns warps (groups of 32 threads) to available processing units.  This process, coupled with stream management, dictates the concurrency achievable.  Understanding this nuance is key to efficiently leveraging CUDA's parallel capabilities.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

CUDA streams provide a mechanism for ordering kernel launches and memory operations.  While multiple streams can execute concurrently, within a single stream, kernel launches are executed sequentially.  However,  multiple *blocks* from a *single* kernel launch within a stream can execute concurrently, subject to hardware limitations. The GPU scheduler, residing within each multi-processor, manages this concurrency. It selects which warps to execute based on factors like warp availability, register pressure, and shared memory usage.  Importantly, the scheduler operates independently for each MP, leading to potential performance variations depending on the kernel's characteristics and data dependencies.

The number of concurrently executing blocks is not directly controlled but is constrained by the hardware: the number of MPs available and the resources (registers, shared memory, etc.) consumed by each block.  If a block requires more resources than available within an MP, it will impede the execution of other blocks.  This resource contention is a common bottleneck, and careful design is required to mitigate it.  Furthermore, memory access patterns significantly impact performance.  Global memory access latency is high relative to processing speeds.  Therefore, efficiently utilizing shared memory and minimizing global memory accesses are crucial for achieving high throughput.  Finally, the size of the problem (grid size) influences concurrency; a larger grid allows for a greater number of concurrently executing blocks but only if sufficient resources are available.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Concurrent Kernel Launch:**

```c++
__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int N = 1024*1024;
  int *h_data, *d_data;
  // ... memory allocation and data transfer ...

  // Launch kernel with multiple blocks
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  myKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N);

  // ... data transfer back to host ...

  return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:*  This example shows a basic kernel launch. The number of blocks is determined by the problem size (N) and the threads per block. The CUDA runtime handles the scheduling of these blocks across the available MPs.  However, no explicit stream management is present.  While multiple blocks will execute concurrently, the performance can be improved with stream management, which is illustrated in the next examples.


**Example 2: Utilizing CUDA Streams for Concurrent Kernel Execution:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernelA(int *data, int N);
__global__ void kernelB(int *data, int N);

int main() {
  // ... memory allocation and data transfer ...
  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  // Launch kernel A in stream 1
  kernelA<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream1>>>(d_data, N);

  // Launch kernel B in stream 2
  kernelB<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream2>>>(d_data, N);

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);

  // ... data transfer back to host ...
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);

  return 0;
}

```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the use of two streams.  `kernelA` and `kernelB` will execute concurrently, potentially leading to better utilization of the GPU resources.  The blocks within each kernel still execute concurrently based on MP scheduling, but the kernels themselves run concurrently due to separate streams.  Note the `cudaStreamSynchronize` calls, which ensure the completion of each stream before proceeding.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Shared Memory Impact:**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *data, int *result, int N) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[tid] = data[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block

    // Perform computation using shared memory
    // ...

    __syncthreads();
    result[i] = sharedData[tid];
  }
}
```

*Commentary:* This kernel utilizes shared memory to reduce global memory access.  The `__syncthreads()` calls ensure that all threads within a block have finished loading data from global memory before performing calculations using the shared memory.  Efficient use of shared memory minimizes global memory access latency, allowing for more effective concurrent execution of blocks, especially when multiple blocks access overlapping data.  Note that excessive shared memory usage per block can still cause resource contention and reduce concurrency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive text on parallel programming are essential resources.  Furthermore, utilizing CUDA profiling tools for detailed performance analysis is paramount in optimizing kernel launches and achieving maximum concurrency.  Understanding the underlying GPU architecture, particularly the multi-processor scheduling mechanism, is crucial for successful CUDA development.  Familiarity with memory hierarchy and optimization techniques is vital for addressing potential bottlenecks and maximizing performance.  Lastly, carefully designed algorithms leveraging data locality and parallelism are inherently key to efficient code.
