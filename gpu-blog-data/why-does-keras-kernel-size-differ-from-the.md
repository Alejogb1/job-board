The discrepancy between the specified kernel size in Keras and the effective kernel size applied during convolution stems fundamentally from the handling of padding.  While the user explicitly defines a kernel size, the actual filter application is influenced by the padding strategy, which subtly (or sometimes dramatically) modifies the effective receptive field of the convolution.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on image segmentation projects, particularly when working with non-standard padding schemes or uneven input dimensions.  The perceived mismatch arises from a lack of complete understanding of how padding interacts with the convolution operation and how Keras implicitly manages padding.

**1. Explanation of Kernel Size and Padding Interaction**

The kernel size dictates the spatial extent of the filter used in a convolutional layer.  A 3x3 kernel, for instance, implies a 3x3 sliding window that computes a weighted sum of the input feature map's values within that window.  Padding, however, introduces extra values around the borders of the input.  The most common padding types are 'valid' and 'same'.

'Valid' padding implies no padding at all. The output spatial dimensions are directly determined by the input dimensions and the kernel size.  No extra elements are added; the convolution only operates on the central portion of the input, effectively reducing the output dimensions.

'Same' padding aims to maintain the spatial dimensions of the input and output.  Keras, by default, employs a strategy to achieve this: it adds padding such that the output has the same dimensions as the input.  Crucially, this padding is not necessarily symmetric.  The exact amount of padding on each side is calculated to ensure the output shape is identical to the input, leading to what might seem like a discrepancy between the specified kernel size and the apparent receptive field.  The kernel's center is effectively shifted, influencing the computation of elements near the border.  This implicit padding strategy can create asymmetry particularly when dealing with odd-sized kernels and input shapes that aren't multiples of the stride.

Furthermore, custom padding strategies implemented via padding layers or manual tensor manipulation can introduce additional complexity.  Incorrect implementation can lead to padding amounts that are not aligned with the kernel size, leading to noticeable distortions in the convolutional operation's output.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different scenarios illustrating the impact of padding on the effective kernel size.  All examples assume a grayscale image for simplicity, easily extensible to multi-channel inputs.


**Example 1: 'valid' padding – explicit demonstration of reduced output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input image (grayscale)
input_img = np.random.rand(1, 8, 8, 1).astype('float32')

# Define a 3x3 convolutional layer with 'valid' padding
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='valid', input_shape=(8, 8, 1))
])

# Perform convolution
output = model.predict(input_img)

# Observe output shape.  Notice the reduction due to 'valid' padding
print(f"Input shape: {input_img.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

This example shows the direct impact of 'valid' padding.  The output shape is smaller than the input because the convolution operates only on the central region accessible by the 3x3 kernel without any padding.


**Example 2: 'same' padding – implicit padding and potentially asymmetric padding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input image (grayscale)
input_img = np.random.rand(1, 7, 7, 1).astype('float32')

# Define a 3x3 convolutional layer with 'same' padding
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='same', input_shape=(7, 7, 1))
])

# Perform convolution
output = model.predict(input_img)

# Observe output shape. Output shape is the same as input, despite the kernel size.
print(f"Input shape: {input_img.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

#Inspect the padding implicitly added
print(model.layers[0].get_weights()[0].shape) # Kernel weights
print(model.layers[0].get_weights()[1]) # Bias weights.

```

Here, the 'same' padding implicitly adds padding to maintain the input and output shape. The exact amount of padding is calculated internally and might not be perfectly symmetric (particularly with odd kernel sizes and non-multiple input dimensions).


**Example 3: Custom padding – illustrating explicit control, potential for mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input image
input_img = np.random.rand(1, 8, 8, 1).astype('float32')

# Manually add padding (example: 1 pixel padding on all sides)
padded_img = np.pad(input_img, ((0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0)), mode='constant')

# Define a 3x3 convolutional layer with 'valid' padding (to counter the manual padding)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='valid', input_shape=(10, 10, 1))
])

# Perform convolution
output = model.predict(padded_img)

#Observe the effects. Manually added padding must be accounted for.
print(f"Input shape: {input_img.shape}")
print(f"Padded shape: {padded_img.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates explicit padding control.  It's crucial to coordinate manual padding with the padding setting of the convolutional layer to avoid inconsistencies between the specified kernel size and the effective convolutional operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow/Keras documentation regarding convolutional layers, padding strategies, and the detailed mathematics behind convolution operations.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra and digital image processing principles will be highly beneficial.  Furthermore, exploring the source code of the Keras convolutional layer implementation can provide detailed insights into the padding calculations.  Several textbooks on deep learning and computer vision provide rigorous mathematical frameworks for understanding convolution.  Finally, detailed tutorials and blog posts on the nuances of convolutional neural networks and their implementation in Keras can serve as valuable supplementary resources.
