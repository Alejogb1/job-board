The observed issue of a custom GPflow 2 kernel exhibiting a `None` size during optimization stems from inconsistent handling of parameter shape transformations within the kernel's `K` (or `K_diag`) method and its declared `params` properties. My experience with Gaussian Process modeling, particularly in the context of large-scale geospatial analysis, has highlighted how subtly incorrect shape handling can lead to this type of silent failure during gradient-based optimization.

Specifically, the problem arises when GPflow's optimization machinery attempts to compute gradients for the kernel's parameters. These gradients are calculated by evaluating the kernel's output (the covariance matrix or its diagonal) and backpropagating through the operations within the `K` or `K_diag` method. The `params` property within the `gpflow.kernels.Kernel` base class is crucial; it dictates which internal variables are considered trainable and, importantly, their expected shapes. If the actual shape of a parameter's variable used in the `K` method is not consistent with the declared `params` shape after an optimization step, GPflow may report it as `None` because the optimization framework is looking for a specific shape to calculate the gradient. This usually happens when a transformation, such as element-wise multiplication or reshaping, alters the original shape within the `K` method without a corresponding adjustment to the `params` property or its underlying parameter.

Let's unpack this with some practical examples. A basic custom kernel might involve a trainable lengthscale and a signal variance. Here's a simplified version:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import gpflow
from gpflow.kernels import Kernel

class SimpleCustomKernel(Kernel):
    def __init__(self, variance=1.0, lengthscale=1.0, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.variance = gpflow.Parameter(variance, transform=tf.math.softplus)
        self.lengthscale = gpflow.Parameter(lengthscale, transform=tf.math.softplus)

    def K(self, X, X2=None):
        if X2 is None:
            X2 = X
        scaled_dist = tf.reduce_sum((tf.expand_dims(X, 1) - tf.expand_dims(X2, 0))**2, axis=2) / self.lengthscale
        return self.variance * tf.exp(-scaled_dist)

    def K_diag(self, X):
        return tf.fill(tf.shape(X)[:-1], self.variance)

    @property
    def params(self):
        return (self.variance, self.lengthscale)

```

In this kernel, both `variance` and `lengthscale` are scalar values. The `K` method calculates a squared Euclidean distance divided by the `lengthscale` then multiplies the result by the `variance`. The `K_diag` returns the variance across the diagonal. The `params` property correctly reflects these scalar parameters. This setup will likely function correctly during optimization as long as the calculations within the `K` method use those scalar parameters in a manner that maintains their intended interpretation.

Now, consider a scenario where we unintentionally introduce a shape-altering operation. Let's imagine we want to modulate the effect of the lengthscale by scaling it with the input features.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import gpflow
from gpflow.kernels import Kernel

class ModulatedLengthscaleKernel(Kernel):
    def __init__(self, variance=1.0, lengthscale=1.0, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.variance = gpflow.Parameter(variance, transform=tf.math.softplus)
        self.lengthscale = gpflow.Parameter(lengthscale, transform=tf.math.softplus)

    def K(self, X, X2=None):
        if X2 is None:
            X2 = X
        scaled_lengthscale = self.lengthscale * tf.reduce_mean(X, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        scaled_dist = tf.reduce_sum((tf.expand_dims(X, 1) - tf.expand_dims(X2, 0))**2, axis=2) / scaled_lengthscale
        return self.variance * tf.exp(-scaled_dist)


    def K_diag(self, X):
        return tf.fill(tf.shape(X)[:-1], self.variance)

    @property
    def params(self):
        return (self.variance, self.lengthscale)
```

In this modification, the `lengthscale` is multiplied by the average feature value of the input data `X`. If `X` is of shape `[N, D]` where N is the number of data points and D the dimensionality of each point, `tf.reduce_mean(X, axis=-1, keepdims=True)` results in a tensor of shape `[N, 1]`. When we use `scaled_lengthscale` in the `K` method, the kernel calculation proceeds. However, the `params` property indicates that `self.lengthscale` should still have a shape of a scalar. During optimization, GPflow will attempt to calculate the gradient with respect to the scalar `lengthscale`, but internally, this parameter was multiplied by the mean of X yielding a tensor, hence the parameter effectively loses its scalar shape. Consequently, it will manifest as a `None` sized variable. This occurs silently during optimization and is difficult to debug unless one knows to examine the shape of parameters within the kernel's computational graph.

Finally, consider a situation where we want to parameterize lengthscales across different input dimensions, which is fairly common in problems with structured inputs. Here's an example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import gpflow
from gpflow.kernels import Kernel

class DimensionSpecificLengthscaleKernel(Kernel):
    def __init__(self, variance=1.0, lengthscales=None, input_dim=1, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(**kwargs)
      if lengthscales is None:
        lengthscales = tf.ones([input_dim])
      self.variance = gpflow.Parameter(variance, transform=tf.math.softplus)
      self.lengthscales = gpflow.Parameter(lengthscales, transform=tf.math.softplus)
      self.input_dim = input_dim


    def K(self, X, X2=None):
        if X2 is None:
            X2 = X
        scaled_dist = tf.reduce_sum((tf.expand_dims(X, 1) - tf.expand_dims(X2, 0))**2 / self.lengthscales , axis=2)
        return self.variance * tf.exp(-scaled_dist)


    def K_diag(self, X):
        return tf.fill(tf.shape(X)[:-1], self.variance)

    @property
    def params(self):
        return (self.variance, self.lengthscales)
```

In this instance, the lengthscales are initialized as a vector. The key is that, unlike the previous example, here we declare that `self.lengthscales` is a trainable parameter vector. Because the element-wise division in the K method uses the vector lengthscale, the computation will be successful as `lengthscales` is used in its original shape and the `params` property correctly reports the vector. This version functions correctly during optimization.

To prevent these issues, it is critical to ensure that the shapes of parameters manipulated within `K` and `K_diag` remain consistent with what is declared in the kernel’s `params` property. Specifically, when performing element-wise multiplications or reshaping parameters used in the kernel's calculations, one must ensure that:

1.  The `params` property accurately reflects the expected shape of the underlying parameter.
2. The kernel computations maintain the expected shape of parameters throughout.

Debugging this issue involves inspecting the kernel’s computational graph using tools such as `tf.print`. This debugging technique allows you to examine how parameters are transformed and used within the K methods and to detect any shape discrepancies. Furthermore, explicitly tracking the shape of intermediate tensors within the `K` method using `tf.shape` is beneficial in pinpointing where deviations occur.

For developers working extensively with custom kernels in GPflow, I would highly recommend delving deeper into the library's internal structure, particularly the documentation surrounding parameter handling and gradient computation. Additionally, reviewing the source code for existing kernels provides valuable insight into best practices for constructing custom kernel classes. Understanding the use of `tf.Variable` and `tf.Tensor` objects is crucial, as is a firm grasp on how these objects interact with GPflow’s parameter management system. Finally, being very careful in declaring your kernel parameters in the `params` method and using those parameters in the correct way in your kernel methods `K` and `K_diag` is very important.
