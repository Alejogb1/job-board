The core challenge in isolating words containing a specific character within a larger string lies in the precise definition of "word."  My experience working on natural language processing pipelines has shown that naive string splitting often fails to account for punctuation and variations in word delimiters.  A robust solution requires careful consideration of these nuances.  Therefore, I will present a method that leverages regular expressions for accurate word boundary detection, coupled with efficient string manipulation techniques.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The algorithm proceeds in three stages. First, a regular expression is used to identify all words within the input string.  This expression should account for punctuation and potential variations in word separators. Second, each extracted word is checked for the presence of the target character. Finally, words containing the target character are printed.  This approach guarantees accuracy and avoids the pitfalls of simple string splitting.

The crucial element is the regular expression used for word extraction. A well-crafted regular expression can handle various scenarios, including hyphenated words, apostrophes within words (e.g., "can't"), and different punctuation marks surrounding words.  A simplistic approach relying only on spaces as delimiters would be inadequate for handling the complexity of natural language.  The choice of regex depends on the specific requirements concerning what constitutes a "word" in your context.  However, a robust starting point would be a regular expression designed to match one or more alphanumeric characters, allowing for apostrophes within the word.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Implementation (Python)**

```python
import re

def print_words_with_char(text, target_char):
    """Prints words containing a specific character from a given text.

    Args:
        text: The input string.
        target_char: The character to search for.
    """
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w*[\'\w]*\b', text.lower()) # Find all words, handling apostrophes
    for word in words:
        if target_char in word:
            print(word)

# Example usage
text = "This is a sample string, with several words.  It's a test!"
target_character = 's'
print_words_with_char(text, target_character)
```

**Commentary:** This example uses `re.findall()` to extract all words using a regular expression that handles apostrophes. The `\b` matches word boundaries, ensuring accurate word separation.  The `\w*[\'\w]*\w*` pattern matches one or more alphanumeric characters, optionally including an apostrophe within the word. The `lower()` method converts the input string to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.


**Example 2:  Handling Multiple Target Characters (Java)**

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class WordFinder {

    public static void printWordsWithChars(String text, String targetChars) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\b\\w*['\\w]*\\b"); //Word boundary handling and apostrophes
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text.toLowerCase());

        while (matcher.find()) {
            String word = matcher.group();
            for (char c : targetChars.toCharArray()) {
                if (word.indexOf(c) != -1) {
                    System.out.println(word);
                    break; //Avoid printing the same word multiple times if it contains multiple target characters
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "This is a sample string, with several words. It's a test!";
        String targetChars = "st"; //Searching for 's' or 't'
        printWordsWithChars(text, targetChars);
    }
}
```

**Commentary:** This Java example demonstrates handling multiple target characters.  The `targetChars` string allows for flexible specification of characters to search for.  The code iterates through each extracted word and checks against every character in `targetChars`. The `indexOf()` method efficiently checks for character presence, and a `break` statement prevents redundant printing if a word contains multiple target characters.


**Example 3:  Customizable Word Definition (C#)**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class WordPrinter
{
    public static void PrintWordsWithCharacter(string text, char targetChar, string wordPattern)
    {
        MatchCollection matches = Regex.Matches(text.ToLower(), wordPattern);
        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            if (match.Value.Contains(targetChar))
            {
                Console.WriteLine(match.Value);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string text = "This-is a sample string, with several words. It's a test!";
        char targetChar = 's';
        //Customizable word pattern allows for hyphens within words.
        string wordPattern = @"\b[\w-]+\b"; 
        PrintWordsWithCharacter(text, targetChar, wordPattern);
    }
}
```

**Commentary:** This C# example highlights the customizability of the word definition.  Instead of a fixed regex, the `wordPattern` parameter allows users to specify their own regular expression for defining "word" boundaries. This adaptability is crucial when dealing with diverse text formats or specific linguistic requirements. The example demonstrates using a pattern that allows hyphens within words, adapting to a different word definition.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of regular expressions, I would recommend consulting a comprehensive guide dedicated to the topic.  Mastering regular expressions is crucial for any text processing task.  Furthermore, a good text on string manipulation techniques in your chosen programming language will prove beneficial. Finally, studying the documentation for your chosen language's regular expression library will clarify nuances and advanced features.  These resources, combined with practical experience, will solidify your proficiency in handling this type of problem effectively.
