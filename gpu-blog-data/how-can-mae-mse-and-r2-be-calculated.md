Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) are fundamental evaluation metrics for regression tasks, and their calculation with a Deep Neural Network Regressor (DNNRegressor) within the TensorFlow framework requires understanding the model's output and the available utility functions. In my experience, the process involves predicting outputs using a trained model, comparing these against the true values, and then using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow's own metrics to compute the desired scores. These metrics provide crucial insights into the model’s performance. I’ve often encountered situations where the choice between MAE and MSE profoundly impacts model selection, and R² offers a view of variance explained by the model.

Let's detail how to calculate these metrics systematically. Initially, you will have your training and evaluation data split. The DNNRegressor will be trained on the training data and subsequently used to predict values for the test set. This prediction process yields output values, which are then compared with the actual target variables using the metrics we are discussing.

**1. MAE Calculation:**

Mean Absolute Error measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without regard to their direction. Mathematically, it's the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It's less sensitive to outliers than MSE because it doesn't square the errors.

*   **Implementation:** We can utilize `sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error` or `tensorflow.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error`. The former requires NumPy arrays or pandas Series, while the latter works within TensorFlow graphs or eager execution. When using the TensorFlow metric, you need to explicitly extract the numerical value from the result as it returns a tensor.

*   **Code Example:**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Sample Data
    X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a simple model for demonstration
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

    # Make Predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test).flatten()

    # Scikit-learn approach
    mae_sklearn = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Scikit-learn MAE: {mae_sklearn}")

    # TensorFlow approach
    mae_tf = tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"TensorFlow MAE: {mae_tf.numpy()}")
    ```
    This code snippet demonstrates both approaches. We generate synthetic data, define a basic neural network, make predictions, and subsequently compute the MAE using both Scikit-learn and Tensorflow's respective modules. The `.flatten()` method is used to ensure the predicted values are of one dimension, suitable for comparison with the ground truth. `mae_tf.numpy()` converts the tensor result from the TF metric to a numerical value. I regularly use both methods, finding Scikit-learn’s implementation simpler for direct analysis with NumPy, while TensorFlow’s is more seamless within its execution paradigm.

**2. MSE Calculation:**

Mean Squared Error measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. Squaring the errors penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it more sensitive to outliers compared to MAE. It is also a differentiable loss function, suitable for use during model optimization.

*   **Implementation:** Similar to MAE, you can use `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error` or `tensorflow.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error`. The former processes NumPy arrays and pandas Series, while the latter operates within TensorFlow's execution environment and output tensors rather than numerical values directly.

*   **Code Example:**

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Sample Data
    X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a simple model for demonstration
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

    # Make Predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test).flatten()

    # Scikit-learn approach
    mse_sklearn = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Scikit-learn MSE: {mse_sklearn}")

    # TensorFlow approach
    mse_tf = tf.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"TensorFlow MSE: {mse_tf.numpy()}")
    ```
    This example is analogous to the MAE calculation, demonstrating the parallel use of Scikit-learn's and TensorFlow's functions. Again, `flatten()` converts predicted values to an appropriate format, and `.numpy()` extracts the numeric output from the TensorFlow tensor. I routinely examine both metrics, choosing based on the need to penalize outliers more severely or not.

**3. R² Calculation:**

R-squared, or the coefficient of determination, assesses the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model fit. Values near one signify that the model captures most of the variability in the data, while lower values indicate a poorer fit. It should be used with caution, since it may be over sensitive to the amount of variables present.

*   **Implementation:** We commonly use `sklearn.metrics.r2_score`. There's no direct equivalent in TensorFlow's `metrics` module for direct calculation. As such, the output of the DNNRegressor must be provided in the format acceptable to Scikit-learn.

*   **Code Example:**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Sample Data
    X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create a simple model for demonstration
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

    # Make Predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test).flatten()

    # Scikit-learn approach
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
    ```
    The code snippet demonstrates calculating R² using Scikit-learn. The predicted and actual target values are passed directly to the `r2_score` function, which then computes the R-squared value. I find R² useful to comprehend how much of the variance is explained by the regression model, when used along side other relevant metrics.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration of these concepts, I recommend referencing materials available through the following channels.  First, consider the official documentation for Scikit-learn, which thoroughly explains each metric and provides code examples. For a detailed understanding of metrics within the Tensorflow ecosystem, refer to the Tensorflow API documentation, which clarifies how TensorFlow functions operate within its computation graph. Furthermore, standard textbooks in the area of machine learning generally include dedicated chapters on regression evaluation, explaining the theoretical underpinnings of MAE, MSE, and R².
Finally, I often consult statistical resources to deepen my understanding of variance and data dispersion, providing a more comprehensive context for R².
In summary, calculating MAE, MSE, and R² for a DNNRegressor involves a straightforward process of obtaining predictions and then using either Scikit-learn's or TensorFlow's libraries for computation. Each metric gives insights into the model’s performance, influencing the choice among different models and hyperparameters.
