Efficiently computing partial sums within a GPU kernel necessitates a nuanced understanding of memory access patterns and parallel reduction techniques.  My experience optimizing large-scale scientific simulations has underscored the critical role of minimizing global memory accesses, a bottleneck often encountered when naively implementing partial sum calculations on GPUs.  Directly summing elements across threads without a structured approach leads to significant performance degradation, particularly with larger datasets.  Therefore, the optimal strategy involves hierarchical reduction, leveraging shared memory to aggregate intermediate results before writing to global memory.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental challenge in GPU partial sum computation stems from the inherently parallel nature of GPUs.  While each thread can independently process a subset of the input data, efficiently combining these partial results requires careful consideration. A naive approach, where each thread writes its partial sum to global memory and then a separate kernel performs the final summation, suffers from severe memory contention and bandwidth limitations.  The solution lies in exploiting the hierarchical structure of GPU architectures.

Hierarchical reduction employs a multi-stage process.  Initially, threads within a thread block cooperate using shared memory to compute a block-wise partial sum.  Each block then contributes its final sum to global memory. Finally, a small number of threads (often a single thread in a single block) then perform the final summation of the block-wise results. This strategy significantly reduces global memory traffic, the primary source of performance bottlenecks in this context.  This approach is particularly effective because shared memory offers significantly higher bandwidth and lower latency compared to global memory.

The number of stages in the hierarchical reduction is determined by the block size and the number of elements in the input array. For instance, with a block size of 256 threads and an array size that is a multiple of 256, a single level of reduction within each block, followed by a final summation across blocks, will suffice. However, for larger datasets requiring multiple reduction stages within each block, the algorithm needs to be carefully designed to handle the recursive nature of the summation. This may involve iterative passes within a single kernel, carefully managing shared memory usage.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Partial Sum with Shared Memory (Single Block)**

This example demonstrates a basic partial sum calculation within a single block, assuming the input array size is smaller than the block size. It avoids the complexity of multi-stage reduction, focusing on the core concept of utilizing shared memory.

```cuda
__global__ void partialSumKernel(const float* input, float* output, int N) {
    __shared__ float sharedData[256]; // Shared memory for partial sums

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = input[i];
    } else {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = 0.0f; // Pad with zeros if necessary
    }
    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads have written to shared memory

    for (int s = 1; s < blockDim.x; s *= 2) {
        int index = 2 * s * threadIdx.x;
        if (index + s < blockDim.x) {
            sharedData[index] += sharedData[index + s];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sharedData[0];
    }
}
```

**Commentary:** This kernel uses a binary reduction within shared memory.  The `__syncthreads()` call is crucial to ensure data consistency between threads within the reduction loop.  The final result of each block is written to the `output` array in global memory.  This is only efficient for smaller datasets fitting within a single block.

**Example 2:  Two-Stage Hierarchical Reduction**

This example extends the previous one by handling larger datasets that require multiple reduction stages.  It incorporates a two-stage reduction: an initial reduction within each block, followed by a final reduction across blocks.

```cuda
__global__ void hierarchicalPartialSumKernel(const float* input, float* output, int N) {
    // ... (Similar shared memory allocation as Example 1) ...

    // ... (Initial reduction within block as in Example 1) ...

    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        atomicAdd(output + blockIdx.x, sharedData[0]); // Atomic add to avoid race conditions
    }
}

// Second Kernel for Final Reduction (Single Block)
__global__ void finalReductionKernel(const float* input, float* output, int numBlocks) {
  // ... (reduction similar to Example 1, but across numBlocks) ...

}
```

**Commentary:**  The `atomicAdd` function is essential to prevent race conditions when multiple blocks try to update the same global memory location. This example requires two kernels; the first performs the block-wise reduction, and the second kernel sums the block sums.  This demonstrates a more robust and scalable approach for larger datasets.

**Example 3:  Using Thrust Library (for comparison)**

Thrust provides high-level abstractions for parallel algorithms.  While not a direct kernel implementation, it offers a convenient way to compute partial sums and serves as a useful comparison point for performance analysis.

```cuda
#include <thrust/reduce.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>

// ... (Input data initialization) ...

thrust::device_vector<float> d_input(input, input + N);
float sum = thrust::reduce(d_input.begin(), d_input.end(), 0.0f, thrust::plus<float>());

// ... (Output sum) ...
```

**Commentary:**  Thrust handles the complexities of parallel reduction implicitly.  This simplifies development but often yields slightly less optimal performance than carefully hand-tuned kernels, especially for specialized scenarios.  Using Thrust provides a good baseline for comparison against custom kernel performance.
