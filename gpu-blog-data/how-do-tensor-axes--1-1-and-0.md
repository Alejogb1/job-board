The behavior of NumPy's `expand_dims` function, and its implicit use in broadcasting operations, hinges critically on the interaction between the specified axis and the existing shape of the array.  Axis -1 refers to the last axis, 0 to the first, and 1 to the second, and their impact on expansion varies depending on the array's dimensionality.  Over the years, working extensively with high-dimensional data in scientific computing, I've encountered numerous instances where a precise understanding of axis specification in expansion was crucial for efficient and correct code execution. Misunderstanding this aspect can lead to subtle, difficult-to-debug errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NumPy arrays are inherently multi-dimensional.  Each dimension is represented by an axis.  When we talk about axis `-1`, we're referring to the last axis of the array, regardless of the array's total number of dimensions. Similarly, axis `0` refers to the first (outermost) axis, and `1` refers to the second axis.  `expand_dims` adds a new axis of size 1 at the specified position. This newly added dimension affects how broadcasting interacts with the array in subsequent operations.

Broadcasting, a fundamental aspect of NumPy's array operations, allows arithmetic operations between arrays of differing shapes under certain conditions.  Crucially, these conditions involve matching the dimensions of the arrays or the presence of a size-1 dimension that is implicitly expanded to match the size of its counterpart. `expand_dims` is frequently used to manipulate the shape of an array to satisfy broadcasting requirements.  Failure to correctly utilize `expand_dims` with the appropriate axis often leads to `ValueError` exceptions related to incompatible array shapes.

Expanding along axis `-1` adds a new dimension at the end.  Expanding along axis `0` adds a new dimension at the beginning. Expanding along axis `1` adds a dimension after the first dimension. The choice of axis directly determines the position of the new dimension within the resulting array's shape.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Expanding a 1D array**

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Shape: (3,)

a_axis_0 = np.expand_dims(a, axis=0)  # Shape: (1, 3) - New axis added at the beginning
a_axis_1 = np.expand_dims(a, axis=1)  # Shape: (3, 1) - New axis added after the first dimension
a_axis_neg1 = np.expand_dims(a, axis=-1) # Shape: (3, 1) - New axis added at the end (equivalent to axis=1 in this case)

print(f"Original array shape: {a.shape}")
print(f"Axis 0 expansion: {a_axis_0.shape}")
print(f"Axis 1 expansion: {a_axis_1.shape}")
print(f"Axis -1 expansion: {a_axis_neg1.shape}")
```

This demonstrates how `expand_dims` adds a new axis at different positions. Note the equivalence of `axis=-1` and `axis=1` for a 1D array.


**Example 2: Expanding a 2D array**

```python
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape: (2, 2)

b_axis_0 = np.expand_dims(b, axis=0)  # Shape: (1, 2, 2) - New axis at beginning
b_axis_1 = np.expand_dims(b, axis=1)  # Shape: (2, 1, 2) - New axis after the first dimension
b_axis_2 = np.expand_dims(b, axis=2)  # Shape: (2, 2, 1) - New axis at the end
b_axis_neg1 = np.expand_dims(b, axis=-1) # Shape: (2, 2, 1) - Equivalent to axis=2

print(f"Original array shape: {b.shape}")
print(f"Axis 0 expansion: {b_axis_0.shape}")
print(f"Axis 1 expansion: {b_axis_1.shape}")
print(f"Axis 2 expansion: {b_axis_2.shape}")
print(f"Axis -1 expansion: {b_axis_neg1.shape}")
```

This example showcases the behavior with a 2D array.  Notice how the position of the new dimension changes with the specified axis.  The negative indexing provides a flexible way to specify the axis relative to the end.


**Example 3:  Broadcasting with expand_dims**

```python
c = np.array([5, 6])  # Shape: (2,)
d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) # Shape: (2, 2)

# Direct addition would fail due to shape mismatch
# print(c + d)  # This line will raise a ValueError

# Correct broadcasting using expand_dims
c_expanded = np.expand_dims(c, axis=0)  # Shape: (1, 2)
result = c_expanded + d  # Shape: (2, 2) - Broadcasting works now

print(f"Result of broadcasting: \n{result}")
```

Here, `expand_dims` is used to enable broadcasting. The original addition would fail because of incompatible shapes. By adding a new axis to `c`, broadcasting rules allow the addition to proceed element-wise, resulting in a correctly sized output array.  This illustrates the practical application of `expand_dims` in facilitating array operations.  Incorrect axis selection here would again lead to broadcasting errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation for detailed explanations of array manipulation functions and broadcasting rules.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra concepts, particularly matrix operations and tensor manipulations, will significantly aid in grasping these concepts.  Reviewing tutorials on array broadcasting and shape manipulation within the context of scientific computing or machine learning will provide practical examples and reinforce understanding.  Finally, working through a series of progressively complex exercises involving array manipulation is invaluable for solidifying the knowledge.
