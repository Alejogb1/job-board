Stable Baselines, in its original form, is not directly compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.  This stems from its reliance on TensorFlow 1.x APIs and the significant architectural changes introduced in the TensorFlow 2.0 release, particularly the removal of the `tf.compat.v1` namespace and the emphasis on eager execution.  My experience porting several reinforcement learning agents from a Stable Baselines 1.x based production environment to a TensorFlow 2.x framework highlights the challenges involved.  The incompatibility isn't simply a matter of importing a different library; it necessitates a more substantial restructuring of the codebase.

**1. Explanation of Incompatibility and Migration Strategies:**

The core issue lies in Stable Baselines' heavy use of TensorFlow 1.x's computational graph paradigm.  TensorFlow 2.0 prioritizes eager execution, where operations are performed immediately, rather than compiled into a graph and executed later.  This fundamental shift necessitates rewriting significant portions of the Stable Baselines code to adapt to the new execution model.  Furthermore, many of the TensorFlow 1.x functions and classes Stable Baselines depended upon have been either deprecated or entirely removed in TensorFlow 2.0.  Attempting a direct import will lead to numerous errors and runtime exceptions.

Several strategies can mitigate this incompatibility.  The most straightforward, yet potentially labor-intensive, approach is a complete rewrite or significant refactoring of the Stable Baselines code to utilize TensorFlow 2.0 APIs directly. This entails replacing TensorFlow 1.x functions with their TensorFlow 2.0 counterparts, adapting the code to leverage eager execution, and potentially restructuring the agent's architecture for better compatibility with the new framework.

A less demanding but arguably less elegant solution involves utilizing the `tf.compat.v1` namespace within TensorFlow 2.0.  This allows for running TensorFlow 1.x code within a TensorFlow 2.0 environment.  However, I strongly advise against this for long-term maintenance and performance reasons.  The `tf.compat.v1` namespace is essentially a compatibility layer, and it's not optimized for the new TensorFlow architecture.  Reliance on this approach often leads to performance bottlenecks and future maintainability issues.  Moreover, it limits the potential to leverage the performance improvements and features available in TensorFlow 2.0.

Finally, migrating to a TensorFlow 2.0 compatible reinforcement learning library is a viable alternative.  Several modern libraries offer similar functionalities to Stable Baselines, built natively for TensorFlow 2.0 and often incorporating optimizations unavailable in its predecessor.  This avoids the complexities of code refactoring altogether, offering a smoother transition and access to more contemporary features and improvements.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the differences between TensorFlow 1.x code (as found in Stable Baselines) and their TensorFlow 2.0 equivalents.  Note that these are simplified examples; a real-world migration would involve much more complex code.

**Example 1:  Simple Tensor Operation**

**TensorFlow 1.x (Stable Baselines-like):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
b = tf.constant([3.0, 4.0])
c = a + b
result = sess.run(c)
print(result)
sess.close()
```

**TensorFlow 2.0:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
b = tf.constant([3.0, 4.0])
c = a + b
result = c.numpy()
print(result)
```

Commentary: The TensorFlow 2.0 version removes the session management entirely, leveraging eager execution.  The `.numpy()` method converts the TensorFlow tensor to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.


**Example 2:  Placeholder Usage**

**TensorFlow 1.x (Stable Baselines-like):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: [[1.0] * 10]})
print(result)
sess.close()
```

**TensorFlow 2.0:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable([[1.0] * 10])
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
print(y.numpy())
```

Commentary:  TensorFlow 2.0 eliminates the need for placeholders; variables are used directly and updated during eager execution. Feed dictionaries are no longer necessary.


**Example 3:  Model Building with Keras**

**TensorFlow 1.x (Illustrative, not directly from Stable Baselines, but showing the conceptual difference):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
# ... training loop using tf.compat.v1 functions ...
```

**TensorFlow 2.0:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(...) #Standard Keras compilation
# ... training loop using tf.keras.Model.fit or custom training loops ...
```

Commentary:  While Keras itself is largely compatible across TensorFlow versions, the training loop will require adaptations. TensorFlow 2.0 encourages using `model.compile()` and `model.fit()` for standard training procedures, whereas TensorFlow 1.x would often require more manual construction of the training loop using session management.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a thorough understanding of the TensorFlow 2.0 API, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  The TensorFlow 2.0 migration guide provides specific details on porting TensorFlow 1.x code.  Several online courses and tutorials offer practical guidance on using TensorFlow 2.0 for building machine learning models.  Books focused on deep reinforcement learning provide relevant context for adapting reinforcement learning algorithms to the new framework.  Finally, reviewing the source code of modern TensorFlow 2.0-compatible reinforcement learning libraries can provide valuable insights into best practices.
