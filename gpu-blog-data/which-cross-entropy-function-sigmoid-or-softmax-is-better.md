The choice between the sigmoid and softmax cross-entropy functions in object detection hinges on the nature of the prediction task.  My experience working on several large-scale object detection projects, including a real-time pedestrian detection system for autonomous vehicles and a medical image analysis pipeline for lesion identification, has shown that the optimal choice isn't universally sigmoid or softmax, but rather depends fundamentally on whether the problem is framed as multi-class, multi-label, or single-class.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Object detection models typically output bounding boxes and class probabilities.  These probabilities represent the likelihood of an object belonging to a specific class.  The critical distinction between sigmoid and softmax lies in how they handle these probabilities.

The sigmoid function operates independently on each class, producing a probability between 0 and 1 for each class. This independence is crucial for *multi-label* classification, where an object can simultaneously belong to multiple classes.  For example, an image containing a vehicle might also include a person, and a single bounding box could thus be classified as both 'vehicle' and 'person'.  Here, each class probability is computed independently; the fact that the model assigns a high probability to 'vehicle' doesn't influence the probability assigned to 'person'.

The softmax function, conversely, outputs a probability distribution over all classes.  The probabilities for all classes sum to 1, enforcing mutual exclusivity.  This is ideal for *multi-class, single-label* classification where an object can belong to only one class.  For instance, in a bird classification task, a single bird image can only be classified as one species.  The softmax ensures that the model's confidence is distributed across all classes, providing a relative measure of belonging to each class.

For *single-class* object detection, where the task simply involves detecting the presence or absence of a specific object (e.g., detecting whether a pedestrian is present in an image), the sigmoid function suffices.  The output represents the probability of the object's presence within the bounding box.

Therefore, the "better" function depends entirely on the problem definition. Incorrectly applying softmax to a multi-label problem will lead to artificially suppressed probabilities, hindering performance.  Similarly, using sigmoid for multi-class single-label scenarios would not provide a proper probabilistic interpretation, as the probabilities wouldn't sum to one.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with Python and TensorFlow/Keras examples.  These examples assume a simplified scenario, focusing on the core functionality of the loss functions.  In real-world object detectors (like Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD), the application is more intricate, involving anchor boxes and region proposal networks, but the fundamental principle of choosing the correct loss function remains the same.

**Example 1: Single-class Object Detection (Sigmoid)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Predicted probability of object presence (single class)
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.8], [0.2], [0.9]])

# Ground truth: 1 for object present, 0 for absent
y_true = tf.constant([[1], [0], [1]])

# Binary cross-entropy loss (sigmoid cross-entropy)
loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)
```

This example showcases a simple single-class object detection setup using binary cross-entropy, equivalent to sigmoid cross-entropy in this context.  The `y_pred` tensor holds the predicted probabilities of object presence, while `y_true` represents the ground truth.  The loss function calculates the discrepancy between predictions and ground truth.


**Example 2: Multi-class Single-label Classification (Softmax)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Predicted probabilities for three classes
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.7, 0.2], [0.4, 0.3, 0.3], [0.2, 0.1, 0.7]])

# Ground truth: one-hot encoded labels
y_true = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])

# Categorical cross-entropy loss (softmax cross-entropy)
loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)
```

Here, `y_pred` contains the softmax-normalized probabilities for three classes.  `y_true` utilizes one-hot encoding to represent the ground truth class labels.  Categorical cross-entropy, implicitly using softmax, calculates the loss. Note that the probabilities across classes for each example sum to one.


**Example 3: Multi-label Object Detection (Sigmoid)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Predicted probabilities for three classes (multi-label)
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.8, 0.6, 0.3], [0.2, 0.1, 0.9], [0.9, 0.7, 0.2]])

# Ground truth: binary labels for each class
y_true = tf.constant([[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

# Binary cross-entropy loss for each class (sigmoid cross-entropy)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred), axis=-1)
print(loss)
```

This example extends the multi-label concept.  Each bounding box can now belong to multiple classes.   `y_true` is a binary matrix representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of each class in the respective bounding boxes.  The loss is computed independently for each class and then averaged.  The `axis=-1` argument ensures averaging across classes for each datapoint.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I strongly suggest consulting advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on computer vision and object detection.  A comprehensive study of the mathematical foundations of cross-entropy and its variants, within the context of maximum likelihood estimation, is essential. Furthermore, reviewing the source code of established object detection frameworks would provide invaluable practical insight.  Lastly, delve into research papers that empirically compare different loss functions in object detection settings. These resources will provide a more thorough grasp of the intricacies and nuances of loss function selection in object detection.
