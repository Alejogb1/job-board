The core challenge in implementing a masked Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in Keras lies in efficiently handling the mask during the loss calculation to prevent masked elements from contributing to the gradient computation.  My experience developing robust anomaly detection models highlighted the crucial role of selective weighting, particularly when dealing with variable-length sequences or datasets with missing values.  Failing to correctly implement masking can lead to inaccurate gradients and, consequently, suboptimal model performance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Standard MSE loss calculates the average squared difference between predicted and target values.  In scenarios where certain values are irrelevant or missing, these values should not influence the loss.  A mask, typically a binary array of the same shape as the target data, addresses this.  Elements with a value of 1 in the mask contribute to the loss; elements with 0 are ignored.  Naively multiplying the MSE difference with the mask element-wise before averaging would result in division by zero if the mask contains all zeros. Therefore, a more robust approach involves calculating the loss only on the masked elements and then normalizing by the number of unmasked elements.

Implementing this in Keras requires careful consideration of how to integrate the masking operation within the custom loss function. We cannot directly use the Keras `mse` loss function as it doesn't support masking.  Instead, a custom loss function must be created, leveraging TensorFlow or NumPy operations for efficient computation.  The key steps involve:

* **Element-wise multiplication:** Multiply the squared differences between predictions and targets with the mask.
* **Summation:** Sum the resulting masked squared differences.
* **Normalization:** Divide the sum by the number of unmasked elements.  This ensures a proper average even with varying numbers of masked elements.
* **Gradient calculation:** TensorFlow's automatic differentiation seamlessly handles the gradient calculations for the operations within the custom loss function.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using TensorFlow operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def masked_mse_tf(y_true, y_pred):
    mask = tf.cast(tf.not_equal(y_true, 0), tf.float32) # Assuming 0 represents masked values
    masked_diff = (y_true - y_pred) * mask
    masked_mse = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(masked_diff)) / tf.reduce_sum(mask)
    return masked_mse

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0, 6.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8, 0.1], [3.9, 0.2, 6.3]])
loss = masked_mse_tf(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)

```

This example leverages TensorFlow's built-in operations for efficiency. The mask is generated using `tf.not_equal`, efficiently identifying masked elements.  Crucially, the division by the sum of the mask elements ensures robust handling of varying numbers of masked values. The use of `tf.float32` ensures consistent data types for numerical stability.


**Example 2: Using NumPy for simpler masking and then converting to Tensor:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def masked_mse_np(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = y_true.numpy()
    y_pred = y_pred.numpy()
    mask = np.where(y_true != 0, 1.0, 0.0)  # NumPy's where function for masking
    masked_diff = (y_true - y_pred) * mask
    masked_mse = np.sum(masked_diff**2) / np.sum(mask)
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(masked_mse, dtype=tf.float32)

# Example usage (same as Example 1):
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 0.0], [4.0, 0.0, 6.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8, 0.1], [3.9, 0.2, 6.3]])
loss = masked_mse_np(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)

```

This approach uses NumPy for the masking and calculations, which can offer readability advantages.  The final result is converted back to a TensorFlow tensor for compatibility with the Keras model. This approach might be slightly slower than the purely TensorFlow based approach for large datasets.

**Example 3: Handling masks as a separate input:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def masked_mse_separate_mask(y_true, y_pred, mask):
    mask = tf.cast(mask, tf.float32)
    masked_diff = (y_true - y_pred) * mask
    masked_mse = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(masked_diff)) / tf.reduce_sum(mask)
    return masked_mse

#Example Usage
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.2, 1.8, 2.9], [3.9, 5.2, 6.3]])
mask = tf.constant([[1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 1.0]])
loss = masked_mse_separate_mask(y_true, y_pred, mask)
print(loss)
```
This example explicitly takes the mask as a separate input, providing greater flexibility, especially if the mask is generated dynamically or from a different source than the target variable.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on custom loss functions provides essential details.  A thorough understanding of NumPy's array operations is beneficial, especially when dealing with array manipulation and masking techniques.  Finally, revisiting the mathematical foundations of MSE loss and its properties aids in debugging and fine-tuning the implementation.  Understanding automatic differentiation is also crucial for correctly implementing custom loss functions within the TensorFlow/Keras framework.
