Automatic differentiation (AD) isn't strictly numerical or exact; it occupies a nuanced space between the two.  My experience implementing AD engines for high-frequency trading applications revealed this crucial distinction: AD leverages the exact rules of calculus, but its practical implementation necessitates numerical computation, leading to inherent limitations in precision.  Therefore, characterizing AD as solely "numerical" is an oversimplification, while claiming it's "exact" ignores the realities of floating-point arithmetic.

The core of AD lies in the application of the chain rule of calculus.  Given a function composed of elementary operations, AD systematically applies the chain rule to compute the derivative of the composite function. This is achieved through a computational graph representing the function's structure.  This graph explicitly details the sequence of operations and their dependencies, allowing for efficient derivative calculation.  The process is fundamentally exact in its theoretical foundation â€“ it's a direct algorithmic translation of the mathematical rules governing differentiation.

However, the devil is in the details of execution.  The computation itself takes place within the constraints of a computer's finite-precision floating-point representation. This introduces round-off errors at each computational step. While the chain rule itself remains theoretically exact, the numerical representation of intermediate values and the accumulation of these rounding errors ultimately impact the accuracy of the computed derivative.  The magnitude of this error depends on factors like the complexity of the function, the number of operations, the specific floating-point representation used, and the algorithms employed for summation and multiplication.  The effects can be subtle yet significant in sensitive calculations.

This explains why the term "exact" in the context of AD is somewhat misleading.  The computed derivative is an approximation derived from an exact process applied to approximate numerical values.  The difference between the true analytical derivative and the AD-computed derivative is a direct consequence of numerical limitations.  This is critically different from numerical differentiation methods such as finite differences, which inherently approximate the derivative using function evaluations at discrete points, introducing a truncation error independent of the floating-point representation.

Let's illustrate this with code examples. These examples are simplified for clarity but capture the essence of the issue.  I've used Python with NumPy for these demonstrations, drawing upon my past experience with similar projects involving optimization problems in portfolio allocation.

**Example 1: Forward-mode AD**

```python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
  return x**3 + 2*x**2 - x + 1

def forward_ad(f, x, h=1e-6): #h represents a small perturbation
    df_dx = (f(x + h) - f(x))/h
    return df_dx

x = 2.0
analytical_derivative = 3*x**2 + 4*x -1
ad_derivative = forward_ad(f,x)

print(f"Analytical derivative at x = {x}: {analytical_derivative}")
print(f"Forward AD derivative at x = {x}: {ad_derivative}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(analytical_derivative - ad_derivative)}")

```

This example demonstrates forward-mode AD, a simple yet illustrative method.  It relies on a finite difference approximation, making it inherently numerical.  Notice the difference between the analytical and approximated derivative; this difference highlights the numerical inaccuracy.  Reducing `h` improves accuracy but also increases the effect of rounding errors due to subtractive cancellation.


**Example 2: Reverse-mode AD (using a library)**

```python
import autograd.numpy as np
from autograd import grad

def f(x):
    return np.sin(x) * np.exp(x)

grad_f = grad(f)
x = 1.0
analytical_derivative = np.cos(x)*np.exp(x) + np.sin(x)*np.exp(x)
ad_derivative = grad_f(x)

print(f"Analytical derivative at x = {x}: {analytical_derivative}")
print(f"Reverse-mode AD derivative at x = {x}: {ad_derivative}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(analytical_derivative - ad_derivative)}")
```

Here, we leverage `autograd`, a widely used Python library. Reverse-mode AD (also known as backpropagation) is generally more efficient for functions with many inputs and few outputs.  While more sophisticated, it still suffers from the same numerical limitations as forward-mode AD.  The difference, though often smaller, again underscores the inherent numerical nature.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Accumulation of Errors**

```python
import numpy as np

def complex_function(x):
    return np.sin(np.exp(np.cos(x**2 + 2*x) ))

# ... (Assume a forward or reverse mode AD implementation is available,  call it 'ad_derivative_of') ...

x = 1.0
ad_derivative = ad_derivative_of(complex_function, x)
# ... (Analytical derivative calculation omitted for brevity; computationally intensive) ...

#Compare AD Result with highly precise numerical method (e.g., high precision arithmetic library) if available.
#The difference would reveal the error accumulation.
```

This example, though incomplete concerning the analytical derivative calculation, aims to illustrate the accumulating nature of numerical errors. The more complex the function, the greater the potential for error accumulation across numerous operations within the computational graph.  Employing libraries offering higher precision arithmetic can provide a more accurate benchmark for comparing against the AD result, showing the extent of the accumulated error.


In conclusion, while automatic differentiation's core algorithm derives from the exact rules of calculus, its practical implementation relies on numerical computations with inherent floating-point limitations.  Consequently, referring to AD as solely "numerical" or "exact" is an oversimplification.  It's a powerful technique for computing derivatives, offering substantial advantages over finite difference methods for many applications. However, practitioners must remain cognizant of the numerical inaccuracies that can arise, especially in complex functions or when high precision is paramount.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for interpreting the results and choosing the appropriate techniques for handling potential errors.
