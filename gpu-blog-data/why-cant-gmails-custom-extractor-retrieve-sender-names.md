Gmail's custom extraction feature, often employed through Apps Script, is primarily designed to parse specific data points within email bodies or headers, not consistently reliable for extracting sender *names* as they are presented to the user. The challenge stems from the fact that the ‘From’ header, while containing sender information, does not store it in a user-friendly display name format, but rather as an email address, or a structured email address and name pair; the display name part is often inconsistently formatted or absent. The Gmail interface displays a user-friendly name, but this name is often retrieved from the user's local contact list, from the Google Workspace user directory, or from other cached sources, not directly from the email headers alone. Consequently, a script extracting directly from the header will likely fail, hence the user's perception that it cannot retrieve the sender name.

The core issue lies in the ambiguity and the multiple sources from which a sender’s display name is generated, and how these do not always translate into consistent, directly parsable data within email headers. I've encountered this problem numerous times while developing reporting tools for shared team inboxes. My initial scripts often failed precisely because I assumed the display name was directly accessible within the ‘From’ header. The reality is far more nuanced.

Specifically, when an email is sent, the ‘From’ field in the RFC 5322 header standard, that Gmail’s scripting API accesses, can be in several forms. First, the simplest case is just the email address, such as `sender@example.com`. In this instance, there is no name at all. Gmail infers the display name, if it shows one, by looking up the address in local contacts or other sources. Second, it can be in a form like `"Sender Name" <sender@example.com>`, where there is an explicit display name before the email address inside angle brackets. However, even this isn’t reliable, due to encoding inconsistencies or incorrect formatting when email systems create headers. Third, some systems might use non-standard formats or lack a display name entirely, relying on the receiving client to infer or retrieve one. These inconsistencies make it incredibly difficult to create a reliable script that works for all cases, particularly when the display name includes non-ASCII characters or commas. What is crucial to understand is that Gmail, on the client-side, performs sophisticated logic to synthesize or retrieve display names; this logic is not readily replicated in the Apps Script environment, which provides a relatively raw view of the email headers. The scripting environment thus only offers the ‘From’ header’s raw contents, not the user-presented display name.

Therefore, a script that naively attempts to extract the string between quotes, or attempts to use regular expressions to handle various email address formats, will likely fail for a large subset of emails. Further complicating this issue, there is no reliable direct API call to extract the display name as seen in the user interface, emphasizing the limitations of the Apps Script environment in accessing user-interface rendered data.

Here are three code snippets, along with commentary, illustrating this problem and potential, albeit incomplete, workarounds.

**Example 1: Basic Attempt with Simple String Manipulation**

```javascript
function extractSenderNameBasic(message) {
  var fromHeader = message.getHeader('From');
  if (!fromHeader) return null;

  // Attempt to extract name enclosed in quotes, this approach is unreliable.
  var nameMatch = fromHeader[0].match(/"([^"]*)"/);
  if (nameMatch && nameMatch[1]) {
     return nameMatch[1];
  }

  // Fallback to return full header if no match found, will return email in this case.
  return fromHeader[0];
}

function testFunction() {
  var threads = GmailApp.search('in:inbox is:unread', 0, 1);
  if (threads.length > 0){
    var messages = threads[0].getMessages();
    messages.forEach(message => {
     var extractedName = extractSenderNameBasic(message)
     Logger.log("Extracted name: "+ extractedName);
    });
  }
}
```

*   **Commentary:** This simple function uses a regular expression to attempt extraction if the name is quoted. While this will work for email headers formatted as `"Name" <email@address.com>`, it fails if the name is not quoted, or if the 'From' field consists solely of the email address. The fallback returns the complete 'From' header, which often includes the email address. It's a good starting point for understanding the problem, but not a solution. The test function just picks up the most recent unread email from the inbox and processes it. This is a simplistic approach, and will fail to be robust.

**Example 2: Slightly More Robust Parsing with Multiple Regexes**

```javascript
function extractSenderNameRegex(message) {
  var fromHeader = message.getHeader('From');
  if (!fromHeader) return null;
  var fromValue = fromHeader[0];

  // Check for quoted name
  var quotedMatch = fromValue.match(/"([^"]*)"/);
  if (quotedMatch && quotedMatch[1]) {
    return quotedMatch[1].trim();
  }

   // Check for name followed by email in angle brackets, removing email part
    var bracketMatch = fromValue.match(/^([^<]+) <[^>]+>$/);
    if (bracketMatch && bracketMatch[1]) {
      return bracketMatch[1].trim();
    }

  // If both fail return the header
  return fromValue;
}

function testFunction() {
  var threads = GmailApp.search('in:inbox is:unread', 0, 1);
  if (threads.length > 0){
    var messages = threads[0].getMessages();
    messages.forEach(message => {
     var extractedName = extractSenderNameRegex(message)
     Logger.log("Extracted name: "+ extractedName);
    });
  }
}
```

*   **Commentary:** This example attempts to improve the extraction by adding a second regular expression to catch names preceding email addresses enclosed in angle brackets. Although it's more robust than the previous example, handling cases where the email address alone appears as the ‘From’ header is still an issue. Moreover, this is vulnerable to more complex formats or incorrectly formatted headers. The `trim()` function is included to remove extraneous spaces, indicating practical problems that need to be handled, but this doesn't resolve the core issue with display name availability.

**Example 3: Attempt at Name Resolution via Contacts**

```javascript
function extractSenderNameContacts(message) {
 var fromHeader = message.getHeader('From');
  if (!fromHeader) return null;
  var fromValue = fromHeader[0];


 var emailMatch = fromValue.match(/<([^>]+)>|([^@\s]+@[^@\s]+)/);

    var email = null;

    if(emailMatch){
     email = emailMatch[1] || emailMatch[2]
    }

 if(!email){
    return fromValue;
 }

  var contact = ContactsApp.getContact(email);
    if(contact){
      return contact.getFullName() || email;
    }

    return fromValue;

}

function testFunction() {
  var threads = GmailApp.search('in:inbox is:unread', 0, 1);
  if (threads.length > 0){
    var messages = threads[0].getMessages();
    messages.forEach(message => {
     var extractedName = extractSenderNameContacts(message)
     Logger.log("Extracted name: "+ extractedName);
    });
  }
}
```

*   **Commentary:** This snippet now tries to resolve a contact name by extracting the email address from the 'From' header. If a contact is found using `ContactsApp.getContact(email)`, then we return the full name, failing which the email address. While an improvement, this method has key limitations: it only retrieves names for senders already in the user's contact list. New contacts or those not in contact lists will not have their names extracted. This illustrates a core point: Gmail is doing much more in the UI than just extracting from headers; it leverages contacts, Google Workspace directories, and other services to generate names for presentation. It’s not a simple matter of getting the right string from the header itself.

In summary, the Gmail custom extractor, based on Apps Script, fails to reliably retrieve sender names because the information needed to display names as in the Gmail UI is not consistently available in raw email headers.  The display name presented by Gmail is the result of additional processing and context not accessible through standard Apps Script methods. No single regex or direct extraction is a complete solution. Attempting contact lookups is an option, but relies on local information.

For further reading, I would recommend reviewing the official Google Apps Script documentation, particularly the sections on Gmail service and header retrieval.  Furthermore, a review of the RFC 5322 standard on Internet Message Format will provide a strong foundation for the structure of email headers and the limitations of this information for display purposes.  Finally, exploration of contact management APIs within Google Workspace will shed light on the sources of data that contribute to the display name presented in Gmail's user interface. These resources will aid in comprehending the limitations of the information available and inform decisions on the practicality of implementing a reliable sender name extraction process.
