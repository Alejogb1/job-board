The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in Keras model predictions after saving and loading almost invariably stems from inconsistencies between the model's architecture and the weights loaded into it.  My experience debugging similar issues over the years, primarily involving large-scale image classification and time-series forecasting, points to three main culprits: data type mismatch during serialization, unintended changes in layer configurations, and issues with custom layer implementations.  Let's examine each of these points in detail.

**1. Data Type Mismatch During Serialization:**

Keras, particularly when utilizing the HDF5 format (`.h5`) for model saving, is sensitive to the data types used for weights and biases.  During the saving process, the data types are serialized along with the model architecture.  However, if the system loading the model uses a different architecture, or a different version of TensorFlow/Keras with different default data types, this can lead to type coercion errors. For instance, a 32-bit floating-point weight might be loaded as a 16-bit float, resulting in information loss and the subsequent generation of NaNs during computations.  This is exacerbated when dealing with custom loss functions or metrics that implicitly rely on specific data types.

**2. Unintended Changes in Layer Configurations:**

Subtle discrepancies between the saved model's architecture and the loaded model's architecture can manifest as NaN predictions. Even a minor change, such as a differing activation function, the addition or removal of a regularization technique (e.g., dropout, batch normalization), or a slight alteration in the number of neurons in a dense layer, can disrupt the weight initialization process during loading and ultimately lead to erroneous calculations and NaNs.  Furthermore, any modification to the input shape after the model is saved can lead to a mismatch between the expected and actual input dimensions, propagating NaNs throughout the prediction pipeline.

**3. Issues with Custom Layer Implementations:**

Models incorporating custom layers pose a significant challenge. If the custom layer's implementation changes between saving and loading, inconsistencies inevitably arise.  This can stem from updating the custom layer's code without properly updating the saved model or using a different version of a custom layer's dependency. For instance, if a custom layer relies on an external library, and that library is updated or even installed differently on the loading system, the predictions might encounter NaNs. This scenario requires rigorous version control of both the model and the custom layerâ€™s codebase.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these issues with specific code examples.  These examples are simplified for clarity, but they demonstrate the core concepts.

**Example 1: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model training (simplified)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,), dtype='float16')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype('float32')
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype('float32')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)

# Saving the model
model.save('model_float16.h5')

# Loading the model with a different dtype
model_loaded = keras.models.load_model('model_float16.h5', compile=False)
model_loaded.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #Compile again after loading
x_test = np.random.rand(10, 10).astype('float32')
predictions = model_loaded.predict(x_test)

#Check for NaNs
if np.isnan(predictions).any():
    print("NaNs detected in predictions.")

```

This example demonstrates the risk of dtype mismatches. If the loading environment doesn't have a float16 dtype readily available,  or if it defaults to a higher precision (like float32), the prediction may produce unexpected results, including NaNs.

**Example 2:  Layer Configuration Discrepancy**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model training (simplified)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)
model.save('model_relu.h5')


# Loading the model with a changed activation function
model_loaded = keras.models.load_model('model_relu.h5', compile=False)
#Change the activation function during load
model_loaded.layers[0].activation = keras.activations.sigmoid
model_loaded.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
x_test = np.random.rand(10, 10)
predictions = model_loaded.predict(x_test)

#Check for NaNs
if np.isnan(predictions).any():
    print("NaNs detected in predictions.")

```

This highlights how modifying the activation function after loading can lead to problems.  The weights were trained with ReLU, but are now used with sigmoid, potentially causing numerical instability.

**Example 3: Custom Layer Issue**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=10, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Intentionally introduce a potential NaN source (replace with actual layer logic)
        return tf.math.divide_no_nan(inputs, tf.reduce_sum(inputs, axis=1, keepdims=True))


model = keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(units=5), keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)
model.save('model_custom.h5')

#Loading the model.  If the custom layer's logic is changed, errors may appear here.
model_loaded = keras.models.load_model('model_custom.h5', compile=False, custom_objects={'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer})
model_loaded.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
x_test = np.random.rand(10, 5)
predictions = model_loaded.predict(x_test)

#Check for NaNs
if np.isnan(predictions).any():
    print("NaNs detected in predictions.")
```

This exemplifies the complexities of custom layers.  A subtle change in the `MyCustomLayer` (not shown here, but easily imagined) could lead to NaNs, particularly if the layer involves operations prone to numerical instability.  The `custom_objects` argument is crucial for loading models with custom components.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow/Keras internals, consult the official TensorFlow documentation and the Keras documentation.  Studying numerical stability in deep learning algorithms will also be beneficial.  Furthermore, exploring best practices for serialization and deserialization in Python will greatly enhance your ability to troubleshoot similar issues.
