No, a `try` block does not inherently prevent `await` from functioning correctly. The confusion likely arises from a misunderstanding of how asynchronous operations and exception handling interact, particularly within the context of promises. My experience debugging numerous Node.js backends over the past several years reinforces that `await` within a `try` block operates as designed, suspending execution until the awaited promise resolves or rejects. The `try` block's primary function is to catch exceptions, including those originating from rejected promises, which are treated as exceptions in asynchronous JavaScript. If the `await` is working correctly, it will suspend the function execution until the awaited promise has settled and, if it rejects, propagate that rejection into a catch block in case you define one, otherwise, crash your system. If the function is not asynchronous, you will probably get an error.

Let me clarify the behavior with some specific examples and delve into why certain scenarios might lead one to believe that `try`/`catch` interferes with `await` execution.

The core mechanism of `await` is to pause the execution of the asynchronous function until the promise it's waiting on settles, meaning it either resolves with a value or rejects with a reason. When used inside a `try` block, `await` still performs its task of waiting for the promise. If the promise resolves successfully, the execution continues normally within the `try` block. If, on the other hand, the promise rejects, the control flow immediately jumps to the nearest `catch` block associated with that `try`, provided there is one defined. The important takeaway here is that the `try` block itself is not the source of any interruption or change in how `await` normally functions. The issue is that an exception is thrown when the promise is rejected.

The confusion arises mainly from the expectations around error handling. Some developers mistakenly believe `try`/`catch` prevents asynchronous errors that originate from a rejected promise. This is not accurate. When using `await`, a rejected promise *becomes* an exception that the `try` block is designed to handle. Failure to have proper `catch` blocks associated to your asynchronous calls will lead to uncaught errors that would crash the application.

Consider the following illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Successful Asynchronous Operation**

```javascript
async function fetchDataSuccessfully() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    return null; // Or handle the error as necessary
  }
}

fetchDataSuccessfully();
```

*Commentary:*

In this example, `fetchDataSuccessfully` demonstrates a typical asynchronous operation. The `await` within the `try` block pauses execution while the `fetch` request is being processed, waiting for the promise to be resolved. If `fetch` returns a successful response, `response.ok` checks if we received the status code we expect and then we wait for the promise that the JSON conversion is resolved. If all of that works, the data is logged. If either of these processes fail, the promise will reject which will throw an exception. This exception, within our `try` block, is caught by the `catch` block. The function is able to successfully log the fetched data and return the data.

**Example 2: Asynchronous Operation with a Rejected Promise**

```javascript
async function fetchDataWithError() {
  try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/nonexistentendpoint'); // Example URL that should fail
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
      }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
      return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      return null; // Or handle the error as necessary
  }
}

fetchDataWithError();
```

*Commentary:*

In this example, I intentionally used an endpoint that is likely to fail. The `fetch` function will return a promise that resolves to a response object or reject with an error. If the server rejects the request because the resource was not found, for example, then the promise will be rejected. This is caught by the `try` block and we are able to log and handle the exception. If no catch block is declared, the program will crash because of uncaught exception. This demonstrates that the `try` block does not block the `await` from working but rather allows us to handle potential errors. `Await` waits for the promise to settle.

**Example 3: Incorrectly Handling Errors Outside of Try/Catch**

```javascript
async function fetchDataOutside() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); // potential issue
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
  }
    const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Data:', data);
  return data;
}

fetchDataOutside()
    .catch(error => console.error("Error from outside: ", error))

```

*Commentary:*

Here, we are executing the exact same code as our first example but we do not have the try/catch block. If the `fetch` promise is rejected, the function execution will stop and, if we do not have a catch declared as above, the program will crash. The catch declared in this example will catch all errors stemming from the execution of `fetchDataOutside`. The function can continue to perform asynchronous operations as expected, but you have to explicitly catch the errors that might occur.

The notion of `try`/`catch` interfering with `await` often stems from confusion around which block is handling the exception. If an asynchronous function using `await` is not wrapped in a `try`/`catch` or the caller of the async function is not handling its exceptions, any rejected promise, which results in an exception, will result in an uncaught error. The `try` block doesn't prevent `await` from waiting; it simply provides a mechanism for gracefully handling errors that arise *after* the `await`ed promise settles to its rejection state. The error handling has to be explicitly implemented.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring resources such as the official JavaScript documentation on promises and async/await. Also, articles about error handling in asynchronous JavaScript can prove valuable. Learning about promise lifecycle and the process of resolving and rejecting would enhance any developer's understanding of how `await` behaves within the context of `try` blocks. You should also consult resources that detail the use of `Promise.all`, `Promise.any`, and `Promise.allSettled`, as those can help manage exceptions with multiple asynchronous operations at the same time. Finally, a deep dive into debugging techniques using your browser or Node.js will help you trace program execution and catch these subtle errors.
