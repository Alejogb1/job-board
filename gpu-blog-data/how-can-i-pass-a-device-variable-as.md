Passing `__device__` variables directly as arguments to CUDA kernels is fundamentally impossible.  This stems from the inherent architecture of CUDA:  kernel execution occurs on the device, while kernel launches originate on the host.  A `__device__` variable resides solely in the device's memory space;  the host lacks direct access or a pointer to manipulate it. Attempts to pass such variables will result in compilation errors.  This restriction arises from the need for data transfer management and the separation of host and device memory spaces.  My experience debugging numerous CUDA applications has repeatedly underscored the critical importance of understanding this limitation.

To effectively utilize data within a CUDA kernel that's conceptually similar to a `__device__` variable, several strategies exist, each with its own performance implications. The optimal choice depends heavily on data size, access patterns, and overall application design.

**1. Passing data through global memory:**

This is the most common and generally preferred approach, particularly for larger datasets.  Data is allocated on the device's global memory using `cudaMalloc()`, copied from the host using `cudaMemcpy()`, and then passed to the kernel as a pointer.  After kernel execution, the results are copied back to the host if necessary. This approach offers flexibility and scalability but introduces the overhead of data transfers.

Here's an example demonstrating this technique:

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel(int *data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    data[i] *= 2; // Example operation on the data
  }
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024;
  int *h_data, *d_data;

  // Allocate memory on the host
  h_data = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    h_data[i] = i;
  }

  // Allocate memory on the device
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(int));

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch the kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, size);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Verify results
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    printf("%d ", h_data[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");

  // Free memory
  free(h_data);
  cudaFree(d_data);
  return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the basic workflow: host allocation, device allocation, host-to-device copy, kernel launch using a pointer to device memory, and device-to-host copy for result retrieval. The `data` argument within the kernel is a pointer to the memory allocated on the device.


**2. Utilizing Shared Memory:**

For smaller datasets with frequent access, shared memory provides a significant performance boost. Shared memory is on-chip memory, much faster than global memory. However, it's limited in size and is shared among threads within a block. Data needs to be copied into shared memory before kernel execution.  This approach is particularly effective for data reused within a single block.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernelShared(int *data, int size) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256]; // Assuming block size of 256
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < size) {
    sharedData[tid] = data[i]; // Copy from global to shared
    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads have copied data

    sharedData[tid] *= 2; // Operation in shared memory

    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads have completed operation

    data[i] = sharedData[tid]; // Copy back to global memory
  }
}

// ... (main function similar to previous example, but using kernelShared) ...
```

In this example, `sharedData` is a shared memory array. `__syncthreads()` ensures that all threads within a block complete a memory operation before proceeding.  Note that the size of `sharedData` should be adjusted according to the block size.


**3. Texture Memory:**

For read-only data with specific access patterns, texture memory can be advantageous.  It's optimized for read operations and can provide better performance than global memory for certain scenarios, such as image processing or look-up tables.  However, writes are not permitted.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_texture_types.h>

texture<int, 1, cudaReadModeElementType> tex; // Declare texture object

__global__ void kernelTexture(int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    int value = tex1Dfetch(tex, i); // Fetch from texture memory
    // ... process value ...
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (allocate and copy data to d_data as before) ...

  // Bind texture to device memory
  cudaBindTextureToArray(tex, d_data, size * sizeof(int));

  // ... (kernel launch using kernelTexture) ...

  // ... (unbind texture memory) ...
  cudaUnbindTexture(tex);

  // ... (rest of the main function) ...

}
```

This illustrates texture memory usage. The data is bound to the texture using `cudaBindTextureToArray()`, and then accessed via `tex1Dfetch()` within the kernel.  Remember to unbind the texture when finished.  The setup requires specific texture declarations and binding.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I'd suggest consulting the CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive CUDA textbook for a detailed understanding of memory management and optimization techniques.  Furthermore, studying examples provided in the CUDA samples directory will aid in grasping the practical application of these concepts.  Carefully reviewing error messages during compilation and execution is crucial for efficient debugging.  Profiling tools can help identify performance bottlenecks related to data transfer and memory access patterns.  Thoroughly understanding the different memory spaces within the CUDA architecture is fundamental for writing efficient and correct CUDA code.
