The core issue when encountering "Inputs to a layer should be tensors" errors within a TensorFlow pipeline involving `tf.data.Dataset` and windowing operations typically stems from an incorrect interpretation of the output structure generated by the windowing and subsequent transformations. Specifically, the layers in a TensorFlow model expect tensor inputs, and if a `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline returns a structure other than a tensor (or a tuple/dictionary of tensors), these errors will arise during model training or evaluation.

Let's examine this in detail, drawing from experiences where I've encountered this issue in the past, particularly during a project involving time series prediction using recurrent neural networks. The `tf.data.Dataset` API offers powerful features for efficient data loading, preprocessing, and pipelining. Windowing, for instance, allows you to create sequences of data from a time series, preparing it for sequence-based models. However, if the resulting dataset is not properly formatted to deliver tensors directly, you’ll encounter this error.

The problem generally manifests after applying methods like `window()` or `batch()` followed by transformations that might inadvertently introduce nested structures. When you use `window()` it creates a nested dataset, containing several sub-datasets of smaller windows. Each window is still a dataset, not a tensor. When you try to feed this directly into a layer, TensorFlow complains, as it expects a tensor, not a dataset. We need to explicitly extract the data using further operations. Often the subsequent steps don't resolve this properly. For example, if you use `batch()` after a windowing function, it’s likely that you’ll get a nested structure of tensors, not a single tensor. This is also true when doing something like mapping with a function that creates another nested Dataset.

To be concrete, consider this simplified scenario. We want to take a time series and create sequences of a specified length. First, I'll define a synthetic dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

time_series = tf.range(100, dtype=tf.float32)
window_size = 10
stride = 2

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(time_series)
dataset = dataset.window(window_size, shift=stride, drop_remainder=True)
```

At this stage, `dataset` is a windowed dataset, with each window still being a `Dataset`. If you tried to feed this to a model it would immediately fail. The fix is to either `batch` or `map` and `unbatch` each window.

Here is an example demonstrating the problematic scenario, followed by its resolution:

**Example 1: Incorrect usage - nested datasets**

```python
# Incorrect usage
dataset_bad = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(time_series)
dataset_bad = dataset_bad.window(window_size, shift=stride, drop_remainder=True)

# Attempting to batch, which produces a nested structure
dataset_bad = dataset_bad.batch(1)

# Attempting to iterate over this dataset will reveal the error
try:
    for x in dataset_bad.take(1):
        print(x) # This shows the nested dataset structure
        # Attempting to use this directly will fail.
        #model_output = model(x)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This will show the 'Inputs to a layer...' error.
```

In this code, I intentionally create the scenario where the `dataset_bad` remains a nested structure even after the `.batch(1)` call. The output demonstrates that the batch function hasn't collected the window into a single tensor. This is where the "Inputs to a layer should be tensors" error would occur, if I were attempting to feed it to a model. The error arises because TensorFlow layers expect a tensor or a batch of tensors as input. They can not consume a nested `tf.data.Dataset`. The error message is telling us that what we fed to the model is not a tensor.

To remedy this, you must apply a batch operation directly on each window individually. I achieve this through mapping a lambda that batches each window to a tensor directly using the `.batch(window_size)` method on each individual window before the overall `batch(1)` call.

**Example 2: Correct Usage with map and batch**

```python
# Correct Usage
dataset_good = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(time_series)
dataset_good = dataset_good.window(window_size, shift=stride, drop_remainder=True)
dataset_good = dataset_good.map(lambda window: window.batch(window_size))
dataset_good = dataset_good.batch(1).unbatch() # Unbatch to remove the dimension of size 1.

# Demonstrating that this dataset outputs tensors
for x in dataset_good.take(1):
   print(x) # This will show a single tensor with shape (10,)

```

In this version, the key lies in the line using `.map(lambda window: window.batch(window_size))`. Here, I map a function that batches each sub-window using its own `.batch()` function. This turns each window (which was a Dataset) into a tensor, which we then collect into a single dataset with the `.batch(1)`. Then I use `unbatch()` to remove the superfluous dimension from the batch of size 1. This process ensures each element of the dataset is now a rank-1 tensor, which a neural network layer can accept.

Another common approach uses `flat_map` to explicitly map each window using a `batch` to a flattened tensor structure, avoiding the nesting. This approach can offer performance advantages, as it generates the final tensor as part of dataset preparation.

**Example 3: Correct usage with flat_map**

```python
dataset_flat = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(time_series)
dataset_flat = dataset_flat.window(window_size, shift=stride, drop_remainder=True)

def window_to_tensor(window):
    return window.batch(window_size)

dataset_flat = dataset_flat.flat_map(window_to_tensor)

# Demonstrating that this dataset outputs tensors
for x in dataset_flat.take(1):
   print(x) # This will show a single tensor with shape (10,)
```

In this final example, I have used `flat_map`. Similar to the `.map` example, `flat_map` allows us to manipulate each window into the right format. The important part is that it automatically flattens any nested output, meaning we don’t need to use the `.batch(1).unbatch()` step. `flat_map` essentially acts as both a map and a flattened output.

By understanding that the fundamental issue arises from feeding non-tensor data structures to model layers, one can avoid this common trap. Always thoroughly verify the output structure of `tf.data.Dataset` pipelines after windowing and other transformations to ensure that they produce tensors, or tuples or dictionaries of tensors, suitable for model inputs. Using the correct combination of `map`, `flat_map` and `batch` is critical for processing a windowed dataset, otherwise you'll continue to receive the 'Inputs to a layer should be tensors' error.

For further study on this particular problem and related topics I would recommend the following resources: The official TensorFlow documentation provides very clear explanations of the `tf.data` API, its core principles, and the various functions involved in data processing. Look specifically at the guides on creating datasets and on best practices for using the api. Also, for understanding performance implications look into best practices for creating data input pipelines. There are also numerous excellent tutorials from TensorFlow and the broader community that specifically walk through the use of `tf.data` for time series forecasting with deep learning.
