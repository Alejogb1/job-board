The primary reason weights fail to update in a PyTorch dual network often stems from a mismatch between the optimizer's parameters and the network's structure, specifically concerning how the parameters are registered for optimization.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on reinforcement learning agents employing dual networks for value function approximation, particularly when dealing with shared and distinct parameter sets across the two networks.  Incorrectly specifying the parameters passed to the optimizer is a frequent culprit, often leading to seemingly frozen weights.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A dual network, in the context of machine learning, typically comprises two distinct networks—often a "critic" and an "actor" in reinforcement learning—or two specialized networks collaborating on a task.  These networks may share some parameters or have entirely separate parameter sets. The core problem arises when the optimizer, responsible for updating network weights based on calculated gradients, does not correctly identify all the parameters requiring adjustment.  This can occur due to several factors:

* **Incorrect parameter grouping:**  If parameters are improperly grouped or nested within modules that aren't correctly registered with the optimizer, the optimizer might simply ignore them during the update step. This is especially relevant when dealing with nested modules, custom layers, or when using techniques like parameter sharing.

* **Incorrect `requires_grad` flags:** Every parameter in PyTorch that needs gradient calculation must have its `requires_grad` attribute set to `True`.  If this flag is accidentally set to `False`, the autograd engine won't track gradients for that parameter, resulting in no weight updates.  This is a common mistake when modifying existing networks or implementing custom layers.

* **Gradient masking or zeroing:**  In some scenarios, gradients might be explicitly masked or set to zero before the optimizer update step. This could happen unintentionally due to a bug in the backward pass or intentionally through gradient clipping techniques implemented incorrectly.  If the gradients for a specific parameter are consistently zero, no updates will occur.

* **Optimizer state issues:** Less frequently, the issue might lie within the optimizer's internal state. This is usually linked to bugs in the custom optimizer implementation or unexpected interactions between the optimizer and the network.

* **Data issues:** While less likely to directly affect weight updates, problematic data (e.g., constant input features, labels with zero variance) can lead to gradients close to zero, resulting in negligible weight changes. This should be addressed by examining the input data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Parameter Grouping**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class DualNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DualNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.shared_layer = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.critic_layer = nn.Linear(5, 1)
        self.actor_layer = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.shared_layer(x)
        critic_output = self.critic_layer(x)
        actor_output = self.actor_layer(x)
        return critic_output, actor_output

#INCORRECT: Only optimizes shared layer
network = DualNetwork()
optimizer = optim.Adam([{'params': network.shared_layer.parameters()}], lr=0.01)

#CORRECT: Optimizes all parameters
network = DualNetwork()
optimizer = optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=0.01)


# ... training loop ...
```

This example demonstrates the crucial aspect of parameter grouping.  The incorrect version only optimizes the `shared_layer`, leaving the `critic_layer` and `actor_layer` weights untouched.  The correct version uses `network.parameters()`, automatically capturing all parameters within the `DualNetwork` for optimization.

**Example 2: `requires_grad` Misconfiguration**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5, 5))
        self.weight.requires_grad = False #<-- This line causes the problem

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight)


network = nn.Sequential(CustomLayer(), nn.Linear(5,1))
optimizer = optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# ...training loop...
```

Here, the `requires_grad` flag is explicitly set to `False` for the weight in `CustomLayer`.  This prevents the autograd system from computing gradients for that parameter, leading to no updates despite being included in the optimizer.  Removing `self.weight.requires_grad = False` would resolve the issue.


**Example 3: Gradient Masking (Accidental)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

network = nn.Linear(10, 5)
optimizer = optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# ... forward pass and loss calculation ...

#INCORRECT: Accidentally zeros out gradients before optimizer step
network.zero_grad()
gradients = torch.autograd.grad(loss, network.parameters()) #gradients are calculated here!
for p, g in zip(network.parameters(), gradients):
    p.grad.data.zero_() #<-- Here gradients are zeroed before being used by the optimizer!

optimizer.step()
```

This example shows how unintentionally zeroing gradients after calculating them can prevent weight updates. The `p.grad.data.zero_()` line should be moved before the `gradients` calculation to clear existing gradients, not after. The line is problematic because it zeros the gradients *after* they have been calculated by `torch.autograd.grad`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections on autograd, optimizers, and modules, should be thoroughly reviewed.  Furthermore, I recommend consulting advanced PyTorch tutorials and books focusing on building and training complex neural network architectures.  Familiarizing oneself with debugging techniques within PyTorch, including using the debugger and carefully examining gradient values, is crucial.  Finally, understanding the mechanics of backpropagation and gradient descent is foundational for troubleshooting such problems.
