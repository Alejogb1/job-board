TensorFlow 2.4.0's CUDA and cuDNN compatibility isn't straightforwardly defined in a single, readily accessible compatibility matrix.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, particularly those involving large-scale image processing pipelines with TensorFlow, has shown that the relationship is more nuanced than simply specifying matching version numbers. It's heavily dependent on the underlying operating system, the specific TensorFlow build (pip-installed versus a custom build), and even the presence of other libraries within the environment.  This necessitates a more investigative approach to determine suitable CUDA and cuDNN versions.

The core issue lies in the dynamic nature of deep learning library development.  While TensorFlow aims for backward compatibility,  subtle changes in CUDA and cuDNN APIs can introduce breaking changes or, more subtly, performance regressions.  Therefore, blindly using the *latest* CUDA and cuDNN versions with TensorFlow 2.4.0 is not guaranteed to yield the best results; it might even lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

My methodology for determining compatibility, honed over years of development, focuses on establishing a baseline and then iteratively validating functionality.  I begin by consulting the TensorFlow 2.4.0 release notes and any associated documentation specifically mentioning CUDA and cuDNN.  While these often lack precise version specifications, they usually provide guidance on the *range* of supported versions, often highlighting minimum requirements or mentioning known incompatibilities with specific releases.  This step is crucial as it avoids unnecessary experimentation with versions that are known to be problematic.

Next, I would leverage the build system's ability to report dependency conflicts. This generally involves building TensorFlow from source (although this is less common now due to the robust pip installation method) or examining the detailed error messages that arise from installation attempts with incompatible versions.  Careful analysis of these logs reveals the specific incompatibility, guiding the selection of appropriate versions.


**Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how I would approach the problem practically.  These are simplified representations for clarity;  real-world projects would require more comprehensive error handling and logging.


**Example 1:  Verifying CUDA Availability (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("CUDA is available:", tf.test.is_built_with_cuda())
print("CuDNN is available:", tf.test.is_built_with_cudnn())

if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda():
    print("CUDA version:", tf.test.gpu_device_name()) #This provides the device name which often implicitly contains CUDA version information.
    try:
        # Attempt to execute a simple CUDA operation to further confirm functionality.
        with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
            a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32)
            b = tf.constant([3.0, 4.0], dtype=tf.float32)
            c = a + b
            print(c.numpy())
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print("CUDA operation failed:", e)
else:
    print("CUDA not detected")
```

This snippet serves as a fundamental sanity check.  It verifies if TensorFlow was indeed built with CUDA and cuDNN support. The attempt to execute a simple addition on the GPU helps to identify more subtle problems beyond simple library presence.  Errors at this stage point to underlying installation flaws or outright incompatibility.


**Example 2:  Checking CUDA and cuDNN Versions (Bash)**

```bash
# Assuming nvidia-smi is installed
nvidia-smi

# Checking CUDA version (method varies depending on installation)
nvcc --version

# Checking cuDNN version (requires navigating to the cuDNN installation directory)
# This usually involves finding a version file or inspecting library properties
# Example (replace path with your actual cuDNN installation):
ls /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+'
```

This example utilizes system-level commands to retrieve the actual versions of CUDA and cuDNN installed on the system.   This is essential for documenting the environment and comparing against TensorFlow's requirements or known compatibility ranges. This step would be followed by a rigorous testing procedure described later.


**Example 3:  Compile-Time Verification (CMake)**

This example illustrates how one would verify compatibility during the *build* process of a TensorFlow application or custom operator (this is a more advanced scenario):

```cmake
# Within a CMakeLists.txt file

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)
find_package(cudnn REQUIRED)

# Check CUDA version against minimum requirement (replace with your minimum)
if(CUDA_VERSION VERSION_LESS 11.2)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "CUDA version ${CUDA_VERSION} is too low. Minimum required version is 11.2")
endif()

#Check cuDNN version against minimum requirement (replace with your minimum)
if(CUDNN_VERSION VERSION_LESS 8.1)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "cuDNN version ${CUDNN_VERSION} is too low. Minimum required version is 8.1")
endif()

# ... rest of CMake configuration ...
```

This approach ensures that the build process halts if the detected CUDA and cuDNN versions do not meet the pre-defined minimum requirements. This is a powerful strategy to prevent building against unsupported versions from the outset.


**Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation for your specific version. Pay close attention to the installation instructions and any warnings or limitations stated.  Review the CUDA and cuDNN documentation to understand their release cycles and potential backward compatibility issues. Finally, actively monitor forums and community support channels related to TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN for reports of compatibility problems or successful configurations similar to your setup.  Thorough testing and iterative experimentation are essential given the dynamic nature of these technologies.
