The core challenge in efficiently employing `thrust::transform_reduce` without an implicit inclusive scan lies in carefully structuring the transformation and reduction operations to avoid the computational overhead and potential synchronization bottlenecks inherent in scan-based approaches.  My experience optimizing parallel algorithms in CUDA for large-scale scientific simulations highlighted this precisely.  Efficiently handling this requires a deep understanding of the underlying execution model and careful design of the functor used within the `transform_reduce` operation.

**1. Clear Explanation**

`thrust::transform_reduce` applies a user-defined functor to each element of an input range and then reduces the results using a binary operation.  Implicitly, if the reduction operation is not associative and commutative,  an inclusive scan (prefix sum) is often necessary to guarantee a correct result. This scan introduces significant overhead, especially for large arrays. The key to avoiding it is to design the transformation and reduction such that the final result is directly obtainable without needing intermediate accumulation through a scan.  This usually necessitates a reformulation of the original problem.

For example, if the goal is to calculate a sum of squares, a naive approach might involve a separate transformation to square each element, followed by a sum reduction.  This implicitly involves a scan.  A more efficient approach would be to combine squaring and summation within a single custom functor, thereby bypassing the intermediate step and the need for a scan.

Another scenario where scan avoidance is crucial involves computations where the output of a transformation on one element depends on the transformation of another, but not in a prefix sum manner. Forcing a scan would impose an incorrect order of operations. In such instances, carefully designed functors and an appropriate choice of reduction operations become paramount.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Calculating the sum of squares efficiently.**

```c++
#include <thrust/transform_reduce.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/functional.h>

struct square_and_sum {
  template <typename T>
  __host__ __device__
  T operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const {
    return x + y * y; //Directly squares and sums
  }
};

int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<int> vec(1000);
  // ... Initialize vec ...

  int sum_of_squares = thrust::transform_reduce(vec.begin(), vec.end(),
                                                thrust::identity<int>(), 0,
                                                square_and_sum(), thrust::plus<int>());

  // sum_of_squares now contains the result without an implicit scan
  return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates the direct combination of squaring and summation within a single functor, `square_and_sum`. The `thrust::identity` functor is used as a placeholder for the initial transformation, allowing us to focus the transformation on the reduction operation. This avoids the intermediate step of squaring every element and then summing, eliminating the need for a scan.


**Example 2:  Calculating the maximum absolute value.**

```c++
#include <thrust/transform_reduce.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/functional.h>
#include <algorithm> // for std::abs

struct abs_max {
  template <typename T>
  __host__ __device__
  T operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const {
    return std::max(x, std::abs(y)); //Takes the absolute value and finds the max
  }
};

int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<int> vec(1000);
  // ... Initialize vec ...

  int max_abs = thrust::transform_reduce(vec.begin(), vec.end(),
                                         thrust::identity<int>(), 0,
                                         abs_max(), thrust::maximum<int>());

  // max_abs now holds the maximum absolute value.
  return 0;
}
```

Here, we directly compute the maximum absolute value without an intermediate array of absolute values.  The `abs_max` functor takes the absolute value of the current element and compares it with the running maximum, achieving the desired result in a single pass.  Again, the initial transformation is an identity to focus the operation on the reduction.


**Example 3:  Weighted average calculation.**

```c++
#include <thrust/transform_reduce.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/functional.h>

struct weighted_sum {
  const thrust::device_vector<float>& weights;
  weighted_sum(const thrust::device_vector<float>& w) : weights(w) {}

  template <typename T>
  __host__ __device__
  T operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const {
      return thrust::make_tuple(x.first + y.first * weights[y.second], x.second + 1);
  }
};

int main() {
    thrust::device_vector<float> values(1000);
    thrust::device_vector<float> weights(1000);
    // ...Initialize values and weights...

    auto result = thrust::transform_reduce(thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(values.begin(), weights.begin())),
                                            thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(values.end(), weights.end())),
                                            thrust::make_tuple(0.0f, 0),
                                            thrust::make_tuple(0.0f, 0),
                                            weighted_sum(weights),
                                            thrust::plus<thrust::tuple<float, int>>());

    float weighted_avg = thrust::get<0>(result) / thrust::get<1>(result);

    return 0;
}

```

This example showcases a more complex scenario where calculating a weighted average requires careful handling. Using `thrust::make_zip_iterator`, we pass pairs of values and weights to the custom functor `weighted_sum`.  The functor accumulates the weighted sum and the count of elements. The final result is obtained by dividing the weighted sum by the count. The use of tuples allows us to manage the intermediate weighted sum and element count within a single reduction step, again preventing the need for a scan.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

*   The Thrust library documentation.  Pay close attention to the sections on functors and the details of `transform_reduce`'s execution.
*   A comprehensive CUDA programming textbook. This will provide the foundational knowledge of parallel programming principles necessary to understand the subtleties of algorithm optimization within the CUDA context.
*   Advanced parallel algorithms texts focusing on efficient parallel reductions and scan algorithms. Understanding the limitations and computational complexity of scans is critical in designing scan-free approaches.


Through careful design of custom functors and appropriate use of `thrust::transform_reduce`, the need for implicit scans can be entirely avoided, leading to significant performance gains in many parallel computation tasks. Remember that the key is to structure your operation such that the final result is directly computed without needing intermediate accumulated values.  This requires a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithm and a willingness to creatively reformulate the problem to fit the capabilities of `thrust::transform_reduce`.
