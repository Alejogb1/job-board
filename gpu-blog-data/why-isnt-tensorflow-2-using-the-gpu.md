TensorFlow 2's failure to utilize a GPU, despite its apparent availability, stems most frequently from misconfigurations within the TensorFlow environment itself, or inconsistencies between the TensorFlow installation and the CUDA/cuDNN setup on the system.  In my experience debugging this issue across numerous projects—ranging from image classification models for medical imaging to large-scale natural language processing tasks—this has been the root cause far more often than hardware malfunctions.  Let's examine the common culprits and their resolutions.


**1.  Verification of GPU Availability and Driver Installation:**

The first, and arguably most crucial step, is confirming both the physical presence and correct driver installation for your GPU. TensorFlow relies on CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration.  Incorrect or missing drivers will prevent TensorFlow from identifying and leveraging the GPU.  I've wasted countless hours tracing obscure errors only to discover a simple driver issue.

To verify GPU availability, I typically use the `nvidia-smi` command in a terminal. This command provides detailed information about the GPUs installed in the system, including their memory usage, utilization, and driver version.  A successful execution indicating GPU presence and proper driver version is a foundational prerequisite.  Furthermore, I check the CUDA installation using the `nvcc --version` command to confirm that the CUDA compiler is installed correctly and that its version is compatible with the installed TensorFlow version.  Mismatch in versions often results in silent failure to utilize the GPU.

**2.  TensorFlow Configuration and Environment Variables:**

Improperly configured environment variables can prevent TensorFlow from correctly accessing the GPU. TensorFlow relies on environment variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to specify which GPUs it should use.  In several instances, I have encountered projects where this variable was either absent, incorrectly set, or pointed to a non-existent GPU.

I recommend explicitly setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the index of your desired GPU(s).  For example, if you have a single GPU and wish TensorFlow to utilize it, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.  If you have multiple GPUs and want to use all of them, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,...` where the numbers correspond to the GPU indices reported by `nvidia-smi`.  Failure to do this, especially on multi-GPU systems, frequently leads to TensorFlow defaulting to the CPU.  Also, ensure that the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable correctly includes the CUDA libraries directory. This is critical to allow TensorFlow to dynamically link against the CUDA libraries.

**3.  Code-level GPU Utilization Verification:**

Even with correct driver and environment variable configurations, TensorFlow might not utilize the GPU if the code itself isn't written to take advantage of it.  This frequently happens when developers inadvertently use operations not optimized for GPU execution.   While TensorFlow automatically places many operations on the GPU when possible, certain operations might still remain on the CPU, hindering performance.

**Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1:  Explicit Device Placement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Explicitly place tensors and operations on GPU:0
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
    b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print(c)

```

This example demonstrates explicit device placement.  The `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` block ensures that the tensor operations within it are executed on the GPU.  The initial check confirms GPU availability before proceeding.  This method provides maximum control over device placement.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.function` for GPU Optimization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_function(x):
    return tf.square(x)

x = tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])
result = my_function(x)
print(result)

```

The `@tf.function` decorator compiles the function into a TensorFlow graph, allowing for potential optimizations, including automatic GPU placement of suitable operations. This approach is often sufficient for leveraging GPU acceleration without explicit device placement, but requires the function’s operations to be compatible with graph execution.


**Example 3:  Checking Device Assignment During Execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(f"Tensor 'a' device: {a.device}")
print(f"Tensor 'b' device: {b.device}")
print(f"Tensor 'c' device: {c.device}")

```

This code explicitly checks the device assignment of each tensor during execution.  If any tensor resides on the CPU, it indicates that a specific operation or data transfer didn’t move to the GPU as intended.  Observing the device assignments is invaluable in pinpointing the exact location of the problem within your TensorFlow workflow.

**4.  TensorFlow Version Compatibility:**

Inconsistent versions of TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN can also prevent GPU usage.  I've seen many instances where a project used an older TensorFlow version incompatible with the newer CUDA/cuDNN drivers installed on the system.  Always refer to the official TensorFlow documentation to find compatible versions.  Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended to avoid such compatibility issues.

**5.  Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on GPU setup and troubleshooting.  Consult the TensorFlow website for detailed instructions and guidance.  Additionally, refer to the CUDA and cuDNN documentation for installation and configuration details.  Thoroughly reviewing these documents often uncovers subtle configuration errors.


By systematically checking GPU availability, environment variables, code-level GPU utilization, version compatibilities, and carefully examining the TensorFlow logs,  the cause of TensorFlow's failure to use the GPU can usually be identified and corrected.  Remember that diligent attention to detail in these areas is crucial for successful GPU utilization in TensorFlow 2 projects.
