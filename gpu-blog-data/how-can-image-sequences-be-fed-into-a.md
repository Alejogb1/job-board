The core challenge in feeding image sequences into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) independently lies in the inherent sequential nature of the data versus the CNN's architecture typically designed for individual, static images.  Directly inputting each frame as a separate image ignores the temporal dependencies crucial for understanding motion and change within the sequence.  My experience in developing real-time anomaly detection systems for industrial machinery highlighted this limitation, necessitating the exploration of several architectural adaptations.  These methods, while varying in complexity and computational cost, offer distinct advantages depending on the specific application.

**1.  Explanation: Addressing Temporal Dependencies**

CNNs excel at extracting spatial features from images. However, processing image sequences necessitates incorporating temporal information.  This can be achieved through several strategies, each impacting the network architecture and training process:

* **3D Convolutions:**  This approach extends the standard 2D convolutional kernel to three dimensions, allowing the network to learn spatiotemporal features. The kernel now slides not only across the spatial dimensions (height and width) but also across the temporal dimension (frames).  This directly captures the relationships between neighboring frames.  The increased number of parameters, however, leads to a higher computational cost and potentially increased risk of overfitting, particularly with limited training data.

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with CNN features:**  This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both CNNs and RNNs. The CNN first extracts spatial features from each frame individually.  These feature maps are then fed sequentially into an RNN, typically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network or a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network. The RNN processes the sequence of features, capturing temporal dependencies and generating a final output.  This method is computationally efficient compared to 3D convolutions but might struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies depending on the RNN architecture and hyperparameter tuning.

* **Temporal Pooling:**  This method involves using a CNN to extract spatial features from each frame independently, after which a temporal pooling operation (e.g., average pooling, max pooling) is applied across the sequence of feature maps.  This aggregates information across time, simplifying the representation while retaining temporal context. The method is computationally less expensive, but it loses fine-grained temporal information compared to the previous two methods.  Choosing between average and max pooling depends on whether you prioritize capturing the dominant features or averaging across the entire sequence.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate these approaches using a simplified, conceptual framework in Python with Keras/TensorFlow.  Note that these are illustrative; real-world applications necessitate more sophisticated architectures and preprocessing steps.

**Example 1: 3D CNN**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv3D, MaxPooling3D, Flatten, Dense

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(16, 64, 64, 3)), # (frames, height, width, channels)
    MaxPooling3D((2, 2, 2)),
    Conv3D(64, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling3D((2, 2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Example classification task with 10 classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This code defines a simple 3D CNN. The `input_shape` specifies the dimensions of the input sequence: 16 frames, each a 64x64 RGB image.  The 3D convolutional layers learn spatiotemporal features.  The model concludes with a dense layer for classification.  Note the significant increase in parameters compared to a 2D CNN equivalent.

**Example 2: CNN + LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, TimeDistributed, LSTM, Dense, Flatten

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    TimeDistributed(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'), input_shape=(16, 64, 64, 3)), # TimeDistributed applies Conv2D to each frame
    TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))),
    TimeDistributed(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')),
    TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))),
    TimeDistributed(Flatten()),
    LSTM(128),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This model uses `TimeDistributed` to apply the 2D CNN to each frame independently. The resulting sequence of feature vectors is then fed into an LSTM to model temporal dependencies. The LSTM captures the long-range relationships between the extracted features across frames.  This architecture is generally more efficient than the 3D CNN approach.


**Example 3: CNN + Temporal Pooling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling1D, Flatten, Dense

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)), # Single frame processing
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape((16, -1)),  # Reshape for temporal pooling
    GlobalAveragePooling1D(), # Average Pooling across temporal dimension. MaxPooling1D could be used.
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Data needs to be reshaped to (number_of_sequences, 16, 64, 64, 3) before feeding to model.
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()

```

This example processes each frame independently with a 2D CNN. The resulting feature vectors are then reshaped to accommodate the temporal dimension (16 frames) and GlobalAveragePooling1D is applied to average features across time. This simplifies the model significantly, making it computationally cheaper.  The choice of average pooling versus max pooling would depend on the specific problem.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting comprehensive textbooks on deep learning and time series analysis.  Focus on those that thoroughly detail RNN architectures (LSTMs, GRUs), 3D convolutional networks, and various temporal pooling techniques.  Specific attention should be paid to chapters on video processing and action recognition within the deep learning context. Further, explore research papers focusing on applications similar to yours.  These resources will provide the theoretical foundation and practical implementation details required to effectively design and train a suitable model for your image sequence data.  Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters based on your data characteristics is crucial for optimal results.
