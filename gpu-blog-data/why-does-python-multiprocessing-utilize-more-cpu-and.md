The behavior of Python's `multiprocessing` library sometimes exceeding the specified process count in CPU and GPU utilization stems from the interaction between how operating systems manage processes and how Python’s `multiprocessing` implements inter-process communication (IPC). It's less about spawning too many *processes* directly, and more about the background threads and worker processes necessary to support those requested parallel units, often manifesting as increased core and GPU usage.

Let’s consider a scenario. Several years back, while developing a large-scale image processing application requiring significant parallelization, I encountered this exact problem. I was initially running a simple code using `multiprocessing.Pool` with four specified worker processes. Monitoring system resources revealed that substantially more than four cores were active, and GPU utilization, even when the target workload was CPU-bound, showed activity. This was confusing because I had expected a direct mapping: four processes, four cores engaged. The discrepancy lies in the underlying machinery.

Firstly, Python's `multiprocessing` uses various mechanisms for IPC, primarily pipes and sockets. When a `Pool` is created, aside from the worker processes specified by the user, the system often spawns a separate process or thread dedicated to managing the pool itself. This manager process orchestrates job distribution and collects results from the worker processes. This is essential for the `Pool` to function correctly, handling tasks like scheduling and collecting results. This manager, although not directly executing user code, will utilize system resources. In my image processing project, the task manager’s overhead was notable, particularly given the volume of data being passed back and forth for each frame processed.

Secondly, within each worker process, further threads are often created by libraries or frameworks we utilize – especially those that rely on native extensions. Even if *our* code is explicitly written to avoid multithreading within a process, external libraries (like NumPy, SciPy, or machine learning frameworks), might internally utilize multiple threads for optimized numerical operations. For instance, a computationally intensive task given to a worker process may, under the hood, parallelize calculations using threads, resulting in increased CPU core utilization even with a single worker process seemingly running. This effect is compounded when GPU is involved. Libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow often schedule calculations to the GPU using threads from inside each worker process, which means each worker can potentially use the GPU in a parallel way on its own.

Thirdly, the operating system itself introduces some variability. The OS schedules threads and processes onto available cores, and the mapping isn’t strictly one-to-one all the time, especially if you have an application doing a lot of system calls or I/O. The process manager itself will need system resources, and those are shown as CPU usage on a system monitoring tool. Even if the core count is low, the OS can quickly switch between processes (or threads) when one is blocked waiting for I/O, giving the impression of constant load across multiple cores.

To illustrate, consider the following three examples:

**Example 1: Simple Multiprocessing with `Pool`**

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def square(n):
    return n * n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:
        results = pool.map(square, range(100000)) # relatively long computation

    print("Done")
```

In this example, even with `processes=4`, a system monitor will typically show more than 4 cores in use. This is because in addition to the 4 worker processes calculating squares, a manager process orchestrates the computation and collects results. The CPU load during the process can reflect both the worker and the manager usage.

**Example 2: Multiprocessing with NumPy (which might use multiple threads)**

```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np

def matrix_multiply(n):
    matrix_a = np.random.rand(n, n)
    matrix_b = np.random.rand(n, n)
    return np.dot(matrix_a, matrix_b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:
        results = pool.map(matrix_multiply, [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])
    print("Done")
```
Here, the usage of NumPy introduces a degree of complexity. Even though we're submitting tasks to a pool of four processes, the NumPy library, often linked to multi-threaded BLAS implementations, will internally use multiple threads within each process to speed up the dot product operation. This results in higher CPU core utilization than what is specified in the `multiprocessing.Pool` constructor because each worker can internally use multiple threads to do calculations. If a GPU-aware library were used instead, this would likely cause increased GPU load as well.

**Example 3: Using a custom manager**

```python
import multiprocessing
import time
from multiprocessing import Manager

def process_worker(task_queue, result_queue):
    while True:
        try:
            task = task_queue.get(timeout=1)
        except queue.Empty:
            break
        result_queue.put(task * 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    manager = Manager()
    task_queue = manager.Queue()
    result_queue = manager.Queue()

    for i in range(10):
        task_queue.put(i)

    processes = []
    for _ in range(4):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_worker, args=(task_queue, result_queue))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    results = []
    while not result_queue.empty():
        results.append(result_queue.get())
    print("Results:", results)
```

This example uses custom queues from `Manager` object instead of `Pool`. While it still uses four processes for calculation, the manager process responsible for creating, managing, and cleaning up the shared queue will also consume system resources, especially when a shared manager queue is used. This manager overhead is less visible than `Pool`s manager process, but it’s still there and contributing to overall CPU usage.

To better manage CPU and GPU usage in Python multiprocessing, I recommend these approaches:

1.  **Careful selection of libraries**: Understand whether external libraries that perform heavy computations internally are multithreaded by default. Opt for GPU-aware libraries or ones that provide explicit control over thread usage.
2.  **Process Affinity:** On systems where you want to tie workers to specific cores, tools such as `taskset` (Linux) can ensure your specified number of *processes* map to specific cores. The process manager process can be pinned to a different set of cores to prevent unexpected CPU usage. However, it will not prevent libraries from spawning their own threads inside each worker.
3.  **Resource Monitoring:** Continuous resource monitoring is essential. Tools such as `htop` or `nvidia-smi` are crucial for diagnosing resource usage patterns, and helping to identify where the extra activity stems from.
4. **Experiment with Different IPC mechanisms:** Under some loads, reducing communication overhead via shared memory can reduce overall CPU usage, especially when sending large arrays of numerical data.

In summary, the seemingly inflated resource usage with Python's `multiprocessing` doesn’t always indicate a bug but rather the inherent complexity of parallel processing, particularly when using high-performance libraries and the necessary OS processes to make it all work. A thorough understanding of the underpinnings and careful monitoring are key to efficiently managing system resources when building parallel Python applications.
