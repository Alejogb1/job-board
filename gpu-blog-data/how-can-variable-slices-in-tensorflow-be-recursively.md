TensorFlow's tensor slicing, while powerful, doesn't directly support recursive assignment in the way one might expect from languages with mutable data structures like Python lists.  My experience working on large-scale neural network architectures has highlighted this limitation, particularly when dealing with dynamically shaped tensors and complex model manipulations.  The core challenge stems from TensorFlow's reliance on computational graphs and the inherent immutability of tensors within those graphs.  A direct recursive assignment, analogous to `my_list[i] = my_list[i] + 1`, is not directly translatable.  Instead, we must leverage TensorFlow's operations to create new tensors reflecting the desired changes.

The crucial understanding is that modifying a tensor slice doesn't alter the original tensor; it produces a *new* tensor.  This new tensor must then be incorporated back into the computational graph, often requiring the use of tensor concatenation or scattering operations.  Attempting to circumvent this with `tf.assign` on a slice will result in unexpected behavior or errors, as `tf.assign` is designed for variable updates, not for modifying immutable tensor slices directly.

To illustrate, let's consider three scenarios requiring what might appear to be recursive slice assignments and how to correctly implement them in TensorFlow.


**Scenario 1: Incrementing Values within a Slice based on a Condition**

Let's say we have a tensor representing a feature map and we want to increment values in a specific slice if a corresponding condition tensor evaluates to true.  A naive approach might attempt a direct recursive assignment, which would be incorrect.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data
feature_map = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([5, 5]))
condition = tf.Variable(tf.constant([True, False, True, False, True]))

# Incorrect approach (will not work as intended)
# for i in range(5):
#     if condition[i]:
#         feature_map[i, :] += 1 # This will not update the variable

# Correct approach
incremented_slices = tf.where(condition, tf.ones([5,5]), tf.zeros([5,5]))
updated_feature_map = feature_map.assign_add(tf.cast(incremented_slices, dtype=feature_map.dtype))

#Verification
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    updated_map = sess.run(updated_feature_map)
    print(updated_map)
```

This approach avoids recursive assignment by creating `incremented_slices` that reflect the desired changes.  The addition is then performed using `assign_add`, which correctly updates the `feature_map` variable within the computational graph.  Note the explicit type casting to match the `feature_map`'s data type.  This is critical for avoiding type errors.


**Scenario 2: Recursive Summation within Nested Slices**

Imagine we have a 3D tensor representing a series of images, and we want to recursively sum values within nested slices.  Again, direct recursion is not feasible.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample 3D tensor
image_stack = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([3, 4, 4]))

# Incorrect approach (Illustrative of wrong concept, won't work)
# for i in range(3):
#   for j in range(4):
#     image_stack[i, j, :] += tf.reduce_sum(image_stack[i, j, :]) # This attempt will fail.

# Correct approach
def recursive_sum_slices(tensor):
    shape = tensor.shape
    if len(shape) == 1:
        return tf.reduce_sum(tensor)
    else:
        sums = tf.map_fn(lambda x: recursive_sum_slices(x), tensor)
        return tf.reduce_sum(sums)

total_sum = recursive_sum_slices(image_stack)
updated_stack = image_stack.assign_add(tf.tile(tf.reshape(total_sum, [1,1,1]), image_stack.shape))

#Verification
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    updated_stack_val = sess.run(updated_stack)
    print(updated_stack_val)

```

This solution uses a recursive helper function, `recursive_sum_slices`, to calculate the sum at each level. This function works correctly, because it operates on copies of slices, not directly manipulating the original tensor. The final update uses `assign_add` and `tf.tile` to efficiently add the total sum to each element.

**Scenario 3:  Updating a Slice Based on Values in Another Slice**

Consider a scenario where we need to update one slice based on computations performed on another slice of the same tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample tensor
data_tensor = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 2]))

# Incorrect approach (will be incorrect)
# data_tensor[0,:] = data_tensor[1,:] * 2 # This is an attempt which fails

# Correct approach
updated_slice = data_tensor[1,:] * 2
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(data_tensor, [[0]], tf.expand_dims(updated_slice,axis=0))
updated_variable = tf.Variable(updated_tensor) # We need to reassign to update the variable

#Verification
with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  updated_tensor_val = sess.run(updated_variable)
  print(updated_tensor_val)
```

Here, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` is employed.  This function allows for targeted updates to specific indices.  Crucially, it creates a *new* tensor with the updated values. The resulting tensor is assigned back to a new variable, because the original variable is not updated in place.  `tf.expand_dims` is used to correctly match the dimensions for the update.


In summary, recursive assignment of tensor slices in TensorFlow necessitates creating new tensors that reflect the desired modifications.  Directly modifying slices is not supported due to TensorFlow's underlying graph execution model. Using appropriate TensorFlow operations such as `tf.assign_add`, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, `tf.map_fn`, and careful consideration of data types are essential for achieving the intended results.  Understanding these concepts and mastering the relevant operations are critical for efficient and correct tensor manipulation in large-scale TensorFlow projects.
