The fundamental difference in how Caffe and TensorFlow/Keras handle model weight shapes stems from their respective design philosophies: Caffe leans towards static, explicit configurations at model definition, while TensorFlow/Keras emphasizes dynamic graph construction and implicit shape inference, at least at higher levels. This leads to noticeable distinctions in how one examines and manipulates the underlying tensor shapes representing model weights. In my experience, navigating these differences has been a key factor in porting models between these frameworks.

Caffe, primarily designed for computer vision tasks, defines models through a protocol buffer structure. This structure explicitly specifies the shapes of input and output blobs (Caffe's term for tensors) for each layer in the network. The weight shapes are inherently determined when configuring the layer parameters within the `.prototxt` file. For example, a convolutional layer's `kernel_size` and `num_output` parameters directly dictate the dimensions of the kernel weights and bias. This is a static definition â€“ the shapes are established at initialization, and if any mismatch occurs, it's usually caught during the layer setup process, typically in C++ with limited debugging flexibility once compiled. It is imperative that all dimensions are congruent, in the traditional sense of math compatibility.

TensorFlow/Keras, in contrast, operates with a more abstract level of shape management. While TensorFlow, at its core, uses statically typed tensors, Keras allows users to define models through a much simpler, often dynamically constructed, graph. Shape inference plays a significant role in many Keras models, especially sequential models. The framework attempts to deduce the output shape of a layer based on the input shape of previous layers. This abstraction simplifies model design but also implies that the precise weight shapes may not be immediately visible until the model is actually built (i.e. when it is first passed an input) or by inspecting the layer objects in code. Furthermore, while Keras manages high-level concerns, it is crucial to understand that within the Tensorflow back-end, these shapes are indeed rigorously defined. Debugging involves accessing the tensor objects themselves.

The following examples demonstrate how weight shapes are accessed and interpreted in each system.

**Example 1: Caffe**

Consider a simple Caffe convolutional layer definition within a `.prototxt` file:

```protobuf
layer {
  name: "conv1"
  type: "Convolution"
  bottom: "data"
  top: "conv1"
  convolution_param {
    num_output: 32
    kernel_size: 3
    stride: 1
    pad: 1
  }
}
```

In C++, using the Caffe API, accessing the weights would typically involve:

```cpp
#include "caffe/caffe.hpp"

// Assume a Caffe Net object 'net' is already initialized

Blob<float>* conv_weights = net->params_[0][0]; // Assuming 'conv1' is the first conv layer
Blob<float>* conv_biases = net->params_[0][1]; // Assuming biases are the second parameter

const int num_output = conv_weights->shape(0);  // 32 (number of output channels)
const int num_input = conv_weights->shape(1);  // number of input channels (determined by the 'data' layer)
const int kernel_height = conv_weights->shape(2); // 3
const int kernel_width = conv_weights->shape(3); // 3

const int bias_size = conv_biases->shape(0); // 32 (number of biases)
```
This C++ code assumes that the `net` object (the Caffe network) has been created and that the convolutional layer 'conv1' is the first one added to the network (hence the `net->params_[0]`). The `net->params_` is a vector of vectors, and the outer vector is indexed by layer. The inner vector is the parameters for the layer (weights then biases). The shapes are accessed using the `shape()` method. Notice how the number of output channels matches the num\_output parameter in the prototxt. The number of input channels in the tensor itself is not present in the prototxt, but will be based on the input of the network itself, and thus would be implicitly specified in a similar fashion, such as a data definition layer.

**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras - Sequential Model**

Using Keras, consider an equivalent convolutional layer definition within a sequential model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(28,28,3)), #Input shape for image data
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')
])

# access the weights by name or index
conv_layer = model.get_layer(index=1) # the 1st layer is the input layer, the 2nd is the conv2d
conv_weights = conv_layer.weights[0]
conv_biases = conv_layer.weights[1]

print(conv_weights.shape) # Output: (3, 3, 3, 32)
print(conv_biases.shape) # Output: (32,)
```

Here, the shape is inferred during the model building process. Keras explicitly sets an input size of 28x28x3 with the `layers.Input` specification, which enables the conv2d output to be inferred, and the kernel weights to be constructed. The weight tensors are accessible through the `weights` attribute of the layer object, and these tensors themselves have a shape attribute which allows the dimensions to be accessed, and matches the Caffe example. Notably, the `padding` parameter was set to 'same', which changes the calculations for determining output size when using certain strides. `weights[0]` accesses the kernel weights, and `weights[1]` is the bias, mirroring Caffe's order of weight and bias parameters.

**Example 3: TensorFlow/Keras - Functional Model**

Using the functional API in Keras, consider a similar convolutional layer definition:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(28,28,3))
conv_layer = layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), padding='same')(input_layer)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_layer)

# Access the weights by index
conv_layer_obj = model.get_layer(index=1)
conv_weights = conv_layer_obj.weights[0]
conv_biases = conv_layer_obj.weights[1]

print(conv_weights.shape) # Output: (3, 3, 3, 32)
print(conv_biases.shape) # Output: (32,)
```

The functional API builds a directed graph instead of a model that directly specifies ordering, and thus requires specifying input and output of the layers.  However, the resultant shape representation remains consistent with the sequential example, in that weight and bias dimensions can be accessed as a tensor object. `get_layer(index=1)` refers to the `Conv2D` layer object. The shapes are represented exactly as in the sequential example. It should be noted, that in both keras examples, the order of dimensions differs from Caffe, where Caffe would represent as (output, input, h, w) but Keras (h, w, input, output).

**Resource Recommendations**

For a detailed understanding of Caffe internals, consulting the official Caffe documentation and examining the source code directly is invaluable. It is written primarily in C++, and the source is available online. The protocol buffer definition files (typically ending in `.prototxt`) within Caffe model definitions also provide explicit shape specifications. Understanding how a `Net` object is instantiated within Caffe reveals details that are often abstracted over in other frameworks.

Regarding TensorFlow and Keras, comprehensive tutorials and guides are readily available on the TensorFlow website. The Keras API documentation, while providing an abstract view, details how layer parameters affect shape inference and explicitly outlines how weights and biases are stored internally in tensors. Examining the source code for particular layer implementations can illuminate lower-level tensor shape manipulation within the TensorFlow backend. Studying the data structures for tensors, their underlying representation and shape information, is paramount when debugging and comparing models. Furthermore, working through examples for all layer types helps develop an intuition for how shapes propagate throughout the model.

In conclusion, while both Caffe and TensorFlow/Keras represent model weights as multi-dimensional tensors, their approaches to defining, accessing, and inferring shapes differ significantly. Caffe's static, explicit model definitions contrast with Keras's dynamic, often implicit, shape management. Understanding these differences is crucial when developing and converting models between these frameworks, as the same model will have different shapes when looked at via the framework APIs. It is also important to note the data dimensionality ordering difference, where tensorflow/keras has (h, w, input, output) but Caffe has (output, input, h, w), which can lead to confusion if not kept in mind when reviewing tensor shapes.
