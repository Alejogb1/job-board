TensorFlow's inherent flexibility allows for highly granular control over the training process, extending beyond the typical whole-tensor approach.  My experience working on large-scale natural language processing models, specifically those involving multilingual translation, has shown that selective training of tensor slices is not only possible but frequently necessary for efficiency and targeted improvement.  This granular control is crucial when dealing with massive datasets and models where updating every parameter in every training step is computationally prohibitive and often counterproductive.

The core concept hinges on understanding how TensorFlow handles gradients and variable updates.  During backpropagation, gradients are computed for each element in a tensor.  By carefully selecting the slices of the tensors involved in the computation graph, we can restrict the gradient updates to those specific slices, leaving the remaining parts unchanged. This is achieved through indexing and masking techniques applied to tensors and their gradients.  This selective training avoids unnecessary computations and can lead to significant performance gains, especially in scenarios involving sparse updates or transfer learning.

**1. Explanation:**

The most straightforward approach involves creating boolean masks to identify the slices to be trained. These masks, which are tensors of the same shape as the tensors being updated, dictate which elements receive gradient updates.  Elements corresponding to `True` in the mask are updated; elements corresponding to `False` remain untouched.  This masking can be integrated directly into the gradient calculation or applied after the gradient computation.

The crucial point is that TensorFlow's automatic differentiation seamlessly handles these masked gradients.  The framework automatically propagates the zero gradients associated with the `False` elements in the mask, effectively preventing any modification of the corresponding tensor elements.  This ensures that only the selected slices are updated during the optimization process.  The efficiency gains stem from the avoidance of computations related to the non-selected elements, reducing both memory usage and computational time.  Further optimization can be achieved by using sparse tensor representations for the masks and gradients where appropriate, especially when dealing with very high-dimensional tensors and sparse updates.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic Slice Selection with Boolean Masking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sample tensor
tensor = tf.Variable([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])

# Create a boolean mask to select the first column
mask = tf.constant([[True, False, False], [True, False, False]])

# Define a simple loss function (for demonstration purposes)
loss = tf.reduce_sum(tensor * mask)

# Use tf.GradientTape to compute gradients only for selected elements
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_value = loss
gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, tensor)

# Apply gradients only to the selected elements using tf.where
updated_tensor = tf.where(mask, tensor - gradients * 0.1, tensor)  # Adjust learning rate as needed.

# Update the tensor variable
tensor.assign(updated_tensor)

print(tensor)
```

This example utilizes a simple boolean mask to select the first column for updating.  The `tf.where` function applies the gradient update only where the mask is `True`.

**Example 2:  Slice Selection using TensorFlow's slicing capabilities**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sample tensor
tensor = tf.Variable([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]])

# Select a specific slice
slice_to_train = tensor[0, :, 0] # Selects the first row from each 2x2 matrix within the main tensor

# Loss function (Illustrative)
loss = tf.reduce_sum(slice_to_train)

#Gradient calculation and update using tf.assign_sub.
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_value = loss
gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, slice_to_train)
slice_to_train.assign_sub(gradients * 0.1)

print(tensor)
```

Here, we directly select a slice using standard TensorFlow indexing. The update is directly applied to the slice. Note that this implicitly updates the original tensor as slices are references to the underlying data.  Careful consideration of the effects of in-place updates is vital here.

**Example 3:  Advanced Masking with TensorFlow operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a larger tensor
tensor = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(100, 100))

# Create a more complex mask based on tensor values
mask = tf.cast(tensor > 0.8, tf.bool) # Example:  Update elements above 0.8

#Loss Function (Illustrative)
loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.boolean_mask(tensor, mask))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_value = loss
gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, tensor)

#Apply gradients only to masked elements
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, tf.where(mask), tf.gather_nd(gradients, tf.where(mask)) * -0.1) # using tensor_scatter_nd_update for more efficiency on large sparse updates.

tensor.assign(updated_tensor)

print(tensor)
```

This demonstrates creating a mask dynamically based on tensor element values.  `tf.boolean_mask` and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` are used for efficient handling of sparse updates, showcasing a more sophisticated technique suitable for large models.  Note the negative learning rate multiplication, often used to counteract the effect of the gradient being only calculated for a portion of the tensor.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections focusing on automatic differentiation, variable manipulation, and tensor operations, are indispensable.  Furthermore, consult advanced materials on optimization algorithms and gradient-based methods within the broader field of machine learning.  A solid understanding of linear algebra and calculus is crucial for mastering this topic.  Specific publications focusing on efficient training strategies for large-scale neural networks offer additional insights.  These resources offer the theoretical background and practical implementation details required for efficient and targeted training of tensor slices.
