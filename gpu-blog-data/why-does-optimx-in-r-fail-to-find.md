Optimx's failure to converge to the correct solution in nonparametric likelihood maximization often stems from the inherent challenges posed by these problems, particularly the potential for highly irregular likelihood surfaces.  My experience working on survival analysis and spatial point process models has shown that the algorithm's sensitivity to starting values, the choice of optimization method, and the nature of the likelihood function itself significantly impact its performance.  Specifically, the absence of analytical gradients, typical in nonparametric settings, leads to reliance on numerical approximations which can be inaccurate or unstable, hindering convergence.

The difficulties are multifaceted. Firstly, nonparametric likelihoods frequently exhibit multiple local maxima.  Gradient-based methods like those implemented in optimx (BFGS, L-BFGS-B, etc.), while efficient in smooth, unimodal landscapes, can easily become trapped in suboptimal local maxima if the initial parameter guess is poorly chosen.  Secondly, the likelihood surface can be highly irregular, characterized by flat regions, sharp ridges, or discontinuities.  These features confound numerical gradient calculations and can mislead the optimizer away from the global maximum.  Thirdly, the computational cost of evaluating the nonparametric likelihood, often involving iterative procedures like kernel density estimation or smoothing splines, can substantially increase the optimization's complexity and runtime, potentially leading to premature termination due to exceeding iteration limits.

Let's illustrate this with three examples.  I've encountered these scenarios in my work developing software for analyzing complex ecological datasets.  These examples demonstrate different aspects of the difficulties encountered when employing optimx in this context.

**Example 1:  Kernel Density Estimation with Bandwidth as a Parameter**

Consider maximizing the likelihood of a univariate dataset assuming a kernel density estimate. The bandwidth, *h*, is the parameter to be optimized.  The likelihood function is given by:

```R
likelihood_kde <- function(h, data) {
  # Check for valid bandwidth (positive)
  if (h <= 0) return(-Inf)
  # Kernel density estimation using a Gaussian kernel
  kde <- density(data, bw = h, kernel = "gaussian")
  # Likelihood calculation (assuming independent and identically distributed data)
  log_likelihood <- sum(log(kde$y[match(data, kde$x)]))
  return(log_likelihood)
}
```

Using `optimx`, we might attempt maximization:

```R
library(optimx)
data <- rnorm(100) # Example data
result <- optimx(par = 1, fn = likelihood_kde, data = data, method = "BFGS", hessian = TRUE)
```

The problem here is that the likelihood surface can be relatively flat, making it challenging for BFGS to identify the optimum. Using a different method, such as Nelder-Mead, which doesn't rely on gradients, might provide a more robust solution, but at the cost of potentially slower convergence.


**Example 2:  Nonparametric Regression with Spline Smoothing**

In nonparametric regression, we might model the relationship between a response variable and a predictor using splines. The degree of smoothing, controlled by a smoothing parameter (λ), affects the likelihood. A higher λ leads to smoother fits but might underfit the data, while a lower λ might overfit, resulting in a wiggly curve that does not represent the underlying relationship effectively. The likelihood function would involve calculating the likelihood of the observed data given the fitted spline.


```R
# This requires a suitable spline fitting library (e.g., mgcv) which I will abstract here for brevity.
likelihood_spline <- function(lambda, x, y) {
  # Fit a spline model using lambda as the smoothing parameter. (This is pseudo-code)
  model <- fit_spline(x, y, lambda)
  # Calculate the likelihood of the model
  log_likelihood <- calculate_likelihood(model, x, y)
  return(log_likelihood)
}

result <- optimx(par = 1, fn = likelihood_spline, x = x_data, y = y_data, method = "Nelder-Mead")

```

The challenge here is that the likelihood surface might exhibit multiple local maxima depending on the complexity of the relationship between *x* and *y*.  Furthermore, the computational cost of fitting the spline for each iteration can be significant.  Careful consideration of the starting value and potentially the use of a global optimization method might be necessary.


**Example 3:  Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation for a Censored Survival Model**

In survival analysis with censored data, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) for the cumulative hazard function is often computed iteratively.  This involves maximizing a likelihood function that accounts for both observed and censored events.

```R
# This would involve a more complex iterative algorithm within the likelihood function, again simplified here.
likelihood_npmle <- function(hazard_rates, time, status){
  # Iteratively update hazard rates to maximize likelihood. (Pseudo-code)
  updated_hazard_rates <- iterative_npmle(hazard_rates, time, status)
  # Log likelihood given the hazard rates. (Pseudo-code)
  log_likelihood <- calculate_survival_likelihood(updated_hazard_rates, time, status)
  return(log_likelihood)
}
#  Initial hazard rates (crude approximation)
initial_hazard_rates <- rep(0.1, length(unique(time)))

result <- optimx(par = initial_hazard_rates, fn = likelihood_npmle, time = time_data, status = status_data, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = 0)
```

Here, the computational burden is substantial, and the likelihood surface might be complex and irregular. The use of a constrained optimization method like L-BFGS-B, which handles boundary constraints (hazard rates must be non-negative), is crucial.  However, even with careful consideration, the algorithm might still struggle to find the global maximum.


**Recommendations:**

To improve the chances of successful optimization with optimx in nonparametric likelihood maximization, consider the following:

1. **Explore different optimization methods:** Experiment with various algorithms offered by optimx (Nelder-Mead, simulated annealing, differential evolution) to find one suitable for the specific likelihood surface.  Gradient-free methods are often more robust for irregular surfaces.

2. **Refine starting values:** The choice of initial parameters critically affects the optimizer's trajectory.  Employ heuristic methods or informed guesses based on domain knowledge or preliminary analyses to obtain sensible starting values.

3. **Employ global optimization techniques:**  Consider using packages designed for global optimization, such as `GenSA` or `DEoptim`, especially when dealing with complex, multimodal likelihood surfaces.  These methods explore the parameter space more thoroughly than local optimization algorithms.

4. **Assess the likelihood function:** Carefully inspect the likelihood function for irregularities or discontinuities.  Consider smoothing techniques to mitigate numerical instability arising from such features.

5. **Increase iteration limits and convergence tolerances:** Optimx’s default settings might not be sufficient for complex problems.  Increase the maximum number of iterations and adjust convergence tolerance parameters to allow for a more thorough search.

6. **Utilize profiling tools:**  Profile the code to identify computational bottlenecks within the likelihood function.  Optimizations at this level can significantly reduce runtime and improve the overall efficiency of the optimization process.


Through diligent application of these strategies, and a deep understanding of the inherent challenges in nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation, one can improve the reliability of optimx and other optimization algorithms in these difficult situations.  It is crucial to remember that even with these precautions, failure to converge to the true global maximum is always a possibility in these complex optimization problems.
