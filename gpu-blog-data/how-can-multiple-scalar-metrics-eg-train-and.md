The core challenge in visualizing multiple scalar metrics within a single TensorBoard graph using PyTorch Lightning stems from the framework's inherent structure:  each metric is logged independently by default.  This necessitates a strategic approach to data aggregation before TensorBoard ingestion.  Over the course of developing a multi-modal sentiment analysis model, I encountered this precise hurdle, and the solution I developed relied on leveraging PyTorch Lightning's `logger` object and carefully structuring the logging process.  My experience highlights that direct aggregation within the training loop often proves more efficient and results in cleaner visualizations than post-processing the TensorBoard logs.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch Lightning's `Logger` functionality, typically instantiated as a `TensorBoardLogger`, handles logging scalar metrics during training. By default, each metric is logged as a separate scalar graph within TensorBoard. To consolidate these into a single graph, we need to meticulously structure how metrics are passed to the logger.  The key is to pre-aggregate metrics within the `training_step`, `validation_step`, or `test_step` methods. This aggregation can be a simple concatenation of values into a dictionary or a more complex operation, depending on the desired visualization.

Crucially, the choice of aggregation method dictates how these aggregated metrics appear in the TensorBoard graph.  For instance, simply creating a dictionary mapping metric names to their values results in separate lines within the single graph.  However, a more sophisticated approach using list comprehension or NumPy arrays facilitates aggregation of multiple data points for each metric at a given step. This allows us to view trends across different metrics in a more coherent manner, making it easier to compare and interpret their performance simultaneously.

It is essential to note that the choice of aggregation method should be informed by the type of information you want to glean from the visualisation.  For example, simple concatenation is ideal for directly comparing the progression of different metrics, while more sophisticated methods allow for calculations like moving averages or other more complex analysis.  It is crucial to choose a method that directly supports the analysis you wish to undertake.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Concatenation**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger
import torch

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... model definition ...

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # ... training logic ...
        loss = self.calculate_loss(...)
        val_acc = self.calculate_accuracy(...)

        self.log("train_loss", loss)
        self.log("val_acc", val_acc)  #Logged separately by default
        return loss

    # ... other methods ...

# Initialize the logger
logger = TensorBoardLogger("lightning_logs", name="my_experiment")

# Initialize the trainer
trainer = pl.Trainer(logger=logger, ...)

# Train the model
trainer.fit(model, ...)
```

This example uses `self.log` to record metrics independently. While basic, it demonstrates the default behavior: separate graphs in TensorBoard.  Notice that `train_loss` and `val_acc` will appear as separate entries in TensorBoard.  This showcases the problem we seek to solve.


**Example 2: Dictionary Aggregation**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger
import torch

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... model definition ...

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # ... training logic ...
        loss = self.calculate_loss(...)
        val_acc = self.calculate_accuracy(...)

        metrics = {"train_loss": loss, "val_accuracy": val_acc}
        self.log_dict(metrics)  #Aggregate into dictionary
        return loss

    # ... other methods ...

# Initialize the logger and trainer as before
# ...
```

Here, `log_dict` consolidates metrics into a single dictionary.  In TensorBoard, these will still be separate lines in a single graph, enabling direct comparison of their progression over epochs. This approach is superior to Example 1 for direct comparison.

**Example 3:  Advanced Aggregation with NumPy**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger
import torch
import numpy as np

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.epoch_metrics = []

    def training_epoch_end(self, outputs):
        epoch_losses = np.array([x['loss'] for x in outputs])
        epoch_accuracies = np.array([x['acc'] for x in outputs])

        self.log('train_loss', epoch_losses.mean(), prog_bar=True)
        self.log('train_acc', epoch_accuracies.mean(), prog_bar=True)


    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # ... training logic ...
        loss = self.calculate_loss(...)
        acc = self.calculate_accuracy(...)
        return {'loss': loss, 'acc': acc}

    # ... other methods ...


# Initialize the logger and trainer as before
# ...
```

This example uses NumPy for averaging batch metrics at the end of each epoch. This leads to a smoother visualization of the average epoch performance, reducing noise from individual batch fluctuations.  The `prog_bar=True` argument displays the metrics on the PyTorch Lightning progress bar.  This technique provides a cleaner representation focusing on epoch-level performance trends.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch Lightning documentation offers comprehensive guides on logging and the `Logger` API.  A thorough understanding of TensorBoard's functionality and visualization options is crucial.  Familiarizing oneself with NumPy's array manipulation capabilities will significantly enhance the sophistication of your aggregation strategies.  Furthermore, reviewing existing PyTorch Lightning projects on platforms such as GitHub provides valuable examples of effective logging practices.



By strategically employing PyTorch Lightning's logging capabilities and appropriate data aggregation techniques, as demonstrated in these examples, the visualization of multiple scalar metrics within a single TensorBoard graph becomes a straightforward yet powerful tool for monitoring and evaluating model performance.  The key lies in anticipating the desired analysis and selecting the appropriate aggregation method accordingly.
