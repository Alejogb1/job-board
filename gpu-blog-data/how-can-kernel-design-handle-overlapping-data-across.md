The fundamental challenge in handling overlapping data across separate warps within a kernel design lies in the inherent limitations of on-chip memory bandwidth and the need to avoid synchronization bottlenecks.  My experience optimizing CUDA kernels for high-throughput scientific simulations has underscored this repeatedly.  Efficient solutions require a deep understanding of warp scheduling, shared memory utilization, and data access patterns. Simply put, naive approaches lead to significant performance degradation due to excessive memory contention.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Warp divergence, where threads within a warp execute different instructions due to conditional branching, is a primary contributor to inefficiency.  When dealing with overlapping data – meaning the same data is accessed by multiple warps – this divergence is exacerbated.  Each warp, operating independently, may access the same memory locations concurrently, leading to significant latency as requests are serialized by the memory controller. This serialization effect dramatically reduces the benefits of parallel processing.  The core strategy in addressing this issue is to carefully orchestrate data access patterns and utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory transactions.

Shared memory, a fast on-chip memory accessible by all threads within a multiprocessor (MP), is the key to mitigating the problem.  By strategically loading overlapping data into shared memory, individual warps can access it concurrently without contention from other warps. This reduces global memory access, minimizing latency and significantly improving throughput.  However, the size of shared memory is limited; careful planning is essential to ensure efficient utilization without exceeding its capacity.  Furthermore, the data needs to be properly organized in shared memory to minimize bank conflicts, which occur when multiple threads within a warp simultaneously access different locations within the same memory bank.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Global Memory Access**

```c++
__global__ void inefficientKernel(float *data, float *result, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    float val1 = data[i];
    float val2 = data[i + 1024]; // Potential overlap with other warps
    result[i] = val1 + val2;
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates inefficient global memory access.  If multiple warps access overlapping regions of `data` (like `data[i + 1024]`), significant memory contention will occur, resulting in slow execution.  The potential for this overlap becomes higher with larger warp sizes and larger datasets.


**Example 2: Improved Performance with Shared Memory**

```c++
__global__ void efficientKernel(float *data, float *result, int N) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[TILE_SIZE]; // TILE_SIZE should be a multiple of warp size

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    // Load data into shared memory
    sharedData[tid] = data[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize before accessing shared data

    float val1 = sharedData[tid];
    float val2 = sharedData[(tid + 1024) % TILE_SIZE]; // Access within shared memory

    result[i] = val1 + val2;
  }
}
```

This improved kernel utilizes shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.  The `__syncthreads()` ensures all threads within a warp have loaded their data into shared memory before accessing it.  The modulo operation (`% TILE_SIZE`) wraps around within shared memory, enabling access to overlapping data without global memory contention. The choice of `TILE_SIZE` is crucial, balancing shared memory usage and the amount of data loaded in a single operation.  It should be carefully chosen based on the hardware specifications and problem size.


**Example 3: Handling Larger Datasets with Tiled Access**

```c++
__global__ void tiledKernel(float *data, float *result, int N) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[TILE_SIZE * TILE_SIZE];
  int bx = blockIdx.x;
  int by = blockIdx.y;
  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = threadIdx.y;

  int x = bx * TILE_SIZE + tx;
  int y = by * TILE_SIZE + ty;

  if (x < N && y < N) {
    int global_index = y * N + x;
    int shared_index = ty * TILE_SIZE + tx;

    sharedData[shared_index] = data[global_index];
    __syncthreads();

    // Perform computations using sharedData
    // ...  accessing other relevant data in sharedData ...

    result[global_index] = ...;
  }
}
```

For very large datasets, a tiled approach is necessary. This example uses 2D blocks and shared memory to efficiently process a larger data region in parallel.  Each block loads a tile of data into shared memory, enabling efficient access and minimizing global memory transactions.  The calculations then use data already present in shared memory, further reducing latency. This approach requires careful consideration of tiling strategy to optimize cache utilization and minimize the number of global memory accesses.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the NVIDIA CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive textbook on parallel computing algorithms will provide the necessary theoretical and practical background to effectively handle these challenges.  Focusing on understanding memory hierarchy, shared memory optimization, and parallel programming patterns is crucial for success.  Detailed analysis of the memory access patterns of your specific algorithm is essential for effective performance tuning.  Profiling tools, provided with the CUDA toolkit, are invaluable for identifying bottlenecks and guiding optimization efforts.  Finally, understanding the architectural specifics of the target GPU is also necessary for fine-grained optimization.
