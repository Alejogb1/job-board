The core challenge in broadcasting (256, 256, 64) and (256, 256, 3) arrays lies in the dimensionality mismatch along the channel (depth) axis.  Direct concatenation isn't feasible; NumPy's `concatenate` or similar functions require compatible shapes along all axes except the one being concatenated.  My experience working on hyperspectral image processing, specifically with multi-band satellite imagery, has frequently presented this problem.  Successfully resolving this requires understanding broadcasting rules and employing techniques to align the dimensionality before combining the data.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The broadcasting process aims to perform element-wise operations on arrays of differing shapes.  NumPy’s broadcasting rules prioritize aligning dimensions by expanding smaller arrays to match the larger ones. However, this expansion only occurs along axes with size 1. In our scenario, we have a 64-channel array and a 3-channel array.  Direct broadcasting will fail because the last dimension doesn't allow for this expansion.  Instead, we must achieve compatibility by either reshaping or utilizing advanced array manipulation techniques.  One approach is to explicitly reshape one of the arrays to match the size of the other along the channel axis.  Another, more complex but often preferable method for large arrays involves employing `numpy.stack`, which stacks arrays along a new axis, enabling subsequent reshaping.  Finally, careful consideration must be given to the intended application; the choice of method impacts performance and memory management.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Reshaping for Concatenation**

This approach is suitable when the intended operation after broadcasting is concatenation along the channel axis.  It's straightforward but less memory-efficient than other methods for very large arrays.

```python
import numpy as np

array_64 = np.random.rand(256, 256, 64)  #Example 64-channel array
array_3 = np.random.rand(256, 256, 3)    #Example 3-channel array

#Reshape the 3-channel array to add a singleton dimension
array_3_reshaped = array_3.reshape(256, 256, 3, 1)

#Tile the 3-channel array along the last axis to match the 64-channel array
array_3_tiled = np.tile(array_3_reshaped, (1,1,1,64))


# Reshape back to original 3 channels for concatenation
array_3_tiled = array_3_tiled.reshape(256,256, 192)

#Concatenate along the last axis
combined_array = np.concatenate((array_64, array_3_tiled), axis=2)

print(combined_array.shape)  # Output: (256, 256, 256)
```

This method efficiently tiles the 3-channel data across 64 channels. However, it consumes more memory compared to `np.stack`.


**Example 2: Using `np.stack` for Efficient Memory Management**

This method avoids unnecessary data duplication and is computationally efficient for large datasets.  It introduces a new axis before concatenation, offering more control and usually requiring less memory overhead.

```python
import numpy as np

array_64 = np.random.rand(256, 256, 64)
array_3 = np.random.rand(256, 256, 3)

# Stack the arrays along a new axis
stacked_array = np.stack((array_64, array_3), axis=-1)

# Reshape to combine channels if needed
combined_array = stacked_array.reshape(256, 256, 67)

print(stacked_array.shape) # Output: (256, 256, 67)
print(combined_array.shape) # Output: (256, 256, 67)
```

This approach leverages NumPy’s efficient stacking mechanism, minimizing memory usage compared to tiling, particularly beneficial for high-dimensional arrays.


**Example 3:  Conditional Broadcasting with `np.where`**

This illustrates a scenario where the goal is not simply concatenation, but a conditional merge based on a criterion. This approach is particularly useful when you need to combine data based on specific conditions.

```python
import numpy as np

array_64 = np.random.rand(256, 256, 64)
array_3 = np.random.rand(256, 256, 3)

# Create a mask to determine which values to select
mask = np.random.rand(256, 256) > 0.5

# Broadcast the mask to 64 channels (replicate along the channel axis)
mask_64 = np.repeat(mask[:, :, np.newaxis], 64, axis=2)

#Use np.where to conditionally select values. This example replaces values
#in array_64 where the mask is true with values from array_3.
#The shapes must be compatible after broadcasting.
combined_array = np.where(mask_64, array_3[:,:,np.newaxis], array_64) #Broadcasting mask to array_64

print(combined_array.shape) # Output: (256, 256, 64)

```

This code snippet demonstrates conditional broadcasting.  It highlights that broadcasting can go beyond simple concatenation.  Choosing the right method depends on the exact requirements of the final output and the desired operation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

NumPy documentation;  Linear Algebra textbooks covering matrix operations and tensor manipulations;  Scientific computing literature focusing on image and signal processing.  Advanced NumPy techniques should be studied in conjunction with a grasp of linear algebra principles for better comprehension of array operations in higher dimensions.  Understanding memory management in Python and efficient array manipulation is crucial for large datasets.  Thorough testing and profiling of code are essential to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with high-resolution image data.
