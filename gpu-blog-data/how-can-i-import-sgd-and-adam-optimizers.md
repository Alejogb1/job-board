The core differentiation in using optimizers within TensorFlow's Keras framework lies in understanding their modular design, specifically how they are instantiated and configured before being passed to a model's compilation step. Having worked extensively with various neural network architectures over the past several years, I've often encountered situations where choosing and properly implementing the right optimizer drastically altered model convergence and performance. This requires precise coding practices to ensure the chosen algorithm executes as intended.

Essentially, optimizers in Keras are objects, not simple string identifiers or built-in functionalities. To import and utilize Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam optimizers, one must explicitly import them from the `tf.keras.optimizers` module. These are not automatically available as global variables. Furthermore, their behavior can be modified through constructor arguments, controlling hyperparameters such as the learning rate, momentum (for SGD), and beta values (for Adam). This flexibility allows fine-tuning, crucial for achieving optimal performance on specific tasks. Once an optimizer object is created, it becomes a parameter for the model’s `compile` method. This method is not a training loop; instead, it configures the training process and defines which optimization algorithm will guide the updates of the model weights.

I'll detail three distinct code examples demonstrating the import, configuration, and application of these optimizers. Each example will emphasize different facets, such as setting custom learning rates and applying specific momentum values.

**Example 1: Basic SGD and Adam Initialization**

This example illustrates the fundamental import process and application of default parameter-based instantiation of SGD and Adam. It emphasizes the minimum code needed to make use of these optimizers without any modification to their default behavior. This approach is useful for quick prototyping and understanding how to hook these objects into a Keras model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a simple sequential model exists.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Importing optimizers
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam

# Default SGD optimizer
sgd_optimizer = SGD()

# Default Adam optimizer
adam_optimizer = Adam()

# Model compilation using SGD
model.compile(optimizer=sgd_optimizer,
             loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model compilation using Adam (recompiling same model)
model.compile(optimizer=adam_optimizer,
             loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model summary after compilation
model.summary()

# Example data for showcasing model build (not required to run the optimizers)
import numpy as np
X = np.random.rand(100, 100)
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y)

# Placeholder for training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
```

In this code block, the import statement `from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam` brings the necessary optimizer classes into scope. We then instantiate `SGD()` and `Adam()` without any constructor arguments, meaning they adopt default learning rate values. These optimizer objects are then applied through the `optimizer` argument within `model.compile()`. I include the model summary to demonstrate that a functional model has been created and the fit operation to showcase that it is ready to be trained. The key takeaway here is that the compiler can handle different optimizers by taking optimizer instances as inputs to its optimizer argument.

**Example 2: Custom Learning Rates and SGD Momentum**

This example builds upon the first, showcasing the initialization of SGD and Adam with custom hyperparameter values. This demonstrates the precise control an engineer can have over these algorithms through their initialization process. Specifically, we modify learning rates for both optimizers and introduce momentum to the SGD instance. In my experience, tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum can be pivotal in enhancing a model’s learning capabilities, especially when working with complex data sets or architectures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a simple sequential model exists.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Importing optimizers
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam

# SGD with custom learning rate and momentum
sgd_optimizer_custom = SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)

# Adam with custom learning rate
adam_optimizer_custom = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)

# Model compilation using custom SGD
model.compile(optimizer=sgd_optimizer_custom,
             loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model compilation using custom Adam (recompiling same model)
model.compile(optimizer=adam_optimizer_custom,
             loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model summary after compilation
model.summary()

# Example data for showcasing model build (not required to run the optimizers)
import numpy as np
X = np.random.rand(100, 100)
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y)

# Placeholder for training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
```

Here, the instantiation of `SGD` includes `learning_rate` set to 0.01 and `momentum` set to 0.9. Similarly, the `Adam` optimizer is instantiated with `learning_rate` set to 0.0001. These modifications highlight the importance of consulting the TensorFlow Keras documentation to understand all available constructor parameters for each specific optimizer. Each optimizer algorithm has a unique set of possible configurations that can be precisely set by the user during instantiation.

**Example 3: Optimizer Instance Reusability and Different Models**

This example demonstrates that the optimizer instances created can be reused with multiple different models. This highlights the optimizer object as a modular component. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where a user is testing the same optimizer settings across different model architectures, a practice I've found very useful in comparative model evaluations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume two simple sequential models.
model1 = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model2 = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(20, activation='softmax')
])

# Importing optimizers
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam

# SGD with custom learning rate and momentum
sgd_optimizer_custom = SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)

# Adam with custom learning rate
adam_optimizer_custom = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)

# Model compilation using custom SGD (model 1)
model1.compile(optimizer=sgd_optimizer_custom,
             loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model compilation using custom Adam (model 2)
model2.compile(optimizer=adam_optimizer_custom,
             loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model summary after compilation
model1.summary()
model2.summary()

# Example data for showcasing model build (not required to run the optimizers)
import numpy as np
X = np.random.rand(100, 100)
y1 = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
y1 = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y1)
y2 = np.random.randint(0, 20, 100)
y2 = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y2)


# Placeholder for training
model1.fit(X, y1, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
model2.fit(X, y2, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
```

In this code snippet, we have two models, `model1` and `model2`, with slightly different architectures. The same `sgd_optimizer_custom` is reused with `model1` and `adam_optimizer_custom` is reused with `model2`. This illustrates the portability of optimizer instances; an optimizer, once configured, can be used with multiple models provided those models use a compatible loss function. In my work, this ability has streamlined the experimentation process, minimizing redundant code when applying the same optimization parameters across various designs.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting resources such as the official TensorFlow API documentation (specifically the `tf.keras.optimizers` module), which provides a detailed description of each optimizer class and its available hyperparameters. Additionally, books on deep learning using TensorFlow can offer more in-depth explanations, and tutorials focused on practical applications are widely available. These resources, combined with experimentation, will help build a robust understanding of optimizers within Keras.
