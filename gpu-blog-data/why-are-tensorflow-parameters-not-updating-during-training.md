The observation that TensorFlow parameters are not updating during training usually stems from a disconnect between intended backpropagation and the actual computational graph, particularly in areas like gradient calculation, optimizer application, or the presence of non-differentiable operations. Having spent considerable time debugging complex TensorFlow models, I've noticed that this issue isn’t always immediately obvious and often necessitates a systematic investigation across several core areas.

First, the fundamental concept of training a neural network relies on calculating gradients of a loss function with respect to the model’s trainable parameters. These gradients, which indicate the direction of steepest ascent in the loss landscape, are used to update the model's weights in the direction that minimizes the loss. If no updates occur, then somewhere along this crucial chain of events, something is malfunctioning. I find that the problem often falls into one of the following categories: issues with the computational graph construction, incorrect optimizer setup, or inadvertently disabling gradient calculations.

A common pitfall arises from inadvertently creating detachments in the computational graph. TensorFlow, like other deep learning frameworks, builds a graph of operations; these operations are tracked to enable automatic differentiation. If a tensor is detached from this graph, its gradients won't be computed and passed back to the earlier layers. This typically happens when using operations that break differentiability, such as casting tensors to a non-floating-point type and back or directly modifying tensor values. In a less obvious example, if custom operations using `tf.py_function` are implemented improperly, they may interrupt the backpropagation, as the gradients don't automatically propagate across such barriers unless explicitly defined. An illustrative instance involves manipulating a tensor with NumPy within a TensorFlow function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class NonUpdatingLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(NonUpdatingLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(1,units)))

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect attempt to modify weights - this will stop gradient prop
        modified_w = self.w.numpy()  # Detaches from TF graph
        modified_w = modified_w * np.array(2.0)
        modified_w = tf.convert_to_tensor(modified_w) # Not an update, new tensor
        return tf.matmul(inputs, modified_w)


input_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1,1),dtype=tf.float32)
model = NonUpdatingLayer(1)
loss = lambda:  tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(model(input_tensor)-tf.constant(2.0)))
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.minimize(loss, var_list = model.trainable_variables)
    print(f"Iteration: {i} Weights: {model.w.numpy()}")
```

In this example, the `self.w` tensor is detached from the computational graph when converting it to a NumPy array. Although it's converted back to a tensor, this becomes a new tensor that does not retain the gradient history of `self.w`. The optimizer will be operating on the original `self.w` variable, which never changes. Therefore, despite calling `optimizer.minimize`, the weights do not update, demonstrating a common yet easily missed issue. The print statements will show that the weights do not change across iterations, a clear indicator that parameters are not being updated.

Another area to examine closely is the optimizer configuration. Incorrectly specifying the `var_list` parameter within the `optimizer.minimize` function can cause targeted variables to be excluded from the update process. I've encountered scenarios where I forgot to include a newly added parameter in the `var_list`, resulting in that parameter not being trained. Additionally, using incompatible optimizers or setting the learning rate to zero will similarly lead to a failure of parameter updates. Moreover, if custom training loops are employed, one must ensure that the gradient calculation scope is tied to the optimization process. It’s not always evident when these are disconnected, but by stepping through these components, the error usually becomes clear.

Let’s explore this incorrect optimizer usage through code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class UpdatingLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(UpdatingLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(1,units)))
        self.b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(shape=(1,units)))


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

input_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1,1),dtype=tf.float32)
model = UpdatingLayer(1)
loss = lambda: tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(model(input_tensor)-tf.constant(2.0)))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
for i in range(10):
    # Only the 'w' is included for optimizaion by mistake, the 'b' is not
    optimizer.minimize(loss, var_list = [model.w])
    print(f"Iteration: {i} Weights: {model.w.numpy()} Bias: {model.b.numpy()}")

```

In this modified version, only `model.w` is included in `var_list`, leaving `model.b` untracked during optimization. Only `model.w` will change across iterations, `model.b` will remain unchanged. This highlights the necessity of ensuring all trainable parameters are registered with the optimizer when calling `optimizer.minimize`. If I were seeing similar behavior during debugging, I would suspect an error in parameter specification.

Finally, issues with non-differentiable operations, while often associated with manual graph manipulation, can also occur in higher-level API usage. When custom loss functions are defined, care must be taken to ensure that they're comprised solely of differentiable TensorFlow operations. The gradient of non-differentiable operations is typically zero, effectively halting backpropagation. An additional case to consider would be masking values where custom boolean masks can result in unexpected non-differentiable computations, thus effectively stopping the parameter update process.

A more subtle example would involve using `tf.stop_gradient` incorrectly. This function explicitly prevents the calculation of gradients for a particular tensor. If this is used inappropriately within the loss function or anywhere within the network's forward pass, gradients will not propagate as expected. For instance:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class GradientStoppingLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(GradientStoppingLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(1,units)))

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrectly stop gradient of weight output
        return tf.stop_gradient(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w))


input_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1,1),dtype=tf.float32)
model = GradientStoppingLayer(1)
loss = lambda: tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(model(input_tensor)-tf.constant(2.0)))
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)

for i in range(10):
    optimizer.minimize(loss, var_list = model.trainable_variables)
    print(f"Iteration: {i} Weights: {model.w.numpy()}")
```

In this final example, `tf.stop_gradient` ensures that the gradient of the output of the layer, and thus any gradient for `self.w` is zeroed. Although `self.w` is a trainable variable, no gradients flow to it, and it will therefore never update. This case makes clear the crucial importance of the correct placement and purpose of all operations within the computational graph.

In summary, a lack of parameter updates during TensorFlow training usually results from failures in one or more aspects of the backpropagation chain. Detailed examination of computational graph detachments, optimizer setup, and the presence of non-differentiable operations or the incorrect use of `tf.stop_gradient` is paramount. As with debugging, systematic checks that include printing intermediate tensors and gradients often reveals the precise source of the problem. When reviewing my past debug sessions on similar problems, I found that the core idea is to follow the flow of information step-by-step. I would recommend researching materials on Tensorflow's automatic differentiation, computational graph construction, and the use of gradient tape. A strong understanding of these core concepts provides a reliable foundation for tackling such intricate issues. Specific areas for further study include the gradient computation mechanisms employed by TensorFlow, the details of loss function design, and the correct use of optimizers. Consulting the official TensorFlow documentation will also yield valuable insights.
