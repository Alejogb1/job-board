TensorFlow SavedModel export failures stemming from `AttributeError` exceptions often originate from inconsistencies between the model's definition and the data it's intended to process during the export phase.  My experience troubleshooting these issues, particularly during the development of a large-scale natural language processing system at my previous employer, points to three primary causes:  missing or incorrectly specified input tensors, incompatible tensor shapes, and the presence of dynamically created operations within the model's graph that are not properly handled during serialization.

**1. Missing or Incorrectly Specified Input Tensors:**

The most common source of `AttributeError` during SavedModel export is a mismatch between the input tensors expected by the `tf.saved_model.save` function and the tensors actually provided.  The `signatures` argument within `tf.saved_model.save` explicitly defines the input and output tensors for the SavedModel. If a tensor specified in the signature doesn't exist in the model's graph at the time of export, or if its name or shape is inconsistent, a `AttributeError` will frequently result.  This stems from the exporter's inability to locate the necessary tensor within the model's internal representation.  The error message often highlights the specific tensor causing the issue.

For instance, if a signature specifies an input tensor named "input_ids" but the model expects "input_ids_0", the export will fail. Similarly, if the signature expects a tensor of shape `(None, 512)` but the model is processing tensors of shape `(None, 1024)`, the exporter will again raise an `AttributeError` because it cannot map the signature to the actual model’s internal structure.  This emphasizes the critical need for precise specification of the input and output tensors in the `signatures` argument.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Input Tensor Name**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition (simplified for illustration)
@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32, name="my_input")])
def my_model(input_tensor):
  return tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor)

# Incorrect signature specification (incorrect tensor name)
infer_sig = tf.saved_model.build_signature_def(
    inputs={'input_ids': tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32)},
    outputs={'output': tf.TensorSpec(shape=[], dtype=tf.float32)})

tf.saved_model.save(my_model, 'my_model', signatures={'serving_default': infer_sig}) #This will fail.
```

This code will fail because the signature expects an input named 'input_ids', while the model uses 'my_input'. Correcting the name in the signature to match the model's internal name resolves this issue.


**2. Incompatible Tensor Shapes:**

Even if the tensor names align perfectly, shape mismatches between the expected input shapes in the signature and the actual shapes fed to the model during export can lead to `AttributeError`.  This often occurs when the model is designed to handle variable-length sequences or images of varying sizes, and the export process is not properly configured to accommodate this variability.  The exporter needs to understand and handle the dynamic shape aspects of the input.

Specifically, using `tf.TensorSpec` with `shape=[None, ...]` is crucial to denote unspecified dimensions, allowing the exporter to handle dynamic shapes.  Failure to do so will lead to errors if the model is given inputs of differing sizes during the export.

**Code Example 2: Inconsistent Tensor Shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32, name="input_tensor")])
def my_model(input_tensor):
  return tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor)

infer_sig = tf.saved_model.build_signature_def(
    inputs={'input_tensor': tf.TensorSpec(shape=[10,10], dtype=tf.float32)}, # Incorrect Shape
    outputs={'output': tf.TensorSpec(shape=[], dtype=tf.float32)})

tf.saved_model.save(my_model, 'my_model', signatures={'serving_default': infer_sig})  #This will likely fail.
```

In this example, the model expects a variable length input (using `None` in the shape) while the signature defines a fixed shape `[10, 10]`.  This inconsistency will often lead to an `AttributeError` during export.  Correcting the shape in the signature to `[None, 10]` resolves the issue.


**3. Dynamically Created Operations:**

Models constructed using dynamic graph operations, where the graph structure is not fully defined until runtime, can pose challenges for SavedModel export. TensorFlow needs a static representation of the model's graph for serialization.  Dynamically created operations, such as those involving `tf.while_loop` or conditional branching based on runtime conditions, may not be properly captured during the export process. This leads to a missing operation in the exported graph and a consequent `AttributeError` when attempting to load and utilize the SavedModel.

It’s essential to ensure that all operations crucial to the model’s functionality are explicitly defined within a `tf.function` decorated function with the `input_signature` properly defined, forcing TensorFlow to create a static computation graph.

**Code Example 3:  Untracked Operation within a Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None], dtype=tf.int32, name="input_list")])
def my_model(input_list):
    output = []
    for i in tf.range(tf.shape(input_list)[0]): #Untracked operation if not in tf.function
        output.append(input_list[i] * 2)
    return tf.stack(output)

infer_sig = tf.saved_model.build_signature_def(
    inputs={'input_list': tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None], dtype=tf.int32)},
    outputs={'output': tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None], dtype=tf.int32)})

tf.saved_model.save(my_model, 'my_model', signatures={'serving_default': infer_sig})
```

This code appears correct as the loop is within the `tf.function` , allowing TensorFlow to trace it and make it a part of the graph during export.  However, incorrectly structuring the loop or introducing operations outside of the `tf.function` will result in the loop not being correctly serialized, likely leading to an `AttributeError`. The use of `tf.function` and a clearly defined `input_signature` is key here.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel, the guide on `tf.function`, and detailed tutorials on creating and exporting models are invaluable. Thoroughly reviewing these resources will improve understanding of the intricacies of model saving and exporting, significantly reducing the likelihood of encountering such issues.  Furthermore, exploring advanced debugging techniques within TensorFlow, such as using TensorBoard to visualize the model graph before and after export, aids in identifying inconsistencies and problematic operations.  Learning to interpret the detailed error messages provided by TensorFlow is essential for pinpointing the exact source of the `AttributeError`.  Finally, utilizing unit tests to verify the model's behavior both before and after export can greatly improve model robustness and aid in early detection of problematic code.
