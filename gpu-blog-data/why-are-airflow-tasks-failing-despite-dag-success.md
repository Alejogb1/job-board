A DAG's successful completion in Apache Airflow only confirms that the defined workflow structure executed without errors in its orchestration. However, individual task failures within a successfully run DAG are common and indicate problems with the specific operations each task is designed to perform, rather than issues with the workflow itself. I've encountered this repeatedly across various projects, and understanding the nuances between DAG and task success is fundamental for building resilient data pipelines. The separation of concerns in Airflow design means the scheduler and executor successfully launch and monitor task instances, but the logic within each task is ultimately responsible for its own success or failure.

The primary reasons for task failures despite DAG success boil down to issues within the task's execution environment or the logic it contains. A DAG reaching a 'success' state implies that all tasks reached a terminal state, but this terminal state could be 'failed' as well as 'success'. Airflow will not halt the DAG execution just because a task has failed, unless explicitly configured. The DAG’s logic only dictates the ordering and dependencies between tasks, not the inner workings of each task’s execution.

A common cause for such failures relates to **resource constraints** at the individual task level. Consider an example where a DAG has a task that runs a large data transformation. If the worker node executing the task lacks adequate RAM, the task might fail with an out-of-memory error. The DAG, from Airflow's perspective, correctly dispatched the task and tracked its completion. The task completed, but the outcome was a failure. Similarly, if a task attempts to access a database that is temporarily unavailable, the task would fail. The issue is not with the DAG’s orchestration, but with the environment and dependencies of the individual task.

Another significant reason involves **incorrect task logic**. Errors in SQL queries, Python scripts, or bash commands will lead to task failures, even when the task itself is executed by Airflow. These logical failures are completely unrelated to the DAG structure. For example, a task designed to load data into a table might encounter an error if the target table is not created properly, if the input data violates schema constraints, or if the logic within the task has an unforeseen edge case. The Airflow scheduler is not aware of these internal failures; it simply records the task's outcome based on the reported exit code.

Furthermore, external systems and **API dependencies** are often culprits for task failures. A task might rely on an external API, web service, or file system. If the external system is unavailable, returns unexpected data, or is experiencing performance issues, the associated task will fail. Airflow's ability to orchestrate the pipeline is not a substitute for the availability and reliability of external dependencies. The DAG successfully proceeds through its defined steps, but a dependent task might fail due to these external factors. A well-designed DAG will incorporate retry mechanisms and alerts to handle these situations, but the initial failure may still occur.

Below are a few code examples demonstrating scenarios where tasks might fail despite DAG success.

**Example 1: Python Operator with Logical Error**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def faulty_function(x,y):
  result = x / y
  return result

def print_result(task_instance):
    value = task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='divide_numbers', key='result')
    print(f"Result of division is: {value}")


with DAG(
    dag_id='division_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    divide_numbers_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='divide_numbers',
        python_callable=faulty_function,
        op_kwargs={'x': 10, 'y': 0},  # Error: Division by zero
        do_xcom_push=True,
        provide_context=True

    )

    print_value_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='print_value',
        python_callable = print_result
    )

    divide_numbers_task >> print_value_task
```

*   **Commentary:** This DAG has two tasks: `divide_numbers_task` that calls `faulty_function` with `y = 0` which causes a `ZeroDivisionError`, which will crash the task, and `print_value_task` that will not execute if its upstream failed, but can be run on its own. The DAG, having successfully launched and monitored the task, will show the DAG as successful despite the clear error. Note that if `print_value_task` was set with trigger rule `all_done`, it would execute irrespective of if the previous step succeeded or not. The crucial point here is that Airflow correctly orchestrated and completed the DAG, despite the task within failing. The error is within the user's python code.

**Example 2: Bash Operator with Incorrect Command**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='bash_command_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    create_directory_task = BashOperator(
        task_id='create_directory',
        bash_command='mkdir /invalid/path' #invalid path
    )
```
*   **Commentary:** In this example, the `create_directory_task` uses a `BashOperator` to create a directory. This is a very common operation. If the path '/invalid/path' does not exist, the command will fail. The Bash operator will return a non-zero exit code, signifying failure. Airflow will mark this task as failed, but the DAG itself will be completed as there were no errors in its internal logic of launching the task. This illustrates that task failures stem from operations and commands within, not the DAG's orchestration. A more practical example would be a bash command failing due to insufficient permissions.

**Example 3: Resource Issue with a Python Operator**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import time
import numpy as np

def resource_intensive_function():
  #Simulate a resource intensive operation
    time.sleep(5)
    large_array = np.random.rand(100000,10000)
    return np.mean(large_array)


with DAG(
    dag_id='resource_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    resource_intensive_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='resource_intensive_task',
        python_callable=resource_intensive_function
    )
```

*   **Commentary:** Here, the `resource_intensive_task` runs a function that allocates a large NumPy array and calculates its mean. Depending on available resources, particularly memory, this might cause a worker to crash. The DAG will continue processing, but the task will fail due to insufficient resources on the executing worker node. Airflow considers the DAG successful from an orchestration perspective, as the failure originates in the task environment. This case requires the use of resource limits at the kubernetes/docker or worker level to handle.

To effectively diagnose such task failures, I've found a consistent approach useful: Firstly, review task logs meticulously in the Airflow UI. The logs usually provide concrete error messages and stack traces to pinpoint the cause. Second, ensure all task dependencies such as databases, APIs, and external systems are accessible and operational. Thirdly, analyze task logic and error handling. Implement robust error trapping in code, and consider using Airflow's `retry` and `on_failure_callback` features. Finally, ensure sufficient worker node resources are allocated to prevent resource-based failures like the above.

For further exploration of these topics, I would recommend reviewing the official Apache Airflow documentation sections on task management, logging, and resource allocation. Also, data engineering best practices documents for implementing idempotent tasks and effective error handling can help mitigate task failures. Another good resource is literature on software reliability engineering, in particular, the concepts of graceful degradation and fault tolerance.
