The optimal split of the MNIST dataset for training and validation hinges critically on the balance between achieving a robust model generalization capability and preventing overfitting while maintaining sufficient data for effective model training.  My experience working on high-performance image recognition systems has shown that a strict 80/20 split, while common, isn't always ideal and can be significantly improved upon with a more nuanced approach, particularly when considering the relatively small size of the MNIST dataset.

**1. Explanation of Optimal Splitting Strategies:**

The straightforward 80/20 split (80% training, 20% validation) offers a reasonable starting point, but several factors can influence its effectiveness.  The inherent class balance in MNIST, while relatively uniform, can still exhibit minor variations.  A random split might accidentally create a validation set with a skewed class distribution, misleading model evaluation.  Furthermore,  the relatively small size of the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images) necessitates careful consideration to ensure adequate samples in both the training and validation sets for each digit class.  Insufficient samples can lead to unreliable performance metrics and hinder accurate model assessment.

To mitigate these potential issues, I advocate for a stratified sampling technique. This ensures proportional representation of each digit class (0-9) in both the training and validation sets. This approach minimizes the risk of biased evaluation stemming from an uneven class distribution in the validation set.  The optimal proportion will depend on the complexity of the model and available computational resources.  In cases where computational resources are limited, a larger proportion for training might be preferred.  However, a validation set too small will not provide sufficient information for reliable model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

A practical approach I've found effective involves a stratified 75/25 or 70/30 split, where the larger portion is allocated for training and a smaller, but still adequately sized, portion is reserved for validation. This strategy balances the need for robust model training with accurate performance assessment.  The exact split should be determined empirically, considering the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set and its subsequent generalization to the test set.

Furthermore, the use of a separate test set is crucial. The MNIST dataset already provides a dedicated 10,000 image test set, which should remain untouched until the final model evaluation.  Using the test set during model development risks overfitting to the test data, leading to an unrealistically optimistic performance estimate.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to splitting the MNIST dataset using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

**Example 1: Simple 80/20 Random Split (using scikit-learn):**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Flatten the images
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784)

# Normalize pixel values
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255

# Split into training and validation sets
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {x_train.shape[0]}")
print(f"Validation set size: {x_val.shape[0]}")
print(f"Test set size: {x_test.shape[0]}")
```

This code demonstrates a basic 80/20 random split.  While simple, it lacks the class stratification that enhances robustness.  The `random_state` ensures reproducibility.

**Example 2: Stratified 75/25 Split (using scikit-learn):**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow import keras

# Load and preprocess MNIST as in Example 1

# Stratified split
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.25, stratify=y_train, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {x_train.shape[0]}")
print(f"Validation set size: {x_val.shape[0]}")
print(f"Test set size: {x_test.shape[0]}")
```

This example uses the `stratify` parameter to ensure proportional representation of each digit class in both the training and validation sets, resulting in a more reliable model evaluation.

**Example 3: Manual Stratification (for demonstration):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Load and preprocess MNIST as in Example 1

# Manual stratification (demonstration - less efficient for large datasets)
train_samples_per_class = 4800
val_samples_per_class = 1600

x_train_strat = np.empty((0, 784))
y_train_strat = np.empty((0,))
x_val_strat = np.empty((0, 784))
y_val_strat = np.empty((0,))

for i in range(10):
    class_indices = np.where(y_train == i)[0]
    np.random.shuffle(class_indices)
    x_train_strat = np.concatenate((x_train_strat, x_train[class_indices[:train_samples_per_class]]))
    y_train_strat = np.concatenate((y_train_strat, y_train[class_indices[:train_samples_per_class]]))
    x_val_strat = np.concatenate((x_val_strat, x_train[class_indices[train_samples_per_class:train_samples_per_class + val_samples_per_class]]))
    y_val_strat = np.concatenate((y_val_strat, y_train[class_indices[train_samples_per_class:train_samples_per_class + val_samples_per_class]]))


print(f"Training set size: {x_train_strat.shape[0]}")
print(f"Validation set size: {x_val_strat.shape[0]}")
print(f"Test set size: {x_test.shape[0]}")
```

This example demonstrates manual stratification.  While illustrating the concept clearly, it's less efficient than `train_test_split`'s built-in stratification for larger datasets.  It's crucial to note this is for illustrative purposes; `train_test_split` is the preferred method for practical applications.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of dataset splitting strategies and their impact on model performance, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks covering model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.  Specifically, focusing on sections dealing with cross-validation techniques and bias-variance tradeoffs will provide valuable insights.  Further, reviewing the documentation for your chosen machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras) is essential for understanding the nuances of their dataset splitting functionalities.  Finally, exploring research papers on image recognition and deep learning will offer advanced perspectives on data handling and model evaluation within the context of large-scale datasets and complex models.  These resources will provide a more robust understanding beyond the simple examples provided here.
