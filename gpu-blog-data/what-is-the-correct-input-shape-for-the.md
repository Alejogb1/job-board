The crucial detail regarding the `conv1d_3` layer input shape hinges on the preceding layers' output and the intended functionality within the broader convolutional neural network (CNN).  My experience developing and debugging similar architectures in time-series analysis and signal processing projects highlights this dependency.  The input shape isn't an intrinsic property of `conv1d_3` itself but a direct consequence of the design choices in layers `conv1d_1` and `conv1d_2`, as well as any preprocessing steps applied to the initial data.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A 1D convolutional layer, denoted as `conv1d`, operates on one-dimensional data.  The input shape is typically represented as `(batch_size, sequence_length, channels)`.  Let's break this down:

* **`batch_size`:**  This represents the number of independent samples processed simultaneously.  It's usually a hyperparameter set during model training and directly affects the memory consumption.  In mini-batch gradient descent, it determines the size of each batch.

* **`sequence_length`:** This signifies the length of the input sequence for each sample. For time-series data, it's the number of time steps; for audio, it's the number of audio samples; and for other 1D data, it's the length of the feature vector.  This dimension is crucial for understanding the receptive field of the convolutional filters.

* **`channels`:** This indicates the number of input features at each time step.  For raw time-series data, it might be 1 (a single time series).  However, if you've applied multiple feature extraction techniques beforehand, you may have multiple channels. For instance, incorporating both amplitude and frequency information would result in two channels.

The input shape of `conv1d_3` is determined by the output shape of `conv1d_2`.  The output shape of a `conv1d` layer is a function of its input shape, kernel size, strides, padding, and dilation.  Understanding these parameters is paramount to correctly predicting the input shape of subsequent layers.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate with three examples demonstrating different scenarios and their implications on the `conv1d_3` input shape.  I'll assume a Keras-like API for consistency, although the concepts apply broadly across deep learning frameworks.

**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 1)), # conv1d_1
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'), # conv1d_2
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu') # conv1d_3
])

model.summary()
```

**Commentary:**  `conv1d_1` receives input of shape `(100, 1)`.  Assuming no padding and a stride of 1, `conv1d_2` will receive an output from `conv1d_1` of shape `(98, 32)`.  `conv1d_2` then produces an output, and subsequently, `conv1d_3`'s input shape will depend on `conv1d_2`'s output shape which is calculated similarly, considering the kernel size, stride, and padding. The `model.summary()` call will explicitly show these shapes.

**Example 2:  With Max Pooling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=16, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', input_shape=(200, 2)), # conv1d_1
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'), # conv1d_2
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu') # conv1d_3
])

model.summary()
```

**Commentary:** The introduction of `MaxPooling1D` reduces the `sequence_length`.  `conv1d_1` outputs `(196, 16)`.  The pooling layer halves the sequence length resulting in `(98, 16)`.  Therefore, `conv1d_2`'s input shape is `(98, 16)`.  The subsequent output shape of `conv1d_2` and therefore the input of `conv1d_3` will need to be calculated based on these parameters, again visible in the model summary.


**Example 3: Incorporating Batch Normalization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(50, 4)), # conv1d_1
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'), # conv1d_2
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu') # conv1d_3
])

model.summary()
```

**Commentary:**  Batch Normalization layers don't alter the shape of the tensor; they normalize the activations.  Hence, the input shape of `conv1d_3` will still be determined by the output of `conv1d_2`, considering the kernel size, stride, and padding of `conv1d_2`.  The batch normalization layers add computational overhead but do not affect the core dimensionality of the data flowing through the network.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of digital signal processing (DSP) fundamentals, especially convolution theorems and their application to signal analysis, will be immensely beneficial in comprehending the intricacies of 1D convolutional layers and predicting output shapes accurately.  Finally, textbooks on neural network architectures and practical guides on implementing CNNs offer valuable insights and detailed explanations of layer functionalities.  Careful examination of the layer's hyperparameters – especially kernel size, stride, and padding – is crucial in accurately determining the input and output shapes of each layer.  Practice building and analyzing simple CNN architectures will solidify this understanding.
