The CUDA runtime error frequently observed at `THCBlas.cu:450` in PyTorch stems from an internal failure within the cuBLAS library, specifically when performing tensor operations on the GPU. This error typically surfaces when the underlying GPU memory or execution context experiences an issue, preventing the cuBLAS routine from completing successfully. I've encountered this numerous times, particularly while working on large-scale neural network training, and it's rarely a direct bug in PyTorch itself.

The `THCBlas.cu` file resides deep within PyTorch's CUDA backend, acting as an interface to NVIDIA's cuBLAS library – a high-performance BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) implementation optimized for GPUs. The line number 450, while seemingly specific, is essentially a marker within that particular file, indicating where PyTorch calls a cuBLAS function. The actual root cause isn't tied to the source code at line 450 but to the preceding operation that has resulted in an invalid state for cuBLAS. These failures generally arise from either incorrect memory management, misconfigured CUDA contexts, or improper argument validation within cuBLAS itself.

A very common scenario leading to this error is memory corruption within GPU RAM. Consider a situation where you allocate a tensor, perform operations on it, and inadvertently access memory outside of the allocated boundary. While this can sometimes silently lead to incorrect computations, it often manifest as the cuBLAS error at line 450 when the underlying BLAS operations subsequently attempt to access this corrupted memory. This is frequently due to errors introduced through custom CUDA kernels which can cause memory overwrite. In such cases, a debugger like `cuda-memcheck` or Valgrind can help identify these rogue memory accesses.

Another frequently observed cause relates to resource exhaustion on the GPU. Specifically, if your process consumes too much GPU memory, even for short periods of time, or uses excessively large tensors, subsequent cuBLAS calls might fail. This can happen when the program attempts to allocate an array larger than the available GPU RAM. The resulting memory allocation failure may not be surfaced immediately; rather, it often surfaces later when the underlying BLAS library attempts to compute based on the previously failed operation. Similarly, improperly configured CUDA contexts can lead to unpredictable behaviours, culminating in cuBLAS failures, especially in multi-GPU scenarios.

Finally, incorrect argument passing to PyTorch’s tensor methods, which ultimately call cuBLAS functions, can cause such problems. While PyTorch often catches these errors at a high level and provides descriptive messages, sometimes the error propagates down to cuBLAS. This can happen, for example, if you attempt to perform a matrix multiplication on tensors with incompatible shapes, while such obvious issues are generally caught upstream, if that upstream logic is broken, these errors can occur.

To illustrate common scenarios and how debugging methods might be approached, consider these three examples.

**Example 1: Memory Corruption**

```python
import torch

def corrupt_memory(size):
    x = torch.randn(size, device='cuda')
    # Intentionally write outside of allocated memory
    offset = x.numel() + 1
    y = torch.randn(1, device='cuda')
    y[0] = x[0]  # valid write
    y = x.view(x.numel() + 1)
    return x, y


def perform_operation(x,y):
    # some operation that will be called after the memory error
     z = torch.matmul(x, torch.randn(x.shape[-1], y.shape[-1], device='cuda'))
     return z


try:
    size = (1000, 1000)
    x, y = corrupt_memory(size)
    z = perform_operation(x,y)
    print("Success:", z.sum()) # should not reach this
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Error Caught:", e)
```
Here, the `corrupt_memory` function intentionally attempts to write outside the allocated memory space. This is done by creating an array y that is sized one larger than it is supposed to be, with the intention that when a later mathematical operation is called in `perform_operation`, the program will throw the cuBLAS error. This doesn't happen in the line of code where we modify y's size, rather it happens on the math operation. While this is contrived, this type of memory error can occur via an external CUDA kernel where it is more difficult to detect the corruption via inspection. Running with `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` can sometimes lead to more easily reproducible errors. In practice, `cuda-memcheck` would be invaluable in catching this type of error.

**Example 2: Resource Exhaustion**

```python
import torch
import gc

def allocate_too_much():
    try:
        size = (int(1e10),10)
        x = torch.randn(size, device='cuda')
        y = torch.randn((10,10), device='cuda')
        z = torch.matmul(x,y)

    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error caught during tensor creation: {e}")
    gc.collect() # forces memory to be freed from the GPU


def test():
    # Attempt a large tensor operation
    try:
        size = (1000, 1000)
        x = torch.randn(size, device='cuda')
        y = torch.randn(size, device='cuda')
        z = torch.matmul(x,y)
        return z

    except RuntimeError as e:
         print(f"Error caught during matrix operation: {e}")



allocate_too_much()

z = test()
if z is not None:
    print("success:", z.sum())
```

In this example, the `allocate_too_much` function attempts to allocate a significantly large tensor, which can trigger out-of-memory issues on the GPU. The `gc.collect()` can mitigate this issue, allowing the subsequent operation to potentially succeed. However, it is still possible that these resources may not be available to the subsequent call in the `test()` method. The key problem is that GPU memory allocation is not guaranteed, and depending on what was run before, there may not be sufficient memory available. The resulting memory allocation failure may not be surfaced immediately, and instead manifests when a subsequent cuBLAS operation is called in the `test()` method. This would typically show up as a cuBLAS failure, although there are a large class of exceptions that may be caused by memory allocation, and it may not point to line 450.

**Example 3: Incompatible Tensor Shapes**

```python
import torch

def perform_incorrect_matmul():
    try:
       size_a = (100, 200)
       size_b = (200, 300)

       # Create two tensors
       a = torch.randn(size_a, device='cuda')
       b = torch.randn(size_b, device='cuda')

       # perform dot product (not matmul)
       z = torch.dot(a.view(-1),b.view(-1))
       print("success:", z)
       # This will crash as it is using an incompatible operation, despite both tensors being well defined

    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error caught: {e}")


def perform_correct_matmul():
        size_a = (100, 200)
        size_b = (200, 300)

        a = torch.randn(size_a, device='cuda')
        b = torch.randn(size_b, device='cuda')

        z = torch.matmul(a,b)
        print("success:", z.sum())

perform_incorrect_matmul()
perform_correct_matmul()
```
In this example, `perform_incorrect_matmul` attempts to perform a dot product when it should be a matrix multiplication. Even though the tensors are correctly sized, the operations are inappropriate, which will cause an error. While PyTorch catches such obvious shape mismatches at a higher level in the `torch.dot` method, more subtle shape errors can sometimes propagate down to cuBLAS leading to a cuBLAS error. By contrast `perform_correct_matmul` uses correctly sized inputs and the `torch.matmul` operation which will not throw an error.

When debugging these issues, it is critical to employ appropriate tools. I have found the `cuda-gdb` debugger to be invaluable for line-by-line debugging of CUDA kernels, especially when custom kernels are involved. The `cuda-memcheck` tool is also essential for identifying memory access violations which, as discussed, can lead to indirect cuBLAS errors. Furthermore, monitoring GPU memory usage using `nvidia-smi` can quickly reveal whether resource exhaustion is the underlying issue.

For further background, I would suggest reviewing NVIDIA’s cuBLAS documentation as it provides insight into the expected usage of these low-level libraries.  The PyTorch documentation itself, specifically the notes on the GPU backend and tensor operations, can also provide valuable context. Additionally, resources on proper memory management within CUDA are indispensable to understand how these issues can arise. Finally, a strong understanding of the BLAS interface itself can be helpful in diagnosing such issues. These resources provide more fundamental knowledge than can be found in stack overflow posts, and allow a deeper understanding of the internals of the underlying libraries.
