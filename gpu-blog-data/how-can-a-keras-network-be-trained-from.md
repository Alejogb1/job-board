Training a Keras network from scratch using TensorFlow involves a nuanced understanding of the TensorFlow backend and the Keras API's flexibility.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the importance of careful model architecture design and hyperparameter tuning for optimal results, particularly when eschewing pre-trained models.  This necessitates a granular control over the training process, achievable through TensorFlow's lower-level functionalities integrated seamlessly within the Keras framework.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core principle revolves around leveraging Keras's high-level API for model definition and TensorFlow's computational graph for efficient training.  Keras, a high-level API, abstracts away many of the complexities of TensorFlow, simplifying model construction. However, for complete control and customization, direct interaction with the underlying TensorFlow operations becomes crucial, especially when dealing with complex custom loss functions, optimizers, or data pipelines. This allows for fine-grained adjustment of the training process, exceeding the capabilities offered solely by the Keras API's default functionalities.

The workflow generally involves the following stages:

* **Defining the Model Architecture:**  This involves specifying the layers (dense, convolutional, recurrent, etc.), their activation functions, and the overall network topology using the Keras Sequential or Functional API.
* **Compiling the Model:** Here, we define the loss function, optimizer, and metrics used to evaluate the model's performance during training.  Crucially, the choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop) and its hyperparameters significantly influence training efficiency and model convergence.
* **Preparing the Data:**  This involves loading, preprocessing, and potentially augmenting the training and validation datasets.  Efficient data handling, including batching and shuffling, is critical for preventing bottlenecks and ensuring the model receives a representative sample of the data.
* **Training the Model:** This step involves feeding the data to the compiled model, iteratively updating the model's weights based on the defined loss function and optimizer. TensorFlow's backend handles the underlying computation, leveraging GPU acceleration if available.
* **Evaluating the Model:** After training, the model's performance is assessed using the validation dataset.  Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score provide insights into the model's generalization capabilities.  This evaluation guides further model refinement or hyperparameter tuning.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model for Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)  # Regression output
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])

# Generate synthetic data
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(1000, 1)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

# Evaluate the model
loss, mae = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
```

This example demonstrates a simple sequential model for regression.  Note the use of `keras.Sequential` for model definition, `model.compile` for specifying the optimizer and loss function, and `model.fit` for training. The `verbose=1` argument provides training progress updates.


**Example 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # 10 classes
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and preprocess MNIST dataset (replace with your own data)
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255
x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, -1)
x_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, -1)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This example showcases a CNN for image classification using the MNIST dataset.  The convolutional and pooling layers are crucial for extracting features from images. The `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function is appropriate for multi-class classification with integer labels.


**Example 3: Custom Loss Function and Optimizer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a custom loss function
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
    return mse(y_true, y_pred) + 0.1 * tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_pred)) #L1 regularization

# Define the model (simple example for brevity)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define a custom optimizer with adjusted learning rate
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Compile the model with custom loss and optimizer
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=custom_loss, metrics=['mae'])

# ... (data loading and training as in previous examples) ...
```

This example demonstrates how to incorporate a custom loss function and optimizer. The `custom_loss` function adds L1 regularization to the mean squared error.  A custom Adam optimizer is defined with a specific learning rate.  This level of control is essential for advanced model development and hyperparameter optimization.
