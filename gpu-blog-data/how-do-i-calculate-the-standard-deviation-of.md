The core challenge in calculating the standard deviation of a matrix's variable lies in precisely defining "variable."  A matrix, fundamentally, is a collection of variables arranged in rows and columns.  Therefore, the calculation depends critically on whether we intend to compute the standard deviation across all elements, row-wise, or column-wise.  My experience in developing high-performance numerical computation libraries has frequently highlighted this ambiguity;  incorrect assumptions about the intended scope of the calculation lead to erroneous results and significant debugging headaches. This response will clarify the methodology for each of these scenarios.

**1.  Standard Deviation across all Matrix Elements:**

This approach treats all the elements of the matrix as a single, large dataset.  We first compute the mean of all elements, and then calculate the standard deviation based on the squared differences from this mean.

The mathematical formula is straightforward:

σ = √[ Σᵢⱼ (xᵢⱼ - μ)² / (m*n -1) ]

Where:

* σ represents the standard deviation.
* xᵢⱼ represents the element in row *i* and column *j*.
* μ represents the mean of all elements.
* *m* represents the number of rows.
* *n* represents the number of columns.
* The denominator (m*n - 1) is used for sample standard deviation; (m*n) is used for population standard deviation.  The choice depends on the context.


**Code Example 1 (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

def matrix_std_all(matrix):
    """Calculates the standard deviation of all elements in a matrix.

    Args:
        matrix: A NumPy array representing the matrix.

    Returns:
        The standard deviation of all matrix elements.  Returns NaN if the matrix is empty or contains non-numeric values.
    """
    try:
        return np.std(matrix.flatten(), ddof=1) # ddof=1 for sample standard deviation
    except ValueError:
        return np.nan

#Example Usage
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
std_dev = matrix_std_all(matrix)
print(f"Standard deviation of all elements: {std_dev}")

empty_matrix = np.array([[]])
std_dev_empty = matrix_std_all(empty_matrix)
print(f"Standard deviation of an empty matrix: {std_dev_empty}") #Returns NaN

mixed_matrix = np.array([[1,2,'a'],[4,5,6]])
std_dev_mixed = matrix_std_all(mixed_matrix)
print(f"Standard deviation of a matrix with mixed types: {std_dev_mixed}") # Returns NaN

```

This Python code leverages NumPy's optimized functions for efficiency. The `flatten()` method converts the matrix into a 1D array, simplifying the calculation. The `ddof` parameter controls the degrees of freedom, allowing a choice between sample and population standard deviation. Error handling ensures the function gracefully handles empty or invalid matrices.


**2. Row-wise Standard Deviation:**

Here, we calculate the standard deviation for each row independently.  This produces a vector (1D array) of standard deviations, one for each row.

**Code Example 2 (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

def matrix_std_rows(matrix):
    """Calculates the standard deviation for each row in a matrix.

    Args:
        matrix: A NumPy array representing the matrix.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array of row-wise standard deviations. Returns an empty array if the input is empty or contains non-numeric values.
    """
    try:
        return np.std(matrix, axis=1, ddof=1) # axis=1 specifies row-wise operation
    except ValueError:
        return np.array([])

#Example Usage
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
row_std_dev = matrix_std_rows(matrix)
print(f"Row-wise standard deviations: {row_std_dev}")

empty_matrix = np.array([[]])
row_std_dev_empty = matrix_std_rows(empty_matrix)
print(f"Row-wise standard deviation of an empty matrix: {row_std_dev_empty}") #Returns an empty array

mixed_matrix = np.array([[1,2,'a'],[4,5,6]])
row_std_dev_mixed = matrix_std_rows(mixed_matrix)
print(f"Row-wise standard deviation of a matrix with mixed types: {row_std_dev_mixed}") # Returns an empty array
```

NumPy's `std()` function, with `axis=1`, efficiently computes the standard deviation along each row.  Error handling is again included for robustness.


**3. Column-wise Standard Deviation:**

Similar to row-wise calculation, this approach computes the standard deviation for each column independently, resulting in a column vector of standard deviations.


**Code Example 3 (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

def matrix_std_cols(matrix):
    """Calculates the standard deviation for each column in a matrix.

    Args:
        matrix: A NumPy array representing the matrix.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array of column-wise standard deviations. Returns an empty array if the input is empty or contains non-numeric values.

    """
    try:
        return np.std(matrix, axis=0, ddof=1) # axis=0 specifies column-wise operation
    except ValueError:
        return np.array([])

# Example Usage
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
col_std_dev = matrix_std_cols(matrix)
print(f"Column-wise standard deviations: {col_std_dev}")

empty_matrix = np.array([[]])
col_std_dev_empty = matrix_std_cols(empty_matrix)
print(f"Column-wise standard deviation of an empty matrix: {col_std_dev_empty}") #Returns an empty array

mixed_matrix = np.array([[1,2,'a'],[4,5,6]])
col_std_dev_mixed = matrix_std_cols(mixed_matrix)
print(f"Column-wise standard deviation of a matrix with mixed types: {col_std_dev_mixed}") # Returns an empty array
```

The only difference from the row-wise calculation is setting `axis=0`.  This specifies that the standard deviation should be computed along the columns.  Again, comprehensive error handling is included.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of matrix operations and numerical computation in Python, I recommend consulting a standard textbook on linear algebra and a comprehensive guide to NumPy.  Furthermore, exploring the documentation for scientific computing libraries in other languages, such as MATLAB or R, would broaden your perspective on efficient matrix manipulations.  Focusing on understanding the underlying mathematical principles will be far more beneficial in the long run than simply memorizing code snippets.  Pay close attention to the nuances of sample versus population standard deviation and the implications of choosing one over the other.  Finally, thorough testing and validation of your chosen method is crucial for ensuring accuracy and reliability in your results.
