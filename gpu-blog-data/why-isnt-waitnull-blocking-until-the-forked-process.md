The expectation that `wait(NULL)` will block until all forked child processes complete stems from a misunderstanding of its behavior within the context of multiple forked processes.  `wait(NULL)` only waits for the termination of a *single* child process.  This is crucial;  it does not inherently manage or track the lifecycle of multiple children simultaneously.  My experience debugging parallel processing pipelines across various Unix-like systems underscored this subtlety repeatedly.  Failing to recognize this distinction leads to race conditions and unpredictable program behavior.

The `wait()` system call, in its simplest form (`wait(NULL)`), suspends the calling process until one of its child processes terminates.  The `NULL` argument signifies that the calling process is indifferent to the specific process ID of the terminated child; it accepts the first available status.  Upon termination of a child, `wait(NULL)` returns the child's process ID and status.  However, if multiple children are forked, and only one terminates before the `wait(NULL)` call,  the call will return immediately, leaving other children running independently.  Consequently, a loop is needed to ensure all children's statuses are obtained.

This requires a strategic approach.  One cannot simply repeat `wait(NULL)` without consideration.  The process ID returned by `wait()` is critical for tracking which child has terminated.  Ignoring this results in undefined behavior; the system may return the same process ID repeatedly if other children are not yet terminated.  Error handling becomes paramount; a naive implementation could lead to resource leaks if child processes crash unexpectedly.

**Explanation:**

The fundamental issue lies in the asynchronous nature of process creation and termination.  Forking a process creates a separate, independent process with its own memory space and execution flow.  The parent and child processes operate concurrently. The parent process, after executing a `fork()`, continues execution immediately; it doesn't wait inherently for the child to finish.  Using `wait(NULL)` in a manner designed to handle multiple child processes incorrectly assumes synchronization.  The parent process's behavior is independent of the child's.  Only when a child exits does the system potentially notify the parent via the `wait()` system call. The system does *not* implicitly track every child process' status for the parent.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Handling of Multiple Children**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid1, pid2;

    pid1 = fork();
    if (pid1 == 0) {
        // Child 1 process
        printf("Child 1 executing...\n");
        sleep(2);
        exit(0);
    }

    pid2 = fork();
    if (pid2 == 0) {
        // Child 2 process
        printf("Child 2 executing...\n");
        sleep(3);
        exit(0);
    }

    wait(NULL); // Waits for only ONE child
    printf("Parent process continues after one child finishes\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the problem.  Only one child's completion is acknowledged before the parent proceeds, leaving the other child potentially still running.


**Example 2: Correct Handling using a Loop and Process ID Tracking**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid1, pid2;
    int status;

    pid1 = fork();
    if (pid1 == 0) {
        // Child 1
        printf("Child 1 executing...\n");
        sleep(2);
        exit(0);
    }

    pid2 = fork();
    if (pid2 == 0) {
        // Child 2
        printf("Child 2 executing...\n");
        sleep(3);
        exit(0);
    }

    while ((wait(&status) > 0)) {
        printf("Child process finished with status %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
    }

    printf("Parent process completed after all children finished\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This code iteratively waits for children using a `while` loop.  The `wait(&status)` call returns the PID of the terminated child, and this loop continues until `wait()` returns -1, indicating no more child processes to wait for.  The `WEXITSTATUS` macro extracts the child's exit status.  This approach properly handles multiple children.


**Example 3:  Robust Handling with Error Checking**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid1, pid2, wpid;
    int status;

    // ... (Forking code as in Example 2) ...

    while ((wpid = wait(&status)) > 0) {
        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child process %d finished with exit code %d\n", wpid, WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else if (WIFSIGNALED(status)) {
            printf("Child process %d terminated by signal %d\n", wpid, WTERMSIG(status));
        } else {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error in wait(): %s\n", strerror(errno));
        }
    }

    if (wpid == -1 && errno != ECHILD) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error in wait(): %s\n", strerror(errno));
    }

    printf("Parent process completed\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This robust version includes error checking. It explicitly verifies the return value of `wait()` and uses macros like `WIFEXITED`, `WEXITSTATUS`, `WIFSIGNALED`, and `WTERMSIG` to handle different termination scenarios, providing more informative output in case of errors or unexpected child process exits.  It also handles the case where `wait()` returns -1 due to reasons other than no children being left (e.g., an interrupt).

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago
*   The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition
*   Documentation for your specific operating system's system calls (e.g., man pages)


These resources provide detailed information about process management, signals, and system calls relevant to understanding and implementing robust concurrent processes in a Unix-like environment.  Thorough understanding of these concepts is essential to avoid the pitfalls illustrated in the first code example and build reliable, multi-process applications.
