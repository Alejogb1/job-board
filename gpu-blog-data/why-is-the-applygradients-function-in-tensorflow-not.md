The `apply_gradients()` function in TensorFlow, despite its apparent simplicity, can fail to update weight and bias variables due to nuanced interactions within the computational graph and how gradients are constructed and applied. My experience debugging neural network training pipelines, particularly during a period when I was transitioning from eager execution to graph-based execution, highlighted these common pitfalls, and I have observed this issue with surprising frequency even amongst experienced practitioners.

The core issue stems from the fact that `apply_gradients()` does not automatically infer or manage variable dependencies. Instead, it relies entirely on the explicit pairs of gradients and variables that are passed to it. If these pairs are not constructed correctly, the optimization step effectively becomes a no-op, leaving weights and biases unaltered. Crucially, this can manifest silently without triggering obvious errors, making the problem difficult to diagnose.

The root causes typically fall into a few categories. Firstly, the most common mistake is failing to compute gradients with respect to the correct variables. TensorFlow's automatic differentiation mechanism, based on recording operations performed using `tf.GradientTape`, requires that those operations directly involve the target variables. If the variables are used in operations outside the tape's context, or if intermediate tensors are used as inputs instead of the variables themselves, the computed gradients will be either zero or disconnected from the variables intended for updating. Secondly, if one manipulates variables in a way that breaks the computational graph's connection, such as assigning new `tf.Variable` instances to the same Python variable name, the optimizer will likely have a reference to old variables no longer in the forward pass, thus, gradients for new variables are not calculated with the existing tape. Finally, issues can arise when performing gradient clipping or transformations without carefully tracking the intended targets of the operation, causing the correct variables to be disassociated from the modified gradients before they are passed into `apply_gradients()`.

Let's illustrate with some code examples based on actual debugging scenarios.

**Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Calculation**

In this case, we use intermediate tensors instead of the variables themselves. This simulates an error where the user makes a common mistake of using the result of an operation, instead of the actual variable in the gradient calculation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define variables
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2)), name="weight")
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((2,)), name="bias")

# Define a simple function to operate on the variables
def linear_transform(x):
    x_transformed = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
    return x_transformed

# Input data
X = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Correct approach: using the original variables in the tape
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = linear_transform(X)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W, b]))

# Incorrect approach: using the result of operations
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred_incorrect = linear_transform(X)
    loss_incorrect = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred_incorrect)

    # Intentional error
    gradients_incorrect = tape.gradient(loss_incorrect, [y_pred_incorrect]) # This calculates gradients for the outputs, not variables.

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_incorrect, [W, b])) # Incorrect mapping, no gradient.

print("W after correct:", W.numpy())
print("W after incorrect:", W.numpy()) # W is unchanged after second operation
print("b after correct:", b.numpy())
print("b after incorrect:", b.numpy()) # b is unchanged after second operation

```

In the first part of the example, we calculate the gradients with respect to W and b correctly. The second part attempts to use the output of the `linear_transform` method `y_pred_incorrect` as the gradient target instead of the variables themselves.  This results in the `gradients_incorrect` list containing derivatives with respect to `y_pred_incorrect` (which should be \[1,1\] as there was simply a sum operation) . However, `apply_gradients` is passed `[W,b]` while the gradients is with respect to an unrelated object, leading to no change in W and b. This demonstrates that TensorFlow only updates the variables for which gradients are explicitly computed with respect to them.

**Example 2: Replacing Variables within the Scope**

Here, I demonstrate the impact of creating new `tf.Variable` objects when one intends to modify the existing variables. This often arises during complex model refactoring:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial variables
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2)), name="weight")
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((2,)), name="bias")

# Optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Initial forward pass and gradient calculations
def train_step():
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    X = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
    y_pred = tf.matmul(X, W) + b
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred)
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [W, b]))


print("W before new variable:", W.numpy())
print("b before new variable:", b.numpy())


train_step()

print("W after first step:", W.numpy())
print("b after first step:", b.numpy())


W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2)), name="weight") # Reassigning a new variable to W.
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((2,)), name="bias")  # Reassigning a new variable to b.

print("W after new variable:", W.numpy())
print("b after new variable:", b.numpy())


train_step() # Gradient will be calculated but applied to old tensors, not new ones.

print("W after second step:", W.numpy()) # W remains unchanged after second step.
print("b after second step:", b.numpy()) # b remains unchanged after second step.


```

The critical point is the re-assignment of `W` and `b` with new `tf.Variable` objects. Although the new variable has the same name (within the python scope), these represent new objects in TensorFlow, no longer associated with the previous training step. The next `train_step()` operation will compute gradients correctly based on the current computational graph but when `apply_gradients` runs, it will attempt to update the *old* variables which were associated with the optimizer. Therefore, W and b will *appear* unchanged after calling `apply_gradients` because, in reality, the old values were changed and not the current values. This illustrates that `apply_gradients()` works on references to the variables, not their names or scope.

**Example 3: Gradient Transformation Issues**

Finally, I'll highlight the consequences of modifying gradients without carefully maintaining their correspondence with the variable targets. This example demonstrates a scenario where one modifies the gradients in an intended way, but makes an unintentional error:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 2)), name="weight")
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((2,)), name="bias")

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

X = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = tf.matmul(X, W) + b
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])

clipped_gradients, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(gradients, clip_norm=1.0) # Attempting to perform clipping on gradient but not applying it on the correct variable.

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W, b])) # original, unclipped gradients being used

print("W after unclipped application", W.numpy())

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = tf.matmul(X, W) + b
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W,b]) # compute new gradient.
clipped_gradients, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(gradients, clip_norm=1.0) # Clipping

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_gradients, [W, b])) # clipped gradients being used

print("W after clipped application", W.numpy())

```

Here, while we do compute and clip the gradients via `tf.clip_by_global_norm`, the original, unclipped `gradients` variable are passed to `apply_gradients` on the first operation. This leads to the weights being modified using the unclipped gradients. Only when we pass the correct `clipped_gradients` to `apply_gradients` is the intended clipping performed. Note that the `_` variable is the norm of the gradients (which is not needed), but the error lies in not using the modified gradient object after clipping. This illustrates that any manipulations to the gradients must be done in a way that does not disconnect the correct target variable with its intended gradient, even after applying some transforms.

In summary, the reasons `apply_gradients` may appear to not update variables revolve around incorrect calculation, breaking the computational graph, or incorrect handling of gradient transforms. Proper debugging requires meticulous attention to how variables are used within the gradient tape and how gradients are subsequently manipulated, ensuring that the correct pairings of gradients and variables are provided to the optimizer. I found that a thorough review of each forward and backward pass, especially when refactoring existing code, is crucial to prevent this common error.

For further resources, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on variable usage, gradient tape, and optimizers. The TensorFlow tutorials often offer detailed walkthroughs of model training which can highlight these subtle issues, particularly in the context of distributed training. Additionally, examining open source projects on GitHub that implement custom training loops could offer practical examples and insights into the correct patterns for working with `apply_gradients`. Furthermore, research papers on deep learning often provide valuable insights on the underlying math which clarifies the mechanics of backpropagation and optimization which can be useful in avoiding common pitfalls with TensorFlow's implementation.
