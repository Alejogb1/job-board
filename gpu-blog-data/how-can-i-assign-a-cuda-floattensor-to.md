Directly assigning a CUDA FloatTensor to a model's weight parameter in PyTorch requires understanding that parameter tensors are managed within the model's structure and require proper manipulation to maintain computation graph integrity. I've encountered this issue often during custom layer implementations and parameter initialization, where direct replacement can disrupt autograd. PyTorch’s automatic differentiation framework relies on a linked computational graph where parameters participate in gradient calculations; therefore, a straightforward substitution can lead to incorrect backpropagation or unexpected behavior. The correct approach involves either in-place manipulation of the parameter's data, or assigning a new tensor to the parameter directly, but this requires using PyTorch’s `nn.Parameter()` which takes care of integrating it with the autograd mechanism.

The challenge lies in the fact that a model's parameters are not simply standard tensors, but `torch.nn.Parameter` objects. These objects are subclassed from tensors but are treated differently by PyTorch, particularly in respect to autograd. A direct assignment `model.weight = cuda_tensor` replaces the `Parameter` object with just a tensor, losing track of the parameter within the model, and ultimately preventing the proper calculation of gradients. We need to either update the underlying data of the parameter tensor or assign a new parameter instance.

**Explanation**

When you define a model with layers, such as a linear layer (`nn.Linear`), PyTorch automatically creates and manages the weight and bias parameters as instances of `torch.nn.Parameter`. These are tensors that are implicitly registered with the module and participate in the autograd tracking. You can access these parameters using attribute access (e.g., `model.weight` or `model.bias`). The primary concern arises when you attempt to replace this parameter with a raw `torch.FloatTensor`. Since these operations disrupt the autograd mechanisms the desired result of optimizing these parameters is not achieved.

The correct way to assign a CUDA FloatTensor involves two methods: modifying the underlying data tensor of the existing parameter or using `nn.Parameter` to encapsulate the new tensor when replacing the entire `nn.Parameter`. The underlying data tensor can be modified via the `data` property of a Parameter. The `data` property is a tensor itself. Modifications on this tensor modify the tensor of the parameter.

**Code Examples**

**Example 1: In-Place Modification using `data`**

This method manipulates the existing parameter’s underlying data tensor, preserving the connection with the model's computation graph. It's preferred when the dimensions and type of the desired CUDA tensor match those of the existing parameter. This modification is done in place, so other objects will immediately reflect this change.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume we have a simple linear model on CUDA
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Create an instance of the model and move it to CUDA
model = SimpleModel().cuda()

# Create a new CUDA FloatTensor with same shape as the model weight.
# Here we are just using random values, but in practice this will be from
# the specific weight initialization desired.
new_weight_data = torch.randn(5, 10, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float)

# This is correct approach: modify the parameter’s underlying data.
model.linear.weight.data = new_weight_data

# Verify the new value by printing some of the weight values
print(model.linear.weight.data[0, :5])
```

*Commentary:* In this example, instead of directly assigning a new tensor to `model.linear.weight`, we access its `data` attribute and replace the tensor with the content of a newly created CUDA tensor, matching the model's weight dimension. By performing this in place modification, we do not disrupt the autograd mechanisms. The changes are immediately visible when accessing `model.linear.weight`. This prevents breaking of the computation graph and will allow correct backpropagation, as if the `model.linear.weight` had been initialized to those values in the first place.

**Example 2: Replacing the Parameter using `nn.Parameter`**

This method replaces the entire `nn.Parameter` object, which is necessary when the shape or dtype of the new tensor differs from that of the original parameter.  This replacement correctly re-integrates the new tensor with the model's autograd mechanism using `nn.Parameter`.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume we have a simple linear model on CUDA
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


# Create an instance of the model and move it to CUDA
model = SimpleModel().cuda()

# Create a new CUDA FloatTensor with a different shape
new_weight_data = torch.randn(5, 10, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float)

# Correct approach for replacing parameters using nn.Parameter
model.linear.weight = nn.Parameter(new_weight_data)

# Verify the new value
print(model.linear.weight.data[0, :5])
```

*Commentary:*  Here, the old weight parameter is replaced entirely with a new one. We encapsulate the new tensor inside `nn.Parameter()` before assigning it to `model.linear.weight`. This ensures that the model correctly tracks the new weight tensor as a parameter subject to gradient computation. This approach is necessary when dealing with tensor replacement where dimensions or data types are not consistent with the initial parameter's specification. This also prevents breaking of the computation graph and will allow correct backpropagation.

**Example 3: Modifying Parameters in a Custom Module**

This example demonstrates how these techniques can be applied within a custom module class, a common scenario when building complex neural networks with custom components.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
      super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
      self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(output_size, input_size, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float))
      self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(output_size, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float))

  def forward(self, x):
      return torch.matmul(x, self.weight.transpose(0, 1)) + self.bias

# Instantiate the custom layer and a base model
custom_layer = CustomLayer(10, 5)
model = nn.Sequential(custom_layer).cuda()

# Create new weight and bias values on CUDA
new_weight_data = torch.randn(5, 10, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float)
new_bias_data = torch.ones(5, device='cuda', dtype=torch.float)

# Modify the weight and bias parameters correctly
custom_layer.weight.data = new_weight_data
custom_layer.bias.data = new_bias_data

# Verify that the values have changed
print("New Weight", custom_layer.weight.data[0, :5])
print("New Bias", custom_layer.bias.data)

```
*Commentary:* This demonstrates how to initialize parameters inside a custom layer, as well as how to modify them in place using the `.data` attribute. This example provides a more realistic scenario showing that the same techniques used for modification or replacement also apply to custom layers. Initializing the weights using `nn.Parameter` is crucial for these weights to be seen as trainable parameters, and that these parameters can be updated using the autograd mechanism.

**Resource Recommendations**

To further enhance understanding of this process, I recommend consulting the PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on the `nn.Module` class, `nn.Parameter` class, and the Autograd package. Studying these areas provides a deeper understanding of how tensors and parameters interact within the framework. I also found it beneficial to review existing open source PyTorch projects. Observing how developers structure their code, especially when it involves parameter initialization and manipulation is highly instructive. Pay close attention to scenarios that directly modify model weights, as this will reinforce the knowledge required to perform such operations correctly. Lastly, understanding of basic concepts of gradient descent and backpropagation can clarify how autograd operates and why the correct handling of parameters is paramount.
