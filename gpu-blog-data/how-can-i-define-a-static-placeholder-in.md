Static placeholders in TensorFlow, while not directly supported in the way one might initially expect from a concept of ‘static’ variables in other programming contexts, can be effectively simulated through the strategic use of TensorFlow constants. My experience working on numerous large-scale deep learning models within a high-performance computing environment has consistently shown that true static placeholders – that is, placeholders whose values are fixed during the graph construction and cannot be altered through feed dictionaries during execution – are not part of the core TensorFlow paradigm. Instead, the desired effect of having fixed values that are part of the computational graph is better accomplished by leveraging TensorFlow constants. The following sections will detail how and why this approach works.

In TensorFlow, a placeholder's fundamental purpose is to act as a promise: it signifies that a value of a specific type and shape will be supplied later during the execution phase. This design supports flexibility in model construction, allowing data to be fed into the graph at runtime rather than being hardcoded into the graph itself. When a placeholder is defined without any specific value initially, we anticipate supplying that value through a feed dictionary when we execute the computational graph. This capability is indispensable for training where the input data and targets change each iteration. However, if we want a value that never changes and is part of the computation from graph definition, a placeholder is not the correct choice. Attempting to fix a placeholder's value before runtime defeats the placeholder's inherent design.

TensorFlow constants, conversely, are explicitly intended to represent fixed values within the computational graph. These values are incorporated directly into the graph's definition and do not require separate feeding mechanisms during runtime. They provide the static, unchanging aspect which, in your question, I suspect you're trying to achieve with a 'static placeholder'. Once a constant is defined, its value is immutable and always available during computations. Therefore, if one needs a static value within a TensorFlow graph, defining a constant rather than relying on a placeholder with a fixed value should be the chosen route. The key distinction is that placeholders require external data input during execution, while constants are inherent parts of the computation defined statically.

Here are three code examples illustrating how constants serve the role of static placeholders effectively within different scenarios:

**Example 1: Static Bias in a Linear Transformation**

This code segment demonstrates how a constant can act as a fixed bias term in a linear transformation. Rather than defining a placeholder for the bias and requiring it to be fed each execution (with the same value each time, mimicking a static variable), we use a constant that is baked into the graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input data (placeholder)
input_data = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 2], name="input")

# Define weights (variable - can be trained)
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=[2, 3]), name="weights")

# Define a static bias using a constant
static_bias = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32, name="static_bias")


# Perform the linear transformation with static bias
linear_output = tf.matmul(input_data, weights) + static_bias


# Execute the graph
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    input_values = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]]
    result = sess.run(linear_output, feed_dict={input_data: input_values})

    print("Output:", result)

```

In this example, `static_bias` will remain `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` for every execution, acting as a pre-defined value in the computation graph. The placeholder `input_data` is fed with different input values for each execution while `static_bias` remains unchanged. The key point is that `static_bias` is constant and needs no feeding.

**Example 2: Fixed Scalar Value for Multiplication**

This example uses a scalar constant to multiply the output of a neuron layer, demonstrating how a fixed scaling factor can be integrated. The constant here effectively behaves like a static multiplier.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable tensor
variable_tensor = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=[4, 4]), name='variable_tensor')

# Define a static scalar multiplier as a constant
scalar_multiplier = tf.constant(2.5, dtype=tf.float32, name="scalar_multiplier")

# Apply multiplication
scaled_tensor = variable_tensor * scalar_multiplier

# Execute graph
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    result = sess.run(scaled_tensor)
    print("Scaled Output:", result)
```
In this code, the multiplication of `variable_tensor` by the constant `scalar_multiplier` is performed. The value `2.5` is hardcoded within the computation graph and cannot be altered at runtime, thus serving as a static factor.

**Example 3:  Fixed Lookup Table for Embedding**

Here, we demonstrate how a constant can represent a fixed lookup table, which can be particularly useful for embeddings. This constant will remain static and accessible throughout the graph execution, avoiding repeated feeding.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input indices (placeholder)
input_indices = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None], name="input_indices")

# Define static lookup table as a constant
lookup_table = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0], [7.0,8.0]], dtype=tf.float32, name="lookup_table")

# Perform the lookup
embeddings = tf.gather(lookup_table, input_indices)

# Execute the graph
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    indices = [0, 2, 1]
    result = sess.run(embeddings, feed_dict={input_indices: indices})

    print("Embeddings:", result)
```

In this third example, the constant lookup table `lookup_table` is defined with fixed embeddings. The `tf.gather` function then looks up embeddings based on the provided `input_indices`. This example shows that a fixed set of parameters can be represented as a constant and not need feeding via placeholder mechanisms.

In summary, using constants is the method to incorporate truly static values into your TensorFlow computational graphs. A placeholder, by its very definition, requires a value during the execution. The flexibility of placeholders makes them suited for variables whose values vary by execution. When a value is intended to be inherently static during graph creation, the correct tool in TensorFlow is a constant.

For learning more about this, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections covering tensors, constants, and graph execution. Reading through practical examples and tutorials on deep learning with TensorFlow can further illuminate the proper utilization of constants. Moreover, reviewing the TensorFlow API reference for operations on tensors, especially `tf.constant`, will deepen understanding. Books focusing on the practical implementation of neural networks with TensorFlow are also excellent resources. These materials provide a complete understanding and demonstrate practical application of static value representation in the framework.
