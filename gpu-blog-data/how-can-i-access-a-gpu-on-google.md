Accessing a GPU on Google AI Platform's `BASIC_GPU` tier within a TensorFlow program requires careful consideration of environment setup and resource allocation.  My experience working on large-scale machine learning projects, particularly those involving image recognition and natural language processing, has highlighted the crucial role of proper configuration in achieving optimal performance.  Specifically,  the `BASIC_GPU` tier, while offering GPU acceleration, necessitates explicit declaration within your TensorFlow code to ensure the computation is offloaded to the hardware.  Failure to do so will result in computation defaulting to the CPU, negating the performance benefits of the GPU.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core principle is ensuring TensorFlow utilizes the available CUDA-capable GPU.  This involves two key steps:  first, verifying the environment's GPU availability and CUDA configuration; second, instructing TensorFlow to use the GPU during session instantiation or within the model's execution graph. Google's AI Platform handles much of the underlying infrastructure, but the TensorFlow program itself must request and utilize the assigned GPU.  Incorrect configuration will leave your program running on the CPU, a significantly slower alternative for computationally intensive tasks like deep learning model training.  This often manifests as unexpectedly long training times or inadequate performance compared to expected benchmarks.

Verifying the GPU's presence is often achieved through system-level commands accessible within the Google Cloud environment, specifically the tools provided within your chosen notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter).  Once confirmed,  TensorFlow must be instructed to utilize this device.  This is typically done by setting a specific device, either explicitly within a TensorFlow session or by employing the `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices` function (in TensorFlow 2.x and later).  For older versions of TensorFlow,  session configuration is the primary method.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow 2.x with `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Verify GPU availability (replace with your specific system command if necessary)
!nvidia-smi

# Explicitly select the GPU
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# ... your TensorFlow model definition and training code here ...
model = tf.keras.Sequential([ ... ]) # Your model architecture
model.compile(...) # Your compilation parameters
model.fit(x_train, y_train, ...) # Your training loop

```

This example first verifies the GPU's existence using `nvidia-smi` (a common command for NVIDIA GPUs).  It then uses `tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices` to retrieve available GPUs and `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` for dynamic memory allocation. This crucial step allows TensorFlow to allocate GPU memory on demand, preventing out-of-memory errors. The `logical_gpus` variable shows the number of logical GPUs available to TensorFlow. The model definition and training then proceeds, with TensorFlow implicitly utilizing the selected GPU.

**Example 2: TensorFlow 1.x with Session Configuration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Verify GPU availability (replace with your specific system command if necessary)
!nvidia-smi

# Configure the session to use the GPU
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.log_device_placement = True  # Optional: Log device placement for debugging
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True # Allow TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory
sess = tf.Session(config=config)

# ... your TensorFlow model definition and training code here ...
with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
    # Initialize variables, build your graph and run operations within this context.
    # For instance:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

```

This demonstrates the TensorFlow 1.x approach.  The `tf.ConfigProto` object allows specifying session parameters.  `gpu_options.allow_growth = True` is critical for preventing excessive memory allocation, particularly relevant for `BASIC_GPU` tier's limited resources. `log_device_placement = True` is invaluable during debugging, showing which operations are executed on which devices.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple GPUs (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (GPU availability verification as in Example 1) ...

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([ ... ])
    model.compile(...)
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, ...)
```

This example (using TensorFlow 2.x) showcases a more advanced scenario.  `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` enables data parallelism across multiple GPUs. This is relevant for larger models or datasets where the single `BASIC_GPU` might be insufficient.  However,  it's important to note that the `BASIC_GPU` tier typically only provides a single GPU.  Including this example emphasizes scaling considerations for future projects.  The code requires a suitable dataset and model for efficient data parallelism, implying more sophisticated model architectures and dataset management techniques, beyond the scope of the immediate problem.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on GPU usage and distributed training, are essential resources.  Additionally,  refer to the Google Cloud Platform documentation for AI Platform's specifics on environment setup and hardware configurations.  Finally, I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the CUDA Toolkit documentation from NVIDIA, as understanding CUDA's role in GPU computation is fundamental to maximizing performance within TensorFlow.  Understanding the nuances of memory management (particularly crucial for limited GPU resources) is a key factor in successfully deploying and training your models.  Thorough examination of these resources will equip you with the knowledge to troubleshoot issues effectively and optimize performance.
