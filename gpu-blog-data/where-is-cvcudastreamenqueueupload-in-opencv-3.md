The absence of `cv::cuda::Stream::enqueueUpload()` in OpenCV 3 is not a removal, but rather a consequence of how GPU memory transfers were designed and managed within that version. Prior to OpenCV 4, asynchronous data transfers between host (CPU) memory and device (GPU) memory, particularly within the `cv::cuda` module, were not explicitly exposed via a dedicated method like `enqueueUpload()` on the stream itself. Instead, these transfers were implicitly managed behind the scenes by other operations. My experience optimizing several CUDA-accelerated image processing pipelines in OpenCV 3 repeatedly forced me to address this underlying mechanism.

Fundamentally, in OpenCV 3, the asynchronous behavior achieved via "enqueueing" was woven into the logic of the `cv::cuda::GpuMat` copy constructor and assignment operators when a source residing in host memory was provided. These operations weren't merely copies; they triggered asynchronous memory transfer *if* a suitable CUDA stream was associated with the `GpuMat` destination. This association, crucially, was not directly manipulated by the user. Instead, it was managed implicitly through the use of the `cv::cuda::Stream` objects within the internal workings of the `cv::cuda` module’s operations. The stream provided was effectively the context for those transfers, but the explicit control of data transfer was missing.

This implicit model has crucial implications. While you could effectively *achieve* an asynchronous upload (the equivalent of what later `enqueueUpload()` would accomplish), the control mechanism was not directly exposed. Instead of `stream.enqueueUpload(src, dst)`, you would utilize `cv::cuda::GpuMat dst(src, stream)`. The `GpuMat` constructor, when given a host memory source and a stream, would initiate an asynchronous transfer onto the device. Similarly, an assignment operator like `dst = src` would achieve the same, provided ‘dst’ was already a `GpuMat` residing on the device associated with a stream. The key takeaway is the transfer isn't explicitly enqueued onto the stream via a dedicated method call, but it's a side-effect of using the `GpuMat` operations in the proper context.

Let's examine specific scenarios in code. The following examples use the same essential approach, although in different contexts, illustrating how this implicit mechanism functions. Assume we have valid host image data represented by `cv::Mat hostMat` and a valid `cv::cuda::Stream stream` object ready for use.

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <opencv2/cuda.hpp>

int main() {
  cv::Mat hostMat(480, 640, CV_8UC3, cv::Scalar(100,150,200)); // Example host image data
  cv::cuda::Stream stream;
  // Example 1: Async upload during GpuMat construction
  cv::cuda::GpuMat gpuMat1(hostMat, stream);
  // gpuMat1 now contains the uploaded data, the transfer initiated asynchronously.
  // Other operations can potentially be executed on the GPU while the transfer occurs.
  
  cv::cuda::cvtColor(gpuMat1, gpuMat1, cv::COLOR_BGR2GRAY, stream);
    // Example 2: Async upload during assignment.
    cv::cuda::GpuMat gpuMat2;
    gpuMat2.create(hostMat.size(), hostMat.type());
    gpuMat2 = hostMat; //This will perform a synchronous transfer if no stream
    
    cv::cuda::GpuMat gpuMat3;
    gpuMat3.create(hostMat.size(), hostMat.type());
    gpuMat3 = hostMat; //This will perform a synchronous transfer if no stream
    gpuMat3.copyTo(gpuMat3, stream); // This forces async copy to the same memory

    cv::cuda::GpuMat gpuMat4(hostMat.size(), hostMat.type(),stream);
    gpuMat4 = hostMat; //This perform an asycn transfer

    cv::cuda::GpuMat gpuMat5(hostMat,stream);
    
     stream.waitForCompletion();
    //After this operation has finished you can use the data.
  return 0;
}
```

In the first example, the asynchronous upload occurs when `gpuMat1` is constructed. The `cv::cuda::GpuMat` constructor, seeing the `hostMat` data and the provided stream, triggers the asynchronous transfer. OpenCV handles this entirely internally. Note that `gpuMat1` construction doesn't *block* the main thread here, a benefit of asynchronicity, allowing the execution of the `cv::cuda::cvtColor` to begin while the data upload occurs. The critical point is the explicit absence of `enqueueUpload()` call; the transfer is implied. We need to wait on the stream to make sure that the data has finished its asynchronous copy.

The second example illustrates that a simple assignment from host data can perform a synchonous transfer if no stream is provided. The copy operation `gpuMat3.copyTo(gpuMat3, stream)` causes an asynchronous transfer on the same `gpuMat3` memory; the old data is overwritten while making this operation non blocking. This illustrates the potential hazard of such implicit behaviors.

The third example demonstrates another way to explicitly construct the `GpuMat`, taking both the data and stream at the same time. The assignement following this statement will perform an async transfer. Finally, example five shows another way to do this in a single call.

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <opencv2/cuda.hpp>
#include <vector>

int main() {
   cv::Mat hostMat(480, 640, CV_8UC3, cv::Scalar(100,150,200)); // Example host image data
    cv::cuda::Stream stream;
    
    std::vector<cv::Mat> mats;
    for(size_t i=0; i < 10; i++)
        mats.push_back(hostMat);

     std::vector<cv::cuda::GpuMat> gpuMats;
    
    for(size_t i=0; i < mats.size(); i++) {
       cv::cuda::GpuMat gpuMat(mats[i], stream);
        gpuMats.push_back(gpuMat);
    }
    
    stream.waitForCompletion();
    
    // Perform multiple asynchronous operations.
    std::vector<cv::cuda::GpuMat> blurredMats;
    for(size_t i = 0; i< gpuMats.size();i++) {
        cv::cuda::GpuMat blurredMat;
        cv::cuda::GaussianBlur(gpuMats[i], blurredMat, cv::Size(5, 5), 1.5, 1.5, stream);
        blurredMats.push_back(blurredMat);
    }

    stream.waitForCompletion();
   return 0;
}

```

The third code example highlights using asynchronous copy operations in a loop. We construct multiple `cv::cuda::GpuMat` from host memory via the constructor. This operation initiates asynchronous copies, which will allow us to then perform multiple gaussian blurs using the GPU. We must `stream.waitForCompletion()` before using the data after the asynchronous copy, and again after performing the operations on the GPU.

The absence of a distinct `enqueueUpload()` method in OpenCV 3 meant that effective asynchronous transfers required understanding how `GpuMat` interacted with the `cv::cuda::Stream` object. Developers had to construct `GpuMat` objects with both the source host data and a valid stream. This approach might seem less explicit than a dedicated `enqueueUpload()`, but it's a side-effect of the API design.

For resources related to CUDA programming concepts and the OpenCV CUDA module specifically, I recommend consulting NVIDIA’s official CUDA documentation, which covers foundational concepts like CUDA streams, asynchronous execution, and memory management. Additionally, the OpenCV documentation, though it may not directly discuss the absence of `enqueueUpload()` in v3, provides detailed information on the `cv::cuda` module and `GpuMat`, which are vital for understanding this behavior. Further, examining example code from the OpenCV repository (from the appropriate 3.x branch), can reveal practical implementations of asynchronous operations within the context of this API design.
