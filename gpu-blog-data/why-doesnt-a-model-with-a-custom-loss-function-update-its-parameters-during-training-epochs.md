Custom loss functions, while offering the flexibility to address specific modeling needs, frequently present challenges when it comes to backpropagation and parameter updates. The core issue typically stems from an incorrect implementation of the gradient calculation within the loss function definition, a problem I've directly encountered several times over the course of my work on predictive models. The training process in neural networks relies on the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters. These gradients then drive the optimization process, modifying the weights and biases to minimize the loss. If this gradient calculation is flawed or missing within the custom loss function, the backpropagation step cannot function effectively, resulting in a model that essentially remains unchanged during training.

A crucial aspect to understand is that frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch automatically compute gradients for built-in loss functions. However, when defining custom functions, the responsibility of gradient computation falls entirely on the developer. Failure to correctly define how the loss changes with respect to the model's predictions means the optimization algorithm is unable to discern the direction in which to adjust the parameters. Consequently, even if the loss itself is calculated correctly, its impact on the model's learning process is negligible.

There are several common reasons this incorrect gradient calculation occurs. Perhaps the most frequent stems from a naive implementation, where the custom loss is computed but the necessary derivatives, according to the chain rule, are not explicitly defined. Another scenario arises when operations within the custom loss function are not differentiable within the automatic differentiation framework. For example, using operations like comparisons (e.g., `if` statements, `>`, `<`) or other non-smooth operators without accounting for their impact on the gradient can effectively halt the flow of gradient information. These can be problematic if you do not provide a workaround to ensure differentiability.

A third issue is not directly related to the gradient itself but rather to the way data is handled. The data that goes into and comes out of the loss function must remain as tensors and part of the computation graph. Accidental detachment of these tensors or operations on them that take them out of the computational graph will prevent gradients from flowing back into the model parameters.

Let me illustrate these points with a few scenarios, drawing on previous experiences.

**Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Definition**

Suppose I needed a custom loss that penalizes predictions that are too far from a target value more heavily than those that are closer. I might be tempted to define a loss function like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_custom_loss_naive(y_true, y_pred):
  error = y_pred - y_true
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(error) ** 3) # cubic error
```

This function calculates the cubic absolute error, a reasonable penalization. However, if we were to use this directly without defining how this impacts the gradient, TensorFlow’s automatic gradient computation cannot propagate the effect of this error backward. To properly implement the gradient, the framework needs explicit definition using TensorFlow's gradient tapes, which we would generally do within the training loop rather than within a defined loss function. Alternatively, we could define the loss function such that the gradient is generated automatically by the chosen framework:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, reduction=tf.keras.losses.Reduction.AUTO, name='my_custom_loss'):
        super().__init__(reduction=reduction, name=name)
    
    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        error = y_pred - y_true
        return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(error) ** 3) # cubic error
```
Here I inherit from `tf.keras.losses.Loss` and provide the calculation within the `call` method. This allows TensorFlow to automatically calculate the gradients based on the operation within. This example showcases that while mathematically, the loss function might look correct, not accounting for how it interfaces with the underlying automatic differentiation engine is the cause of lack of parameter updates.

**Example 2: Non-Differentiable Operations**

Consider the scenario where I want to penalize predictions based on whether they're above or below a threshold.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_threshold_loss(y_true, y_pred, threshold=0.5):
    loss = tf.where(y_pred > threshold, tf.abs(y_pred - y_true) * 2, tf.abs(y_pred - y_true) * 0.5)
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)
```
This function seems intuitively correct—it penalizes predictions above the threshold more heavily than those below. However, using `tf.where` creates a discrete jump in the loss function. Automatic differentiation relies on differentiability and so we must provide a smooth, differentiable alternative. Specifically, the derivative of `tf.where` at `y_pred = threshold` is undefined since the function jumps at this point. The function does not return a gradient through that part of the computation graph. A smoother equivalent could be defined using sigmoid as a differentiable approximation for the discrete nature of the conditional.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_threshold_loss_smooth(y_true, y_pred, threshold=0.5, steepness=10.0):
    sigmoid_weight = tf.sigmoid((y_pred - threshold) * steepness)
    loss = tf.abs(y_pred - y_true) * (1.5 * sigmoid_weight + 0.5 * (1 - sigmoid_weight))
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)
```

This version, instead of abruptly changing the penalization, smoothly transitions from the 'below threshold' penalty to the 'above threshold' penalty using a sigmoid function, making backpropagation work correctly. I’ve found this approach to be particularly useful when dealing with custom penalty landscapes. The `steepness` variable helps adjust how abruptly the function transitions across the threshold.

**Example 3: Detaching Tensors**

Another problem can occur in the loss function where intermediate results are inadvertently removed from the computation graph. For example, I have seen where people convert the tensorflow tensors to numpy arrays inside a loss function for additional processing:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def my_loss_detaching_tensor(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred_np = y_pred.numpy()
    y_true_np = y_true.numpy()
    
    modified_pred = y_pred_np * 2 # example calculation done with numpy
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(modified_pred - y_true_np))
    return loss
```
In this function I convert the predictions and targets to NumPy arrays before performing the calculations. While this will compute a loss value, since operations are now happening outside of the TensorFlow graph there are no valid gradients from this computation to be backpropagated to the model parameters. Therefore, no updates occur. The solution in these scenarios is to perform all calculations with TensorFlow tensors:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_loss_tensor_operations(y_true, y_pred):    
    modified_pred = y_pred * 2 # example calculation done with tensors
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(modified_pred - y_true))
    return loss
```

By performing the operation directly with TensorFlow tensors, we ensure that they remain within the computation graph. This enables backpropagation and ensures the model can learn from the defined loss.

In conclusion, parameter updates not occurring in models with custom loss functions can be attributed to incorrect gradient handling, non-differentiable operations, or accidental detachment of tensors from the computational graph. Carefully crafting custom loss functions by ensuring their differentiability and proper inclusion in the computation graph will remedy the described training issues.

For further study, I recommend exploring resources covering the following topics:

*   **Automatic Differentiation:** Investigate how backpropagation and automatic differentiation function within your chosen deep learning framework. Understanding these mechanisms is foundational for creating effective custom loss functions.
*   **Tensor Operations:** Familiarize yourself with the mathematical operations available for tensors, ensuring that you do not inadvertently leave the computation graph during loss definition.
*   **Custom Layers and Gradient Tapes:** Learning how to use these tools within your chosen framework can help you debug the gradient flow, and will help you write functions that provide the gradient information needed.
*   **Mathematical Differentiation:** A solid understanding of differentiation is essential for defining correct loss functions and ensuring that the gradients that are being calculated are accurate.

By meticulously addressing these issues, and continually deepening ones understanding of the underlying mathematical principles, one can create impactful custom loss functions that drive optimal model learning.
