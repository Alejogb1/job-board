Model parallelism, in the context of Keras, addresses the challenge of training or inferencing models exceeding the memory capacity of a single GPU or even a single machine.  My experience building large-scale recommendation systems highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  We consistently encountered models with embedding layers of such size that even multiple high-end GPUs struggled to accommodate them.  This necessitates distributing the model's computation across multiple devices.  While Keras doesn't natively support model parallelism as seamlessly as data parallelism (handled by `tf.distribute.Strategy`), several strategies effectively achieve it.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core principle behind model parallelism in Keras involves partitioning the model's layers across different devices.  Each device holds and processes a subset of the model's weights and computations.  This differs from data parallelism, where the entire model is replicated across multiple devices, and each processes a different subset of the training data.  Effective model parallelism requires careful consideration of model architecture and communication overhead between devices.  Strategies often involve using custom training loops or leveraging frameworks that build upon Keras, offering better multi-device support.

One crucial aspect is managing communication between devices.  Since different parts of the model reside on separate devices, efficient mechanisms for exchanging intermediate activations are necessary.  This inter-device communication often introduces latency, impacting overall performance.  Therefore, careful design, minimizing data transfer, and selecting appropriate communication backends (like NCCL or Horovod) are vital for optimizing the process.

Another critical point is ensuring proper synchronization.  If multiple devices update shared weights concurrently without proper coordination, the training process may become unstable or produce incorrect results.  Synchronization mechanisms, usually built into the chosen distributed training framework, are needed to maintain consistency.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to model parallelism with Keras, focusing on the conceptual aspects rather than complete, production-ready code.  Adapting these concepts to a specific use case requires careful consideration of the model architecture and the chosen distributed training framework.

**Example 1:  Using TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` (with limitations):**

While primarily intended for data parallelism, `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` can be adapted for limited forms of model parallelism. This approach is suitable for models with clearly separable sections that can be independently trained.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    # Define model with clearly separable parts. For instance, a two-tower model:
    model_part1 = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
    ])
    model_part2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])

    # Combine parts (this would need appropriate data splitting and merging)
    # ... (Implementation for combining model outputs would go here)

    # Compile and train the model parts separately or together in a custom training loop
    # ... (Custom training loop to manage data flow and gradient updates)
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases the rudimentary use of `MirroredStrategy`. The limitation is its less-than-optimal handling of complex inter-part dependencies.  A truly partitioned model needs more sophisticated communication mechanisms, which `MirroredStrategy` doesn't directly provide.

**Example 2:  Custom Training Loop with Horovod:**

Horovod is a highly efficient distributed training framework.  It works well with Keras by enabling custom training loops that manage model partitioning and communication explicitly.

```python
import horovod.tensorflow as hvd
import tensorflow as tf

hvd.init()

# Assuming model is already defined and partitioned (e.g., layer-wise)
# model_part = get_model_part(hvd.rank())  # Function to retrieve the correct part

# Create optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
optimizer = hvd.DistributedOptimizer(optimizer)

# Custom training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            # Process data specific to this device
            outputs = model_part(batch)
            loss = compute_loss(outputs)

        grads = tape.gradient(loss, model_part.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model_part.trainable_variables))

    # Optional allreduce to sync model weights (Horovod handles this efficiently)
    hvd.broadcast_global_variables(0)
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates a custom training loop with Horovod managing communication and gradient aggregation across devices.  The `get_model_part` function (not shown) would handle the partitioning of the model across different ranks.  This approach offers greater control but requires more manual implementation.

**Example 3:  TensorFlow Extended (TFX) with a Pipelined Model:**

For truly massive models, employing a pipeline-like architecture with TFX might be the most effective strategy. This requires breaking the model into distinct stages, each running on different devices.

```python
#  (Simplified illustration - full TFX implementation would be significantly more complex)
# Define the pipeline stages (each as a separate Keras model or callable)
stage1_model = create_stage1_model()
stage2_model = create_stage2_model()
# ...

# Deploy these stages to different devices/machines using TFX deployment tools
# ... (TFX deployment setup, handling data transfer and synchronization)

# Data flows through the pipeline sequentially
stage1_output = stage1_model(input_data)
stage2_output = stage2_model(stage1_output)
# ...
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates a high-level approach using TFX to manage a pipelined model.  TFX handles deployment, monitoring, and scalability.  It's best suited for scenarios demanding extreme scaling and complex model architectures. The detail is purposely omitted as a comprehensive example would require a substantial codebase.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow's official documentation on distributed training.
*   Horovod's documentation and tutorials.
*   Publications on model parallelism techniques in deep learning.
*   Comprehensive textbooks covering distributed systems and parallel computing.  These provide the theoretical foundations necessary to understand and optimize model parallelism.


In conclusion, while Keras doesn't directly support model parallelism in a simple manner, leveraging frameworks like Horovod or employing TFX for complex scenarios offers viable solutions.  Choosing the appropriate strategy depends heavily on the specific model architecture, the desired level of control, and the available computing resources.  The inherent complexity demands a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts and careful implementation to optimize performance and ensure correctness.
