The discrepancy between allowed HTTP and blocked HTTPS connections typically stems from misconfigurations within the network infrastructure, specifically concerning certificate validation and proxy settings.  Over my years working with network security at a large financial institution, I encountered this issue numerous times, often related to improperly configured firewalls or intermediate proxies that lack the necessary certificate authorities (CAs) in their trust stores. This fundamentally explains why an unencrypted HTTP connection—requiring no certificate validation—would succeed while its encrypted HTTPS counterpart fails.

**1.  Explanation of the Underlying Mechanisms**

HTTP and HTTPS, while sharing the same fundamental request-response model, differ critically in their security layers.  HTTP transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.  HTTPS, on the other hand, utilizes Transport Layer Security (TLS) – the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) – to encrypt the communication channel. This encryption relies on digital certificates issued by trusted CAs.  These certificates, essentially digital identities, verify the server's authenticity.  The client (e.g., a web browser) checks the certificate’s validity against its own built-in trust store or against the trust store of an intermediate proxy server.  If the certificate is invalid (e.g., expired, self-signed, or issued by an untrusted CA), the connection will be aborted.

The blocking of HTTPS connections, while allowing HTTP, directly implicates problems with this certificate validation process.  The network infrastructure—firewalls, proxies, or intermediate devices—is likely configured to only permit connections that pass a rigorous certificate verification.  This verification is absent in HTTP, allowing connections to proceed unchecked. The most common causes are:

* **Missing or Incomplete CA Certificates:** The intermediate proxy or firewall lacks the root or intermediate certificates required to validate the server's certificate.  This is particularly problematic with certificates from lesser-known or private CAs.
* **Incorrect Proxy Configuration:** If a proxy server is involved, its configuration might be faulty, failing to forward HTTPS requests correctly or to properly validate certificates. This often involves incorrect SSL-bumping or interception settings.
* **Firewall Rules:** Firewall rules may be excessively restrictive, explicitly blocking HTTPS traffic on specific ports (typically 443) without similar restrictions on HTTP (port 80).
* **Certificate Pinning Issues:**  While less common in this specific scenario, improperly implemented certificate pinning on the client-side can also lead to blocked HTTPS connections if the pinned certificate doesn't match the server's currently active certificate.

Troubleshooting involves systematically examining each of these areas.  Network administrators should check firewall logs, proxy server configurations, and certificate trust stores to pinpoint the source of the problem.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating Potential Issues and Solutions**

The following examples demonstrate potential scenarios in different programming languages, focusing on proxy settings and certificate validation challenges.  Remember, these are simplified examples to illustrate the concepts.  Real-world applications often require more robust error handling and security considerations.

**Example 1: Python with Incorrect Proxy Settings (requests library)**

```python
import requests

proxies = {
    'http': 'http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8080',
    'https': 'http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8080' #Incorrect: should likely be https
}

try:
    response = requests.get('https://www.example.com', proxies=proxies, verify=True) #Verify SSL certificate
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
    print(response.text)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This Python code uses the `requests` library.  The critical element is `verify=True`, which enables SSL certificate verification.  If the proxy is incorrectly configured to only handle HTTP, the HTTPS request will fail.  The error message will likely indicate a certificate validation error or a connection problem related to the proxy.  Correcting the `proxies` dictionary to use `'https'` appropriately resolves the issue if that is the root cause.

**Example 2: JavaScript with Insecure Context (fetch API)**

```javascript
fetch('https://www.example.com', {mode: 'no-cors'})
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.text();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

This JavaScript example uses the `fetch` API.  The `mode: 'no-cors'` option is crucial here.  It bypasses the standard CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) mechanisms that typically handle certificate validation in the browser context. While useful for very specific, limited tasks, this example demonstrates how bypassing security features can lead to a seemingly successful HTTP request while HTTPS fails due to stricter security protocols being in place.  Removing `mode: 'no-cors'` and ensuring the correct CORS configuration are necessary to resolve this specific example's problems.

**Example 3: Java with Self-Signed Certificate Handling**

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

// ... (TrustManager implementation to handle self-signed certificate) ...

SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, new TrustManager[]{new X509TrustManager() {
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) throws java.security.cert.CertificateException {
    }
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) throws java.security.cert.CertificateException {
    }
    public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
        return null;
    }
}}, new java.security.SecureRandom());

HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());

URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com");
HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
// ... (rest of the code to handle the connection) ...
```

This Java code snippet demonstrates how to handle self-signed certificates.  By creating a custom `TrustManager` that ignores certificate validation (`checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` are left empty), we can force a connection even with an invalid certificate.  However, this is extremely insecure and should only be used for development or testing purposes in tightly controlled environments.  For production, you must install the correct CA certificates in the Java trust store.  This example showcases how an overly permissive certificate handling approach could lead to successful HTTP connections while legitimate HTTPS connections are blocked because they fail the default, stricter validation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further investigation, I recommend consulting official documentation for your specific network devices (firewalls, proxies), programming language libraries related to network communication (e.g., `requests` in Python, the `fetch` API in JavaScript, the `java.net` package in Java), and the relevant security standards for TLS/SSL and certificate handling (RFCs, etc.).   Comprehensive guides on network security best practices and troubleshooting techniques will also prove beneficial.  Furthermore, consult specialized books focusing on network administration and security audits for a deeper understanding of the intricacies of secure network design and operation.  Thorough examination of server and client logs is critical during any debugging effort.
