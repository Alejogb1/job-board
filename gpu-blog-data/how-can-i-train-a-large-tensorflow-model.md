Training large TensorFlow models that exceed available GPU memory requires a strategic approach leveraging techniques designed for distributed training and efficient memory management.  My experience working on a multi-agent reinforcement learning project involving a model exceeding 20GB,  necessitated the exploration of these very methods.  The core issue isn't simply the model size; it's the interplay between model parameters, activation values during forward and backward passes, and the limitations of GPU memory.  Addressing this involves careful consideration of model architecture, data partitioning, and optimization strategies.


**1. Model Parallelism:**

This approach involves partitioning the model itself across multiple GPUs. Each GPU is responsible for training a subset of the model's layers or parameters.  The forward and backward passes are orchestrated such that the output of one GPU feeds into the input of the next, effectively distributing the computational load.  This differs from data parallelism, which replicates the entire model across GPUs but distributes the training data.  Effective model parallelism requires careful consideration of layer dependencies to ensure efficient communication between GPUs.  For example, splitting a convolutional neural network layer-by-layer is often straightforward, while recursively splitting recurrent layers requires more nuanced design.  This necessitates using TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` or `tf.distribute.Strategy` for the efficient distribution and synchronization of gradients.  Failure to do so will lead to synchronization bottlenecks and diminished training performance.


**Code Example 1: Model Parallelism with `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  # Define your model here.  Consider using tf.keras.models.Sequential or
  # tf.keras.Model for modularity.  You'll likely want to split the model
  # into logical units that are assigned to different GPUs.

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'), # Assign to GPU 0
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),  # Assign to GPU 1
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')   # Assign to GPU 0
  ])

  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

  # Define your training loop using strategy.run to distribute the computation
  # across the available GPUs. This ensures that the gradients calculated on
  # different GPUs are aggregated correctly.  The model itself needs to be
  # constructed *within* the `strategy.scope()` to ensure it's distributed.


  def distributed_train_step(inputs, labels):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          predictions = model(inputs)
          loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

  def train_step(dataset):
      for inputs, labels in dataset:
          strategy.run(distributed_train_step, args=(inputs, labels))

  # ... Your training loop using train_step function ...
```


**2. Data Parallelism:**

In this technique, a complete replica of the model is placed on each GPU. The training dataset is then split across the available GPUs, and each GPU trains on its assigned portion of the data.  After each batch, gradients are aggregated across all GPUs.  This method is simpler to implement than model parallelism, especially for models that don't have inherent structure well-suited for partitioning.  However, it still requires sufficient memory on each individual GPU to hold the entire model.  TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` can handle this type of parallelism effectively.  While seemingly easier, careful batch size selection is paramount; too large a batch might still exceed GPU memory.


**Code Example 2: Data Parallelism with `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
  loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

  def train_step(inputs, labels):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          predictions = model(inputs)
          loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


  # Dataset is split across GPUs automatically by MirroredStrategy
  for inputs, labels in training_dataset:
      strategy.run(train_step, args=(inputs, labels))

```


**3. Gradient Checkpointing:**

This technique trades computation time for memory savings.  Instead of storing activations for every layer during the forward pass, intermediate activations are recomputed during the backward pass. This significantly reduces the memory footprint, particularly beneficial for deep networks.  TensorFlow provides built-in support for gradient checkpointing through the `tf.GradientTape` API. While this increases the overall training time, it effectively enables the training of models that would otherwise be impossible to fit in GPU memory.


**Code Example 3: Gradient Checkpointing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

checkpoint = tf.GradientTape(persistent=True, checkpoint=True)
with checkpoint:
    # Your model forward pass here
    predictions = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)

gradients = checkpoint.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
checkpoint.reset() # crucial step

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training and gradient checkpointing.  Textbooks on distributed machine learning and high-performance computing.  Research papers focusing on memory-efficient training techniques for deep learning models.


In conclusion, training large TensorFlow models exceeding GPU memory necessitates a multi-faceted approach.  Model parallelism offers a solution by splitting the model itself across multiple GPUs, distributing the computational burden.  Data parallelism, while simpler, replicates the model on each GPU, requiring careful batch size management. Gradient checkpointing trades computation time for significantly reduced memory usage by recomputing intermediate activations.  The choice of which strategy, or combination of strategies, depends critically on the model's architecture, dataset size, and available hardware resources.  Effective implementation demands a thorough understanding of TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities and careful consideration of potential performance bottlenecks.
