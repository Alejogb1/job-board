The core concept of a Siamese network hinges on its ability to learn a similarity metric by processing pairs of inputs, not necessarily individual inputs in isolation. While the classic use case often involves comparing distinct images (e.g., verifying signatures or facial recognition), the technique of splitting input data and feeding each half to one of the network's branches *can* be used for generating embeddings, but with specific implications for what those embeddings represent and how they’re interpreted. This approach isn’t universally common, and its success depends significantly on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.

A Siamese network, architecturally, consists of two (or sometimes more) identical sub-networks. These sub-networks are parameter-sharing; that is, they employ the exact same weight matrices and biases. During training, a pair of inputs – be they images, text sequences, or, in this specific case, halves of the same input – are fed into these sub-networks. The outputs of these sub-networks, the embeddings, are then compared via a distance function (e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity). The objective of the training process is to minimize the distance between embeddings of similar inputs and maximize the distance between embeddings of dissimilar inputs.

Splitting an input into two parts and using these parts as paired inputs to the Siamese network effectively forces the network to learn an embedding space where the similarity is not between two independent objects but rather between two components of a single object. This can be particularly useful when the holistic meaning of the data stems from the relationship between its parts. I’ve utilized this technique in an industrial application involving long, sequential data, where the first half represented a context and the second half represented an event occurring within that context. The network was trained to predict whether the event was *typical* for the given context, indirectly embedding both halves into a shared latent space that reflects this context-event relationship.

The utility of this approach is that it allows the network to learn features relevant to the *internal structure* of the input. Instead of treating the input as one monolithic entity, the network learns to represent the different sections of the input and their interdependencies. However, it’s crucial to recognize that this method might not be optimal in scenarios where the input’s overall shape or global information is crucial to its identity, rather than the relationships between internal segments.

Let’s examine some code examples to illustrate this. I will assume the use of TensorFlow/Keras, as that is where much of my prior work has been concentrated.

**Code Example 1: Basic Input Splitting and Siamese Network Construction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_embedding_network(input_shape):
  input_layer = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
  x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
  embedding = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)  # Embedding layer
  return keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=embedding)

def create_siamese_network(input_shape, embedding_dim):
    input_a = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    input_b = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    embedding_net = create_embedding_network(input_shape)

    embedding_a = embedding_net(input_a)
    embedding_b = embedding_net(input_b)

    # Simple Euclidean Distance as the distance function
    distance = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(embedding_a - embedding_b), axis=1, keepdims=True)
    return keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=distance)


# Example Usage (assuming input shape is (100,)):
input_shape_ex = (100,)
embedding_dim_ex = 64
siamese_net = create_siamese_network(input_shape_ex, embedding_dim_ex)
siamese_net.summary()
```

In this code, `create_embedding_network` defines the shared sub-network that produces embeddings. The `create_siamese_network` then takes two inputs, passes each through the shared sub-network, and calculates the Euclidean distance between the resulting embeddings. This distance becomes the target of the training procedure. This example shows the basic architectural layout of the Siamese network when used with split inputs. The key part is how we take two separate input placeholders – `input_a` and `input_b` – which would correspond to the two halves of our input after splitting.

**Code Example 2: Data Preparation for Split Inputs**

```python
import numpy as np

def create_split_data(data, split_ratio=0.5):
    n_samples = data.shape[0]
    split_point = int(data.shape[1] * split_ratio) # determine splitting index along the second dimension (feature axis)
    data_a = data[:, :split_point] # take all rows, up to the split_point column
    data_b = data[:, split_point:] # take all rows, starting at the split_point column
    return data_a, data_b

# Assume we have some data with 100 samples and 200 features
dummy_data = np.random.rand(100, 200)

# Split the data into two equal halves
data_a, data_b = create_split_data(dummy_data)

print("Shape of data_a:", data_a.shape)
print("Shape of data_b:", data_b.shape)


# Create dummy labels (example: 1 for pairs from same source, 0 for dissimilar sources in real settings)
labels = np.ones((dummy_data.shape[0], 1))  # All same source in this case
```

This code outlines a simple function for splitting data along the feature dimension. The `create_split_data` function splits the input along its feature axis (second dimension in numpy arrays), generating two halves that are to be treated as paired inputs by the Siamese network from the previous example.  Note that depending on the task, you will need labels which will indicate whether the embeddings should be similar (i.e., from the same source, or in this context, both halves of the input), or dissimilar, (i.e. derived from different samples).  In a typical implementation, one might use labels to indicate that embedding pairs coming from different sources should be far apart. Here, since it is a demonstration of embedding split inputs, all pairs come from the same source, thus all labels are set to `1`.

**Code Example 3: Training the Siamese Network with Split Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Assuming the previous definitions of create_embedding_network and create_siamese_network and create_split_data are defined.

# Generate some data for demonstration
num_samples = 1000
input_dim = 100 # input dimension is the size of each half after splitting
dummy_data = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_dim * 2)

data_a, data_b = create_split_data(dummy_data)
labels = np.ones((num_samples, 1))

#Create model
siamese_net = create_siamese_network((input_dim,), 64)

# Define loss function (contrastive loss)
def contrastive_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  margin = 1
  square_pred = tf.square(y_pred)
  margin_square = tf.square(tf.maximum(margin - y_pred, 0))
  return tf.reduce_mean(y_true * square_pred + (1-y_true) * margin_square)

# Compile the model
siamese_net.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(), loss=contrastive_loss)

# Train the model
siamese_net.fit([data_a, data_b], labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Extract embedding net after training is complete
embedding_net = siamese_net.layers[2]  # assuming the embedding layer is the third one in the graph
# Now, use this embedding_net to generate new embeddings.

single_test_input = dummy_data[0,:input_dim].reshape(1, input_dim)
embedded_input = embedding_net.predict(single_test_input)
print("Example embedded input:", embedded_input)


```

This final example shows how to train the Siamese network with the prepared split input data and demonstrates the use of a common training loss for this application, namely contrastive loss. Here the `contrastive_loss` ensures that if the inputs are from the same source (y_true == 1), the embedding distances will be small, while if they are dissimilar (y_true == 0, which is not used here but necessary in a realistic scenario) the distance will be larger than the margin value. The final part shows how to extract the learned embedding network and use it to generate embeddings for an unseen half of input.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further study of Siamese networks and related techniques I would suggest exploring academic publications concerning metric learning and embedding spaces. Research papers on contrastive loss and triplet loss also provide valuable theoretical insights. Tutorials and documentation for TensorFlow and Keras can offer practical guidance, along with example implementations in the fields of image recognition and natural language processing. The documentation of loss functions, optimizers and custom layer building offered by Tensorflow and Keras is invaluable. Finally, consulting literature on specific applications in your field, such as signal processing or time series analysis, might reveal existing research that applies these methods to data structured similarly to your use case.
