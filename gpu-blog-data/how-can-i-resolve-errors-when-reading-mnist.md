MNIST datasets, while seemingly straightforward, often present subtle challenges during loading and processing, particularly if the environment or implementation deviates slightly from expected norms. I’ve encountered these issues across multiple deep learning projects, each time requiring a focused diagnostic approach to pin down the underlying cause. These errors typically fall into a few broad categories: file path discrepancies, incorrect file formatting, data type mismatches, or improper handling during the loading process. A systematic examination of these areas is crucial for effective resolution.

The first common issue centers around file paths. The program must correctly locate the MNIST data files – usually compressed archives or extracted files residing in a specific directory structure. Incorrect relative or absolute paths, typos in filenames, or assuming a consistent location across different systems, are frequent culprits. The error often presents as a `FileNotFoundError` or similar exception indicating the program cannot access the specified file. Debugging requires first verifying the exact directory and file names where the dataset is expected. Furthermore, if compressed data formats such as .gz are used, the appropriate decompression library and usage should be ensured. This may mean that during development, a relative path that is functional on one machine may fail catastrophically when moved to a different environment. The use of hardcoded, absolute paths should always be considered a significant risk during implementation. Instead, the program should be designed to use relative paths or a configuration system that allows paths to be defined consistently across deployments.

Another point of error involves file format and integrity. MNIST datasets are typically provided as binary files containing images and labels. If these files have been corrupted, partially downloaded, or are in a format not handled correctly by the loading mechanism, loading fails. Corrupted or incomplete files will present errors related to inconsistent file lengths or corrupted magic number identification in libraries used to load the data, such as in the `struct` library in python, which is often used to parse binary data. Libraries like `gzip` are utilized when the file is compressed. If the dataset is partially downloaded, decompression errors would also be noted. To mitigate these issues, it is critical to verify that the datasets are downloaded completely and are the correct size based on the original source. This could involve verifying against a checksum or comparing with known file sizes if documented by the source. Also, employing robust error handling will allow the program to gracefully exit when file integrity is not assured. 

Data type mismatch is another important point of consideration. The pixel values for MNIST images are often represented as unsigned 8-bit integers (uint8), while the corresponding labels are typically integers ranging from 0 to 9. Improper data type casting or conversion during reading can lead to unexpected errors or data corruption. For example, if the pixel values are read and incorrectly treated as floating-point numbers without proper normalization, the resulting data may not be suitable for use in deep learning models, which expects a defined range, typically from 0 to 1, or -1 to 1, depending on the specific training procedure. Additionally, if labels are interpreted as a different data type during the loading process, they may not be useful in evaluating the training progress or may introduce additional logical errors that are challenging to diagnose. This mismatch can occur even if the underlying file format is correct, making debugging more challenging. It requires verifying the expected data types at each step of the loading process, utilizing debugging tools to inspect the shape and type of the data at each stage, to verify the expected values and distributions.

Finally, the specifics of the loading implementation itself can contribute to problems. This includes how images and labels are batched, how preprocessing is applied, and how the dataset is iterated through for training. Errors at this stage are usually related to incorrect slicing or indexing, improper use of data loading tools (like TensorFlow's `tf.data` API), or resource exhaustion if the dataset is too large for available memory. Debugging these kinds of issues require careful examination of the data handling logic within the loading code, often using debugging utilities that allow one to examine batches of the data before being sent to a training step.

Here are three code examples illustrating these common error scenarios and their solutions, using Python with numpy for demonstration, recognizing that TensorFlow, PyTorch and other deep learning libraries have alternative, similar implementations. This is done using numpy to demonstrate the underlying concepts, rather than relying on high-level API calls. This will emphasize the actual data structures themselves, which is paramount for resolving issues.

**Example 1: File Path Discrepancy**

```python
import numpy as np
import os
import struct
import gzip

def load_mnist(images_path, labels_path):
    try:
        with open(labels_path, 'rb') as file:
            magic, num = struct.unpack(">II", file.read(8))
            labels = np.frombuffer(file.read(), dtype=np.uint8)

        with open(images_path, 'rb') as file:
            magic, num, rows, cols = struct.unpack(">IIII", file.read(16))
            images = np.frombuffer(file.read(), dtype=np.uint8).reshape(len(labels), rows, cols)
        return images, labels

    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error loading file: {e}. Check file paths.")
        return None, None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None, None

# Incorrect Path Example
incorrect_images_path = "incorrect/train-images-idx3-ubyte"
incorrect_labels_path = "incorrect/train-labels-idx1-ubyte"
images, labels = load_mnist(incorrect_images_path, incorrect_labels_path)
#The program will print the FileNotFound error

# Correct Path Example
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) #Assumes data in same directory
images_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "train-images-idx3-ubyte")
labels_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "train-labels-idx1-ubyte")
images, labels = load_mnist(images_path, labels_path)

if images is not None:
    print(f"Loaded images shape: {images.shape}")
    print(f"Loaded labels shape: {labels.shape}")
#After correcting the path the program will print the dimensions of the loaded tensors.
```

This example demonstrates the importance of verifying file locations by using a try/except block to catch the specific `FileNotFoundError`, which often occurs when the paths are specified incorrectly. The example also illustrates how to obtain the directory of the script, assuming the data files are in the same location or an appropriate relative location. It catches any other exceptions that can be generated by the loading step. This helps isolate the path problem and can highlight other potential errors in file parsing that may occur, such as corrupted binary data. Note that this example assumes the data files are not compressed in .gz format; if the files are compressed they must be decompressed during the file read.

**Example 2: Data Type Mismatch and Normalization**

```python
import numpy as np
import os
import struct
import gzip

def load_mnist(images_path, labels_path):
    try:
        with open(labels_path, 'rb') as file:
            magic, num = struct.unpack(">II", file.read(8))
            labels = np.frombuffer(file.read(), dtype=np.int32) #incorrect type
            labels = labels.astype(np.uint8)
            

        with open(images_path, 'rb') as file:
            magic, num, rows, cols = struct.unpack(">IIII", file.read(16))
            images = np.frombuffer(file.read(), dtype=np.uint8).reshape(len(labels), rows, cols).astype(np.float32) / 255.0 # correct type and normalization
        return images, labels

    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error loading file: {e}. Check file paths.")
        return None, None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None, None

current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) #Assumes data in same directory
images_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "train-images-idx3-ubyte")
labels_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "train-labels-idx1-ubyte")

images, labels = load_mnist(images_path, labels_path)

if images is not None:
    print(f"Images dtype: {images.dtype}")
    print(f"Labels dtype: {labels.dtype}")
    print(f"First pixel value in first image (after normalization): {images[0,0,0]}")
```

Here, I’ve introduced a common error related to data types, where the labels are initially read as `np.int32` instead of `np.uint8`. The program will operate correctly after the data type is recast to the correct type, but would fail if the re-casting step was absent. Additionally, I've included the important step of image normalization. If normalization is missing, pixel values would range from 0-255, whereas deep learning models usually expect values between 0 and 1. The data is explicitly cast to floating point, then normalized, to ensure that the values are in the expected range. This example highlights not just the importance of using the correct underlying binary data type, but also preparing the data to be appropriate for use with deep learning models.

**Example 3: Partial File Handling and Integrity**

```python
import numpy as np
import os
import struct
import gzip

def load_mnist(images_path, labels_path):
    try:
        with open(labels_path, 'rb') as file:
            magic, num = struct.unpack(">II", file.read(8))
            label_data = file.read()
            expected_label_size = num #The number of labels in the file
            if(len(label_data) != expected_label_size): #check partial download
                print("Error, partial label download, exiting.")
                return None, None
            labels = np.frombuffer(label_data, dtype=np.uint8)


        with open(images_path, 'rb') as file:
            magic, num, rows, cols = struct.unpack(">IIII", file.read(16))
            image_data = file.read()
            expected_image_size = num * rows * cols #The number of pixel values in the file
            if(len(image_data) != expected_image_size):
               print("Error, partial image download, exiting.")
               return None, None 
            images = np.frombuffer(image_data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(len(labels), rows, cols)
        return images, labels

    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error loading file: {e}. Check file paths.")
        return None, None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None, None

current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) #Assumes data in same directory
images_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "train-images-idx3-ubyte")
labels_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "train-labels-idx1-ubyte")

images, labels = load_mnist(images_path, labels_path)

if images is not None:
    print(f"Images shape: {images.shape}")
    print(f"Labels shape: {labels.shape}")
```

This example focuses on data integrity by checking for incomplete downloads. This example reads the data into a raw byte string, then checks to see if the length of the received data is equal to the expected length by referring to the magic number in the binary file format and data dimensions. If there is a mismatch, it is likely that there was a partial download or an issue with data transmission or writing, and the program will exit gracefully rather than proceeding with corrupt data. This emphasizes the importance of using error handling to check for file integrity, rather than assuming that the download was successful.

For further investigation of file handling and data preprocessing, refer to official documentation for Python’s standard libraries such as the `os`, `struct`, and `gzip` modules, which have proven to be invaluable during similar investigations. In addition, researching standard data preprocessing techniques for deep learning using NumPy is essential to understanding how to appropriately structure the data for use in training and inference. Finally, while the provided code examples use NumPy for the underlying loading procedure, it is recommended to examine the data loading APIs for libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to understand their recommended approaches for data input, which may be more efficient and robust for practical applications. These resources will allow a more in-depth understanding of file formats, and the appropriate data structures and conventions used in this field.
