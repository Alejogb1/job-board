The primary challenge with standard softmax in large vocabulary scenarios, like language modeling, stems from the computational cost of calculating probabilities over every possible class. Sampled softmax offers a computationally efficient alternative by approximating the full softmax through a subset of classes. I've encountered this issue frequently while training large transformer models for textual data, and implementing it correctly requires understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and TensorFlow's specific API.

At its core, sampled softmax calculates a loss based only on the correct class label and a limited selection of negative samples from the output vocabulary. The process involves two main stages: sampling the negative classes and adjusting the loss to reflect the approximation. During each training step, instead of computing probabilities across all possible outputs, a small number (typically hundreds or thousands) of incorrect classes are chosen. The loss calculation then focuses on discriminating between the true class and these sampled negatives. This significantly reduces the computational demands, especially when dealing with output spaces in the tens or hundreds of thousands of classes.

Keras, as a high-level API, does not directly expose a sampled softmax loss function as a distinct loss class. Instead, it leverages TensorFlow's lower-level functionalities. The implementation necessitates careful construction of a custom loss function that utilizes `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss`. This custom loss function, crucially, needs access to the model's output embeddings and the target labels. Furthermore, the embedding matrix should be part of the model's trainable variables, not passed as an external input, since the gradient update should propagate through the embeddings.

Implementing a working solution involves:

1.  **Defining a custom loss function:** This function takes the model's output logits (pre-softmax activation) and labels as input. Inside, `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss` performs the heavy lifting. The key is properly formatting the inputs to this TensorFlow operation. We must provide the bias and embedding parameters from our model directly. The `num_sampled` parameter of `sampled_softmax_loss` controls the number of negative samples. A good initial value is often 64, but can be tuned during experimentation. Also, the 'inputs' parameter to `sampled_softmax_loss` should have the same shape as the embeddings.

2.  **Ensuring access to output embeddings:** Within the Keras model, the output layer should consist of a `Dense` layer that does *not* include an activation. The weights and biases of this layer are the embeddings and biases used by `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss`.

3.  **Properly handling labels:** The `labels` parameter to `sampled_softmax_loss` is expected to be a 2D tensor with shape `[batch_size, 1]`. Therefore, ensure any input label tensor has the appropriate dimensionality.

4.  **Integrating the custom loss during model compilation:** The custom loss function is passed as the `loss` argument during the Keras model's compile step.

Here are three illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Basic implementation within a sequential model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def sampled_softmax_loss(labels, logits, embedding_matrix, bias, num_sampled, num_classes):
    labels = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, 1])
    loss = tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(
        weights=embedding_matrix,
        biases=bias,
        labels=labels,
        inputs=logits,
        num_sampled=num_sampled,
        num_classes=num_classes
    )
    return loss

class SampledSoftmaxModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_sampled):
        super(SampledSoftmaxModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.dense_output = keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, use_bias=True) # no activation here
        self.num_sampled = num_sampled
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim


    def call(self, inputs):
        embedded = self.embedding(inputs)
        return self.dense_output(embedded)

    def loss_function(self, labels, logits):
        return sampled_softmax_loss(
            labels, logits, self.dense_output.kernel, self.dense_output.bias,
            self.num_sampled, self.vocab_size
        )

# Example usage:
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 128
num_sampled = 64
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 20

model = SampledSoftmaxModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_sampled)

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()

#Dummy data generation for training
dummy_inputs = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, sequence_length))
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, sequence_length))

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(inputs)
        loss = model.loss_function(labels, logits)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


for i in range(10):
    loss = train_step(dummy_inputs, dummy_labels)
    print(f'Loss at step {i}: {loss}')

```

In this first example, I illustrate a complete custom model incorporating `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss`. Notice that the `Dense` output layer does not have an activation function (crucial for this implementation), and the loss function is a method within the model class. The `train_step` function uses tf.function for graph execution.

**Example 2: Implementation within a functional Keras model.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def sampled_softmax_loss(labels, logits, embedding_matrix, bias, num_sampled, num_classes):
    labels = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, 1])
    loss = tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(
        weights=embedding_matrix,
        biases=bias,
        labels=labels,
        inputs=logits,
        num_sampled=num_sampled,
        num_classes=num_classes
    )
    return loss


def create_sampled_softmax_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_sampled):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(None,))
    embedded = keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)(inputs)
    output_logits = keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, use_bias=True)(embedded) # No activation.
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output_logits)

    def loss_function(labels, logits):
         return sampled_softmax_loss(
            labels, logits, model.layers[-1].kernel, model.layers[-1].bias,
            num_sampled, vocab_size
        )
    model.loss_function = loss_function # Function attribute.

    return model

#Example usage
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 128
num_sampled = 64
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 20

model = create_sampled_softmax_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_sampled)

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()


#Dummy data generation for training
dummy_inputs = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, sequence_length))
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, sequence_length))


@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    logits = model(inputs)
    loss = model.loss_function(labels, logits)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss


for i in range(10):
    loss = train_step(dummy_inputs, dummy_labels)
    print(f'Loss at step {i}: {loss}')

```
This example demonstrates integration using Keras' functional API. The `create_sampled_softmax_model` function builds the model, and notably, the custom loss function becomes an attribute of the model.

**Example 3: Using a custom training loop.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def sampled_softmax_loss(labels, logits, embedding_matrix, bias, num_sampled, num_classes):
    labels = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, 1])
    loss = tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(
        weights=embedding_matrix,
        biases=bias,
        labels=labels,
        inputs=logits,
        num_sampled=num_sampled,
        num_classes=num_classes
    )
    return loss

class SampledSoftmaxModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_sampled):
        super(SampledSoftmaxModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.dense_output = keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, use_bias=True)
        self.num_sampled = num_sampled
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size

    def call(self, inputs):
      embedded = self.embedding(inputs)
      return self.dense_output(embedded)

    def loss_function(self, labels, logits):
       return sampled_softmax_loss(
          labels, logits, self.dense_output.kernel, self.dense_output.bias,
          self.num_sampled, self.vocab_size
        )


vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 128
num_sampled = 64
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 20


model = SampledSoftmaxModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_sampled)
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()


dummy_inputs = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, sequence_length))
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(batch_size, sequence_length))

#Custom training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    print(f'Epoch {epoch}')
    for i in range(10):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(dummy_inputs)
            loss = model.loss_function(dummy_labels, logits)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        print(f'Loss at step {i}: {loss}')

```

This third example utilizes a more explicit training loop, highlighting that the gradient calculation and parameter updates are the same regardless of the model's API use. It reinforces the independence of the core sampled softmax loss from high-level framework mechanics.

For further exploration, I recommend focusing on resources detailing TensorFlow's low-level API, specifically the documentation around `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss`. Additionally, consulting tutorials and examples focused on custom loss function creation in Keras provides the necessary context for integrating this solution into more complex model architectures.  Textbooks discussing efficient deep learning for large vocabularies would also be beneficial. I've frequently found that the combination of those resources is critical for a comprehensive understanding and reliable implementation.
