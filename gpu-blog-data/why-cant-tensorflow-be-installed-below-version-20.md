TensorFlow's architectural shift from graph-based execution in versions prior to 2.0 to eager execution in 2.0 and subsequent releases necessitates significant code and dependency changes, preventing direct installation below this threshold. My experience migrating legacy machine learning pipelines confirms this incompatibility; attempting to use a version 1.x model with TensorFlow 2.x libraries results in a cascade of errors related to graph construction and execution.

The core problem stems from how TensorFlow handles computations. In versions 1.x, computations were defined as static computational graphs, built first and executed later within a session. This required explicit creation of placeholder tensors, variables, and operations, and then passing them to a TensorFlow session for evaluation. This approach is now referred to as graph execution. The graph, effectively, is a blueprint of the computations. It optimizes resource usage by performing operations in a static structure. This allowed significant performance improvements via hardware acceleration, distributed computing, and whole-graph optimizations. However, this method made debugging, experimenting, and iterating complex and cumbersome. Debugging involved inspecting the graph structure and often required external tools like TensorBoard.

TensorFlow 2.0 fundamentally altered this execution model by enabling eager execution by default. Eager execution evaluates operations immediately as they are encountered in the code, as in NumPy. This provides an intuitive programming experience, simplifies debugging, and encourages an iterative development cycle, since errors surface more quickly. Instead of building a static graph then running it, the computations are performed line-by-line in a Python-like manner. This shift made many of the previous TensorFlow 1.x API functions and structures, such as placeholders and sessions, obsolete.

The switch to eager execution also resulted in the integration of Keras as the high-level API for building neural networks. Prior to 2.0, Keras was often installed separately, and its integration became central to TensorFlow's development strategy. This involved a complete rewrite of the Keras interface, using `tf.keras` rather than the independent Keras package. The `tf.keras` integration leverages the native eager execution framework. As a consequence, TensorFlow 1.x does not have an equivalent structure that handles Keras model definition and training using eager execution.

The backward incompatibility is also compounded by changes in the underlying C++ libraries that handle the low-level operations, referred to as the TensorFlow runtime. The runtime underwent significant modifications to accommodate eager execution and to align with the updated Python API. Older versions lack the requisite internal structures and API support to interface with later Python APIs. Attempts to force older versions of the Python libraries to use newer runtime libraries result in segmentation faults and missing function issues due to the underlying C++ ABI changes. The package manager would try to use Python libraries that are attempting to call functions and memory spaces that no longer exist or are named differently in the compiled code.

Letâ€™s examine some illustrative code examples that highlight these differences and why direct installation below 2.0 is not feasible.

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.x Graph-Based Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define placeholders
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name='input_x')
w = tf.Variable(2.0, name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(1.0, name='bias')
y = tf.add(tf.multiply(x, w), b, name='output_y')

# Initialize variables
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# Prepare input data
input_value = 5.0

# Create a session and run the graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(init)  # Initialize variables
  output = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: input_value})
  print("Output:", output)

```

In this TensorFlow 1.x example, the operations are defined first as a static computational graph. Placeholders (`x`) and variables (`w`, `b`) are explicitly created. The computation (`y`) is defined using `tf.add` and `tf.multiply`. No calculation occurs until a `tf.Session` is instantiated and the operations are explicitly evaluated using `sess.run()`. The result of the calculation is only available after the session executes the operation with the corresponding data fed through the `feed_dict`. Attempting to run this with TensorFlow 2.x will fail because `tf.placeholder` and `tf.Session` have been removed.

**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.x Eager Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Variables defined as tf.Variable objects, no placeholder needed
w = tf.Variable(2.0, name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(1.0, name='bias')

# Input data as a float
input_value = 5.0

# Operations executed immediately.
y = tf.add(tf.multiply(input_value, w), b, name='output_y')
print("Output:", y.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the changes introduced in TensorFlow 2.x. The variables are defined using the same `tf.Variable` as before. However, `tf.placeholder` is not used because eager execution removes the need for it. The operations are evaluated immediately, and the result is directly available. The output is accessed through `.numpy()` for printing because operations now return `Tensor` objects and not raw values. This illustrates the ease of use and immediate feedback associated with eager execution. Attempting to run this code with a version of TensorFlow before 2.0 will fail, since  `tf.add` will expect `Tensors` and not a numerical constant.

**Example 3: Model Building Using Keras in TensorFlow 2.x**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model definition using keras functional API
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Dummy training data
X_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Training setup and execution
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

print(model.summary())
```

This example illustrates a basic neural network built using the integrated Keras API in TensorFlow 2.x. This functional API is not present in pre-2.0 versions of TensorFlow.  The Keras model building and training is performed with eager execution. The compiled model is ready for immediate use. This code demonstrates both the simplification of model building and training and the departure from previous approaches to model construction. Attempting to run this in Tensorflow 1.x will fail because the `keras.Input` is not supported.

In conclusion, the architectural changes introduced in TensorFlow 2.0, specifically the adoption of eager execution as the default mode and the integration of Keras as its high-level API, created a divide that is difficult to bridge. The significant differences in computational graph construction, API design, and underlying runtime libraries make installing earlier versions beneath TensorFlow 2.0 impractical. The changes were not incremental and involve rearchitecting the core engine. For anyone working with legacy code bases written for TensorFlow 1.x, migration to TensorFlow 2.x or later is the only viable option for compatibility and ongoing support.

For resources, I would recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation covering version changes, specifically the migration guide. Additionally, research tutorials focusing on TensorFlow 2.x eager execution, especially Keras tutorials. Finally, I advise looking into advanced training techniques using eager execution with gradient tapes, which are also unique to TensorFlow 2.x. This will help develop the intuition required to write compatible, modern TensorFlow code.
