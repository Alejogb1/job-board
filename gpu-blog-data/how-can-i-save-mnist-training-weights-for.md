TensorFlow provides several methods for saving and loading model weights, catering to different levels of granularity and deployment needs. Based on my experience, the most common and robust approaches revolve around checkpointing and the SavedModel format. Checkpointing is ideal for intermediate saves during training and restoring a model's state, while SavedModel is better suited for deployment and serving models in a production environment. For MNIST, either option works, but understanding the nuances of each is important.

Checkpointing focuses on the variables within a TensorFlow model, storing their values at specific points in the training process. This allows one to resume training from a particular state or revert to an earlier, potentially better-performing point. It’s managed primarily through the `tf.train.Checkpoint` and associated utility classes. I've found checkpointing particularly useful when experimenting with different hyperparameters; I can easily revert to a previous checkpoint if a new experiment performs poorly. Checkpoints are not necessarily self-contained, however; they rely on the graph structure being reconstructible. Therefore, the model’s code and the checkpoint must align.

The SavedModel format, on the other hand, provides a self-contained representation of a TensorFlow model, including its graph structure, variables, and assets. This means it's portable and can be loaded independently of the original model definition, facilitating deployment across different environments. It's particularly useful when one needs to deploy a model for inference without retraining. I've personally used this format extensively when moving models from training environments to cloud-based inference servers. The `tf.saved_model` API provides tools to build and load models in this format.

Here's how to implement both strategies effectively with the MNIST dataset:

**Example 1: Checkpointing during Training**

This example demonstrates how to create and save checkpoints during the training loop. The checkpoint includes the model’s weights and, optionally, the optimizer’s state. This allows for resuming training from a specific point, which has been invaluable in my work with long-training models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the MNIST model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Define loss and metrics
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')

# Define the training step
@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    train_accuracy.update_state(labels, predictions)
    return loss

# Create checkpoint object and manager
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model)
checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, './training_checkpoints', max_to_keep=3)

# Load latest checkpoint if available
if checkpoint_manager.latest_checkpoint:
    checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_manager.latest_checkpoint)
    print(f"Restored from checkpoint: {checkpoint_manager.latest_checkpoint}")

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Training loop
EPOCHS = 5
BATCH_SIZE = 32
num_batches = len(x_train) // BATCH_SIZE

for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for batch in range(num_batches):
        batch_images = x_train[batch*BATCH_SIZE:(batch+1)*BATCH_SIZE]
        batch_labels = y_train[batch*BATCH_SIZE:(batch+1)*BATCH_SIZE]
        loss = train_step(batch_images, batch_labels)
        if batch % 100 == 0:
             print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Batch {batch+1}: Loss = {loss.numpy():.4f}, Accuracy = {train_accuracy.result().numpy():.4f}")
    
    train_accuracy.reset_states()
    checkpoint_path = checkpoint_manager.save()
    print(f"Saved checkpoint to {checkpoint_path}")

```

In this example, a `tf.train.Checkpoint` object is created to track the model’s weights and the optimizer's state. The `tf.train.CheckpointManager` automates checkpoint saving, handling the naming and deletion of older checkpoints. Crucially, the manager's latest checkpoint, if it exists, is restored before training begins. The `save()` function creates and writes the checkpoint. The chosen directory, `./training_checkpoints`, can be any valid file path, though I generally find subfolders with specific names useful for organization.

**Example 2: Saving and Loading a SavedModel**

This example details how to export a trained model as a SavedModel and then load it for inference. The entire model, including graph and weights, is stored in a self-contained directory. This method is extremely useful when you need to deploy a trained model or use it in environments separate from training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the MNIST model (same as before)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Load MNIST dataset (just the test set for evaluation)
_, (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Define a minimal training loop to populate weights
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    train_accuracy.update_state(labels, predictions)
    return loss

# Train a few epochs
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 2
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for batch in range(len(x_test) // BATCH_SIZE):
       batch_images = x_test[batch*BATCH_SIZE:(batch+1)*BATCH_SIZE]
       batch_labels = y_test[batch*BATCH_SIZE:(batch+1)*BATCH_SIZE]
       loss = train_step(batch_images, batch_labels)

# Export the model
MODEL_DIR = './saved_mnist_model'
tf.saved_model.save(model, MODEL_DIR)
print(f"Model saved to: {MODEL_DIR}")

# Load the saved model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(MODEL_DIR)

# Perform inference using the loaded model
predictions = loaded_model(x_test[:5])
print(f"Predictions for first five test images: {tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)}")

```

Here, after a brief training process to establish a valid model, we use `tf.saved_model.save` to save the model to a directory (here, `./saved_mnist_model`). The function creates all the necessary files representing the model. `tf.saved_model.load` is used to load this self-contained model back into memory. This is very similar to how models are loaded for serving via TensorFlow Serving. The loaded model can then be used for inference. In practice, the serving model and the model being trained may be more complex, but the procedure remains essentially the same.

**Example 3: Saving specific layers from the model**

While less common in some situations, saving individual layers or a subset of a model is beneficial when one needs only a portion of the overall trained network. This can be useful if, for example, a portion of your model is pre-trained or is used as a feature extractor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the MNIST model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name='dense_layer_1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name = 'dense_layer_2')
])

# Load MNIST dataset (just the test set for evaluation)
_, (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Define a minimal training loop to populate weights
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    train_accuracy.update_state(labels, predictions)
    return loss

# Train a few epochs
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 2
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for batch in range(len(x_test) // BATCH_SIZE):
       batch_images = x_test[batch*BATCH_SIZE:(batch+1)*BATCH_SIZE]
       batch_labels = y_test[batch*BATCH_SIZE:(batch+1)*BATCH_SIZE]
       loss = train_step(batch_images, batch_labels)

# Save a specific layer by extracting its weights
dense_layer_1_weights = model.get_layer('dense_layer_1').get_weights()
print(f"Layer Weights for 'dense_layer_1': {dense_layer_1_weights}")

# To load the weights you would recreate the layer, and set the weights
new_dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name='new_dense_layer')
new_dense_layer.build(input_shape=(None,784))
new_dense_layer.set_weights(dense_layer_1_weights)
print(f"Weights of the new dense layer, should match above: {new_dense_layer.get_weights()}")

# You can also save the weights using numpy and load them later using the same procedure.
import numpy as np
for index, weight_matrix in enumerate(dense_layer_1_weights):
    np.save(f"./dense_layer_1_weight_{index}.npy", weight_matrix)

loaded_weight_matrix_0 = np.load("./dense_layer_1_weight_0.npy")
loaded_weight_matrix_1 = np.load("./dense_layer_1_weight_1.npy")
loaded_dense_layer_1_weights = [loaded_weight_matrix_0, loaded_weight_matrix_1]

new_dense_layer_numpy = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name='new_dense_layer_numpy')
new_dense_layer_numpy.build(input_shape=(None,784))
new_dense_layer_numpy.set_weights(loaded_dense_layer_1_weights)
print(f"Weights of the numpy loaded dense layer, should match above: {new_dense_layer_numpy.get_weights()}")
```
Here, the individual weights are accessed via the model's layers. The process of saving these individual weights is done with basic numpy saving functionality. Saving in this way enables specific parts of the model to be saved for later use, or for reuse in a completely different network architecture. This approach can be very beneficial in a modular approach to model building.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow checkpointing, the official TensorFlow guide on "Checkpoints" is invaluable. The TensorFlow documentation surrounding the `tf.train` module provides very useful detail and the rationale behind each approach. Similarly, the “SavedModel” guide explains saving and loading entire models in detail. The Keras API documentation within the Tensorflow site is another useful resource that explains how the Keras API ties into these checkpointing and model saving strategies. Additionally, examples in the TensorFlow GitHub repository often provide concrete illustrations of how to apply these techniques. Studying these resources will equip one with the knowledge to use the methods most appropriately.
