TensorFlow's GPU integration within PyCharm often hinges on correct environment configuration and CUDA toolkit setup, not merely PyCharm's internal workings.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, involving varied hardware configurations and TensorFlow versions, points to inconsistent environment variables as the primary culprit.  PyCharm, while providing a user-friendly interface, relies on underlying system-level components and environment variables to correctly identify and utilize the GPU.  A missing or incorrectly set path variable for CUDA libraries, for instance, will prevent TensorFlow from accessing the GPU regardless of PyCharm's internal settings.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The challenge of PyCharm not recognizing a TensorFlow GPU stems from a disconnect between the TensorFlow installation, the CUDA toolkit, and the environment PyCharm utilizes.  TensorFlow needs to be built with CUDA support, requiring the correct CUDA toolkit version corresponding to your GPU's compute capability and your NVIDIA driver version.  The system's environment variables must accurately point to the CUDA libraries (including `nvcc`, `cudnn`, and CUDA runtime libraries).  PyCharm's interpreter settings, in turn, must reflect this environment, allowing the Python interpreter used within the IDE to access these libraries.  If any step in this chain is broken – a mismatch in versions, a missing path, or an incorrect interpreter configuration – PyCharm will effectively "see" only the CPU, even if the GPU is physically present and drivers are correctly installed.

Verifying each step methodically is essential. First, confirm the CUDA toolkit is correctly installed and the `nvcc` compiler is accessible from the command line.  Then, check the system's environment variables, specifically `PATH`, `CUDA_HOME`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or their Windows equivalents).  These variables need to include the paths to the CUDA binaries and libraries. Finally, the PyCharm project interpreter should explicitly use the Python environment where TensorFlow with CUDA support is installed. A virtual environment is strongly recommended to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Installation and `nvcc` Accessibility:**

```bash
nvcc --version
```

This command, executed from your terminal, should display the version of the NVCC compiler.  Failure to do so indicates a problem with the CUDA toolkit installation or path configuration.  I've encountered situations where the installation appeared successful, but the `bin` directory containing `nvcc` wasn't correctly added to the `PATH` variable.

**Example 2: Checking TensorFlow GPU Availability in Python:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This Python code snippet, executed within your PyCharm project, attempts to list available GPUs.  A zero output indicates TensorFlow isn't detecting any GPUs.  This can be due to any of the issues previously mentioned—incorrect environment variables, incompatibility between TensorFlow, CUDA, and the driver, or an issue with the interpreter selected in PyCharm.  I have found that using `print(tf.__version__)` along with this code is valuable in isolating version conflicts.

**Example 3: Setting up the PyCharm Project Interpreter:**

This example doesn't show code directly, but rather illustrates a crucial configuration step within PyCharm.  Within PyCharm's settings, navigate to "Project: <YourProjectName> -> Python Interpreter."  Ensure the selected interpreter points to the correct virtual environment or installation directory where TensorFlow with CUDA support is located.  Do not rely on the system-wide Python installation; use a virtual environment.  This isolates TensorFlow's dependencies and prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system.  During my work on a large-scale scientific computing project, neglecting this step resulted in prolonged debugging sessions.  Incorrect interpreter selection is a very common error.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, the CUDA toolkit documentation, and the PyCharm documentation.  Each of these resources provides detailed installation guides, troubleshooting tips, and explanations for configuring GPU support.  Thoroughly reviewing the setup instructions for each component involved is critical.  Pay particular attention to the compatibility requirements between TensorFlow, CUDA, cuDNN, and your NVIDIA drivers.  Consult forums and communities dedicated to TensorFlow and CUDA for specific error message troubleshooting.  Reading through the documentation carefully and systematically is far more effective than searching for isolated solutions online.  Using the official support channels for each component is also highly recommended for specific version related problems.  Consulting NVIDIA's documentation on compute capabilities and driver updates is also important to ensure compatibility with your specific hardware.
