The core challenge in implementing a single-layer neural network lies in effectively managing the weighted sum of inputs and applying an activation function to produce the output.  Over the years, I've found that a clear separation of concerns, focusing on modularity, significantly improves code readability and maintainability, especially when scaling to more complex architectures. This response will detail this approach, illustrated with code examples employing Python and NumPy.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A single-layer neural network, often referred to as a perceptron, consists of a weighted sum of input features, followed by an activation function.  The weights represent the importance of each input feature in determining the output.  The learning process involves adjusting these weights iteratively to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target value.  This is usually achieved through an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.

Mathematically, the output of a single-layer perceptron can be expressed as:

`y = f(W.x + b)`

Where:

* `y` is the output of the network.
* `f` is the activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).
* `W` is the weight matrix (a vector in the case of a single-layer network).
* `x` is the input vector (features).
* `b` is the bias term (a scalar).

The training process aims to find the optimal values for `W` and `b` that minimize a chosen loss function, typically measuring the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.  This involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, and updating them iteratively using gradient descent or a variant thereof.  The choice of activation function influences the network's ability to model non-linear relationships in the data.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Perceptron Implementation using NumPy**

This example implements a single-layer perceptron for binary classification using a sigmoid activation function and gradient descent.

```python
import numpy as np

class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, input_size, learning_rate=0.01):
        self.weights = np.random.rand(input_size)  # Initialize weights randomly
        self.bias = 0
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate

    def sigmoid(self, x):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

    def predict(self, inputs):
        linear_output = np.dot(self.weights, inputs) + self.bias
        return self.sigmoid(linear_output)

    def train(self, inputs, targets, epochs):
        for _ in range(epochs):
            for i in range(len(inputs)):
                prediction = self.predict(inputs[i])
                error = targets[i] - prediction
                self.weights += self.learning_rate * error * prediction * (1 - prediction) * inputs[i]
                self.bias += self.learning_rate * error * prediction * (1 - prediction)


# Example usage:
inputs = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
targets = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1]) # AND gate

perceptron = Perceptron(2)
perceptron.train(inputs, targets, 10000)

print("Weights:", perceptron.weights)
print("Bias:", perceptron.bias)

print("Predictions:", [round(perceptron.predict(x)) for x in inputs])

```

This code defines a `Perceptron` class encapsulating weight initialization, prediction, and training logic.  The `train` method implements gradient descent to update weights and bias based on the prediction error.  The example demonstrates training a perceptron to emulate an AND gate.  Note the use of NumPy for efficient vectorized operations.


**Example 2:  Implementing a ReLU Activation Function**

This example replaces the sigmoid activation function with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

```python
import numpy as np

class PerceptronReLU:
    # ... (other methods remain the same as in Example 1) ...

    def relu(self, x):
        return np.maximum(0, x)

    def predict(self, inputs):
        linear_output = np.dot(self.weights, inputs) + self.bias
        return self.relu(linear_output)

    def train(self, inputs, targets, epochs):
        for _ in range(epochs):
            for i in range(len(inputs)):
                prediction = self.predict(inputs[i])
                error = targets[i] - prediction
                # Derivative of ReLU is 1 for x > 0, 0 otherwise.  Simplified update rule.
                derivative = 1 if prediction > 0 else 0
                self.weights += self.learning_rate * error * derivative * inputs[i]
                self.bias += self.learning_rate * error * derivative
```

This demonstrates the flexibility of the framework.  Switching activation functions requires only modifying the `predict` and `train` methods accordingly. The ReLU derivative simplification showcases efficiency improvements possible with specific activation functions.


**Example 3:  Using Mean Squared Error as a Loss Function**

This expands upon Example 1 by explicitly defining and using a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.

```python
import numpy as np

class PerceptronMSE:
    # ... (other methods similar to Example 1, using sigmoid) ...

    def mse(self, targets, predictions):
        return np.mean((targets - predictions)**2)

    def train(self, inputs, targets, epochs):
        for _ in range(epochs):
            predictions = np.array([self.predict(x) for x in inputs])
            loss = self.mse(targets, predictions)
            # ... (gradient descent calculations remain similar to Example 1) ...
            print(f"Epoch {_}, Loss: {loss}") #Monitor training progress.

```

This example introduces a more formal loss function calculation and monitoring, facilitating better understanding of the training progress.  Adding loss function visualization would further enhance the debugging and analysis capabilities.
