The impact of special tokens on embeddings within a TensorFlow-based BERT model from Hugging Face hinges on the specific tokenization strategy employed and the model's architecture.  My experience working on large-scale natural language processing tasks, particularly those involving fine-tuning BERT for question answering and sentiment analysis, has highlighted that the influence is not uniform across all embeddings but rather localized to specific layers and dependent on the token's role.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Hugging Face Transformers library utilizes a WordPiece tokenizer for most BERT variants. This tokenizer breaks down text into sub-word units, including special tokens like [CLS], [SEP], and [MASK].  Crucially, these tokens are not simply added as arbitrary symbols; they have learned embeddings.  The [CLS] token's embedding, for instance, often serves as a contextualized representation of the entire input sequence, aggregating information across all input tokens.  Its impact is therefore pervasive, influencing downstream layers.  Conversely, [SEP] tokens, used to demarcate different sentences in a sequence, primarily affect local contextualization within their immediate vicinity.  The [MASK] token, primarily used for masked language modeling training, has a highly context-dependent effect, its embedding dynamically adjusting based on surrounding words.


While all special tokens possess embeddings, their influence on other embeddings is not direct or equal.  The effect propagates through the transformer layers.  Early layers might show limited interaction between special token embeddings and other word embeddings, reflecting local context awareness. As we progress through the deeper layers, the interaction becomes more global and complex, with the special tokens' influence becoming more diffuse and integrated into the overall sentence representation.  This is because the self-attention mechanism at the heart of BERT allows information flow between all tokens, leading to the fusion of information from special and regular tokens.  However, the degree of influence is determined by the attention weights, not a direct, hard-coded interaction.  This nuanced interaction explains why simply removing special tokens drastically impairs performance; it's not simply about removing a few embeddings but disrupting the intricate contextual representation learned by the model.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate manipulating special tokens and observing their impact in TensorFlow using the Hugging Face library.  These examples assume familiarity with basic TensorFlow and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

**Example 1: Accessing Special Token Embeddings:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = TFBertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize a simple sentence
inputs = tokenizer("This is a sentence.", return_tensors="tf")

# Get the embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state

# Access the embeddings of specific tokens (assuming '[CLS]' is index 0 and '[SEP]' is index 7)
cls_embedding = embeddings[:, 0, :]
sep_embedding = embeddings[:, 7, :]

print(cls_embedding.shape) # Output: (batch_size, 768) - typical BERT embedding dimension
print(sep_embedding.shape) # Output: (batch_size, 768)

#Further analysis can be done by comparing these to other word embeddings.
```

This example demonstrates accessing the embeddings of the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens directly.  Notice that the shape reflects the standard BERT embedding dimensionality, indicating that these special tokens are indeed treated as regular tokens with learned representations.  The `last_hidden_state` captures the output of the final transformer layer, where the influence of special tokens is most integrated.


**Example 2:  Modifying Input with Altered Special Tokens (Hypothetical):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel

# ... (Tokenizer and model loading as in Example 1) ...

# Hypothetical scenario: Replacing [CLS] with a custom token
inputs = tokenizer("This is a sentence.", return_tensors="tf")
modified_input_ids = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(inputs['input_ids'], [[0,0]], [tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids('[CUSTOM]')])
modified_inputs = {'input_ids': modified_input_ids, 'attention_mask': inputs['attention_mask']}

#Process with model, observing changes in output.
outputs_modified = model(**modified_inputs)
#Compare outputs_modified with outputs from Example 1.  Significant differences are expected.
```

This illustrates a hypothetical modification.  While directly replacing [CLS] is likely to severely impact performance,  this demonstrates how altering special tokens can affect the model's output.  Significant differences between the output embeddings are anticipated, underscoring the critical role of the learned special token embeddings. This is a theoretical exercise; extensive testing would be needed to determine the extent of such changes.


**Example 3:  Analyzing Attention Weights:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel

# ... (Tokenizer and model loading as in Example 1) ...

# Access attention weights (requires model modification to expose attention outputs)
# This requires accessing internal model layers which are not directly exposed.
# The following is a conceptual example and may require significant modification 
# based on the specific BERT model version.

# Hypothetical access (requires modification to the model architecture):
attention_weights = model.get_attention_weights(**inputs) # This function likely needs to be defined depending on the model's structure

# Analyze attention weights involving special tokens.
#Examine attention weights of CLS and SEP tokens.  High values would indicate strong influence.

#This example requires advanced familiarity with TensorFlow model internals.
```

This example focuses on the attention mechanism.  Analyzing the attention weights provides insight into how information flows between the special tokens and other words.  High attention weights between a special token and another word would indicate a strong influence.  However, directly accessing attention weights often requires manipulating the model's internals, and this is model-specific.  It's not a straightforward process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Hugging Face Transformers documentation.  Published research papers on BERT and its variants.  Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on custom model modification and layer access.


In summary, the impact of special tokens isn't a simple "all or nothing" effect.  Their embeddings are crucial, not simply placeholders. Their influence is dynamic, context-dependent, and propagates through the transformer layers, significantly shaping the overall embedding representation of the input sequence.  Direct manipulation, as illustrated, requires careful consideration of the architecture and can significantly alter the model's behaviour.
