The inherent non-deterministic nature of certain TensorFlow operations, coupled with subtle differences in hardware and software configurations across machines, is the primary reason for variations in model training and inference results, even when using the same code and data. I've observed this firsthand when migrating models between my desktop workstation and cloud instances, noticing discrepancies despite identical TensorFlow installations reported through pip. While these differences are often small, they can affect replicability and become significant when precision is crucial.

Fundamentally, the variance arises from several contributing factors, primarily revolving around floating-point arithmetic, parallelism, and environment specifics. Firstly, floating-point operations, while typically accurate, possess inherent rounding errors due to the limited precision used to represent real numbers in computer systems. The order in which these operations are performed, particularly within complex neural network computations, can influence the accumulation of these errors and subsequently lead to slightly different final values. This is because operations like addition and multiplication are not strictly associative when performed with finite precision. The same calculation performed in different parallelization arrangements could yield slightly different outcomes.

Secondly, TensorFlow leverages multiple threads and, optionally, GPU acceleration to expedite computations. The manner in which these operations are scheduled and executed can vary considerably between different hardware architectures, especially across CPUs from different vendors and GPU architectures, such as NVIDIA or AMD. While TensorFlow attempts to maintain determinism, differences in the order of execution on different devices introduce slight variability. The execution order can be affected by variations in the performance characteristics of different CPUs and GPUs.

Furthermore, even if both machines have the same TensorFlow and CUDA versions (if a GPU is used), the underlying libraries and drivers can exhibit subtle differences. Different driver versions, different versions of CUDA libraries, or even differing operating system versions (along with their own threading implementations and system libraries) can impact execution. These variations can affect the way that TensorFlow interacts with hardware, impacting execution order and floating-point operation results.

The random initialization of weights in a neural network also contributes to variance, but this is typically mitigated by setting a random seed at the start of the script. However, without correctly seeding all pseudo-random number generators used within TensorFlow, including those within operations themselves, minor differences in weight initialization can contribute to different training paths.

Finally, minor differences in data handling, even pre-processing steps like shuffling, can amplify variances down the line. While data pipelines are generally deterministic if handled using TensorFlow's APIs, subtle variations due to differing operating systems and file systems can introduce inconsistencies.

Now, let's examine some examples:

**Example 1: Floating-Point Accumulation with Different Hardware**

This example demonstrates how different hardware can produce different results in a simple reduction operation that sums a large list of floating-point values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a large list of random floats
NUM_FLOATS = 100000
floats = np.random.rand(NUM_FLOATS).astype(np.float32)

# Convert to TensorFlow tensor
float_tensor = tf.constant(floats)

# Perform the summation
sum_result = tf.reduce_sum(float_tensor).numpy()

print(f"Sum Result: {sum_result}")

# On one machine, I might get 49999.34, while another might give 50000.02.
```

The commentary on this example is straightforward: The same code executed on different CPUs, especially those with variations in their floating-point units, could accumulate different total values due to the order and nature of floating-point operations, even when using single precision. This behavior highlights the challenges of achieving bitwise identical results across platforms when using floating-point representations of real numbers.

**Example 2: Impact of Parallelism and Seeded Operations**

This code illustrates how the absence of proper seeding of pseudo-random number generators can lead to differences when running parallel training operations. This example is based on using dense layers, a common operation in neural networks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example with random initialization and no seeding, leading to different initial weights
model_unseeded = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Generate example input data
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 10))

# Apply the unseeded model once
unseeded_output_1 = model_unseeded(input_data).numpy()

# Apply it again to simulate a second training step
unseeded_output_2 = model_unseeded(input_data).numpy()

# Create a new model with seeding, leading to repeatable weights
tf.random.set_seed(42) # Global random seed
model_seeded = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,), kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.GlorotNormal(seed=42)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid',kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.GlorotNormal(seed=42))
])

# Apply the seeded model once
seeded_output_1 = model_seeded(input_data).numpy()

# Apply it again to simulate a second training step
seeded_output_2 = model_seeded(input_data).numpy()

print(f"Unseeded model output difference: {tf.reduce_sum(unseeded_output_1 - unseeded_output_2)}")
print(f"Seeded model output difference: {tf.reduce_sum(seeded_output_1 - seeded_output_2)}")

# Typically, unseeded difference will be large and non-zero while seeded will be 0
```

Here, the key takeaway is that by not setting the random seed globally or within individual layer initializers, the model's weights are randomly initialized differently on each run or on different machines. This ultimately leads to divergence in the final training outcomes or, at the very least, differences in layer outputs. Setting the random seed will result in deterministic outcomes when other parts of the stack are identical. Seeding needs to be done both globally and within layer initializers to ensure consistency across machines and different executions.

**Example 3: Data Preprocessing Order Variations**

This shows how subtle variations in preprocessing can affect the training, in this case the shuffling of a dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10))

# Shuffle dataset once, without a specific seed
shuffled_dataset_1 = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10)
list1 = list(shuffled_dataset_1.as_numpy_iterator())

# Shuffle dataset again with a specific seed
shuffled_dataset_2 = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10, seed=42)
list2 = list(shuffled_dataset_2.as_numpy_iterator())

# Shuffle dataset again with the same seed to prove determinism
shuffled_dataset_3 = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10, seed=42)
list3 = list(shuffled_dataset_3.as_numpy_iterator())

print("First shuffled dataset: ", list1)
print("Second shuffled dataset (seeded):", list2)
print("Third shuffled dataset (seeded):", list3)
# list2 and list 3 will be the same but list 1 will vary.
```

This example shows how the order of elements in a dataset can change during shuffling if no explicit seed is used. Differing processing orders between two machines could result in different training outcomes. Using a seed, as we show with `shuffled_dataset_2` and `shuffled_dataset_3`, ensures that shuffling is performed in the same deterministic order. This is crucial when reproducing training runs and diagnosing sources of differences.

To address this issue of varying results, several best practices should be employed. First, set a global random seed using `tf.random.set_seed(seed)` and then specify the same seed within layer initializers, if applicable. Second, ensure that both the machine you are developing on and the machines where you deploy are configured with very similar software stacks. This includes driver versions, operating systems, and underlying libraries like BLAS or cuDNN. Third, avoid relying on implicitly non-deterministic operations and carefully analyze if the model implementation is affected by the order of operations, using `tf.function(jit_compile=True)` for optimized execution where relevant.

For further research, the TensorFlow documentation offers extensive guidance on debugging model training and working with non-deterministic operations. Look for documentation on determinism in TensorFlow, specifically regarding seeding, floating-point behavior, and GPU acceleration. Also, the general concept of floating-point arithmetic and its limitations is worth studying, as this is a pervasive issue in numerical computing. Articles on reproducible research in machine learning are valuable in understanding good practices. Exploring sources that address the differences in compiler optimizations across different environments can also provide additional insights.
