The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in loss calculations during neural network training often stems from numerical instability, frequently exacerbated by subtle data modifications.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, particularly involving high-dimensional data and complex architectures, points to three primary culprits: exploding gradients, vanishing gradients, and data issues directly impacting the loss function's calculation.


**1. Exploding Gradients:**

Exploding gradients manifest when the gradients during backpropagation become excessively large, leading to numerical overflow.  This overflow often manifests as `inf` (infinity) initially, which subsequently propagates through calculations to produce `NaN` values in the loss.  Slight data modifications can push the network into a state where the already unstable gradient calculations become completely overwhelmed, resulting in this failure. This is particularly prevalent in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep feedforward networks due to the chain rule's compounding effect on gradient calculations.  The issue isn't necessarily that the data is inherently problematic but that a minor change alters the network's trajectory, pushing it past a numerical stability threshold.


**Code Example 1: Illustrating Exploding Gradients (Python with TensorFlow/Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Simulate a scenario prone to exploding gradients
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1) #High learning rate exacerbates issue

#Slightly modified dataset
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10) * 10  #Increased magnitude
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10 #Increased magnitude

for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x_train)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_train, predictions)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

```

In this example, increasing the magnitude of the input data significantly increases the chance of exploding gradients.  A smaller learning rate or gradient clipping could mitigate this, but a small change in the input distribution can be sufficient to trigger the issue if the architecture is already predisposed to it.


**2. Vanishing Gradients:**

Conversely, vanishing gradients occur when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, effectively preventing updates to earlier layers in the network. While this initially doesn't result in `NaN` values, it can lead to a flat loss landscape where the optimizer struggles to find a minimum. Subtle data changes can exacerbate this by pushing the network further into a state of ineffective learning, leading to inconsistent loss values and potentially resulting in `NaN` after a prolonged period of stagnation. This is particularly relevant in very deep networks or networks using activation functions like sigmoid that saturate.


**Code Example 2: Illustrating Potential Vanishing Gradients (Python with PyTorch):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

#Deep network, potential for vanishing gradients
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 128),
    nn.Sigmoid(),
    nn.Linear(128, 128),
    nn.Sigmoid(),
    nn.Linear(128, 128),
    nn.Sigmoid(),
    nn.Linear(128, 1)
)

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) #Low learning rate may not help with vanishing gradients
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

#Dataset with low variance, prone to slow learning
x_train = torch.randn(100, 10) * 0.1
y_train = torch.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred = model(x_train)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```

Here, a deep network with sigmoid activation and a low-variance dataset increases the risk of vanishing gradients. A slightly modified dataset might push it towards a region where gradients are so small that numerical precision issues arise, leading to inconsistencies and potential `NaN`s after many epochs.


**3. Data Issues Directly Affecting the Loss Function:**

Finally,  `NaN` values can arise from problematic data points themselves.  This is often overlooked but crucial.  Even slight modifications can introduce data points that cause division by zero, taking the logarithm of a non-positive number, or other invalid operations within the loss function itself.  For instance, if your loss function involves calculating a ratio and a data modification leads to a zero in the denominator, you'll immediately get a `NaN`.


**Code Example 3: Illustrating Data-Induced NaN (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

#Loss function with potential for division by zero
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.sum(np.abs(y_true - y_pred) / y_true) #Problem if y_true contains zeros

y_true = np.array([1, 2, 3, 0, 5]) #Zero introduced
y_pred = np.array([1.1, 1.9, 3.2, 0.1, 4.8])

loss = custom_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

This straightforward example shows how a single zero in `y_true` directly leads to a `NaN` loss.  In more complex scenarios, subtle changes in the data might produce similar invalid operations hidden within a much larger loss calculation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Numerical analysis textbooks focusing on floating-point arithmetic and error propagation.
*   Deep learning textbooks with detailed sections on optimization algorithms and their stability.
*   Documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) on handling numerical instability.


In conclusion, the appearance of `NaN` loss values after slight data modifications points to fragility within the training process, stemming from either gradient issues or data points directly impacting the loss calculation. Thoroughly inspecting the data, choosing appropriate architectures and activation functions, employing gradient clipping or regularization, and using robust loss functions are essential strategies for addressing this prevalent problem.  Debugging often requires careful examination of both the data and the network's behavior during training.
