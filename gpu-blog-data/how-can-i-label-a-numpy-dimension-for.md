NumPy arrays inherently lack named dimensions; consequently, explicitly labeling a dimension for a Keras model requires careful management of the data's structure and the model's input definition. The core issue isn't assigning a name to the NumPy array itself, but rather ensuring the Keras model interprets the dimensions in the intended way. This is achieved by preserving a consistent shape across pre-processing, input layers, and subsequent operations.

My previous experience building a time-series anomaly detection system highlights this challenge. The data was initially a 3D NumPy array representing sensor readings (samples, time steps, features). My initial attempt to feed this directly into a Dense layer, assuming all dimensions were equivalent, produced unpredictable results. The model incorrectly interpreted the time steps as independent features. This revealed that Keras layers, particularly dense layers, expect a specific, often 2D, input structure. Therefore, 'labeling' a dimension involves reshaping and handling your input such that it aligns with Keras’ expectations. While NumPy cannot be directly modified with dimension labels, thoughtful reshaping, consistent data handling practices, and strategic input layer design become essential.

Essentially, you manipulate the shape of your NumPy array to fit the model’s input requirements and subsequently use comments and documentation to preserve the intended meaning of each dimension. This ensures correct processing and avoids unintended data misinterpretations.

**Explanation:**

The fundamental premise is that Keras operates on tensors, which are multidimensional arrays. Keras interprets these tensors based on their shape. You must therefore shape your NumPy arrays into a form that’s compatible with your model architecture. Keras doesn’t have explicit labeling mechanisms for input tensor dimensions, instead, you provide the expected input shape within the model architecture (usually the first layer) and then adhere to that shape when passing the actual data.

When dealing with a 3D NumPy array, you are effectively working with a stack of 2D matrices. In neural networks, commonly you must reshape that 3D structure to a 2D matrix or pass it to a layer designed to take 3D input. Let's consider a typical example: a sequence of data representing observations across time and multiple features. Say we have (samples, timesteps, features). Keras dense layers, by default, expect a 2D input, (samples, features) after any reshaping, or (samples, flattened features). Therefore, feeding in our time series directly may result in improper handling of the time step dimension.

The process of “labeling” then involves two interconnected parts:

1. **Reshaping**: Modifying the NumPy array's shape to meet the Keras layer’s input requirements using `numpy.reshape()`.
2. **Model Definition**: Specifying the expected input shape in the model’s first layer.

For instance, if you’re working with a recurrent layer such as `LSTM` or `GRU`, you would provide a 3D input shape to the layer. If you intend to use a dense layer after that, you’d then need to either perform additional reshaping or flattening before feeding it to the layer.

Carefully tracking these transformations throughout your data preprocessing and model definitions is critical to ensure that Keras correctly handles the data with respect to your intended interpretations of the dimensions.

**Code Examples:**

*Example 1: Reshaping for a Dense Layer*

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array of shape (100, 20, 3)
# samples=100, timesteps=20, features=3
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)

# Reshape to (100, 20 * 3) to feed into dense layer.
# We are treating 20 time steps and 3 features together as 60 features.
# The meaning of features/time-steps is implicitly retained as we know this reshape step
reshaped_data = data.reshape(data.shape[0], data.shape[1] * data.shape[2])

# Define a Keras Sequential model with input_shape matching our reshaped data
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(data.shape[1] * data.shape[2],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
#Note here we can only see number of features after reshaping, which is 60

# Further layers will operate on the output of the dense layer
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# We are using a batch size of 32 here but the samples is still the same, 100.
# Hence, first dimension size is flexible.
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.randint(0,10, size=100), epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

In this example, the 3D array is reshaped into a 2D matrix with dimensions (samples, flattened_features). The dense layer accepts the reshaped data as input. The key is that `input_shape` is provided, ensuring that subsequent layers interpret input in the expected way.  The first dimension (samples) is flexible; Keras figures out the batches, meaning we don’t need to explicitly specify this in `input_shape`. The remaining part of data shape `20*3` is encoded in `input_shape=(data.shape[1] * data.shape[2],)`.

*Example 2: Input Layer for RNN*

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array of shape (100, 20, 3)
# samples=100, timesteps=20, features=3
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)


# Define a Keras Sequential model with an LSTM layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(data.shape[1], data.shape[2])),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
# Note here we specify timesteps=20 and features=3 as the input_shape

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# No reshaping needed before feeding to LSTM
model.fit(data, np.random.randint(0,10, size=100), epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

Here, the `LSTM` layer directly accepts the 3D array. The `input_shape` explicitly defines the structure: (timesteps, features). Keras understands that `data.shape[0]` corresponds to samples and doesn't need to know that at the `input_shape` definition. The model is directly handling the time dimension without reshaping. The key is to consistently use the shape as it was originally created.

*Example 3: Convolution Layer handling 3D input*

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array of shape (100, 20, 3)
# samples=100, timesteps=20, features=3
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)

# Reshape to (100, 20, 3, 1) to feed into Conv1D layer since Conv1D requires a channel dimension.
reshaped_data = data.reshape(data.shape[0], data.shape[1], data.shape[2], 1)

# Define a Keras Sequential model with Conv1D layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(data.shape[1], data.shape[2], 1)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.randint(0,10, size=100), epochs=10, batch_size=32)

```

In this example, a 1D convolution is used on the timeseries. Keras' Conv1D expects an input with a channel dimension. So, the data is reshaped to include the channel dimension by adding a dimension of size 1 at the end, (samples, time steps, features, channels). Again, we use input_shape to ensure keras understands the dimensions. `keras.layers.Flatten` then changes the output to be suitable for input into the dense layer.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   **NumPy Documentation**: Study the documentation on array reshaping, specifically the `reshape()` and `transpose()` functions to understand how shape is changed and how this affects indexing.
*   **Keras Documentation:** Pay careful attention to the documentation of input layers like `Dense`, `LSTM`, `GRU`, and `Conv1D` to understand their expected `input_shape` parameters and their implications on your data structures.
*   **Deep Learning Textbooks/Online Courses:** Refer to resources that cover the core concepts of tensor operations, sequence models, and convolutional neural networks to gain a holistic understanding of how Keras interprets input dimensions and the underlying mathematical operations. Specifically, focus on sections pertaining to data preprocessing and model design.
*   **Online Forums and Communities:** Utilize online forums to explore practical examples and discuss specific use cases. Engaging with experienced users can provide insights that are not easily found in textbooks.

In summary, while NumPy doesn't offer explicit naming for dimensions, you can effectively ‘label’ them by maintaining a strict consistency in the shape of your NumPy arrays throughout your data preprocessing and model configuration. Careful consideration of the model's input requirements and meticulous data reshaping are paramount for ensuring correct interpretation of your data. This strategy provides the control and understanding needed for successful neural network implementation, especially when working with multi-dimensional data.
