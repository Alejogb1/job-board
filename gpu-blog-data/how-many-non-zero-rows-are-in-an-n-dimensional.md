Determining the number of non-zero rows in an N-dimensional tensor requires a nuanced approach, differing significantly from the straightforward row count in a 2D matrix.  My experience optimizing large-scale tensor computations for high-energy physics simulations has highlighted the critical need for efficient solutions to this problem.  The difficulty stems from the inherent ambiguity of "row" in higher dimensions.  A straightforward row count is only meaningful for a two-dimensional tensor.  For N-dimensional tensors (N > 2), we must define what constitutes a "row" relative to the dimensions we wish to analyze.

**1. Defining the "Row" in N-Dimensional Space:**

The crucial first step is to clearly define what constitutes a "non-zero row" in the context of an N-dimensional tensor. We can't simply count rows as we would in a matrix. Instead, we must select a subset of dimensions to represent our "row."  This selection defines which dimensions contribute to the criteria of a non-zero row.  Let's assume we consider a "row" to be a vector formed by fixing all but one dimension.  The choice of which dimension to vary determines which "rows" we count.  This is a key point often overlooked, leading to incorrect interpretations.  For example, consider a 3D tensor. We could treat the first dimension as our "row" index, fixing the second and third dimensions and checking for non-zero elements along the first dimension.  Alternately, we might choose the second or third dimension as the varying dimension defining the "row".  This definition must be explicitly stated for the counting algorithm to be meaningful.

**2. Algorithmic Approach and Computational Considerations:**

The most straightforward, albeit computationally expensive, approach involves iterating through the tensor.  For each "row" (defined as above), we check if it contains any non-zero elements.  If it does, we increment a counter.  This approach has a time complexity directly proportional to the total number of elements in the tensor.  For extremely large tensors, this brute-force method becomes impractical.  Optimizations are crucial.

Efficient methods often rely on vectorized operations offered by libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow. These libraries offer functions that can significantly speed up calculations by operating on entire arrays at once, rather than element by element.  Furthermore, sparsity can play a crucial role.  If the tensor is sparse (meaning most elements are zero), optimized sparse matrix representations and algorithms can drastically reduce computation time and memory usage.

**3. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the concept using NumPy.  They highlight the process of defining the "row" and counting non-zero elements within the chosen "row".

**Example 1: Counting non-zero rows along the first dimension of a 3D tensor.**

```python
import numpy as np

def count_nonzero_rows_dim1(tensor):
    """Counts non-zero rows along the first dimension of a 3D tensor."""
    nonzero_rows = 0
    for i in range(tensor.shape[0]):
        row = tensor[i, :, :] # Define "row" as a slice along the first dimension.
        if np.any(row): # Check if any element in the "row" is non-zero.
            nonzero_rows += 1
    return nonzero_rows

tensor3d = np.array([[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], [[2, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]])
count = count_nonzero_rows_dim1(tensor3d)
print(f"Number of non-zero rows (along dim 1): {count}")  # Output: 2
```

This example clearly defines the "row" as a slice along the first dimension.  The `np.any()` function efficiently checks for the presence of any non-zero element within that slice.

**Example 2:  A more general function using a specified dimension.**

```python
import numpy as np

def count_nonzero_rows(tensor, dim):
    """Counts non-zero rows along a specified dimension of an N-dimensional tensor."""
    nonzero_rows = 0
    shape = tensor.shape
    for i in range(shape[dim]):
        row = np.take(tensor, indices=i, axis=dim) # Extract the "row" using np.take
        if np.any(row):
            nonzero_rows += 1
    return nonzero_rows

tensor4d = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(3, 2, 4, 5)) # Example 4D tensor
count = count_nonzero_rows(tensor4d, dim=0)  # Count along the first dimension
print(f"Number of non-zero rows (along dim 0): {count}")

count = count_nonzero_rows(tensor4d, dim=2)  # Count along the third dimension
print(f"Number of non-zero rows (along dim 2): {count}")
```

This function generalizes the process to N-dimensional tensors, accepting the dimension along which to count as an argument.  `np.take` provides a flexible way to extract the relevant "row" regardless of tensor dimensionality.

**Example 3: Leveraging NumPy's `any` for vectorized operation (for 3D tensor)**

```python
import numpy as np

def count_nonzero_rows_vectorized(tensor):
  """Vectorized approach for counting non-zero rows along the first dimension of a 3D tensor."""
  return np.sum(np.any(tensor, axis=(1, 2)))

tensor3d = np.array([[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], [[2, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]])
count = count_nonzero_rows_vectorized(tensor3d)
print(f"Number of non-zero rows (vectorized): {count}") # Output: 2
```

This example utilizes NumPy's `any` function along multiple axes to achieve a vectorized computation, resulting in significantly faster execution for larger tensors.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation and optimization, I recommend studying linear algebra textbooks focusing on matrix and tensor operations.  Furthermore, the documentation for NumPy and other numerical computation libraries is indispensable.  Finally, exploring resources on sparse matrix techniques and algorithms will prove invaluable for handling large, sparse tensors efficiently.  These resources offer crucial background and detailed explanations of optimized algorithms and data structures for efficient tensor processing.
