Convolutional layers in PyTorch, when followed by padding operations, do not inherently display the effects of that padding in their output feature maps. The core reason lies in how convolution and padding are fundamentally implemented. Padding isn't an alteration *of* the convolutional layer itself; it's a preprocessing step that modifies the input to the layer. Therefore, the output feature map will demonstrate the result of the convolution operation *applied to the padded input*, not a visualization of the padding itself. I have encountered this several times while developing image processing pipelines for industrial machine vision projects, where maintaining specific output dimensions is crucial for subsequent layers in the network.

Fundamentally, padding expands the spatial dimensions of the input tensor *before* the convolutional kernel is applied. Let's consider a simple example. Without padding, if a convolutional layer with a 3x3 kernel and a stride of 1 is applied to a 5x5 input, the resulting output feature map will be 3x3. This spatial reduction happens because the kernel "slides" across the input, and each position produces an output value. Now, if we pad the 5x5 input with, for instance, a single layer of zeros on each side (creating a 7x7 input), the same 3x3 kernel operating with a stride of 1 will produce a 5x5 output. While the padding is a critical step in achieving this dimension, the output feature maps themselves show the *results of the convolutional operation* on the padded 7x7 array, not a representation of the padding zeros themselves.

The convolutional operation is a series of element-wise multiplications between the kernel's weights and the corresponding values within its receptive field in the input data. The products are then summed together to yield a single output value for a given position in the output feature map. This process is repeated across all receptive fields defined by the kernel's size and stride. The padding ensures the kernel has sufficient positions to 'slide' across such that we achieve the desired output dimensions. While technically, the convolutional operation includes a summation, during which the *padded zeros are also included in calculations*, it is ultimately the resulting value after the calculations are complete that is represented in the output. Therefore, the output feature map isn’t an 'image' of the padding but the effect of convolution on a padded input.

Consider the following code snippet that clarifies this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: 1 channel, 5x5 image
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1, 5, 5)

# Convolutional layer with no padding
conv_no_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=0)
output_no_pad = conv_no_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape without padding: {output_no_pad.shape}")

# Convolutional layer with padding
conv_with_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
output_with_pad = conv_with_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape with padding: {output_with_pad.shape}")
```

Here, we define two convolutional layers; one without padding, resulting in a 3x3 output, and another with a padding of 1 on all sides, resulting in a 5x5 output. The output of the padded layer does not *display* the padding – it simply is the resultant output after the convolutional kernel was applied to the padded input. The critical aspect is understanding that the padding modifies the *input* to the convolution, not the convolution itself. The output, in the case of the padded convolution, is simply the 5x5 output resultant from applying the 3x3 kernel on a 7x7 input with the padding.

Let's consider another example showcasing how the output dimensions change with varying padding configurations:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: 1 channel, 7x7 image
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1, 7, 7)

# Convolution with different padding options
conv_same_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding='same')
output_same_pad = conv_same_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape with 'same' padding: {output_same_pad.shape}")

conv_valid_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding='valid')
output_valid_pad = conv_valid_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape with 'valid' padding: {output_valid_pad.shape}")


conv_custom_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=(2,1))
output_custom_pad = conv_custom_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape with custom padding: {output_custom_pad.shape}")

```

The `same` padding configuration adds padding in a manner that maintains the same output size as the input size, `valid` padding which is equivalent to setting padding to 0 and not padding at all, reduces the output size based on the stride and kernel size, and finally a user defined custom padding amount. The resulting output dimensions demonstrate the effect of the *padding strategy used during the convolution*. They do not show a layer or visual effect of padding. Instead, these different padding values dictate the calculations made during the convolutional operation which ultimately changes the resultant output.

For a final and illustrative case, let’s investigate the padding when working with strided convolutions. These can be particularly difficult to visualize.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: 1 channel, 7x7 image
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1, 7, 7)

# Convolution with stride of 2 and no padding
conv_stride_no_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=0)
output_stride_no_pad = conv_stride_no_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape with stride 2 and no padding: {output_stride_no_pad.shape}")

# Convolution with stride of 2 and padding 1
conv_stride_pad = nn.Conv2d(1, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1)
output_stride_pad = conv_stride_pad(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape with stride 2 and padding 1: {output_stride_pad.shape}")

```

Here, we have two convolutional layers, both with a stride of 2. The first layer operates without padding, resulting in a 3x3 output, while the padded layer has a padding of 1 on all sides leading to a 4x4 output. Again, notice that the padding does not manifest itself as a visual effect in the output. Instead, it only changes the *final output size* of the convolutional operation based on where the kernel is applied. The padded layer will effectively compute more valid convolutions because the input is enlarged and there are no ‘out of bounds’ errors. The convolution is still calculating with the same kernel, stride, and weights.

To summarize, the output of a convolutional layer in PyTorch does not graphically display the padding because padding is a preprocessing step that alters the spatial dimensions of the input tensor before the convolutional operation. The output feature maps present the results of the convolution applied to this padded input, not the padding itself. The padding ensures the convolutional kernel can calculate at specified locations. Therefore, the user should not expect the padding to be visually observable in the output tensors. When using convolutional layers, especially when employing `same` padding or when working with strided convolutions, careful consideration of the effects of these different padding configurations on the output size is crucial.

For a deeper understanding, I suggest consulting resources that detail the mathematical operation behind convolution and padding, including guides on PyTorch’s specific implementation. Focus on understanding how kernel size, stride, and padding interact to determine the output size. Reading source code in libraries like PyTorch directly can also be immensely insightful. Additionally, papers and tutorials discussing convolutional neural network architectures often provide helpful context. Look for resources specifically outlining spatial operations in CNNs and the effects of different padding strategies, or even articles on how convolution and pooling interact.
