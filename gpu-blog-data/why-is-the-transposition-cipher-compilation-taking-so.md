The execution time of a transposition cipher, specifically its compilation or encoding phase, escalates drastically with increasing message length and complexity due to its inherent algorithmic characteristics. Having optimized and implemented several cipher variants for distributed message processing, I've observed that the primary bottleneck often isn't the core swapping of characters, but rather the ancillary operations—specifically key generation, padding, and memory management—that consume significant resources, particularly when dealing with large datasets or dynamic keys.

The core of a transposition cipher involves rearranging the characters of a plaintext message according to a specific permutation. A simple columnar transposition, for example, arranges the message into a grid, then reads the columns to create the ciphertext. This permutation, effectively the cipher’s key, dictates the order of columnar reading. More complex transposition ciphers might involve multiple permutations, route ciphers with geometric patterns, or even variable column lengths. Regardless of the specific method, the fundamental process involves indexing, accessing, and rewriting sequences of characters.

Several factors contribute to increased processing time. First, the key itself. If the key is generated dynamically, especially from sources that require complex computation or random number generation with specific statistical qualities (which cryptographic applications almost always necessitate), this key generation step becomes an overhead. For instance, deriving a unique key based on the message digest and then applying a shuffling algorithm adds considerable pre-processing time.

Secondly, and perhaps most substantially, is memory management. Transposition ciphers often require constructing intermediate data structures, like matrices or lists, to hold the plaintext during the transposition process. The larger the message, the larger these structures become, leading to substantial memory allocation and data movement overhead. In languages without efficient dynamic memory management, this can lead to performance bottlenecks. In situations where memory must be allocated and deallocated repeatedly or where frequent memory copying occurs, performance will degrade significantly.

Thirdly, the implementation details of the core transposition algorithm matter. The simple reading and writing of characters might appear trivial, however if nested loops or inefficient indexing are used, performance issues will arise. For example, using slow string concatenation operations or repeated substring operations instead of in-place character modification would also reduce efficiency. Furthermore, when handling texts that may not perfectly fill the grid used for transposition, padding is typically necessary. Padding procedures need to be handled efficiently because they involve appending specific characters to the original message before encryption. Finally, the efficiency of any implementation also depends on the programming language used as some languages have more efficient string and memory handling compared to others.

Let us consider three code examples to illustrate these points. These examples use Python for demonstration purposes due to its clarity, but the underlying principles apply across different languages. The examples intentionally prioritize clarity over extreme optimization.

**Example 1: Basic Columnar Transposition**

This example shows a simple columnar transposition.

```python
def columnar_transpose(text, key):
    cols = len(key)
    rows = (len(text) + cols - 1) // cols
    grid = [['' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

    k = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if k < len(text):
                grid[i][j] = text[k]
                k+=1

    ciphertext = ''
    sorted_key = sorted(range(cols), key=lambda x: key[x])
    for col_index in sorted_key:
        for row_index in range(rows):
            ciphertext += grid[row_index][col_index]
    return ciphertext

text = "This is a message for testing a columnar transposition cipher"
key = "zebras"
encrypted_text = columnar_transpose(text, key)
print (encrypted_text)
```

Here, the key step that could be inefficient is in construction of `grid` and how characters from the input are stored into it. The double-loop, while conceptually simple, scales quadratically with message and key size, especially if the implementation did not allocate the memory for the grid efficiently at its creation. While this code example constructs the grid in a single step, in some situations, memory may be allocated for each column one at a time, which results in unnecessary overhead. Also the nested loop reading the grid to create the ciphertext, while straightforward, has the potential to be a time bottleneck with very long messages.

**Example 2: Transposition with Dynamic Key Generation**

Here, the key is derived from the message digest using SHA256 and then shuffled using a basic random permutation algorithm.

```python
import hashlib
import random

def generate_dynamic_key(text, length):
    hash_value = hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    seed = int(hash_value, 16) % (10**8)
    random.seed(seed)
    key = list(range(length))
    random.shuffle(key)
    return "".join(map(str, key))

def columnar_transpose_dynamic(text, length):
    key = generate_dynamic_key(text, length)
    cols = len(key)
    rows = (len(text) + cols - 1) // cols
    grid = [['' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

    k = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if k < len(text):
                grid[i][j] = text[k]
                k+=1
    
    ciphertext = ''
    sorted_key = sorted(range(cols), key=lambda x: int(key[x]))
    for col_index in sorted_key:
        for row_index in range(rows):
            ciphertext += grid[row_index][col_index]
    return ciphertext

text = "A longer message with dynamic key generation to showcase the time delay associated"
length = 10
encrypted_text = columnar_transpose_dynamic(text, length)
print(encrypted_text)
```

In this example, the time cost is greatly impacted by the dynamic key generation using `hashlib.sha256` and the `random.shuffle` function. While the hashing itself can be reasonably fast, creating the key as a list, shuffling it, and then converting back to a string adds overhead. If the length of the generated key is substantial, this process is even more costly. It is worth noting that the conversion of individual characters of the key from strings to integers in line `sorted_key = sorted(range(cols), key=lambda x: int(key[x]))` can also contribute to overhead when the number of columns is high.

**Example 3: Transposition with Padding**

This example explicitly pads the message to fit perfectly into the grid.

```python
def transpose_with_padding(text, key, padding_char='X'):
    cols = len(key)
    rows = (len(text) + cols - 1) // cols
    padding_needed = (rows * cols) - len(text)
    padded_text = text + (padding_char * padding_needed)

    grid = [['' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

    k = 0
    for i in range(rows):
      for j in range(cols):
          if k < len(padded_text):
            grid[i][j] = padded_text[k]
            k+=1

    ciphertext = ''
    sorted_key = sorted(range(cols), key=lambda x: key[x])
    for col_index in sorted_key:
      for row_index in range(rows):
        ciphertext += grid[row_index][col_index]
    return ciphertext

text = "This message needs padding"
key = "12345"
encrypted_text = transpose_with_padding(text,key)
print(encrypted_text)
```

This example demonstrates explicit padding. The `padding_needed` calculation and the creation of `padded_text` are additional operations. While padding itself is not resource intensive, handling the edge case of messages that do not perfectly fit into a grid can contribute to additional computational costs, particularly if not handled carefully. Note how the message padding is also handled through string concatenation. It would be more efficient to directly update the message, where possible.

In conclusion, the prolonged compilation or execution time of transposition ciphers, even relatively straightforward implementations, stems from the intricate interplay between key management, memory allocation, and the specific implementations of the algorithms. When dealing with large-scale data or complex scenarios, optimization is critical to enhance throughput. For further study in this area, I recommend researching the following: 1) Textbooks that explain data structure and algorithm analysis focusing on time complexity of matrix operations, 2) resources that address cryptographic algorithm efficiency and specific implementations, and 3) guides that address profiling and optimization tools for specific development environments.
