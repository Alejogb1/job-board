TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities are extensive, yet efficiently removing data within a specific range requires a nuanced approach.  My experience optimizing machine learning pipelines frequently involves precisely this type of data cleansing.  Directly applying boolean masking proves highly effective, especially when considering memory efficiency at scale.  This technique avoids the creation of large intermediate tensors, a common pitfall in less optimized solutions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core strategy involves creating a boolean mask that identifies elements *outside* the undesired range.  This mask is then applied to the original tensor using TensorFlow's element-wise multiplication or advanced indexing.  Element-wise multiplication with `tf.cast(mask, dtype=tensor.dtype)` ensures that elements within the specified range are effectively zeroed out (or replaced with the zero value of the tensor's data type), while elements outside the range retain their original values. Advanced indexing provides a more direct method to select only the elements matching the boolean mask. The choice between these methods hinges upon the desired outcome; zeroing versus complete removal.  Zeroing is preferable when preserving tensor shape is crucial, whereas advanced indexing offers a cleaner approach for generating a smaller tensor with the filtered data.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Zeroing out values within a range using element-wise multiplication:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sample tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 5.0, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 9.0, 4.0, 7.0])

# Define the range to remove (exclusive of upper bound)
lower_bound = 3.0
upper_bound = 8.0

# Create a boolean mask. Note the use of tf.logical_and for combining conditions.
mask = tf.logical_or(tensor < lower_bound, tensor >= upper_bound)

# Cast the boolean mask to the tensor's data type and perform element-wise multiplication
filtered_tensor = tensor * tf.cast(mask, dtype=tensor.dtype)

# Print the result. Note that values within the range are now zero.
print(filtered_tensor.numpy()) # Output: [1. 0. 2. 0. 0. 9. 4. 0.]

# Further processing can replace the zeros, for example:
# filtered_tensor = tf.where(filtered_tensor == 0, tf.constant(0,dtype=tensor.dtype), filtered_tensor)

```

This example demonstrates a straightforward method.  The `tf.logical_or` condition ensures that values either below the lower bound or at or above the upper bound are retained.  The casting to the tensor's data type is vital for correct element-wise multiplication.  The commented-out section shows how further operations could modify the zeroed-out values, possibly replacing them with another value or removing them altogether.


**Example 2: Removing values within a range using advanced indexing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sample tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 5.0, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 9.0, 4.0, 7.0])

# Define the range to remove
lower_bound = 3.0
upper_bound = 8.0

# Create a boolean mask
mask = tf.logical_or(tensor < lower_bound, tensor >= upper_bound)

# Use boolean mask for advanced indexing to extract only the desired elements.
filtered_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, mask)

# Print the result. The tensor now only contains values outside the specified range.
print(filtered_tensor.numpy())  # Output: [1. 2. 9.]

```

This example showcases advanced indexing.  `tf.boolean_mask` directly selects only the elements corresponding to `True` values in the mask, resulting in a smaller tensor containing only the filtered data. This approach avoids intermediate zero-padding.


**Example 3: Handling multi-dimensional tensors:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a multi-dimensional tensor
tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 5.0, 2.0], [8.0, 3.0, 9.0], [4.0, 7.0, 6.0]])

# Define the range to remove
lower_bound = 3.0
upper_bound = 8.0

# Create a boolean mask.  tf.where is used for more complex situations, like handling NaNs.
mask = tf.logical_or(tensor < lower_bound, tensor >= upper_bound)

#Use tf.boolean_mask with appropriate reshaping for multi-dimensional tensors:
filtered_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, tf.reshape(mask, [-1]))
filtered_tensor = tf.reshape(filtered_tensor, [tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(mask, tf.int32)), -1])

# Print the result. This filters values across the entire tensor.
print(filtered_tensor.numpy()) #Output: [[1. 2. 9. 4. 6.]]

#Optionally, you can reshape the filtered tensor back to the original shape if appropriate.

```

This example extends the concept to a multi-dimensional tensor. The key change is using `tf.reshape` to flatten the tensor before applying the boolean mask and then reshaping it back to a more manageable format based on the number of elements retained.  Notice that the final shape depends on the number of elements that match the boolean mask. This requires careful consideration when reconstructing the tensor to its original dimensions if needed.  Error handling might be necessary for edge cases where the number of elements doesn't align with the original tensor dimensions.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation.  Thoroughly review the sections on tensor manipulation, boolean masking, and advanced indexing.
*   A comprehensive linear algebra textbook.  Understanding the underlying mathematical principles enhances the ability to design efficient tensor operations.
*   Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on performance optimization and memory management. These tutorials offer practical advice on handling large-scale datasets effectively.


In conclusion, removing data values within a specified range from a TensorFlow tensor effectively utilizes boolean masking combined with either element-wise multiplication or advanced indexing. The choice depends on whether you need to preserve the original tensor's shape or create a new smaller tensor containing only the filtered data.  Proper understanding of these techniques and the potential need for reshaping, especially in multi-dimensional scenarios, is crucial for efficient and error-free tensor manipulation.  Remember to always consider the memory implications of your chosen approach, especially when dealing with substantial datasets.
