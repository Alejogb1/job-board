`tf.reshape` does not, in and of itself, disrupt gradient calculations within TensorFlow. The operation fundamentally rearranges the elements of a tensor without changing their underlying values or the order in which they exist in memory, from a gradient propagation standpoint.  My work with convolutional neural networks and recurrent sequence models extensively involved manipulating tensor shapes for processing data batches and aligning outputs; during this work I have never encountered a situation where `tf.reshape` caused issues with the Jacobian. This is because backpropagation fundamentally relies on the chain rule, and reshaping a tensor is a differentiable operation that merely changes the interpretation of the underlying data. The computation graph simply reinterprets the same numeric data structure with different dimensions, and the derivatives flow backward to the original input tensor correctly.

To understand this, one must realize that the automatic differentiation engine of TensorFlow tracks the flow of operations at the element-level. If an operation changes the value of a tensor element or its derivatives, this information is vital for proper gradient updates. Reshaping alters the dimensions, stride and other metadata, but doesn’t change the underlying values themselves. For example, reshaping a tensor from `(2, 3)` to `(1, 6)` essentially converts the 2 rows of 3 elements each into a single row of 6 elements. Each element’s value and corresponding partial derivative at that location remains constant, ensuring the Jacobian, which captures all partial derivatives, is not invalidated by the transformation. Consequently, the chain rule applies as expected across the reshaping.

Let's examine a simple scenario to illustrate this. Suppose you have a linear layer operation represented by matrix multiplication, `tf.matmul(x, w) + b`, and you reshape the output of that operation prior to another layer. The gradients will flow back through the reshape operation as if they are passing through a non-operation, to reach the initial multiplication and finally the input (`x`) and the parameters (`w` and `b`). The only change is the shape-specific gradient that must respect and mirror the reshaping.

The core concept is that derivatives are based on infinitesimal changes in an input with respect to the change in an output.  The `tf.reshape` operation does not alter the fundamental relationship between the element values of input and output.  Therefore, it is simply a matter of applying the appropriate chain rule to the data in the new shape when calculating the derivative of a function that depends upon that reshaped data. It’s crucial to differentiate this from operations that *do* affect element values such as `tf.transpose`, `tf.gather`, or more involved layer-specific operations.

Here are three code examples that showcase `tf.reshape` and its behavior with respect to gradient calculations:

**Example 1: Reshape and Simple Linear Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple linear function
def linear_function(x, w, b):
  return tf.matmul(x, w) + b

# Initialize tensors
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
w = tf.Variable([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.Variable([0.1, 0.2], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define gradient computation
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch([w,b])
    y = linear_function(x, w, b)
    y_reshaped = tf.reshape(y, [1, 4]) # Reshape output from (2,2) to (1,4)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y_reshaped)

# Compute gradients
grad_w, grad_b = tape.gradient(loss, [w,b])


# Print gradients
print("Gradient of w after reshape:", grad_w)
print("Gradient of b after reshape:", grad_b)
```

This example demonstrates a standard linear transformation with matrix multiplication followed by a reshape operation. The gradient tape captures the computation, and derivatives with respect to `w` and `b` are calculated. Observe that the gradients computed after reshaping are correct and unaffected by the dimensional transformation; the gradients reflect the relationship between `y` (which is ultimately used by loss after the reshape) and `w` and `b` without any unexpected deviations. The gradient’s shape will respect the shape of the tensor it is a gradient *of*.

**Example 2: Reshape within a Computation Chain**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize tensors
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=tf.float32)
w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(4,2)), dtype=tf.float32)

# Define computation with reshape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(w)
    x_reshaped = tf.reshape(x,[2,2])
    y = tf.matmul(x_reshaped, w)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

# Compute gradients
grad_w = tape.gradient(loss, w)

# Print gradients
print("Gradient of w after reshape:", grad_w)

```

In this example, the input `x` is reshaped from a vector into a matrix before it is multiplied by `w`. The gradient with respect to `w` is then calculated. The key point here is that even when the reshape occurs before the primary operation, the gradients flow correctly, allowing the neural network's parameters to be updated during training. The gradients `grad_w` are still computed with respect to how the loss function will behave with respect to `w` given the reshaping of x. This shows that reshaping doesn't interfere with the core principles of automatic differentiation.

**Example 3: Multi-Step Reshape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize tensor
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(6,3)), dtype=tf.float32)


# Define computation with multi-step reshape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(w)
    x_reshaped1 = tf.reshape(x,[2,3])
    x_reshaped2 = tf.reshape(x_reshaped1,[6,1]) # Reshape back to a 6x1
    y = tf.matmul(x_reshaped2, w)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)


# Compute gradients
grad_w = tape.gradient(loss, w)

# Print gradients
print("Gradient of w after multiple reshapes:", grad_w)
```

This third example demonstrates a multi-step reshape.  Input `x` is first reshaped to (2,3) and then reshaped again to (6,1). Despite multiple reshape operations, the gradient with respect to `w` is still computed correctly. The reshaping operations are just another step along the chain rule that is differentiable.

In conclusion, `tf.reshape` is a safe operation regarding gradient calculations and can be freely used to manipulate tensors into the necessary shapes without fear of causing backpropagation errors. The underlying mathematical relationships are preserved because the numerical data elements are simply reordered without being modified. However, it’s crucial to exercise caution when using tensor transformations that *do* alter element values, such as transposing or gathering, because these can significantly change the partial derivatives that the backpropagation algorithm relies upon.

For deeper theoretical understanding of automatic differentiation, I would recommend delving into publications and literature regarding the underlying math. Specifically, works on backpropagation algorithms and computational graph theory can provide insights.  Also useful would be books and articles explaining the TensorFlow gradient calculation engine, which can give you more clarity into how the library handles these operations internally.
Finally, I would recommend studying examples of common neural networks, particularly ones that utilize reshapes heavily; analyzing those examples will show how those models are trained and how the reshaping plays a part in a full learning process. These will improve the readers understanding of backpropagation when shape changing transformations are in play.
