PyTorch Lightning's handling of trainable parameters, specifically during its optimization phase, can appear misleading if one conflates the framework’s internal bookkeeping with the underlying PyTorch module's inherent structure. My experience building a complex multi-modal transformer network highlighted this. The perceived "incorrectness" stems not from a bug in Lightning, but rather from a difference in scope and abstraction. PyTorch Lightning abstracts the training loop, handling optimizers and gradient updates; its methods for accessing “trainable parameters” do not directly mirror those one would use with a raw PyTorch `nn.Module`.

The core concept to understand is that PyTorch itself maintains a list of parameters registered with an `nn.Module` that require gradient computation; these are, in essence, the parameters involved in training. In contrast, PyTorch Lightning, in its `LightningModule`, offers several ways to define and interact with parameters. It manages optimization state (including gradients and updates), which might not be directly reflected in simple calls to `model.parameters()`. This difference, however, is intentional. PyTorch Lightning aims to provide more granular control over optimization steps, including advanced techniques like mixed precision and gradient accumulation. It needs its own internal management system, resulting in discrepancies in parameter availability at different phases.

Let's examine the typical workflow with a standard PyTorch model, and then contrast it with a Lightning-managed model. Using the vanilla approach, parameters are typically accessed directly.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Accessing parameters in standard PyTorch
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter Name: {name}, Requires Grad: {param.requires_grad}")

# Typical training loop (simplified)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_data)
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, torch.randn(1, 1))
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

This code block demonstrates the standard way to work with parameters in PyTorch. `model.named_parameters()` provides access to the named parameters and indicates whether they `requires_grad`, essential for gradient backpropagation. The `optimizer` is initialized using these parameters, ensuring updates are applied correctly. All changes in the forward pass cascade backward, updating the parameters within the registered `nn.Module`.

Now, let's observe how this differs within a PyTorch Lightning environment. The `LightningModule` uses `configure_optimizers` to manage the optimizer rather than directly injecting parameters. The parameters that Lightning tracks are tied to the optimizer setup. We also can modify parameters via custom training loops that utilize `optimizer.step()` directly.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class LightningSimpleModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x = batch
        output = self(x)
        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, torch.randn(1, 1))
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
       optimizer = optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.001)
       return optimizer


model = LightningSimpleModel()

# Accessing parameters in PyTorch Lightning (at initialization)
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter Name: {name}, Requires Grad: {param.requires_grad}")


# Example of parameter usage after optimization definition.
trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=1)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
trainer.fit(model, train_dataloaders=[dummy_input])
```

In this example, while the parameter printing in initialization looks similar to the standard PyTorch example, the parameters used for optimization are now managed via the `configure_optimizers` hook. The `training_step` function utilizes the parameters registered during the optimizer's configuration.  PyTorch Lightning tracks all trainable parameters through this mechanism, not just the bare `nn.Module.parameters()` object. This management is done behind the scenes.

Where the confusion often arises is when a user attempts to manually manipulate `model.parameters()` after the initialization but expects those changes to be automatically reflected in the optimizer's state. This will not happen as PyTorch Lightning relies on parameters configured during `configure_optimizers`. We can demonstrate this with a modified example.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class LightningSimpleModelModified(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.new_param = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5,5))


    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x = batch
        output = self(x)
        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, torch.randn(1, 1))
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
       optimizer = optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.001)
       return optimizer


model = LightningSimpleModelModified()

# Add a new parameter after initialization but BEFORE configuration
model.new_param = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5,5))
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        print(f"Parameter Name (before optimizer): {name}, Requires Grad: {param.requires_grad}")

# Print parameters after configuring optimizers
trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=1)
trainer.fit(model, train_dataloaders=[torch.randn(1,10)])

print("Parameters after fit: ")
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter Name (after fit): {name}, Requires Grad: {param.requires_grad}")
```

In this modified example, `new_param` is added after the initial construction of the `LightningSimpleModelModified` but before the training and optimization takes place. The parameter is visible when querying `named_parameters` directly before optimizer configuration. When inspecting parameters *after* a full `fit` call, however, this parameter has been properly registered as requiring gradients. The optimizer is configured *after* the parameter is added. It becomes part of the trainable set when the optimizer is initialized within the `configure_optimizers` method.

The important takeaway is that PyTorch Lightning doesn’t implicitly track every parameter defined anywhere within a `LightningModule` object. It explicitly uses parameters identified by `self.parameters()` called inside the `configure_optimizers()` method. This ensures consistency and allows PyTorch Lightning to manage different optimizers and schedules, all while adhering to PyTorch’s core parameter management principles.

Instead of considering this a "bug" it's more accurate to view it as a design decision that enforces a specific framework for organizing and handling model parameters. For users who want to manage parameters outside of the traditional `configure_optimizers()` way, PyTorch Lightning provides complete flexibility to do so within the `training_step` (and other related loops), with direct access to gradient calculation and optimization.

To solidify one’s understanding and mastery of these concepts, I recommend consulting resources directly related to PyTorch's `nn.Module` and parameter registration mechanisms, specifically exploring the use of `requires_grad`. Furthermore, I’ve found thorough exploration of the PyTorch Lightning documentation, specifically the sections detailing `configure_optimizers` and manual optimization steps, immensely useful. Finally, a good understanding of how optimizers track parameters is crucial, including the difference between `model.parameters()` and how this is used in `optimizer.step()`. Focusing on these resources will build a solid foundation for working effectively with both vanilla PyTorch and the PyTorch Lightning framework.
