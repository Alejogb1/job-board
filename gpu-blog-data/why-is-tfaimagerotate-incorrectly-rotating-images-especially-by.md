TensorFlow Addons (tfa) `tfa.image.rotate`, specifically when used with rotations by multiples of 90 degrees, exhibits an artifact often manifested as unexpected image shearing or distorted pixel alignment. This behavior stems from its internal implementation which combines rotation with an interpolation method that is not always best suited for these particular transformations, and, more critically, how it treats the output image dimensions. Over my several years working on image processing pipelines, I have frequently observed this behavior, prompting a need for a better understanding of the underlying causes and how to mitigate them.

The root cause is that `tfa.image.rotate` does not guarantee that the output image dimensions are exactly preserved, particularly when the rotation angle is not a simple multiple of 180 degrees. With 90-degree rotations, for example, the algorithm often computes new dimensions based on the bounding box encompassing the rotated image, which may result in an image that is slightly larger than the original, even if the visual content appears within the original image bounds. The rotation itself is often performed via a bilinear or other similar interpolation, and while these are generally suitable for arbitrary rotations, the dimension mismatch combined with the interpolation leads to a slight skew, or distortion, when viewed against the original image axes. The algorithm doesn’t consistently center the rotation, resulting in a subtle but visible shift and shearing effect when the interpolated pixels are fitted into the output array.

This behavior is not an outright bug but rather a side effect of the generic way that `tfa.image.rotate` is implemented to handle arbitrary rotations. It prioritizes flexibility over pixel-perfect preservation for specific cases, leading to the observed artifacts.

Let me illustrate with a few code snippets and commentary. First, I will perform a 90-degree rotation on a simple square image using the default parameters.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_addons as tfa
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a sample square image (100x100 with a simple gradient)
image = np.arange(10000).reshape(100,100)
image = tf.constant(image, dtype=tf.float32)
image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=-1)  # Add channel dimension
image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0) # Add batch dimension

# Perform the 90-degree rotation
rotated_image_90 = tfa.image.rotate(image, tf.constant(np.pi/2))
rotated_image_90 = tf.squeeze(rotated_image_90).numpy()

#Display original and rotated images
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2)
ax[0].imshow(tf.squeeze(image).numpy())
ax[0].set_title("Original Image")
ax[1].imshow(rotated_image_90)
ax[1].set_title("Rotated Image (90 degrees)")
plt.show()

```

The output from this code will show a slight shearing effect on the rotated image compared to the original. This is because the bilinear interpolation does not perfectly align the rotated image pixels back to the output raster grid within the slightly altered dimension of the output. The dimensions may also be very slightly larger than 100x100.

Next, I will demonstrate how this issue becomes more pronounced when rotating back to the original orientation.

```python
# Rotate the image by 90 degrees twice
rotated_image_180 = tfa.image.rotate(rotated_image_90[tf.newaxis, ...], tf.constant(np.pi/2))
rotated_image_180 = tf.squeeze(rotated_image_180).numpy()

#Display original, 90 deg, and 180 deg rotated images
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3)
ax[0].imshow(tf.squeeze(image).numpy())
ax[0].set_title("Original Image")
ax[1].imshow(rotated_image_90)
ax[1].set_title("Rotated Image (90 degrees)")
ax[2].imshow(rotated_image_180)
ax[2].set_title("Rotated Image (180 degrees)")
plt.show()

```

Here, the output image `rotated_image_180`, which should be a perfect 180-degree rotation of the original, exhibits notable degradation and pixel misalignment. The errors accumulated during each rotation compound, further distorting the image. The use of an intermediary image in a pipeline, as is common practice when applying multiple image augmentations, means such minor errors can accumulate to more significant visual artifacts.

Finally, I will illustrate how using a different interpolation method such as 'nearest' sometimes reduces the artifact, though it introduces a new one – blockiness due to the nature of the interpolation.

```python
# Rotate the image by 90 degrees using 'nearest' interpolation
rotated_image_nearest = tfa.image.rotate(image, tf.constant(np.pi/2), interpolation='nearest')
rotated_image_nearest = tf.squeeze(rotated_image_nearest).numpy()

#Display original and rotated nearest images
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2)
ax[0].imshow(tf.squeeze(image).numpy())
ax[0].set_title("Original Image")
ax[1].imshow(rotated_image_nearest)
ax[1].set_title("Rotated Image (90 degrees, Nearest)")
plt.show()
```

While the shearing effect might be less pronounced, the image appears blockier due to the nearest-neighbor interpolation picking the closest pixel. This highlights that the choice of interpolation method can affect the specific nature of the artifact observed.

To mitigate these issues, I have found several techniques effective in my work. Firstly, if rotations are only by multiples of 90 degrees, employing a function that performs in-place transposition and flipping operations (which are equivalent to 90 degree rotations) can be advantageous. This approach avoids interpolation altogether, preserving the original pixel structure. It would not use the tensorflow `tfa.image.rotate` but instead use a combination of tensor transposes and flips. Another effective workaround is padding images slightly before rotation and then cropping them back to their original dimensions after rotation. This helps center the rotation more precisely and can reduce the issues arising from the automatic dimension calculation within the `tfa.image.rotate` function. It also provides a form of ‘guard’ region around the image. If arbitrary rotations are necessary, I have found that libraries focused on image transformations rather than general tensor operations often provide a better result – albeit often at the cost of having the images converted to NumPy arrays instead of staying as tensors.

Regarding resource recommendations for anyone experiencing similar challenges, I would suggest reviewing material discussing image transformations from a signal processing point of view. Studying image resampling techniques and the mathematics behind rotation operations can help clarify the behavior of interpolation algorithms. A good starting point would be books and articles dealing with image processing or computer graphics. Material explaining the fundamentals of rotation matrices and their impact on pixel coordinates within an image grid would also be beneficial. Additionally, research into the specifics of different interpolation methods and their effect on image quality and distortion is crucial for making informed choices in image manipulation pipelines. Lastly, I would suggest consulting documentation for image processing libraries that may be in competition with tensorflow addons to see if their solutions better meet your specific application.
