The core issue lies in the fundamental nature of exception handling and its interaction with iterative processes, specifically those employing cursors.  An exception thrown within a cursor loop's iteration block doesn't merely halt the *current* iteration; it propagates upwards, terminating the loop entirely unless explicitly caught and handled within the loop's scope. This behavior is consistent across numerous database systems and programming languages that interact with them. My experience working with Oracle PL/SQL, T-SQL, and Python's database interaction libraries solidified this understanding over numerous projects, particularly during the development of a large-scale data warehousing application.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Cursor loops operate by iteratively fetching rows from a result set. Each iteration involves fetching the next row and processing it within the loop's body.  When an exception occurs within this body – such as a constraint violation, division by zero, or a database connection error – the program's control flow immediately transfers to the nearest exception handler. If no appropriate handler is found within the loop itself, the exception bubbles up the call stack, ultimately terminating the loop and possibly the entire application depending on the exception's severity and the absence of a higher-level handler. This behavior isn't specific to cursor loops; it's a fundamental aspect of structured exception handling.  The crucial distinction is that the loop doesn't automatically resume after the exception is handled; it concludes.  This is because the exceptional condition typically indicates a failure within a core aspect of the loop's operation, rendering continued iteration potentially unsafe or illogical.  For instance, if a database connection is lost during a row processing, further iterations are likely to fail as well.

The behavior differs from situations where the loop includes explicit conditional checks and breaks.  Conditional breaks are deliberate program control flow changes, executed upon satisfying a specified condition. Exceptions, on the other hand, represent unexpected and potentially disruptive events requiring immediate attention.  The design choice to terminate the loop reflects a prioritized focus on handling the error condition and preventing propagation of potentially harmful side effects.  Resuming iteration after an unhandled exception might lead to data corruption or inconsistent state within the application and the database.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: PL/SQL (Oracle)**

```sql
DECLARE
  CURSOR emp_cur IS
    SELECT emp_id, salary FROM employees WHERE dept_id = 10;
  emp_rec emp_cur%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN emp_cur;
  LOOP
    FETCH emp_cur INTO emp_rec;
    EXIT WHEN emp_cur%NOTFOUND;
    BEGIN
      -- Potential division by zero error
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ID: ' || emp_rec.emp_id || ', Salary: ' || emp_rec.salary / 0);
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: Division by zero for employee ' || emp_rec.emp_id);
    END;
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE emp_cur;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An unexpected error occurred: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
/
```

*Commentary:* This PL/SQL example demonstrates a nested exception handler. The inner handler catches the `ZERO_DIVIDE` exception, preventing the entire loop from terminating if a single row causes the error. The outer handler catches any other exceptions, providing a safety net for unforeseen issues.  However, even with the nested handler, the loop will still process only rows *before* the exception occurred.  Rows after the exception will not be handled.


**Example 2: T-SQL (SQL Server)**

```sql
DECLARE @emp_id INT, @salary INT;
DECLARE emp_cur CURSOR FOR
SELECT emp_id, salary FROM Employees WHERE dept_id = 10;
OPEN emp_cur;
FETCH NEXT FROM emp_cur INTO @emp_id, @salary;
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Potential error: invalid cast
        SELECT @salary = CAST(@salary AS DECIMAL(5,2)) * 2;  
        PRINT 'Employee ID: ' + CAST(@emp_id AS VARCHAR(10)) + ', Salary: ' + CAST(@salary AS VARCHAR(20));
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        PRINT 'Error processing employee ' + CAST(@emp_id AS VARCHAR(10)) + ': ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END CATCH;
    FETCH NEXT FROM emp_cur INTO @emp_id, @salary;
END;
CLOSE emp_cur;
DEALLOCATE emp_cur;
```

*Commentary:*  This T-SQL snippet utilizes `TRY...CATCH` blocks for exception handling within the loop.  Similar to the PL/SQL example,  the `CATCH` block provides a localized exception handling mechanism. It catches the exception and prints an error message, but the loop continues to the next row. The loop stops only when `@@FETCH_STATUS` is no longer 0, meaning no more rows are available.   The primary difference is that error messages are printed without interrupting processing further rows.


**Example 3: Python with psycopg2 (PostgreSQL)**

```python
import psycopg2

try:
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydb user=myuser password=mypassword")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT id, value FROM mytable")
    for row in cur:
        try:
            # Potential ValueError
            result = int(row[1]) / 0
            print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Result: {result}")
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Value Error for ID {row[0]}: {e}")
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            print(f"ZeroDivisionError for ID {row[0]}: {e}")
    cur.close()
    conn.close()
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
```

*Commentary:* This Python example uses `psycopg2` to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The outer `try...except` block handles database connection errors. The inner `try...except` block handles specific exceptions during row processing (like `ValueError` if `row[1]` cannot be cast to an integer, and `ZeroDivisionError`).  Similar to the previous examples, the loop continues to the next iteration if an exception is handled within the inner block. However, a database error in the outer `try...except` will halt execution.  Note the distinct handling of different exceptions for granular error management.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of exception handling, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your specific database system and programming language.  Thorough study of database error codes and their meanings is also invaluable.  Additionally, books on database programming and advanced SQL techniques will provide contextual knowledge on cursor usage and effective error management strategies.  Practicing with diverse exception scenarios and implementing robust exception handling is crucial for building reliable database applications.  Reviewing examples and code from open-source projects with mature database interaction can also aid in learning best practices.
