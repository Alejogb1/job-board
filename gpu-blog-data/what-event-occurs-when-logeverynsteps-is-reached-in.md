The core functionality triggered by reaching `log_every_n_steps` in a PyTorch Lightning Trainer is the logging of metrics and potentially model states to the chosen logger.  This isn't simply a matter of printing values; it's a coordinated event that integrates with the underlying training loop and interacts significantly with the logging backend.  My experience working on large-scale image classification and generative models highlighted the importance of correctly configuring this parameter, especially when dealing with distributed training and sophisticated logging mechanisms.

**1.  Detailed Explanation:**

`log_every_n_steps` dictates the frequency of logging events within the PyTorch Lightning training loop.  It's an integer value specifying the number of training steps between successive logging operations.  Crucially, the event isn't solely about logging the current training loss;  it triggers a broader logging process encompassing any metrics explicitly tracked by the Trainer. This includes both scalar metrics (like loss, accuracy, etc.) and potentially more complex data (like histograms of activations or gradients, depending on the chosen logger's capabilities).

The precise behavior depends on how your `LightningModule` is structured.  Specifically, the `training_step`, `validation_step`, and `test_step` methods dictate what metrics are collected.  These methods should return a dictionary containing the metrics you wish to log. The Trainer then automatically gathers these metrics from each batch processed in those steps and aggregates them, respecting the `log_every_n_steps` setting.

The logging action itself leverages the logging backend configured in the Trainer.  Common backends include TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, Comet ML, and more. The Trainer interacts with the chosen backend to store the logged data, allowing for visualization and analysis during and after training. The specific format and functionalities differ between backends.

One common misunderstanding is that `log_every_n_steps` is tied directly to the logging of the loss function.  While the loss is typically logged, it’s important to understand it’s just one of many metrics potentially logged at this interval. The logging procedure also encompasses any other metrics returned by your `LightningModule`'s steps.

Furthermore, the triggering of this event is not only bound to the main training loop.  It also applies during validation and testing, depending on how `log_every_n_steps` interacts with the `val_check_interval` and `test_check_interval` parameters. The interaction can become complex in scenarios involving multiple GPUs or TPUs where the aggregation and logging process require careful coordination across devices.  My work on a large-scale language model involved managing the efficient logging from 32 GPUs, which required detailed understanding of these interactions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Logging**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... model definition ...

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        # ... forward pass ...
        loss = self.loss_function(outputs, y)
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        return loss

    # ... other methods ...

trainer = pl.Trainer(
    max_epochs=10,
    log_every_n_steps=10,
    logger=TensorBoardLogger("tb_logs", name="my_experiment"),
)
trainer.fit(MyModel(), datamodule)
```

This example demonstrates the basic usage.  `log_every_n_steps=10` ensures that the `train_loss` is logged to TensorBoard every 10 training steps. The `self.log` method within the `training_step` is crucial; this is how metrics are registered for logging by the Trainer.


**Example 2: Logging Multiple Metrics**

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... model definition ...

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        # ... forward pass ...
        loss = self.loss_function(outputs, y)
        accuracy = self.calculate_accuracy(outputs, y)
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        self.log('train_accuracy', accuracy)
        return loss

    # ... other methods ...

trainer = pl.Trainer(
    max_epochs=10,
    log_every_n_steps=50,
    logger=TensorBoardLogger("tb_logs", name="my_experiment"),
)
trainer.fit(MyModel(), datamodule)

```

Here, both `train_loss` and `train_accuracy` are logged every 50 steps, illustrating the logging of multiple metrics.  The flexibility to log various metrics is a key advantage of this mechanism.

**Example 3:  Handling Validation Logging**


```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    # ... model definition and training_step ...

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        # ... forward pass ...
        loss = self.loss_function(outputs, y)
        accuracy = self.calculate_accuracy(outputs, y)
        self.log('val_loss', loss, on_step=False, on_epoch=True) #Log at epoch end
        self.log('val_accuracy', accuracy, on_step=False, on_epoch=True)
        return {'val_loss': loss, 'val_accuracy': accuracy}

    # ... other methods ...

trainer = pl.Trainer(
    max_epochs=10,
    log_every_n_steps=100,
    logger=TensorBoardLogger("tb_logs", name="my_experiment"),
    val_check_interval=1.0, #Validate every epoch
)
trainer.fit(MyModel(), datamodule)
```
This shows validation logging.  `on_step=False, on_epoch=True` ensures metrics are logged at the epoch's end, rather than after each batch during validation.  Note how `log_every_n_steps` still affects the logging frequency;  the validation metrics are logged to the logger at the `log_every_n_steps` interval during the validation loop.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch Lightning documentation.  Explore the sections on loggers and the `Trainer`'s configuration options.  Consider reviewing examples demonstrating the logging of various metrics and using different logging backends.  Pay attention to the differences between `on_step` and `on_epoch` parameters within the `self.log` method.  Examining the source code of different logging backends (TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, etc.) can provide deeper insights into their specific functionalities.  Finally, understanding the principles of distributed training in PyTorch is beneficial for optimizing logging performance in multi-GPU/TPU settings.
