Multi-threaded multi-GPU computation optimization necessitates a nuanced understanding of data partitioning, communication overhead, and the inherent limitations of both OpenMP and OpenACC.  My experience optimizing large-scale fluid dynamics simulations, involving terabyte-sized datasets and hundreds of processing cores across multiple NVIDIA GPUs, highlights the critical role of careful memory management and algorithmic design.  Simply parallelizing existing code rarely yields optimal performance; rather, a restructuring informed by performance analysis is crucial.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Effective multi-threaded multi-GPU computation hinges on leveraging the strengths of each technology while mitigating their weaknesses. OpenMP excels in managing multi-threading within a single node, efficiently utilizing multiple CPU cores for tasks suitable for shared memory parallelism. Conversely, OpenACC shines in directing data movement and computation across multiple GPUs, leveraging their superior floating-point performance.  The optimal approach involves a hybrid strategy, employing OpenMP for CPU-bound pre- and post-processing steps and for managing data transfer between the CPU and GPUs, while using OpenACC to accelerate computationally intensive kernels on the GPUs.

A crucial aspect is minimizing data transfer between CPU and GPU.  This overhead, often significantly impacting performance, can be reduced through careful data partitioning and the judicious use of asynchronous data transfers.  Furthermore, the choice of data structures profoundly affects performance.  Structures optimized for GPU memory access patterns, such as coalesced memory access, are essential.  Ignoring these factors can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, despite the apparent parallelism.  My experience shows that a 10x speedup is easily achievable through proper optimization, while a poorly implemented strategy might offer only marginal improvements or even performance degradation.

Another key consideration is the granularity of parallelism.  Over-parallelization can lead to excessive thread management overhead, negating performance gains.  This is particularly relevant when using OpenMP on the CPU, where the thread creation and synchronization costs can outweigh the benefits of increased parallelism for fine-grained tasks.  A careful performance analysis using tools like VTune Amplifier and NVIDIA Nsight Compute is indispensable for determining the optimal granularity and identifying performance bottlenecks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the hybrid OpenMP/OpenACC approach applied to a simple matrix multiplication problem. This is a simplified representation of the complexity involved in real-world scenarios but adequately demonstrates the key concepts.

**Example 1: CPU-based Initialization using OpenMP**

```c++
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int N = 1024;
  double **A = (double **)malloc(N * sizeof(double *));
  double **B = (double **)malloc(N * sizeof(double *));
  double **C = (double **)malloc(N * sizeof(double *));

  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    A[i] = (double *)malloc(N * sizeof(double));
    B[i] = (double *)malloc(N * sizeof(double));
    C[i] = (double *)malloc(N * sizeof(double));
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      A[i][j] = i + j;
      B[i][j] = i - j;
      C[i][j] = 0.0; // Initialize result matrix
    }
  }
  // ... further computation involving A, B, and C ...
}
```

*Commentary:*  This snippet demonstrates OpenMP's utility in parallel initialization. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive distributes the loop iterations across available CPU cores, significantly reducing initialization time for large matrices.  This pre-processing step is crucial before offloading the computationally intensive multiplication to the GPUs.

**Example 2: GPU-based Matrix Multiplication using OpenACC**

```c++
#include <openacc.h>

// ... assuming A, B, and C are already allocated and initialized ...

#pragma acc kernels
{
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Commentary:* This example uses OpenACC to offload the matrix multiplication to the GPU. The `#pragma acc kernels` directive specifies that the enclosed code should be executed on the GPU.  The `#pragma acc loop independent` directives enable parallel execution of the loops, exploiting the GPU's many cores.  The choice of independent loops is critical; dependent loops require different strategies, often involving restructuring the algorithm.  Properly utilizing the `independent` clause is paramount for optimal performance.


**Example 3:  Asynchronous Data Transfer with OpenACC**

```c++
#include <openacc.h>

// ... assuming A, B, C allocated on host ...

#pragma acc data copyin(A[0:N][0:N], B[0:N][0:N]) copyout(C[0:N][0:N]) async(1)
{
  // ... GPU computation (Example 2) ...
}

acc_wait(1); // wait for asynchronous operations
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates asynchronous data transfer using OpenACC.  The `acc_data` directive asynchronously copies data from the host (CPU) to the device (GPU) (`copyin`) and back (`copyout`), using asynchronous stream 1. This allows for overlapping data transfer with computation, minimizing idle time.  `acc_wait(1)` synchronizes the program, ensuring that the data transfer is complete before proceeding.  The use of asynchronous operations is a key optimization technique, especially in scenarios with significant data transfer overhead.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult the official OpenMP and OpenACC specifications.  Study guides focusing on performance optimization techniques for parallel programming are invaluable.  Consider also exploring advanced materials on GPU architecture and programming models to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hardware limitations and optimization strategies for various hardware architectures.  Finally, thoroughly researching advanced data structures and algorithms tailored for parallel computing will significantly improve your ability to design and optimize highly efficient multi-threaded, multi-GPU applications.  Profiling tools such as VTune Amplifier and NVIDIA Nsight Compute are essential for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.
