Tensor creation in PyTorch requires consistent data types within its input. Specifically, when dealing with nested lists of strings, a direct conversion using `torch.tensor()` will fail because PyTorch tensors are designed for numerical data, not arbitrary strings. This results in a `TypeError` because the function cannot automatically map strings to numerical values suitable for tensor representation. I've encountered this exact issue when working with text preprocessing pipelines for sequence-to-sequence models where raw input frequently arrived as lists of strings before tokenization. To address this, we need to encode the strings numerically prior to creating the tensor.

The core problem stems from the foundational design of PyTorch tensors. Tensors, at their heart, are multidimensional arrays of numerical data, typically floating-point numbers or integers. They form the basis for all neural network computations within PyTorch. Directly passing a list containing strings violates this principle. The `torch.tensor()` function attempts to automatically infer a consistent data type from its input. When confronted with a mixed type, or specifically strings, it throws a `TypeError`. The solution involves transforming the strings into a numerical representation through encoding. The most common approach involves mapping each unique string to an integer. Then this numerical representation is used as the foundation for our tensor.

There are several methods for this string-to-integer encoding. The basic approach involves creating a dictionary (or equivalent lookup) to store unique strings and their corresponding integer IDs. This dictionary becomes our vocabulary, where each word or string is assigned an integer index. I've seen this straightforward approach work well in many practical cases. However, for more sophisticated models, pre-existing tokenizers from libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers can streamline this process. These tokenizers often provide subword tokenization, which is useful for handling rare words and varying word forms. But for our purposes, focusing on the basic integer encoding method will demonstrate the core principle.

Let's examine a basic example without external libraries. Assume we have a nested list of strings like this:

```python
import torch

nested_list = [["apple", "banana", "cherry"], ["date", "elderberry", "fig"], ["grape", "honeydew", "kiwi"]]

# 1. Create a vocabulary mapping unique words to integer IDs.
unique_words = set()
for sublist in nested_list:
  unique_words.update(sublist)

word_to_id = {word: idx for idx, word in enumerate(unique_words)}
print(f"Vocabulary: {word_to_id}")


# 2. Convert the nested list to a nested list of integers
numeric_list = [[word_to_id[word] for word in sublist] for sublist in nested_list]
print(f"Numeric list: {numeric_list}")


# 3. Now create the tensor
tensor = torch.tensor(numeric_list)
print(f"PyTorch tensor: {tensor}")
```
This code first iterates through the nested list, extracting every unique string and storing it in a set `unique_words`. Then, it creates `word_to_id` dictionary, mapping each unique word to an integer based on its index. It proceeds to generate the `numeric_list` where each original string is substituted with its corresponding integer. Finally, we use this numeric representation to build our tensor with `torch.tensor()`. The output clearly shows a `torch.Tensor` with integer values.

The above is sufficient for small cases but when padding is required in batch processing, which is very common in practical cases such as with sequences of varying length, we need to implement an additional step. We will also introduce a padding token in our vocabulary.
```python
import torch

nested_list = [["apple", "banana"], ["date", "elderberry", "fig"], ["grape"]]

#1. Create a vocabulary mapping unique words to integer IDs and add a padding token.
unique_words = set()
for sublist in nested_list:
  unique_words.update(sublist)

word_to_id = {word: idx + 1 for idx, word in enumerate(unique_words)} # Note the offset to reserve index zero for padding
padding_token_id = 0
word_to_id["<pad>"]= padding_token_id
print(f"Vocabulary: {word_to_id}")


#2. Find the maximum length of the sublists
max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in nested_list)

#3. Pad lists to maximum length
padded_numeric_list = []
for sublist in nested_list:
  numeric_sublist = [word_to_id[word] for word in sublist]
  padding_amount = max_len - len(numeric_sublist)
  padded_numeric_sublist = numeric_sublist + [padding_token_id] * padding_amount
  padded_numeric_list.append(padded_numeric_sublist)

print(f"Padded numeric list: {padded_numeric_list}")


#4. Now create the tensor
tensor = torch.tensor(padded_numeric_list)
print(f"Padded PyTorch tensor: {tensor}")
```
In this updated version, we assign indices starting from 1 for words and reserving 0 for padding using `idx+1` in our mapping. We find the maximum length of all the nested lists. Then, we iterate through each sublist, converting it to a numeric representation and calculating padding. Finally, we pad each list and then generate the tensor using padded representation. Note that adding an explicit padding token helps in cases when the batch is passed through networks that require fixed size inputs.

Finally, if some words are unknown, which is extremely common in natural language scenarios, a mechanism to handle them should be in place. Here we will map out-of-vocabulary words to a specific ID.
```python
import torch

nested_list = [["apple", "banana", "kiwi"], ["date", "elderberry", "fig", "unknownword"], ["grape", "unknownword2", "kiwi"]]

# 1. Create a vocabulary mapping unique words to integer IDs, add padding, and <unk> tokens
unique_words = set()
for sublist in nested_list:
  unique_words.update(sublist)

word_to_id = {word: idx + 2 for idx, word in enumerate(unique_words)} # Offset by 2
padding_token_id = 0
unknown_token_id = 1
word_to_id["<pad>"]= padding_token_id
word_to_id["<unk>"]= unknown_token_id
print(f"Vocabulary: {word_to_id}")


# 2. Find the maximum length of the sublists
max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in nested_list)

#3. Pad lists to maximum length and convert out of vocabulary words to <unk> ID
padded_numeric_list = []
for sublist in nested_list:
    numeric_sublist = []
    for word in sublist:
        if word in word_to_id:
            numeric_sublist.append(word_to_id[word])
        else:
            numeric_sublist.append(unknown_token_id)
    padding_amount = max_len - len(numeric_sublist)
    padded_numeric_sublist = numeric_sublist + [padding_token_id] * padding_amount
    padded_numeric_list.append(padded_numeric_sublist)


print(f"Padded numeric list: {padded_numeric_list}")


#4. Now create the tensor
tensor = torch.tensor(padded_numeric_list)
print(f"Padded PyTorch tensor: {tensor}")
```

Here, we add `<unk>` with an integer ID 1. We iterate through the sublist and check for each word's presence in our vocabulary. If not present, we use `<unk>` ID for it. We also add padding as before. Now the tensor contains the relevant numeric IDs of all the words along with padding tokens.

For further exploration and advanced concepts, consulting the PyTorch documentation is vital for understanding tensor operations and data loading strategies. Also, consider studying resources on natural language processing that explain the process of tokenization, encoding, and padding in greater detail. Books focused on deep learning architectures can offer a broader view of how data preprocessing fits within the model building. Specific focus on recurrent neural networks and transformers are highly recommended. Also, reading relevant research papers can provide a cutting-edge understanding of the current techniques in the area. Specifically, pay attention to data preprocessing sections for useful hints and tricks. Finally, practicing these concepts by implementing them directly from scratch will build a solid understanding.
