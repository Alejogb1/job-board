A 3D tensor, in the context of TensorFlow, is essentially a multi-dimensional array with three axes, often representing data with spatial or temporal dimensions, such as image stacks or time-series data across different channels. Dividing such a tensor into smaller 3D tensors is crucial for tasks like parallel processing, data batching, or applying convolutional operations on sub-regions. This division isn't a single operation; instead, it requires careful selection of TensorFlow functions based on the specific slicing or reshaping required. I've frequently encountered the need for this operation when working with volumetric medical images during my time building image analysis pipelines.

The core challenge lies in the fact that a tensor's shape is immutable. We cannot literally ‘divide’ a tensor in-place. Instead, we manipulate its shape and view it as collections of smaller tensors. The fundamental functions used are `tf.split`, `tf.slice`, and `tf.reshape`, often in combination. The right choice depends on whether you want to split along one or more axes with equal or unequal sizes and whether you want the resulting tensors to have the same dimensionality or not.

`tf.split` is ideally suited for dividing a tensor along a specific axis into a predefined number of sub-tensors of equal size, although you can specify size in the more recent releases. I often use this when batching sequential data or dividing across channels. For example, consider a medical imaging dataset where each image is a 3D volume and a series represents the time steps; we might want to split on time.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example: A volume with dimensions [depth, height, width] of size [10, 20, 30]
original_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[10, 20, 30])

# Split the tensor along the depth (axis=0) into 2 equal sub-tensors
split_tensors = tf.split(original_tensor, num_or_size_splits=2, axis=0)

# Verify the shapes
print("Original Tensor Shape:", original_tensor.shape)  # Output: (10, 20, 30)
print("Split Tensor 1 Shape:", split_tensors[0].shape) # Output: (5, 20, 30)
print("Split Tensor 2 Shape:", split_tensors[1].shape) # Output: (5, 20, 30)

# Demonstrate splitting into uneven sizes
uneven_split_sizes = [2, 3, 5] # sizes must add up to original axis size
split_tensors_uneven = tf.split(original_tensor, num_or_size_splits = uneven_split_sizes, axis = 0)

print("Split Tensor 1 (Uneven) Shape:", split_tensors_uneven[0].shape) # Output: (2, 20, 30)
print("Split Tensor 2 (Uneven) Shape:", split_tensors_uneven[1].shape) # Output: (3, 20, 30)
print("Split Tensor 3 (Uneven) Shape:", split_tensors_uneven[2].shape) # Output: (5, 20, 30)


```

In this example, `tf.split` divides the initial tensor of shape [10, 20, 30] into two tensors along the first axis, resulting in two tensors of shape [5, 20, 30]. Critically, all the sub-tensors along the split axis have the same shape. It is also demonstrated that size can be given explicitly in a list to generate tensors of different lengths on the split axis. The `axis` parameter dictates the axis along which the split occurs (0: depth, 1: height, 2: width). Note that this function only splits along a single axis.

On the other hand, `tf.slice` provides more granular control over which section of the tensor you extract, but it does not reshape the data. I often use this when extracting specific regions of interest for analysis, akin to cropping a sub-portion.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example: A volume with dimensions [depth, height, width] of size [10, 20, 30]
original_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[10, 20, 30])

# Slice a 3D sub-tensor starting at [2, 4, 6] with shape [3, 7, 10]
sliced_tensor = tf.slice(original_tensor, begin=[2, 4, 6], size=[3, 7, 10])

# Verify the shapes
print("Original Tensor Shape:", original_tensor.shape)  # Output: (10, 20, 30)
print("Sliced Tensor Shape:", sliced_tensor.shape)  # Output: (3, 7, 10)


# Slice to take every other element on axis 0, and all elements of axes 1 and 2
sliced_tensor_strided = tf.slice(original_tensor, begin=[0,0,0], size = [-1,-1,-1], strides=[2,1,1])
print("Sliced Tensor (Strided) Shape: ", sliced_tensor_strided.shape) # Output: (5, 20, 30)

```
In this second example, `tf.slice` extracts a smaller tensor of shape [3, 7, 10] from the initial tensor. The `begin` argument specifies the starting indices for the slice, and the `size` argument specifies the dimensions of the slice. As shown, a stride can also be added such that non-contiguous data can be extracted. Unlike `tf.split`, the size and start position are explicitly provided for each dimension, but the resulting tensor retains the same number of axes.

`tf.reshape`, however, is used to change the view or organizational shape of the data, often in combination with other functions. It does not change the data itself; it reinterprets it. I have often used reshaping to flatten sections of a tensor for applying fully connected layers or to restructure the output of a convolutional layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example: A volume with dimensions [depth, height, width] of size [10, 20, 30]
original_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[10, 20, 30])

# Reshape the tensor into [2, 5, 20, 30]
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(original_tensor, shape=[2, 5, 20, 30])

# Verify the shapes
print("Original Tensor Shape:", original_tensor.shape) # Output: (10, 20, 30)
print("Reshaped Tensor Shape:", reshaped_tensor.shape) # Output: (2, 5, 20, 30)

# Reshape into [1, 10, 600]
reshaped_tensor_flat = tf.reshape(original_tensor, shape=[1, 10, 600])
print("Reshaped Tensor (Flat) Shape:", reshaped_tensor_flat.shape) # Output: (1, 10, 600)

```

In the above example, `tf.reshape` transforms the initial tensor from [10, 20, 30] into [2, 5, 20, 30], essentially reinterpreting the data arrangement. The critical constraint is that the product of the new dimensions must be equal to the product of the original dimensions to maintain the number of data points. It can also be combined with `tf.slice` and `tf.split` in complex tensor partitioning situations. The example also demonstrates reshaping the tensor into a flatter form.

When dividing a 3D tensor, one must select the appropriate function based on your needs. If you require equally sized subdivisions along an axis, use `tf.split`. If you require specific portions of the tensor, employ `tf.slice`. If the ultimate goal is to rearrange the dimensions or create additional axes, use `tf.reshape`. Frequently a mixture of these three can solve a particular division or slicing requirement of a multidimensional tensor. It's also imperative to ensure that the dimensions and arguments align with what the function expects to avoid unexpected errors, such as dimension mismatch errors.

For further learning, I would highly recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation for these functions. Additionally, the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet provides an accessible introduction to tensor operations with Keras and TensorFlow, and online courses such as those from Coursera or edX that cover machine learning with TensorFlow often include practical examples of these tensor manipulation techniques. These resources provide both conceptual understanding and working examples, which I have always found more useful than abstract theory alone. Finally, engaging with open source repos on Github where people are using the library to work on real-world problems can provide deeper understanding.
