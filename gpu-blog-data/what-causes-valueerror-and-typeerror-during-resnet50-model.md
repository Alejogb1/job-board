ValueError and TypeError are common exceptions encountered during ResNet50 training, stemming from mismatches between expected and actual data types or shapes. My experience training various deep learning models, including ResNet50 on diverse datasets, reveals these errors often point to specific problems within the data preprocessing pipeline or within the model's internal operations. It’s not usually an issue with the core ResNet50 architecture itself, but rather how it interacts with the data you feed it.

The primary reason for a `ValueError` during ResNet50 training typically lies in shape inconsistencies between the input data and what the model expects. ResNet50, as with most convolutional neural networks (CNNs), requires input data with a specific tensor structure: `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`. For most implementations, particularly those using Keras or PyTorch, the input tensor should contain floating-point data. When data that does not conform to this, such as differently sized images or integers where floating point is needed, the model raises `ValueError`. A common manifestation is `ValueError: Input 0 of layer "conv1" is incompatible with the layer: expected min_ndim=4, got ndim=3` or similar variations depending on the implementation. Here the ndim refers to the number of dimensions. It expects 4 dimensions (batch, height, width, channel). If data is loaded incorrectly, for example, an individual image instead of a batch is passed, the `ndim=3` is the result. Batch dimension is lost.

Conversely, `TypeError` during ResNet50 training generally arises when the data type doesn't match the model's requirements for its internal computations. ResNet50, like the majority of neural networks, performs mathematical operations that expect floating-point representations of images. Often, this originates from integer or improperly casted image pixel values. While the image loading libraries will often load pixel data as an integer, this should be explicitly cast to floating point before being passed to the model. Additionally, type errors may manifest in the labels when attempting to compute the loss. Loss functions may expect labels that are integers, one-hot encoded vectors or a different data type than is provided.

A typical source of shape `ValueError` arises when dealing with datasets that have images of varying dimensions. For example, if images of shapes (224, 224, 3) and (100, 100, 3) are loaded within the same batch and then passed to the model's input without preprocessing steps such as resizing, padding, or cropping, a `ValueError` is inevitable. This also occurs if the batch size is not divisible when passing it through a DataLoader that has a "drop_last = True" argument. These lead to inconsistent shapes within the mini-batches.

Another common source of type errors arises when the data augmentation pipeline does not handle images in floating-point correctly. If a pipeline, for example, saves augmented images as integers, they will result in a type mismatch when the model is trained.

Here are three concrete code examples illustrating these errors, using Python with Keras (TensorFlow):

**Example 1: Shape `ValueError` due to inconsistent image sizes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate loading images of different sizes
images = [np.random.rand(224, 224, 3),
          np.random.rand(100, 100, 3),
          np.random.rand(224, 224, 3)]

# Assume labels are one-hot encoded, this would be correct in most cases
labels = [np.array([1, 0, 0]),
          np.array([0, 1, 0]),
          np.array([1, 0, 0])]

# ResNet50 model creation
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False, weights=None, input_shape=(None, None, 3))
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(model.output)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')(flatten)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=output)

# Attempt to train with inconsistent batch
try:
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(tf.stack(images), tf.stack(labels), epochs=1)
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"ValueError caught: {e}")

# Now use padding
padded_images = []
max_height = max(image.shape[0] for image in images)
max_width = max(image.shape[1] for image in images)

for image in images:
    pad_height = max_height - image.shape[0]
    pad_width = max_width - image.shape[1]
    padded_image = np.pad(image, ((0, pad_height), (0, pad_width), (0, 0)), mode='constant')
    padded_images.append(padded_image)
try:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(tf.stack(padded_images), tf.stack(labels), epochs=1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError caught: {e}")

# Now use resizing
resized_images = []
target_size = (224,224)
for image in images:
    resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, target_size)
    resized_images.append(resized_image)
try:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(tf.stack(resized_images), tf.stack(labels), epochs=1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError caught: {e}")
```

In this code, the initial attempt to train the ResNet50 with a batch of images that have different sizes leads to a `ValueError`. The padding section attempts to mitigate this using padding. However, this would usually lead to suboptimal performance. In practice, it is better to resize all images to a constant size as seen in the third case. This resizing is also better to have as an integral part of the DataLoader pipeline. The `tf.stack` function is used to convert the list of numpy arrays to tensors.

**Example 2: `TypeError` due to integer input images**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate loading images as integers
images = [np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8),
          np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8),
          np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8)]

# Assume labels are one-hot encoded
labels = [np.array([1, 0, 0]),
          np.array([0, 1, 0]),
          np.array([1, 0, 0])]

# ResNet50 model creation
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False, weights=None, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(model.output)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')(flatten)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=output)

# Attempt to train with integer images
try:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(tf.stack(images), tf.stack(labels), epochs=1)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError caught: {e}")

# Now cast to float
float_images = [tf.cast(image, dtype=tf.float32) for image in images]
try:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(tf.stack(float_images), tf.stack(labels), epochs=1)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError caught: {e}")
```

Here, the images are initially loaded as `np.uint8` integers, which will cause a `TypeError` as the model expects floating-point inputs. Casting the images using `tf.cast` to `tf.float32` resolves the type error.

**Example 3: `TypeError` due to incorrect label type.**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate loading images as integers
images = [np.random.rand(224, 224, 3),
          np.random.rand(224, 224, 3),
          np.random.rand(224, 224, 3)]

# Assume labels are integers
labels = [0, 1, 0]

# ResNet50 model creation
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False, weights=None, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(model.output)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')(flatten)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=output)

# Attempt to train with integer labels
try:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(tf.stack(images), tf.constant(labels), epochs=1)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError caught: {e}")

# Now create one-hot labels
one_hot_labels = [np.eye(3)[label] for label in labels]

try:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(tf.stack(images), tf.stack(one_hot_labels), epochs=1)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError caught: {e}")
```
Here the loss function, `categorical_crossentropy` expects one-hot encoded vector as labels. Using the integers directly results in a type error. Converting them into one-hot vectors allows for a working training loop. Note that if the loss is instead `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` the integer labels are expected.

In summary, these errors are rarely caused by the ResNet50 model itself, but rather the user’s handling of data. To effectively train ResNet50, ensure that your image data is consistently sized, of the correct floating-point type and that the labels are in a format that matches the loss function. I consistently emphasize the data pipeline as a critical area of focus to ensure a robust training.

For further learning, I recommend resources focused on TensorFlow and Keras' data loading and preprocessing techniques, specifically the tf.data API in TensorFlow and the image preprocessing capabilities within TensorFlow and Keras. Look into the implementations of common dataset loaders (e.g. Imagenet, CIFAR10) to see common practices in action. Also, it is valuable to consult tutorials specifically focused on CNN input handling, as well as documentation for specific loss functions to see the types of labels expected for them. Finally, pay careful attention to debugging techniques using print statements and more advanced debuggers.
