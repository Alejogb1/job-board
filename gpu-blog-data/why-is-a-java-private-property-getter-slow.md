Within the context of Java, the assertion that a private property getter is inherently slow is a misconception. The performance implications arise not from the access level itself (private) but from the surrounding architectural choices within a given application. When performance issues appear related to accessing a seemingly simple private field through a getter method, it's typically a symptom of excessive layers of indirection, bytecode manipulation libraries, runtime reflection, or overly complex business logic within the getter itself, rather than the private declaration being the culprit. Private access modifiers are a mechanism for encapsulation, not a performance bottleneck. My experience, drawn from years spent optimizing high-throughput Java applications for financial institutions, illustrates these issues repeatedly.

The core of the matter lies in understanding how Java compiles and executes code. When a simple getter for a private field is declared, the Java compiler generates direct bytecode instructions for accessing that field. For instance, `this.myField` generates a `GETFIELD` bytecode instruction that directly reads the field’s value from memory. A public or protected getter method similarly accessing the field, with minimal logic within the method body, should exhibit comparable performance. The key takeaway is that there isn't any inherent overhead in the private declaration causing the problem. The slowdowns typically originate from how the getter is *used* or, more frequently, from what happens *within* it.

One major cause of perceived slowness is indirection. Consider, for example, a poorly designed architecture where accessing a seemingly simple private field involves multiple method calls or complex object navigation.  Each method call incurs a cost, including pushing arguments onto the stack, resolving method dispatch, and returning the value.  When these calls are nested deep, the combined cost can become significant, giving the appearance of slow getter access. We can also see this pattern with lazy loading that is incorrectly or unnecessarily implemented. Let's consider this example:

```java
 public class Account {
    private String accountNumber;
    private TransactionManager transactionManager;

    public Account(String accountNumber, TransactionManager transactionManager) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.transactionManager = transactionManager;
    }

    private String getAccountNumber() {
        // Simulate an expensive operation, e.g., fetching from a slow cache
        return transactionManager.getTransactionDetails(accountNumber).getAccountNumber();
    }

     public String getAccount() {
        return getAccountNumber(); // Accessing a 'simple' getter
    }
}

class TransactionDetails {
  private String accountNumber;
  public TransactionDetails(String accountNumber){
     this.accountNumber= accountNumber;
  }

    public String getAccountNumber() {
      return accountNumber;
    }
}

class TransactionManager {
    public TransactionDetails getTransactionDetails(String accountNumber){
       try {
             Thread.sleep(100); //Simulate a long operation
         }catch(Exception e){}
       return new TransactionDetails(accountNumber);
    }
}

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    TransactionManager tm = new TransactionManager();
    Account account = new Account("ACC123", tm);
     long startTime = System.nanoTime();
     for(int i=0; i < 1000; i++){
      account.getAccount();
     }
     long endTime = System.nanoTime();
      long duration = (endTime - startTime);
    System.out.println("Duration: " + duration/1000000.0 + " milliseconds");
  }
}
```
Here, although `getAccountNumber()` appears to be a simple getter, the actual call to `getTransactionDetails` makes it slow. This isn't the getter's fault; rather, the indirection and the time-consuming `TransactionManager` call slow it down. In real-world scenarios, such indirection could involve database lookups, calls to remote services, or complex transformations, contributing significantly to the total time to get an account number. This indirection gives the illusion that the private method call is the problem.

Another common source of perceived slowness is excessive or incorrect usage of reflection. Reflection provides powerful capabilities, including the ability to access private members and call methods dynamically. However, reflection bypasses the compiler’s optimization and introduces additional overhead. In cases where a library dynamically accesses private fields through reflection for what it perceives is a simple retrieval, the reflection overhead will be significant. This is common in some object-mapping libraries that are used heavily in enterprise applications. Let's take a look at a scenario that emulates this effect.

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
public class ReflectiveGetter {
    private String data = "secret";
    public String getData(){ return data;}

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchMethodException, InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException, NoSuchFieldException {
        ReflectiveGetter obj = new ReflectiveGetter();

        long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            //Using direct getter
           obj.getData();
        }
         long endTime = System.nanoTime();
      long duration = (endTime - startTime);
        System.out.println("Duration with Direct Getter: " + duration/1000000.0 + " milliseconds");
        startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            //Using Reflection to access method
            Method method = ReflectiveGetter.class.getDeclaredMethod("getData");
            method.invoke(obj);

        }
       endTime = System.nanoTime();
     duration = (endTime - startTime);
    System.out.println("Duration with Reflective Method: " + duration/1000000.0 + " milliseconds");
        startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
             //Using Reflection to access field
            Field field = ReflectiveGetter.class.getDeclaredField("data");
            field.setAccessible(true);
           String val = (String)field.get(obj);
        }
        endTime = System.nanoTime();
     duration = (endTime - startTime);
    System.out.println("Duration with Reflective Field: " + duration/1000000.0 + " milliseconds");
    }

}
```
In the code example above, we access the private field directly, and then access it via a method using reflection, and finally access the field directly using reflection. The result of the comparison will show that reflection access takes significantly longer. The overhead associated with reflection is introduced by the need to load class information, resolve field names, and perform access checks at runtime. Even though reflection allows us to retrieve the private field, this additional complexity slows down operations. We should avoid reflection as much as possible.

Another common mistake is placing complex logic into a getter method. Although getter methods should, by convention, be simple accessors, developers might be tempted to perform calculations, data transformations, or even make external calls within these methods. Such complex operations can cause slowdowns. For example:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
public class Product {
    private double price;
    private double salesTaxPercentage;
    public Product(double price, double salesTaxPercentage){
        this.price=price;
        this.salesTaxPercentage=salesTaxPercentage;
    }
    private double getPrice(){
        return price;
    }

    private double getSalesTaxPercentage(){
        return salesTaxPercentage;
    }

    public double getFinalPrice() {
       return getPrice() + (getPrice() * getSalesTaxPercentage());
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product product = new Product(100.0,0.05);
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
             product.getFinalPrice();
        }
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        long duration = (endTime- startTime);
        System.out.println("Duration of calculation: " + duration/1000000.0 + " milliseconds");
    }
}

```
In the example above, the final price computation adds processing logic in addition to simple property access. While the example is a simple calculation, more complex computations like iterating through collections or doing external lookups can lead to major slowdowns. It's critical to keep getter methods concise and avoid heavy processing that should belong in other areas of the application logic.

To optimize this kind of situation, I recommend the following steps. Firstly, carefully review your architecture for unnecessary indirection. Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks before making changes. Secondly, limit the usage of reflection. Rely on direct method calls and field access whenever possible, keeping in mind that reflection can be a necessary evil with mapping libraries. Thirdly, move complex business logic out of getter methods. Place these operations where they are needed, and consider caching the results if you are operating on immutable values. Caching must be done carefully because it introduces additional complexity in terms of ensuring consistency of cached values, and can even introduce subtle bugs.

For further learning, I suggest exploring resources on Java performance tuning. Specifically, look into best practices around efficient data access, architecture design, and avoiding the pitfalls of reflection. Understanding the inner workings of the Java Virtual Machine, and having a firm grasp on profiling tools such as JProfiler or VisualVM is essential for identifying and addressing these performance issues. I have personally seen the greatest gains in performance when time is spent thinking about design and avoiding the patterns mentioned above, and less time spent on micro-optimizations. Focusing on minimizing unnecessary operations and using appropriate data structures will do more to improve application performance than focusing on the private access modifier.
