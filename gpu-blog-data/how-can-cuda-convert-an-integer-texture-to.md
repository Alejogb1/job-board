Directly addressing the conversion of an integer texture to an integer4 texture in CUDA requires understanding the underlying memory representation and the limitations imposed by the hardware.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving texture-based rendering and particle simulations highlights the crucial role of efficient texture manipulation.  Simply assigning an integer value to each component of an Integer4 doesn't account for potential data loss or alignment issues.  The most effective approach involves careful consideration of data packing and potential padding.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA's texture memory is optimized for read-only access, making it highly efficient for sampling data during rendering or computations.  However,  the direct conversion from an integer texture (e.g., `cudaTextureTypeInt`) to an integer4 texture (`cudaTextureTypeInt4`) isn't a single operation.  Instead, it requires a kernel function that reads data from the integer texture, packs the data into `int4` structures, and then writes this data to a new texture or a buffer intended for later texture binding.

The integer texture holds a single integer value per texture element.  The `int4` texture, on the other hand, holds four integer values per element, allowing for packing of multiple data channels (e.g., RGBA, XYZW, etc.). The critical aspect lies in how we efficiently map the single integer from the source texture to the four components of the destination `int4` texture. Several strategies exist, each with implications for memory usage and performance.

The simplest approach is to replicate the single integer across all four components.  This might be suitable if the original integer data represents a scalar value that needs to be consistently applied.  However, if each component of the `int4` texture needs to represent a different value, this approach would be inefficient and require preprocessing of the input integer data before texture creation. A more sophisticated approach might involve using bitwise operations to unpack multiple values already encoded within the single integer.

Furthermore, efficient memory access plays a significant role.  Coalesced memory access, crucial for optimal CUDA performance, needs to be maintained.  Therefore, the kernel's access pattern to the input integer texture needs to be carefully designed to ensure that multiple threads access contiguous memory locations.  Misaligned memory accesses can lead to significant performance degradation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Replication**

This example replicates the single integer value across all four components of the `int4`.  It's suitable only if the application requires this specific behavior.

```cpp
__global__ void convertIntToInt4(const int* inputTex, int4* outputTex, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int index = y * width + x;
    int value = inputTex[index];
    outputTex[index] = make_int4(value, value, value, value);
  }
}
```

This kernel iterates through the input texture, reads an integer value, and creates an `int4` with all components set to that value.  The `make_int4` function constructs the `int4` structure.  Proper block and thread configurations are assumed to be handled externally to maximize performance for given hardware.

**Example 2:  Data Packing (assuming pre-encoded data)**

This kernel showcases unpacking two integers encoded within a single input integer.  This requires prior knowledge of the data encoding scheme.

```cpp
__global__ void unpackIntToInt4(const int* inputTex, int4* outputTex, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int index = y * width + x;
    int packedValue = inputTex[index];
    int value1 = packedValue >> 16; // Extract the higher 16 bits
    int value2 = packedValue & 0xFFFF; // Extract the lower 16 bits

    outputTex[index] = make_int4(value1, value2, 0, 0); // Assign to int4 components
  }
}
```

Here, we assume that the input integer holds two 16-bit integers. Bitwise operations are used to extract these values, which are then assigned to the `x` and `y` components of the `int4` texture.  The `z` and `w` components are set to 0.  This demonstrates how to handle pre-packed data; the actual bit manipulation will depend on the specific encoding used.

**Example 3:  Zero-Padding**

This approach handles the case where we want to populate only a subset of the `int4` components.

```cpp
__global__ void zeroPadIntToInt4(const int* inputTex, int4* outputTex, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int index = y * width + x;
    int value = inputTex[index];
    outputTex[index] = make_int4(value, 0, 0, 0); // Pad with zeros
  }
}
```

This kernel takes the input integer and populates only the `x` component of the `int4`. The remaining components (`y`, `z`, `w`) are set to 0, illustrating a zero-padding strategy.  This could be adapted to populate different components as per the application's requirements.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA Programming Guide, CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive textbook on parallel computing and GPU programming.  Furthermore, familiarity with bitwise operations and memory access patterns in CUDA is crucial.  Understanding the texture memory model and its limitations is essential for writing efficient code.  Exploring examples of texture binding and manipulation in CUDA documentation will be beneficial.
