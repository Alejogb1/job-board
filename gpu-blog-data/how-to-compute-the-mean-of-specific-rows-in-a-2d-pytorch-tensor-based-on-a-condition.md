PyTorch's tensor manipulation capabilities extend to complex conditional operations, allowing for selective computation, including the mean of specific rows based on a condition. This task isn't directly handled by a single PyTorch function but requires a combination of logical masking and reduction operations, which I've frequently employed in my experience building sequence-to-sequence models for time series analysis.

**Explanation**

The core challenge lies in isolating the rows that meet our condition before applying the mean operation. This process typically unfolds in three key stages. First, we establish a boolean mask that indicates which rows satisfy the defined condition. Second, we apply this mask to the tensor, effectively selecting only the rows where the mask is true. Finally, we compute the mean along the appropriate dimension of the masked tensor.

The conditional logic can be based on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to: checking if a specific element in the row meets a threshold, examining if the row contains a particular value, or evaluating a more complex logical expression across multiple elements of the row. The resulting mask will always have the same number of rows as the original tensor, where *True* values correspond to the rows that satisfy the condition, and *False* values represent the rows that fail to meet it.

PyTorch leverages element-wise logical operators like `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, along with logical combination operators like `&` (AND) and `|` (OR), making it very flexible in constructing these conditions. Once the boolean mask is ready, we use it to perform boolean indexing. This indexing technique returns a new tensor containing only the rows corresponding to the *True* values in the mask. It effectively reduces the dimensions of the tensor, discarding the unselected rows.

The final mean operation is achieved through the `torch.mean()` function, making it critical to specify the correct dimension for the mean computation. If our original tensor was 2D representing samples in rows and features in columns, and we wanted the mean of each feature across selected rows, we compute the mean across dimension zero, which is the row axis. If instead, we required the mean across features, we'd compute it on dimension one. If the selected rows should result in one mean, then we could first flatten all the selected rows and compute a single mean. The approach we take, depends on the granularity of the mean value we desire from the selected rows, and this is a common pattern seen when batching training samples.

**Code Examples**

Let's illustrate this with three examples, showcasing different conditional scenarios:

**Example 1: Thresholding a Specific Column**

In this scenario, let's assume our 2D tensor represents measurements, and we'd like to compute the mean of rows where the value of the second column is greater than a specified threshold.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor (rows: samples, columns: features)
data = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                   [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                   [7.0, 1.0, 9.0],
                   [10.0, 8.0, 11.0]], dtype=torch.float32)

threshold = 4.0

# Create a boolean mask for the condition (2nd column > threshold)
mask = data[:, 1] > threshold

# Apply the mask to select the rows
selected_rows = data[mask]

# Compute the mean along dimension zero (mean per feature)
mean_of_selected_rows = torch.mean(selected_rows, dim=0)

print("Original Tensor:\n", data)
print("Mask:\n", mask)
print("Selected Rows:\n", selected_rows)
print("Mean of Selected Rows:\n", mean_of_selected_rows)
```

Here, `data[:, 1]` selects the second column. The comparison operation generates a boolean mask that is used to select corresponding rows. Finally, `torch.mean(selected_rows, dim=0)` computes the mean for each column across the selected rows. The output showcases both the mask and selected rows as an intermediary step.

**Example 2: Checking for Presence of a Specific Value**

Suppose we want to compute the mean of all rows containing the value '9'. Instead of checking a specific column, our condition requires us to scan each row.

```python
import torch

data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 9],
                   [7, 1, 9],
                   [10, 8, 11]], dtype=torch.int32)

target_value = 9

# Check if each row contains the target value
mask = torch.any(data == target_value, dim=1)

# Select rows with the mask
selected_rows = data[mask]

# Flatten and compute a single mean
flattened_selected = selected_rows.float().flatten()
mean_value = torch.mean(flattened_selected)

print("Original Tensor:\n", data)
print("Mask:\n", mask)
print("Selected Rows:\n", selected_rows)
print("Mean of Selected Rows:", mean_value)
```

This example utilizes `torch.any` along `dim=1` to check if the condition is met in any column for the given row. Then, we cast selected rows to float, flatten them and compute the overall mean. This illustrates how to extract a single mean value when required.

**Example 3: Complex Conditional Logic**

This last example demonstrates more complex logic, selecting rows where the sum of the first two columns is greater than 6, or the third column is equal to 11.

```python
import torch

data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 1, 9],
                   [10, 8, 11]], dtype=torch.int32)

# Complex mask construction
mask = ((data[:, 0] + data[:, 1]) > 6) | (data[:, 2] == 11)

selected_rows = data[mask]

# Calculate the mean of the selected rows per column
mean_selected_rows_per_col = torch.mean(selected_rows.float(), dim=0)

print("Original Tensor:\n", data)
print("Mask:\n", mask)
print("Selected Rows:\n", selected_rows)
print("Mean of Selected Rows:\n", mean_selected_rows_per_col)
```

In this case, we construct the mask through a combination of AND and OR conditions, further enhancing the masking flexibility. The means per column are calculated on the selected rows.

**Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding and practical application of PyTorch tensor manipulations, I recommend exploring the following resources:

*   **PyTorch Official Documentation:** This is the primary source for detailed information on all PyTorch functions, including tensor indexing, logical operations, and reduction methods. The documentation provides numerous examples and comprehensive explanations of the library's capabilities.

*   **PyTorch Tutorials on the official website:** The tutorials are excellent for learning how to apply core PyTorch functionalities in realistic scenarios, such as in image classification and natural language processing tasks. Look for tutorials that demonstrate indexing, masking, and data loading techniques.

*   **Community Forums and Online Discussions:** Engaging with community forums and discussions on platforms like Stack Overflow or the official PyTorch forums can offer insights from experienced users, help debug problems, and uncover best practices for particular tasks.

These resources will provide the necessary theoretical knowledge and practical examples to become proficient in PyTorch tensor manipulation and to effectively handle complex computations like conditional mean calculation on specific rows.
