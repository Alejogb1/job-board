The discrepancy between `add_metric` and `add_loss` when applied to the same tensor in Keras stems from how these functions integrate into the model's training and evaluation phases.  While both allow monitoring a tensor's value, they serve distinct purposes and are handled differently by the backend optimization process.  `add_loss` directly influences the model's optimization via the loss function, whereas `add_metric` solely provides monitoring information, not affecting gradient calculations. This difference, often subtle, manifests in numerical disparities due to the inclusion of regularization terms, gradient clipping, and the inherent stochasticity of the training process.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue numerous times while developing custom loss functions and monitoring specific aspects of model behavior, particularly in scenarios involving complex regularization strategies.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras `add_loss` function registers a tensor as a component of the overall loss function. The model's optimizer subsequently utilizes this loss value (along with any other defined losses) to compute gradients and update model weights during training.  Crucially, any regularization or other modifications applied *during* training – such as gradient clipping or weight decay – affect the final loss value computed and used for backpropagation.  The optimizer's inner workings can introduce minor numerical variations compared to a straightforward computation of the tensor's value.

Conversely, `add_metric` registers a tensor for monitoring purposes.  This tensor's value is calculated and logged during both training and evaluation phases, but it does *not* directly influence weight updates.  The metric is computed *after* the optimizer completes its work; thus, any regularization or numerical adjustments applied during the optimization process will not affect the metric's reported value.  The metric value represents the raw calculation of the input tensor, free from the optimizer's internal modifications.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Simple Mean Squared Error and Custom Metric**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

def custom_mse(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
    model.add_loss(mse)  # Added as a loss
    model.add_metric(mse, name='custom_mse_metric') # Added as a metric
    return mse

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_mse, metrics=['mae'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

In this example, we define a custom Mean Squared Error (MSE) function.  Note how it's added as both a loss and a metric. During training, the loss influences weight updates.  The metric provides a separate, potentially numerically different, value reflecting the raw MSE calculation *without* optimizer interventions.  The discrepancy, if any, highlights the impact of the optimizer's internal mechanisms.


**Example 2:  L1 Regularization and Metric Monitoring**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l1(0.01), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

def l1_norm(w):
    l1 = tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(w))
    model.add_loss(l1)
    model.add_metric(l1, name='l1_norm_metric')
    return l1

# Assume x_train and y_train are defined
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #mse loss is seperate
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, L1 regularization is applied. The L1 norm of the kernel weights is added as both a loss and a metric.  The reported `l1_norm_metric` will differ from the contribution of the regularization term to the overall loss due to the optimizer’s operations. The optimizer modifies the weights directly, influencing the loss, while the metric computes the L1 norm on the *final* weights after optimization.


**Example 3: Gradient Clipping and Loss-Metric Comparison**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

def clipped_mse(y_true, y_pred):
  mse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
  model.add_loss(mse)
  model.add_metric(mse, name='unclipped_mse')
  return mse

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) #Gradient Clipping

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=clipped_mse, metrics=['mae'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This illustrates the effect of gradient clipping. The MSE is added as both a loss (subject to gradient clipping) and a metric (not subject to clipping). The reported `unclipped_mse` metric will generally differ from the loss because the optimizer applies gradient clipping before updating weights. The loss reflects the clipped gradients’ effect, whereas the metric reflects the unclipped MSE.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, the TensorFlow documentation, and a well-structured textbook on deep learning (covering optimization algorithms and backpropagation) will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Examining the source code of Keras and TensorFlow (where feasible) can offer further insight into implementation details.  Finally, exploring research papers on optimization algorithms within the context of neural networks can significantly enhance one's comprehension of this topic.
