The softmax function, while commonly associated with multi-class classification, isn't strictly *required* in all scenarios, but it profoundly influences the model's output and interpretation. I've encountered situations, particularly when developing custom loss functions or dealing with probabilistic outputs, where alternative approaches might be more suitable. However, for most standard implementations, its inclusion is highly recommended for several crucial reasons that impact both training stability and interpretability of the final predictions.

The primary role of softmax within a multi-class classification network is to transform raw model outputs (logits) into a probability distribution over the class labels. Before softmax, these logits can be any real number, positive or negative, with no inherent meaning relative to class membership probabilities. Softmax applies an exponential transformation, which ensures that all values are positive, and then normalizes the result by dividing by the sum of exponentials across all classes. This enforces the requirement that probabilities over all classes sum to one. This transformation allows the model to represent a discrete probability distribution that directly mirrors the problem's goal: to assign each input to one of several possible categories and express the confidence in that assignment.

Without a softmax layer, the outputs of the final layer are simply arbitrary values. Training the model without probabilities would necessitate a different kind of loss function, one that doesn't rely on probabilistic interpretations. You might try to directly minimize the difference between raw output values and some target encoding. However, this would not yield probabilities directly, making it harder to evaluate performance metrics typically used in classification, and complicates applying any type of uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, these raw values can lead to training instability as there are no bounds on their ranges.

The choice of whether to *explicitly* include a softmax layer can also depend on the specific loss function implemented. Some popular loss functions, like cross-entropy loss, are often implemented to implicitly incorporate the softmax operation. This optimization is quite common because the combination of the exponential in softmax and the logarithm in cross-entropy creates a numerically stable computational process. During implementation, it's vital to understand if the chosen loss function already performs the softmax transformation on the input logits or requires it as a distinct processing step. A common mistake is applying softmax both within a built-in loss function and then adding it on the model output, resulting in an inaccurate final output.

Let's examine some code examples to illustrate these points. Consider a simple neural network implemented in Python using the PyTorch library:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example 1: Softmax explicit in the model

class ModelWithSoftmax(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(ModelWithSoftmax, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1) # Softmax explicitly applied

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.softmax(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_classes = 3
model_with_softmax = ModelWithSoftmax(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output_with_softmax = model_with_softmax(dummy_input)

print("Output with explicit softmax:", output_with_softmax)
```

In this first example, `ModelWithSoftmax`, I explicitly include a softmax layer within the model definition. The output here will directly represent the probabilities of each class for a given input. This implementation is clear for someone reading the code; the final output values are probabilities.

Now, let's observe the scenario where softmax is not included in the model and the probabilities are generated implicitly within a loss function:

```python
# Example 2: Softmax implicit in the loss function (using CrossEntropyLoss)
class ModelWithoutSoftmax(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
      super(ModelWithoutSoftmax, self).__init__()
      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
      self.relu = nn.ReLU()
      self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

  def forward(self, x):
      x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
      x = self.fc2(x)
      return x

model_without_softmax = ModelWithoutSoftmax(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)
output_without_softmax = model_without_softmax(dummy_input)
print("Raw Logits (no softmax):", output_without_softmax)

# Training setup using CrossEntropyLoss, which includes softmax
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
target = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (1,))
loss = criterion(output_without_softmax, target)

print("Loss value (cross entropy): ", loss)
```

In `ModelWithoutSoftmax`, the final layer produces raw logits.  The cross-entropy loss is implicitly applying softmax internally. This example demonstrates how a loss function like `CrossEntropyLoss` within PyTorch can seamlessly handle the probabilities. We feed the raw logits directly to the loss function during training. The loss computation is based on the softmaxed probabilities, though we do not see those probabilities directly.

Finally, let us examine a case where neither the model nor the loss function provide softmax. This is generally *not* recommended unless you have a very specific use case, and this type of approach would likely require substantial modification to the training pipeline.

```python
# Example 3: No softmax and using a mean squared error (Not Recommended)

class ModelWithoutSoftmaxAgain(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
      super(ModelWithoutSoftmaxAgain, self).__init__()
      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
      self.relu = nn.ReLU()
      self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

  def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model_without_softmax_again = ModelWithoutSoftmaxAgain(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)
output_without_softmax_again = model_without_softmax_again(dummy_input)

print("Raw Logits:", output_without_softmax_again)


criterion_mse = nn.MSELoss()
# Target must be in a one-hot format for MSE
one_hot_target = torch.zeros(1, num_classes)
one_hot_target[0, target.item()] = 1
loss_mse = criterion_mse(output_without_softmax_again, one_hot_target)

print("MSE Loss (requires explicit target transformation):", loss_mse)

```

In this third scenario, we use mean squared error to calculate loss. The output from the model is raw logits and is compared to one-hot encoded target values. Neither the model nor the loss function handle softmax. This setup is more difficult to train effectively, because we are trying to directly predict the one-hot encoding instead of probabilities. Furthermore, the MSE loss makes less sense in the context of a categorical classification, where the classes are independent from each other, while MSE assumes a particular ordering.

In summary, the inclusion of softmax is typically essential in multi-class classification. The reasons include allowing the model output to be interpreted as a proper probability distribution, and compatibility with the typical cross entropy loss function. While it can be omitted, this requires deep understanding of the impact on model output and modifications of the training setup. I would recommend exploring resources like the PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.Softmax` and `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, as well as documentation for other machine learning frameworks if you are using an alternative. Also, focusing on more general explanations of statistical modeling is helpful when dealing with outputs and loss functions. Specifically, familiarize yourself with the probability axioms and how loss functions are designed to minimize particular types of prediction errors. It is also advisable to carefully evaluate the documentation for the specific loss functions being used; this helps avoid redundant or incorrect applications of softmax.
