The root cause of your model achieving 0% accuracy after implementing feature columns almost certainly lies in a mismatch between the data preprocessing performed on your feature columns and the expectations of your chosen machine learning algorithm.  In my experience debugging similar issues over the past decade,  the problem rarely stems from a fundamental flaw in the feature engineering itself, but rather from subtle incompatibilities in how the data is handled.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

Feature columns, in essence, represent a structured way of presenting data to a machine learning model. They dictate how raw data points are transformed and encoded before feeding them into the algorithm. The most common culprits for 0% accuracy after implementing feature columns are:

* **Incorrect Data Type Handling:**  Machine learning algorithms are sensitive to data types.  If your feature column transformation results in unexpected data types (e.g., strings where numerical values are expected, or categorical variables not one-hot encoded appropriately), the model will fail to learn effectively.  This often manifests as 0% accuracy because the model cannot interpret the input features.  The model may be attempting to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric data or treating categorical features as numerical features, producing nonsensical results.

* **Data Leakage:** Feature engineering sometimes introduces data leakage if information from the test set inadvertently influences the training process. For example, using statistics calculated from the entire dataset (including the test set) to scale or normalize features will lead to overly optimistic results on the training data, and catastrophic failure on unseen data (i.e., 0% accuracy).  This scenario often goes unnoticed until the model is deployed.

* **Cardinality Issues:**  High-cardinality categorical features (features with many distinct values) can negatively impact model performance, particularly for algorithms that don't handle high-cardinality features effectively.   Without proper handling (such as feature hashing or embedding techniques), these features can lead to an overly sparse feature space, resulting in poor generalization and 0% accuracy.

* **Insufficient Data:**  Even with correctly implemented feature columns, if your dataset lacks sufficient data points to properly train your model, you might observe 0% accuracy, or extremely low accuracy.  This is especially true for complex models.

* **Incorrect Feature Scaling/Normalization:**  Many algorithms require features to be scaled or normalized to a similar range.  Failing to do so can disproportionately weight some features over others, hindering the learning process.  This can manifest as 0% accuracy, or wildly inaccurate predictions depending on the scaling discrepancies.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate these potential issues with examples using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  Note that I've used simplified datasets for demonstration purposes.

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect: Using string labels directly
data = {'feature': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'], 'label': [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}
feature_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(key='feature', vocabulary_list=['A', 'B', 'C'])

# This will result in an error or unexpected behavior. The model doesn't understand strings
# You need to convert strings into numerical representation using integer indexing or one-hot encoding


# Correct: One-hot encoding
feature_column = tf.feature_column.indicator_column(tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(key='feature', vocabulary_list=['A', 'B', 'C']))
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures([feature_column])
model = tf.keras.Sequential([input_layer, tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... (model fitting and evaluation) ...
```

This code highlights the importance of proper encoding for categorical features. Directly feeding string labels to the model will likely lead to errors or meaningless results.

**Example 2: Data Leakage during Scaling**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

#Simulate data
data = pd.DataFrame({'feature1': np.random.rand(100), 'feature2': np.random.rand(100), 'label': np.random.randint(0,2,100)})
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[['feature1', 'feature2']], data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# INCORRECT: Fitting scaler on the entire dataset
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(pd.concat([X_train, X_test]))
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Correct: Fit the scaler ONLY on training data.
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# ... (model training using X_train_scaled and X_test_scaled)
```

This illustrates data leakage.  Fitting the scaler on the entire dataset (including the test set) allows information from the test set to influence the training process, resulting in an overly optimistic evaluation on the training data and poor generalization to unseen data.

**Example 3: High Cardinality Feature**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate high cardinality feature
data = {'feature': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O'], 100), 'label': np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)}

# INCORRECT:  Directly using one-hot encoding will result in a very sparse matrix
feature_column = tf.feature_column.indicator_column(tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(key='feature', vocabulary_list=sorted(list(set(data['feature'])))))


#CORRECT: Using embedding (Reduces dimensionality)
feature_column = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(key='feature', vocabulary_list=sorted(list(set(data['feature'])))), dimension=5)
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures([feature_column])
model = tf.keras.Sequential([input_layer, tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#... (model fitting and evaluation) ...
```
This example demonstrates how high cardinality can cause problems. A simple one-hot encoding for a feature with many unique values will result in a sparse matrix, making it difficult for a model to generalize. Using an embedding layer instead reduces dimensionality and prevents over-sparsity, greatly improving the model's ability to learn and make accurate predictions.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.).  Also, explore textbooks on machine learning and deep learning; they cover various aspects of feature engineering and model training in detail.  Consider researching topics such as feature scaling techniques (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE), and different approaches for handling categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding).  Finally, revisiting the fundamentals of data preprocessing and model selection is always beneficial for debugging such issues.  Thoroughly understanding your data, particularly its distribution and characteristics, is critical for successful machine learning modeling.
