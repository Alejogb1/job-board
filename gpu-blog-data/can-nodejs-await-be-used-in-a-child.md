The crucial aspect to understand regarding the use of `await` within Node.js child processes hinges on the execution context.  `await` relies on the presence of an event loop, and the availability of that loop is dependent on how the child process is spawned and managed.  In my experience debugging asynchronous operations across multiple processes, this subtle distinction often causes unforeseen complications.

**1. Explanation:**

Node.js's `await` keyword is syntactic sugar for promises. It allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style, improving readability.  However, `await`'s functionality intrinsically depends on the existence of an event loop to manage the asynchronous operations. The main Node.js process inherently possesses an event loop.  Child processes, on the other hand, inherit this behavior only under specific circumstances.

If you fork a child process using `child_process.fork`, a new Node.js process is created which *does* have its own event loop. Consequently, `await` can be used within this forked process without issue.  Inter-process communication (IPC) becomes necessary to handle data exchange between the parent and child.

Conversely, if you spawn a child process using `child_process.spawn` or `child_process.exec`, a new process is created, but it isn't necessarily a full Node.js environment.  The `spawn` method, in particular, allows execution of arbitrary programs, and those programs may or may not have an event loop. If the child process is not a Node.js environment, or a different Node.js version which doesnâ€™t support async/await,  `await` will be unsupported and using it will result in an error. `exec` generally executes shell commands and is even less likely to support `await`.

Therefore, the viability of employing `await` in a child process is entirely contingent on the method used for process creation and the nature of the executed program within that child process.  Improperly managing this distinction leads to common pitfalls like unhandled promise rejections or unexpected synchronous behavior.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: `child_process.fork` (Successful `await` usage):**

```javascript
const { fork } = require('child_process');

async function run() {
  const child = fork('./child.js');

  child.on('message', async (message) => {
    console.log('Parent received:', message); //This message is received from the child process
    const result = await someAsyncOperation(message); //await works here because the parent has an event loop
    console.log('Parent processed:', result);
  });

  child.send('Hello from parent!');
}

async function someAsyncOperation(msg){
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(`${msg} processed`),1000));
}


run();
```

`./child.js`:

```javascript
process.on('message', async (message) => {
  console.log('Child received:', message);
  const processedMessage = await someAsyncChildOperation(message); //await works here because the child process forked from node also has an event loop
  process.send(processedMessage);
});

async function someAsyncChildOperation(msg){
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(`Child processed: ${msg}`), 500));
}
```

This example showcases the successful utilization of `await` in both the parent and child processes using `child_process.fork`.  Both processes have their own event loops. IPC is used for communication.


**Example 2: `child_process.spawn` (Unsuccessful `await` usage - non-Node.js child):**

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const child = spawn('sleep', ['1']); //spawning a system command rather than a node process

child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`Child output: ${data}`);
});

child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`Child error: ${data}`);
});

child.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`Child process exited with code ${code}`);
});

//Attempting to use await here will not work and will cause an error
//const result = await someAsyncOperation('test');
//console.log('Result: ', result)
```

This example demonstrates the limitations of `await` when using `child_process.spawn` with a non-Node.js program (`sleep` in this case).  The child process lacks an event loop capable of handling `await`.  Any attempt to use `await` within the parent process's handling of the child's output would need to be handled using callbacks, not promises.


**Example 3: `child_process.spawn` (Potential `await` usage - Node.js child, but requiring careful handling):**

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

async function run() {
  const child = spawn('node', ['./childAsync.js']); //Spawning node process

  for await (const chunk of child.stdout) {
    console.log(`Parent received: ${chunk}`);
    //process chunk - await is possible here within the parent, however, it is only possible if the child's stdout only returns at the end of its async process.
    //Otherwise, processing the data chunk will require additional considerations around handling the stream of data.

  }
}

run();
```

`./childAsync.js`:

```javascript
const somePromise = async ()=>{
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Test"), 1000));
    console.log("Child completed");
    process.stdout.write("Completed"); //write to stdout
    process.exit();
};

somePromise();
```

This example shows a scenario where you might *think* you can use `await` because the child is another Node.js process.  However, the `child.stdout` is a stream, and `for await...of` iterates over chunks of data as they become available.  The example works because all of the asynchronous operations are completed before `process.exit()` is called, and that output will be handled by the `for await` loop in the parent.   A more robust solution for handling asynchronous operations in this scenario might involve a different IPC mechanism, such as message passing with `child.send` and `child.on('message')`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Node.js documentation on `child_process` is essential.  Understanding the nuances of streams, particularly `ReadableStream` and `WritableStream`, is crucial for effectively handling asynchronous I/O operations when interacting with child processes. A solid grasp of asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript, including promises and async/await, is also paramount.  Finally, explore resources covering inter-process communication techniques specific to Node.js to manage data efficiently between the parent and child processes.
