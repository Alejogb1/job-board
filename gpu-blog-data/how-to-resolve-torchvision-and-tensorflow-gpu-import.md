The root cause of `torchvision` and TensorFlow GPU import errors almost invariably stems from mismatches between the installed libraries and the CUDA toolkit version, or a failure to properly configure the environment to utilize the GPU.  This is particularly true when dealing with multiple deep learning frameworks concurrently.  In my experience troubleshooting this for years across diverse projects – from medical image analysis to natural language processing – I've found that a methodical approach focusing on version compatibility and environment isolation is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process of leveraging GPU acceleration with TensorFlow and PyTorch (which `torchvision` utilizes) necessitates installing compatible CUDA toolkits, cuDNN libraries, and corresponding versions of the deep learning frameworks themselves.  A mismatch between these components can lead to import errors manifesting as cryptic messages indicating a lack of GPU support or failing to find specific CUDA libraries.  Furthermore, even with correct installations, improper environment configuration, such as conflicting CUDA versions in different environments (e.g., conda environments) or incorrect environment variables, will consistently prevent GPU usage.

The first step is to unequivocally determine the exact CUDA version installed on your system. This is crucial because PyTorch and TensorFlow are very specific about their CUDA compatibility.  For example, a TensorFlow version compiled for CUDA 11.8 will fail to import if only CUDA 11.6 is installed.  Similarly, `torchvision`, being a PyTorch-dependent library, will fail if the PyTorch installation is incompatible with your CUDA setup.

Secondly, confirm the CUDA architecture of your GPU. Different GPUs support different CUDA architectures (compute capabilities).   It's vital that both your CUDA toolkit and the compiled versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow are compatible with your GPU's architecture.  Installing a TensorFlow build optimized for a different architecture will result in import failure.

Thirdly, verify the correct installation of the cuDNN library. cuDNN is a crucial component providing optimized deep learning primitives, and its absence or incompatibility will also cause import failures.  The cuDNN version should always match the CUDA toolkit version.

Finally, and often overlooked, ensure your Python environment is correctly configured to use the GPU. This involves setting environment variables such as `CUDA_HOME` and ensuring that the Python interpreter can find the relevant CUDA libraries within its search path.  Using virtual environments is highly recommended to avoid conflicts between different projects and their dependencies.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three code examples illustrating common scenarios and solutions, all within the context of separate conda environments for optimal isolation:

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Installation and Compatibility**

```python
import torch
import tensorflow as tf

print("Torch Version:", torch.__version__)
print("CUDA Available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
print("CUDA Version:", torch.version.cuda)  # May be None if CUDA is not available
print("CUDNN Version:", torch.backends.cudnn.version()) # May be None if CUDA is not available or cuDNN is not found

print("\nTensorFlow Version:", tf.__version__)
print("TensorFlow GPU Available:", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) # Check for GPU devices available to TensorFlow
```

This code snippet checks the versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow and assesses whether the GPU is detected by both frameworks.  A `None` value for CUDA or cuDNN versions indicates an incomplete or incorrect installation.  An empty list from `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` suggests that TensorFlow cannot access your GPU.  Error messages at this stage will be very specific to the missing or mismatched component.


**Example 2:  Creating a Conditionally GPU-Aware Function**

```python
import torch

def gpu_aware_calculation(x):
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device('cuda')
        x = x.to(device)
        # Perform GPU calculations here
        result = x * 2  #Example calculation
        return result.cpu() #Return to CPU for compatibility
    else:
        # Perform CPU calculations here
        result = x * 2 #Example calculation
        return result


tensor = torch.tensor([1,2,3])
result = gpu_aware_calculation(tensor)
print(result)
```

This code dynamically adapts to the presence or absence of a GPU.  It first checks if CUDA is available (`torch.cuda.is_available()`). If true, it moves the tensor to the GPU (`x.to(device)`), performs the calculation, and returns the result to the CPU using `.cpu()` for better compatibility with downstream processing. If a GPU is not available, it performs the same calculation on the CPU. This approach gracefully handles scenarios where GPU acceleration is unavailable without causing runtime crashes.


**Example 3: Setting CUDA Environment Variables (within conda environment)**

This example requires explicit configuration within your conda environment's shell (before activating the environment, add the export statements to your shell's config file such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8  # Replace with your actual CUDA path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$CUDA_HOME/lib64/stubs
export PATH=$PATH:$CUDA_HOME/bin
```

This code snippet demonstrates setting essential environment variables. Replace `/usr/local/cuda-11.8` with the actual path to your CUDA installation. These variables are critical; the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ensures that the dynamic linker can locate CUDA libraries, and the `PATH` variable allows your system to find CUDA executables.  This step often resolves issues stemming from the environment's inability to locate CUDA components.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for both PyTorch and TensorFlow.  Pay close attention to the system requirements and installation instructions, particularly concerning CUDA and cuDNN compatibility.  Thoroughly review the troubleshooting sections of these documentations; they address numerous common errors related to GPU configurations.  Furthermore, familiarize yourself with the concepts of virtual environments (e.g., using `conda` or `venv`) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different CUDA versions or framework versions.  The comprehensive understanding of these concepts minimizes the probability of such errors.
