Backpropagation's application within neural network training is not a matter of *when* in a temporal sense, but rather *where* within the computational graph.  Its application is intrinsically tied to the forward pass and is not an independently scheduled operation.  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional networks for image recognition has repeatedly highlighted the crucial understanding of this dependency. Misinterpreting this can lead to inefficient implementations and inaccurate gradients, ultimately hindering model convergence.

The core principle is that backpropagation calculates gradients – the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the network's weights and biases – *after* a forward pass has completed. The forward pass propagates input data through the network, generating activations at each layer.  Only once these activations are available can the backward pass, facilitated by backpropagation, begin. This is because the gradient calculation at a given layer depends on the activations of that layer and its subsequent layers.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The algorithm proceeds as follows:  First, the input data is fed forward through the network. Each layer performs its computation, transforming the input data and producing an output. This output becomes the input to the next layer. This continues until the final layer produces the network's output. This output is then compared to the target value (ground truth), resulting in a loss value.  The loss function quantifies the discrepancy between the network's prediction and the desired outcome.  This loss value is then propagated backward through the network using the chain rule of calculus.

Backpropagation leverages the chain rule to efficiently calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network.  It starts at the output layer and recursively computes the gradient for each preceding layer.  The gradient at a particular layer is calculated as the product of the gradient from the subsequent layer and the derivative of the layer's activation function with respect to its pre-activation value. This derivative is then used to update the weights and biases of that layer using an optimization algorithm, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.  The update rule typically involves subtracting a scaled version of the gradient from the current weight or bias value. This iterative process of forward and backward propagation continues for a predefined number of epochs or until a convergence criterion is met.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three examples using a simplified neural network structure, focusing on different aspects of backpropagation implementation.

**Example 1: Single-layer perceptron (using NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the sigmoid activation function and its derivative
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)

# Initialize weights and bias randomly
weights = np.random.randn(2, 1)
bias = np.random.randn(1)

# Forward pass
input_data = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
output = sigmoid(np.dot(input_data, weights) + bias)

# Calculate loss (Mean Squared Error)
target = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])
loss = np.mean((output - target)**2)

# Backward pass
error = output - target
d_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(output)
d_weights = np.dot(input_data.T, d_output)
d_bias = np.sum(d_output, axis=0, keepdims=True)

# Update weights and bias (using a learning rate)
learning_rate = 0.1
weights -= learning_rate * d_weights
bias -= learning_rate * d_bias

print(f"Loss: {loss}")
print(f"Updated weights: {weights}")
print(f"Updated bias: {bias}")
```

This demonstrates the fundamental steps: forward pass calculation, loss computation using Mean Squared Error, error calculation and propagation backwards to compute gradients for weights and bias updates.  Note that the sigmoid derivative is crucial for the chain rule application.

**Example 2: Multi-layer perceptron (using TensorFlow/Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

Keras handles backpropagation implicitly through its `compile` and `fit` methods.  The optimizer (`adam` here) uses backpropagation to calculate gradients and update weights.  The user doesn't explicitly code the backward pass.  The `loss` function defines the error function, and the `metrics` provide performance tracking.  This abstracts the complexities, showcasing the convenience of higher-level frameworks.

**Example 3: Custom backpropagation implementation (Conceptual):**

```python
class Layer:
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        # ... weight and bias initialization ...

    def forward(self, input):
        # ... forward pass computation ...
        return output

    def backward(self, d_output):
        # ... compute d_input and gradients ...
        return d_input, d_weights, d_bias

# ... Network class definition utilizing multiple Layer instances ...

# Training loop:
# ... forward pass through all layers ...
# ... loss computation ...
# ... backward pass: start from output layer, call backward() on each layer sequentially ...
# ... gradient update ...

```

This example shows a conceptual structure for a custom-built network.  Each layer has a `forward` method for the forward pass and a `backward` method that performs backpropagation.  The backward pass is explicitly implemented, recursively moving through the layers.  This demonstrates the underlying principles at a lower level, providing greater control but demanding more implementation effort.

"Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop; "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen.  These texts offer comprehensive explanations of backpropagation and neural network architectures.  They provide mathematical foundations and practical implementations, enhancing one's understanding of this essential aspect of deep learning.
