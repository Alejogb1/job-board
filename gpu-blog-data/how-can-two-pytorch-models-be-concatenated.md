The fundamental challenge in concatenating two PyTorch models lies not in a single, readily available function, but rather in understanding the underlying computational graph and ensuring compatibility of output dimensions.  Over the years, working on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects, I've found that the most robust approach hinges on careful consideration of model architectures and the use of `nn.Sequential` containers.  Directly attempting concatenation at the model level frequently results in unexpected behavior, primarily due to differing input expectations between the models.

**1. Understanding the Constraints**

Successful concatenation requires that the output of the first model be a valid input for the second. This necessitates alignment in both data type (e.g., tensors) and dimensionality.  A critical factor often overlooked is the presence of batch normalization or other layers that implicitly modify the tensor's shape (e.g., adding a channel dimension).  Mismatched dimensions lead to runtime errors.  Furthermore, the models' internal state (e.g., the state of an LSTM) cannot be naively concatenated.  Each model should operate independently, with the output of one feeding into the input of the next.

**2. The `nn.Sequential` Solution**

The most straightforward and reliable method utilizes PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` container.  This container takes a list of modules as input, effectively creating a sequential pipeline.  By placing the two models within this container, we define the desired concatenation. The critical element here is confirming the output of the first model is compatible with the input requirements of the second.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate this with three examples, highlighting various scenarios and considerations:

**Example 1: Simple Concatenation of Linear Layers**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Model 1: Two linear layers
model1 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU()
)

# Model 2: A single linear layer
model2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

# Concatenated model
concatenated_model = nn.Sequential(model1, model2)

# Input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Forward pass
output = concatenated_model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 2])
```

This example demonstrates the simplest case.  The output of `model1` (a tensor of shape [batch_size, 5]) is directly accepted by `model2`, which expects an input of shape [batch_size, 5].  The `nn.Sequential` container cleanly manages the forward pass.


**Example 2: Handling Dimension Mismatches with Reshaping**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Model 1: Linear layer
model1 = nn.Linear(10, 15)

# Model 2: Convolutional layer (expecting a 3D tensor)
model2 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv1d(3, 8, kernel_size=3),
    nn.ReLU()
)

# Reshape the output of model1
class ReshapeLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, shape):
        super(ReshapeLayer, self).__init__()
        self.shape = shape

    def forward(self, x):
        return x.reshape(self.shape)

# Define the reshape operation to match the input expectation of the convolutional layer
reshape_layer = ReshapeLayer((-1, 3, 5)) #Example reshape, adjust based on your needs

# Concatenated model
concatenated_model = nn.Sequential(model1, reshape_layer, model2)

# Input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Forward pass
output = concatenated_model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Output will depend on the reshape operation
```

This example addresses dimension mismatches.  `model1` produces a 2D tensor, while `model2` (a CNN) needs a 3D tensor (batch_size, channels, length). A custom `ReshapeLayer` is introduced to adapt the output of `model1` before it's fed into `model2`.  Careful planning and understanding of the tensor shapes is crucial here.  The exact reshape parameters depend heavily on the dimensions of the model outputs.



**Example 3: Concatenating with Feature Extraction Layers**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Model 1: Feature extractor (e.g., a CNN for images)
model1 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    nn.ReLU()
)

# Model 2: Classifier (fully connected layers)
model2 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(16 * 12 * 12, 128), # Adjust based on the output of model1
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 10)
)

# Concatenated model
concatenated_model = nn.Sequential(model1, model2)

# Input tensor (example image-like tensor)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 24, 24)

# Forward pass
output = concatenated_model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 10])
```

This showcases a more practical scenario: concatenating a feature extractor (e.g., a CNN) with a classifier (fully connected layers).  The output of the CNN is a feature map, which needs to be flattened before being fed into the fully connected layers.  The crucial step is understanding the output shape of the feature extractor and adjusting the input dimension of the first fully connected layer accordingly. The dimensions (16 * 12 * 12) in `model2` are illustrative and would need adjustments depending on your convolutional layers and input image size.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's neural network modules and the intricacies of building complex architectures, I strongly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  The PyTorch tutorials provide numerous examples showcasing various model architectures and training techniques.  Furthermore, exploring advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on practical implementations and architecture design will prove immensely beneficial.  Studying implementations of well-known architectures (ResNet, Inception, etc.) can offer valuable insights into effective model design and concatenation strategies.  Finally, actively engaging in online forums and communities dedicated to PyTorch can provide assistance with specific problems and alternative approaches.
