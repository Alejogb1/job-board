The core issue stemming from Keras GRU `initial_state` and `cell.state_size` incompatibility invariably arises from a mismatch in the expected dimensionality.  My experience debugging this across numerous LSTM and GRU-based sequence modeling projects highlights the crucial need for precise alignment between the input shape of your data and the recurrent cell's internal state structure.  Failure to achieve this harmony leads to shape mismatches during the forward pass, ultimately resulting in `ValueError` exceptions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The GRU cell, unlike a simple recurrent unit, possesses an internal state vector that governs the flow of information across timesteps.  This state vector's dimensionality is determined by the `units` parameter during GRU layer instantiation.  Crucially, the `initial_state` argument expects a tensor (or a list of tensors if you're using stacked GRUs) whose shape mirrors this internal state. The most common mistake arises from forgetting the batch size dimension.  The `cell.state_size` attribute provides the dimensionality of the hidden state *for a single sample*.  To correctly specify `initial_state`, you must consider the batch size of your input data.


If your input sequence has a batch size of `B` and the GRU has `N` units, then `initial_state` should be a tensor of shape `(B, N)`.  Failing to include the batch size dimension is the primary source of the `ValueError` encountered when utilizing `initial_state`. The error message often directly points to a shape mismatch between the provided `initial_state` and what the GRU cell expects based on its `state_size` and the input batch size.

A second, less frequent, source of error involves a mismatch in data type between the `initial_state` tensor and the internal workings of the GRU cell. Ensuring consistent data types (typically `float32`) across all tensors involved prevents subtle type-related incompatibilities.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Initialization with NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define GRU layer with 64 units
gru_layer = GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

# Input data shape: (Batch Size, Time Steps, Features)
batch_size = 32
time_steps = 10
features = 20
input_data = np.random.rand(batch_size, time_steps, features)

# Correctly sized initial state
initial_state = np.zeros((batch_size, 64)) #Matches batch size and GRU units

# Model definition and execution
model = Sequential([gru_layer])
output, final_state = model(input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)  # (32, 10, 64)
print("Final state shape:", final_state.shape) # (32, 64)
```

This example shows the correct way to initialize the `initial_state`.  The shape matches the batch size of the input data and the number of units in the GRU layer.  Note the use of `return_state=True` to access the final state.


**Example 2:  Incorrect Initialization Leading to Error:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

gru_layer = GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

batch_size = 32
time_steps = 10
features = 20
input_data = np.random.rand(batch_size, time_steps, features)

# Incorrect initial state: missing batch size dimension!
initial_state = np.zeros((64,))

try:
    model = Sequential([gru_layer])
    output, final_state = model(input_data, initial_state=initial_state)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")
```

This intentionally introduces an error. The `initial_state` lacks the batch size dimension, leading to a `ValueError`.  The `try...except` block gracefully handles the expected exception.


**Example 3: Handling Stacked GRUs:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Stacked GRUs
gru_layer1 = GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
gru_layer2 = GRU(units=32, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

batch_size = 32
time_steps = 10
features = 20
input_data = np.random.rand(batch_size, time_steps, features)

# Initial state for stacked GRUs - list of tensors
initial_state = [np.zeros((batch_size, 64)), np.zeros((batch_size, 32))]

model = Sequential([gru_layer1, gru_layer2])
output, state1, state2 = model(input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)
print("State 1 shape:", state1.shape)
print("State 2 shape:", state2.shape)
```

For stacked GRUs, `initial_state` must be a list of tensors, one for each GRU layer in the stack. Each tensor's shape needs to match the respective layer's `units` and the batch size.  This example demonstrates the correct approach.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation provides comprehensive details on the GRU layer and its arguments.  Consult the TensorFlow documentation for a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation and shape management in TensorFlow/Keras.  A solid understanding of linear algebra and matrix operations is also beneficial for working with recurrent neural networks.  Reviewing introductory material on recurrent neural networks and specifically GRUs can improve your comprehension of the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, debugging tools within your chosen IDE (e.g., pdb in Python) are invaluable for inspecting tensor shapes at various stages of the model execution.
