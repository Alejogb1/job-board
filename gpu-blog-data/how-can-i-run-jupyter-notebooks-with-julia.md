Running Jupyter Notebooks with Julia on a GPU necessitates careful consideration of several interdependent factors: Julia's package ecosystem, GPU driver installation, and the specific libraries enabling GPU acceleration.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing workflows for climate modeling has provided extensive exposure to these intricacies.  Inconsistent GPU utilization is often attributable to overlooked dependencies or improper configuration, not fundamental incompatibility.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between Julia's high-level syntax and the low-level hardware control required for GPU programming.  Julia itself isn't inherently GPU-aware; instead, it relies on packages that interface with CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or ROCm (for AMD GPUs). These packages provide Julia functions that map to GPU kernels, allowing for parallel computation.  Success hinges on three key areas:

* **Correct Driver Installation:** The underlying CUDA or ROCm drivers must be installed and configured correctly on your system.  In my experience, driver version mismatches with CUDA-enabled Julia packages are a frequent source of errors, leading to runtime exceptions or, worse, silent failure, resulting in CPU-bound computations despite the presence of a GPU.  Ensure the driver version is compatible with the CUDA toolkit version used by your Julia packages.

* **Package Selection:** The choice of Julia packages dictates the level of GPU utilization and the ease of implementation.  For general-purpose GPU programming, `CUDA.jl` (for NVIDIA) or `ROCArrays.jl` (for AMD) provide fundamental building blocks. Higher-level packages such as `Flux.jl` (for deep learning) or `CuArrays.jl` (for array operations) offer more convenient abstractions, often hiding the complexities of kernel management.  However, this convenience may come at the cost of reduced control over optimization details.

* **Kernel Optimization:**  Writing efficient GPU kernels requires careful consideration of memory access patterns, data parallelism, and algorithm design. While higher-level packages abstract away much of this, understanding the underlying principles remains crucial for performance tuning.  Neglecting these aspects can result in suboptimal GPU usage, even with correctly installed drivers and appropriate packages.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic CUDA.jl Matrix Multiplication:**

```julia
using CUDA

# Initialize matrices on the GPU
A = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1024, 1024)
B = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1024, 1024)
C = CUDA.zeros(Float32, 1024, 1024)

# Perform matrix multiplication on the GPU
@cuda c = a * b for (c,a,b) in zip(C,A,B)

# Transfer the result back to the CPU (optional)
C_cpu = Array(C)

#Further analysis and processing on C_cpu would happen here
```

This example demonstrates basic matrix multiplication on the GPU using `CUDA.jl`. The `@cuda` macro compiles and executes the code on the GPU. Note that the use of `Float32` improves performance compared to `Float64`.  Transferring data between CPU and GPU (`Array(C)`) has an associated overhead; minimizing such transfers is a key performance optimization strategy.

**Example 2:  Using CuArrays.jl for Array Operations:**

```julia
using CuArrays

# Create CuArrays
A = CuArray(rand(Float32, 1000, 1000))
B = CuArray(rand(Float32, 1000, 1000))

# Perform element-wise addition on the GPU
C = A .+ B

# Access results on the CPU
C_cpu = Array(C)
```

`CuArrays.jl` provides a more user-friendly interface for array operations on the GPU.  The code is significantly more concise than the explicit kernel launch in the previous example, benefiting from optimized underlying implementations.  Again, minimizing data transfer between host and device is crucial.

**Example 3:  A Simple Neural Network with Flux.jl:**

```julia
using Flux, CUDA

# Define a simple neural network
model = Chain(
    Dense(10, 10, Ïƒ),
    Dense(10, 1),
) |> gpu

# Define loss function and optimizer
loss(x, y) = Flux.Losses.mse(model(x), y)
opt = ADAM(0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
data = (rand(Float32, 10, 10), rand(Float32, 10, 1))
for i in 1:1000
    Flux.train!(loss, params(model), [(data...)], opt)
end
```

This example illustrates a rudimentary neural network using `Flux.jl` with GPU acceleration. The `|> gpu` function moves the model parameters to the GPU. `Flux.jl` handles the complexities of backpropagation and optimization on the GPU, providing a high-level interface for deep learning.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend exploring the official documentation for `CUDA.jl`, `CuArrays.jl`, `Flux.jl`, and the relevant GPU driver documentation.  The Julia community forums and documentation are invaluable resources for troubleshooting and finding solutions to specific problems.  Furthermore, several excellent books on high-performance computing and GPU programming provide valuable context. Mastering the concepts of parallel computing and memory management is crucial for optimizing GPU utilization.  Finally, carefully examine the error messages encountered; they are often remarkably informative and pinpoint the precise location of the issue.  Pay close attention to the differences between CPU and GPU memory models.  Understanding these differences avoids common performance pitfalls.
