XGBoost, while capable of leveraging multi-threading on a single machine, often exhibits suboptimal scaling when distributed across multiple GPUs. The core reason isn't a fundamental limitation within the XGBoost algorithm itself, but rather a bottleneck arising from the interaction between its gradient boosting nature and the overhead associated with GPU data transfer and synchronization. I've encountered this issue firsthand numerous times when scaling models for complex classification tasks involving large tabular datasets, particularly during model training for real-time fraud detection systems where minimizing latency was paramount.

The gradient boosting process in XGBoost is inherently sequential. Each tree is built based on the residuals from the previous tree, meaning the construction of the (n+1)th tree depends entirely on the completion of the nth tree. This dependency limits parallel execution in a fundamental way. While XGBoost does utilize OpenMP for parallelization within the tree building process, specifically during the splitting of nodes and candidate feature search, these are limited to a single machine's resources. They don't extend naturally to distributed training across separate GPUs.

The primary challenge when attempting to use multiple GPUs effectively for XGBoost is the cost of data movement. Each GPU requires its own copy of the dataset, or at least the necessary features. Moving this potentially massive dataset across the system's interconnect (e.g., PCIe) for every tree update is a high-latency operation. The computation done on each GPU, while accelerated compared to a CPU, is often dwarfed by this data transfer overhead, leading to diminishing returns as the number of GPUs increases.

Furthermore, the gradient update process must be synchronized across the GPUs. After each tree iteration, gradients and sufficient statistics must be exchanged and aggregated to enable the next tree to be built. This inter-GPU communication becomes a further bottleneck, particularly with an increasing number of GPUs, because it must occur repeatedly per round of boosting. This introduces synchronization delays which can outweigh the theoretical computational gain provided by the additional devices. The core algorithm, by its nature, is not conducive to massive parallel execution across GPUs.

While XGBoost's core implementation doesn't inherently support multi-GPU training, various approaches have been proposed and implemented to address the issue. These approaches generally involve methods to distribute data, gradients, and tree building processes more efficiently. However, this usually requires modifications to the core algorithm or the use of an alternative framework which are not part of the standard XGBoost API.

Let's look at how this can manifest in code, with some modifications to illustrate key aspects.

**Code Example 1: CPU-Only Training**

```python
import xgboost as xgb
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate a sample dataset
X = np.random.rand(10000, 100)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 10000)

dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X, label=y)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary:logistic',
    'eval_metric': 'logloss',
    'nthread': 8 # Use 8 threads on the CPU
}

start_time = time.time()
bst = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=100)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"CPU training time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

```

This first example shows a basic training setup using `xgboost.train` on a CPU. We are using `nthread=8`, which will utilize multiple cores on the CPU, leveraging XGBoost's efficient multi-threading. The output will give us a baseline for the training time.

**Code Example 2: Pseudo-GPU Training on CPU (Illustrative)**

```python
import xgboost as xgb
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate a sample dataset
X = np.random.rand(10000, 100)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 10000)

dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X, label=y)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary:logistic',
    'eval_metric': 'logloss',
    'nthread': 1 # Simulate single GPU environment, but on CPU
}

start_time = time.time()
bst = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=100)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Simulated Single GPU training time (on CPU): {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

```

Here, we deliberately restrict the number of threads to `1`, simulating what would be happening on a single GPU without modifications for multi-GPU support. Notice the time it takes is considerably longer than the first example. This reinforces that XGBoost performance gains are primarily within a single machine's resources and can not effectively leverage multiple independent computing devices, such as GPUs.

**Code Example 3: Attempting Data Parallelism (Ineffective)**

```python
import xgboost as xgb
import numpy as np
import time
import multiprocessing

# Generate a sample dataset
X = np.random.rand(10000, 100)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 10000)
num_parts = 4

def train_part(data_part, label_part):
   dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(data_part, label=label_part)
   params = {
        'objective': 'binary:logistic',
        'eval_metric': 'logloss',
        'nthread': 1 # Simulate single GPU environment
    }
   return xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=25) # Train only a part of the trees

# Split data
X_parts = np.array_split(X,num_parts)
y_parts = np.array_split(y, num_parts)

# Initialize Process Pool
pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes = num_parts)

start_time = time.time()
results = pool.starmap(train_part, zip(X_parts, y_parts)) # Training in parallel
pool.close()
pool.join()

# Attempt to Merge models (This fails because the trees are not built sequentially)
# bst = results[0]
# for i in range(1, num_parts):
#     bst.update(results[i].get_dump(), bst)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Failed Parallel Training Time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
print("Note: Models can not be combined in this way.")

```

This third example is an attempt to utilize multiple cores (or theoretically multiple GPUs if data were loaded on individual GPU memory regions) to train model parts in parallel. We partition the data and start a process for each part, training for only a fraction of the total required boosting rounds. Although this seems like it might work in theory, it doesn't, and we cannot combine the models in this manner, because the process of gradient boosting inherently depends on the sequential nature of the tree building process. Each tree must be built on the residuals from the last one, so we cannot train independent trees and naively merge them without losing the boosting effects. The time taken is also unlikely to be faster, due to the overhead of creating the sub processes and transferring data to them. This demonstrates the inherent challenge in trying to parallelize the gradient boosting process without modifying the core logic.

The code examples above illustrate that simply distributing data and running the XGBoost algorithm independently on multiple devices is not a viable method. It fails due to the dependency of subsequent steps on previous results and the need for coherent gradient accumulation across devices.

To effectively utilize multiple GPUs, more sophisticated techniques involving changes to the core gradient boosting algorithm are required. These include, but are not limited to, techniques such as distributed gradient aggregation or specialized communication libraries. Standard XGBoost doesn't currently implement these directly.

For further study, I would recommend the following resources:
* Technical documentation and academic papers on distributed machine learning.
* The specific documentation of libraries offering multi-GPU support for gradient boosting algorithms, such as the RAPIDS ecosystem.
* Publications focusing on techniques such as gradient compression, and asynchronous gradient descent as they apply to distributed learning.

While XGBoost's performance can be greatly improved with careful single machine optimization, its ability to effectively leverage multiple GPUs is limited without specialized implementations of the gradient boosting process. Understanding the sequential dependency inherent in gradient boosting and the overheads associated with data transfer and inter-device synchronization is crucial to grasping why achieving significant speedup by simply adding more GPUs is not viable.
