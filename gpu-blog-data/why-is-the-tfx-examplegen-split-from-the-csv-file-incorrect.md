The root cause of an incorrect split in TFX's ExampleGen when processing CSV data often stems from a misunderstanding of how ExampleGen handles the splitting process, particularly its reliance on the `split_ratio` parameter and the default 'random' splitting strategy, which can seem non-deterministic when the input data lacks a unique key. I've personally encountered this frustration while building an anomaly detection pipeline for network traffic data, where a seemingly inconsistent dataset partitioning led to significant model performance variations. Let's delve into why this happens.

ExampleGen, by design, processes input data, extracts feature columns, and then partitions this data into training, evaluation, and optional validation splits according to the configured `split_ratio`. When fed a CSV file, ExampleGen reads the data row by row. If no unique identifier column is present (or explicitly specified for custom splitting) within the CSV, the splitting is, in effect, random, based on the order the rows are encountered during read operation, which is not always the same. This random assignment can seem like a bug, especially when the CSV file is generated from an external source and exhibits slight variations in row ordering across executions. The randomness is deterministic within the same execution given the same input and random seed, but not stable across different executions or slight input variations.

The core problem isn't with ExampleGen's implementation itself but with the implicit expectation of a stable and repeatable split when using the default random strategy. If the data lacks an inherent ordering or unique identifier that can be used to produce a deterministic split, any small change in the input row order can cause a different row to be assigned to training or evaluation. This, in turn, leads to an inconsistent distribution of data across different splits which can hinder model training consistency and make reproducing results difficult. This issue becomes more pronounced in larger datasets, where minute shifts in row order lead to significant differences in the composition of the training and evaluation data.

Now, let's illustrate this with some example code snippets. Consider the following initial TFX pipeline code snippet, representing a typical, yet flawed setup.

**Example 1: Basic CSV Input with Default Split**

```python
from tfx import components
from tfx.dsl import Channel
from tfx.types import standard_artifacts
from tfx.proto import example_gen_pb2
import os

# Assuming the existence of a CSV data file 'data.csv' in the 'data_root' directory
data_root = 'data/'
example_gen = components.CsvExampleGen(
    input_base=data_root,
    splits=example_gen_pb2.Input(splits=[
        example_gen_pb2.Input.Split(name='train', hash_buckets=2),
        example_gen_pb2.Input.Split(name='eval', hash_buckets=1)
    ])
)

example_artifacts = Channel(type=standard_artifacts.Examples)

#This is a simplified version for demonstration purposes and omits other components.
example_gen.outputs['examples'].set_artifact(example_artifacts)

# Later in pipeline you access example_artifacts. This setup can lead to inconsistent splits.
```

In this example, `CsvExampleGen` is configured to split the input CSV data into a 2/1 training/evaluation split (roughly 66.67% training, 33.33% evaluation). However, the absence of a clear splitting key or specific non-default split function means that ExampleGen uses its default strategy that treats each row equally and, essentially, pseudo-randomly assigns them to a specific split upon initial read. Subsequent pipeline runs with the same CSV content but different row order will likely result in discrepancies between training and evaluation data. The hash_buckets parameter is not a stable splitting strategy, it is essentially random.

To avoid this, I've found it critical to use a stable splitting strategy. This can be achieved by specifying a unique key in the data or implementing a custom split function.

**Example 2: Leveraging a Key for Deterministic Splits**

Let's assume the CSV data contains a column called 'id' that provides a unique key for each row. Then we can instruct ExampleGen to use this column for splitting via a feature hash:

```python
from tfx import components
from tfx.dsl import Channel
from tfx.types import standard_artifacts
from tfx.proto import example_gen_pb2
import os

data_root = 'data/'
example_gen = components.CsvExampleGen(
    input_base=data_root,
    splits=example_gen_pb2.Input(splits=[
        example_gen_pb2.Input.Split(name='train', hash_buckets=2),
        example_gen_pb2.Input.Split(name='eval', hash_buckets=1)
    ]),
    custom_config=example_gen_pb2.CustomConfig(
        custom_options={"key_feature_name": "id"}
    )
)


example_artifacts = Channel(type=standard_artifacts.Examples)
example_gen.outputs['examples'].set_artifact(example_artifacts)

#Consistent split since 'id' column is used to split.
```

In this improved version, a `CustomConfig` is used to specify that the column 'id' should be used for consistent splitting. This works by hashing the `id` value and assigning rows to different splits according to the hash value and split ratio. This solution will provide a deterministic split, regardless of minor changes in row order. This approach has consistently given me a reproducible split in my network anomaly detection pipelines. The `hash_buckets` parameter acts as a split ratio definition, and the hash function, although deterministic for the same key, distributes based on the hash, resulting in the desired split.

However, if a unique identifier does not exist, or if we wish to use a different split method (for example, chronological), a custom split function is needed.

**Example 3: Implementing a Custom Split Function**

Implementing a custom split function involves creating a separate Python module containing the split function and then providing that module's path to the ExampleGen.

First, create a file called `custom_split.py` in the same directory as your pipeline definition.
```python
#custom_split.py
import hashlib

def my_custom_split_function(row, num_buckets):
    # Example: hash a string based feature to determine bucket
    hash_id = hashlib.md5(row["some_string_column"].encode()).hexdigest()

    split_bucket_idx = int(hash_id, 16) % num_buckets
    return split_bucket_idx
```

Then, change the pipeline definition to utilise the custom split function:

```python
from tfx import components
from tfx.dsl import Channel
from tfx.types import standard_artifacts
from tfx.proto import example_gen_pb2
import os

data_root = 'data/'

example_gen = components.CsvExampleGen(
    input_base=data_root,
    splits=example_gen_pb2.Input(splits=[
        example_gen_pb2.Input.Split(name='train', hash_buckets=2),
        example_gen_pb2.Input.Split(name='eval', hash_buckets=1)
    ]),
    custom_config=example_gen_pb2.CustomConfig(
        custom_options={
            "split_fn": "custom_split.my_custom_split_function"
        }
    )
)


example_artifacts = Channel(type=standard_artifacts.Examples)
example_gen.outputs['examples'].set_artifact(example_artifacts)

#This code assumes a custom_split.py module is present in the same directory.
#This leverages the 'some_string_column' and MD5 hashes it.
```

This approach permits any logic to be used for the split. In the above example, we hash a string column to determine the split, which will give a reproducible split. The name `my_custom_split_function` in `custom_options` points to the function inside the Python module `custom_split`. When using custom split functions like this you should be especially diligent in testing it and ensuring your split is correct, and as intended. It is recommended to add sufficient logging to inspect how the split is operating.

To avoid these data splitting issues, always prioritize providing a stable, reproducible splitting strategy to TFX's ExampleGen. The default random method might be sufficient for small initial explorations, but can cause frustration and inconsistent model performance when moving towards production. This experience has taught me that taking the time to verify the distribution of data across training and evaluation splits is vital to the stability of any production ML pipeline.

For further exploration on data handling and pipeline best practices, I recommend consulting the official TFX documentation, particularly the sections on data input and custom components.  Additionally, articles detailing general ML workflow stability often provide additional insights into robust data handling.  The concept of data lineage is also key to ensuring data quality in a continuous learning environment. Finally, reviewing the TFX design principles, particularly in how each component aims to encapsulate specific functionality, clarifies how splits are handled.
