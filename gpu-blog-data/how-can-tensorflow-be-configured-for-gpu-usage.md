TensorFlow's capability to leverage GPUs for accelerated computation is paramount for deep learning applications, often resulting in orders of magnitude performance improvement compared to CPU-only execution. The initial setup requires careful consideration of the available hardware and software environment, and is not a completely automated process. I’ve spent a significant amount of time optimizing model training on different systems, and found that a systematic approach is most effective.

To enable GPU usage within TensorFlow, several key steps are involved, encompassing both software and hardware prerequisites. Primarily, a compatible NVIDIA GPU and appropriate drivers are necessary. The CUDA Toolkit, a development environment by NVIDIA, must be installed, containing libraries and tools that TensorFlow will utilize for GPU communication. In addition, cuDNN, a deep neural network library also provided by NVIDIA, needs to be installed. It provides optimized routines for deep learning operations which are essential for leveraging the GPU efficiently.

The TensorFlow installation itself plays a crucial role. TensorFlow offers two versions: the standard one and a GPU-enabled version. The latter is required for GPU utilization and often installs alongside the appropriate CUDA and cuDNN libraries at the point of installation. A mismatch between the CUDA/cuDNN versions and the TensorFlow version may lead to runtime errors, highlighting the importance of adhering to the compatibility matrix published by TensorFlow’s release notes.

Once the environment is correctly set up, TensorFlow, through its API, allows explicit or implicit specification of device placement. The default behavior often involves TensorFlow automatically placing operations on the GPU if available and deemed suitable. However, in more complex scenarios, it’s beneficial to manually control which devices computations execute on. This control permits distributing tasks across multiple GPUs or constraining certain operations to the CPU for specific reasons such as debugging, profiling, or optimizing memory utilization.

The specific mechanism for defining device placement involves TensorFlow's device specification strings. These strings take the form `/device:GPU:<ID>`, where `<ID>` is an integer representing the specific GPU device. For instance, `/device:GPU:0` refers to the first available GPU, typically the default for single-GPU systems. Similarly, `/device:CPU:0` indicates the first available CPU.  TensorFlow also provides features for multi-GPU training using `tf.distribute.Strategy` to distribute model operations or manage data-parallelism.

The initial verification of correct GPU usage is often the most challenging stage. I typically rely on observing memory allocation on the GPU via the `nvidia-smi` command line tool. When TensorFlow operations begin, I expect to observe a spike in memory usage on the GPU.  Further checks involve using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`, which returns a list of discovered GPU devices by TensorFlow, confirming that the library recognizes and can interact with the installed GPUs. If this returns an empty list, a deeper investigation into the CUDA, cuDNN and TensorFlow installation is usually warranted.

Furthermore, I find it beneficial to profile model execution to see where bottlenecks occur. By using TensorFlow profiler tools, one can identify operations that could be optimized for GPU execution or operations mistakenly scheduled on the CPU when a GPU device was intended. In larger, complex projects, I often develop custom solutions to optimize the placement of operations for better performance.

Below are code examples illustrating various aspects of GPU configuration within TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Basic GPU Availability Check**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
    print("GPUs available:")
    for gpu in gpus:
        print(gpu)
else:
    print("No GPUs detected.")

# Further example - verifying if the tensorflow library was built with GPU support

if tf.test.is_gpu_available():
    print("TensorFlow built with GPU support")
else:
    print("TensorFlow NOT built with GPU support")
```

*Commentary*: This example provides a simple check for GPU availability. It uses the `tf.config.list_physical_devices` function to retrieve a list of available GPU devices. The output will display the details of any detected GPUs. The `tf.test.is_gpu_available()` test is designed to verify that the TensorFlow build itself is compiled with GPU support which is equally important for GPU operation. If GPUs are available, but this test returns `False`, the appropriate TensorFlow build must be installed.

**Example 2: Explicit Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define operations and specify device placement

with tf.device('/device:GPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], name='b')
    c = tf.add(a, b, name='c')
    print("Result on GPU:", c)


with tf.device('/device:CPU:0'):
    x = tf.constant([7.0, 8.0, 9.0], name='x')
    y = tf.constant([10.0, 11.0, 12.0], name='y')
    z = tf.add(x, y, name='z')
    print("Result on CPU:", z)

```

*Commentary*: This code snippet demonstrates how to explicitly specify the device for TensorFlow operations. By using `tf.device` context managers, the addition operation `c = tf.add(a, b)` is forced to run on the first available GPU (indexed as 0), while `z = tf.add(x,y)` is forced to the CPU. This explicit placement control can be invaluable for debugging and optimizing performance. The output confirms the operations have been executed and allocated on the intended device.

**Example 3: Restricting GPU memory usage**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Get handle to GPU device
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:

    # Restrict TensorFlow to only allocate 3GB of memory on GPU 0
    try:
        tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(
            gpus[0],
            [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=3072)]
        )
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)


    # Test operation - will allocate on GPU up to the configured limit
    with tf.device('/device:GPU:0'):
        a = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)
        c = tf.add(a,b)
        print(c)


else:
    print("No GPUs found to apply memory restrictions.")
```

*Commentary:* This code example shows how to control the amount of memory allocated on the GPU by TensorFlow. By using `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`, the first GPU is configured to a memory limit of 3072 MB (3 GB). The operation created within the `tf.device` context will then only allocate memory up to the configured restriction. This memory control is extremely important for utilizing GPU resources efficiently, especially in multi-GPU environments or during development where you may want to isolate processes using the same GPU.

Further self-guided learning can be achieved through the official TensorFlow documentation; this is the first place I always go when working with the library.  Additionally, research publications on the subject of GPU programming and deep learning also provide good sources of information and technical understanding. Various online deep learning courses also contain useful practical tips that are applicable here. Studying the examples given in the TensorFlow repository can also expose you to advanced techniques.
