The `ValueError: Unknown layer: Functional` error encountered during Keras `load_model` invocation stems fundamentally from a mismatch between the model's architecture as defined during saving and the available Keras layers at load time.  This discrepancy commonly arises from using custom layers, or layers from a different Keras version, during the initial model training and subsequent loading.  In my experience debugging production-level deep learning pipelines, I've observed this issue predominantly when deploying models trained in one environment (e.g., a development machine with specific libraries) to another (e.g., a production server with potentially different versions or missing dependencies).

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras `load_model` function relies on a serialized representation of your model's architecture and weights.  This serialization process leverages Python's `pickle` module and embeds crucial metadata about each layer within the saved model file (typically an HDF5 file).  If the `load_model` function encounters a layer type that it cannot recognize – meaning a layer class with that name is not available in the currently active Keras environment – it raises the `ValueError: Unknown layer: Functional`. This is especially true for custom layers, where the class definition must be accessible during loading.  Furthermore, even with standard Keras layers, version mismatches between the TensorFlow/Keras versions used during saving and loading can result in this error; layer implementations can evolve across releases.

This error is not directly linked to the "Functional API" itself; rather, it highlights an inconsistency in the environment's ability to reconstruct the model's complete architecture.  A functional model, while using the Functional API for building, still ultimately relies on standard layer objects. The issue is that one or more of these layer objects, whether standard or custom, is unavailable or has changed in a way that breaks the loading process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Missing Custom Layer**

```python
# model_save.py (Model saving script)

from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal')
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return keras.activations.relu(keras.backend.dot(inputs, self.w))

inputs = Input(shape=(10,))
x = MyCustomLayer(64)(inputs)
outputs = Dense(1)(x)
model = Model(inputs, outputs)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save('my_model.h5')
```

```python
# model_load.py (Attempting to load the model without the custom layer definition)

from tensorflow import keras

try:
    model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates the classic scenario: a custom layer `MyCustomLayer` is used during model creation but not defined during model loading.  The `model_load.py` script will fail with the `ValueError: Unknown layer: MyCustomLayer` (or potentially `ValueError: Unknown layer: Functional`, if the internal layer representation is not properly serialized).  The solution requires ensuring `MyCustomLayer`'s definition is available in `model_load.py` before calling `load_model`.

**Example 2: Keras Version Mismatch**

```python
# model_save_v1.py (Model saving with Keras v1)

import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf

tf.disable_v2_behavior() #Ensure Keras v1 behavior

from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential([LSTM(128, input_shape=(10,1))])
model.save('model_v1.h5')
```

```python
# model_load_v2.py (Attempting to load with Keras v2)

import tensorflow as tf # This will use Keras V2

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

try:
    model = load_model('model_v1.h5')
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

```

This example highlights a version incompatibility. Saving a model using older Keras APIs (here simulating Keras v1) and trying to load it with a newer version often leads to issues; the internal representation might not be fully compatible.  The solution necessitates maintaining consistent Keras versions or using a compatible saving/loading mechanism that addresses version differences.

**Example 3: Incorrect Layer Import**

```python
# model_save_incorrect_import.py (Saving model with incorrect layer import)

from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, LayerNormalization #correct import
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import tensorflow.keras.layers as kl # incorrect import of LayerNormalization in some other parts of your code

inputs = Input(shape=(10,))
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = kl.LayerNormalization()(x) #incorrect
outputs = Dense(1)(x)
model = Model(inputs, outputs)
model.save('incorrect_import.h5')
```

```python
# model_load_incorrect_import.py (Attempting to load with correct import)

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, LayerNormalization # correct import

try:
    model = load_model('incorrect_import.h5')
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
```

This demonstrates another subtle issue.  While the model was saved with `LayerNormalization`, it might get serialized in a way which depends on the *exact* method used to reference it.  An incorrect import path during model building, even if seemingly corrected during loading, can cause compatibility problems.  The solution involves meticulously reviewing all layer imports during both saving and loading to avoid such inconsistencies.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models.  A thorough understanding of the Keras Functional API and its limitations is also crucial.  Reviewing the source code of any custom layers for potential serialization issues can be essential. Furthermore, debugging with a step-by-step approach, checking each layer's successful instantiation, can isolate the root cause.  Finally, maintaining a version control system for both your code and the model itself ensures reproducibility.  Consistent environment management (using virtual environments or containers) is also paramount for avoiding these kinds of discrepancies.
