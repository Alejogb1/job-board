The `libcublas.so.9.0` error encountered when using TensorFlow with CUDA 10.0 stems primarily from a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit version expected by TensorFlow's compiled libraries and the CUDA toolkit actually installed on the system.  This incompatibility manifests as a dynamic linker error because TensorFlow cannot locate the correct version of the cuBLAS library, a crucial component for performing linear algebra operations on NVIDIA GPUs.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous deep learning projects, ranging from image classification to natural language processing, this discrepancy is almost always the root cause.

**1.  Explanation of the Error:**

TensorFlow's binary distributions are compiled against specific versions of CUDA and cuBLAS.  When you install TensorFlow, its installer or build process embeds paths to the expected CUDA libraries within its shared object files (`.so` files on Linux).  If these libraries are not present at the runtime locations specified by TensorFlow, or if incompatible versions are present, the system's dynamic linker will fail to resolve the dependencies, leading to the `libcublas.so.9.0` error.  This doesn't necessarily mean that CUDA 10.0 itself is the problem; the issue is with the specific version of cuBLAS that TensorFlow expects (in this case, version 9.0).  CUDA 10.0 likely includes a different version of cuBLAS.

The dynamic linker searches for libraries in predefined locations, including system-wide directories and paths specified by the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. If the correct `libcublas.so.9.0` is not found in any of these locations during TensorFlow's execution, the error is raised.  Furthermore, conflicts can arise if multiple versions of CUDA are installed concurrently, leading to ambiguity for the dynamic linker.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The error typically doesn't manifest within the TensorFlow code itself, but rather during its initialization or the execution of GPU-accelerated operations. The following examples highlight scenarios where the error can occur and demonstrate potential debugging steps.

**Example 1:  Simple TensorFlow import:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
    #Further TensorFlow operations here
except Exception as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow initialization failed: {e}")
```

* **Commentary:**  This minimal example demonstrates a basic TensorFlow import. The `try...except` block is crucial for catching the error during runtime. The output of `len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))` helps confirm GPU visibility.  The exception message should provide valuable clues about the underlying library loading issues.  If the `libcublas.so.9.0` error occurs here, the problem is likely with the TensorFlow installation or system environment.


**Example 2:  Explicit CUDA context creation (more advanced):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

#Attempt to set CUDA environment variables for debugging (use with caution).
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0' #Select specific GPU
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64' #Add correct path if necessary.  Use extreme caution.

try:
    # ... TensorFlow code that uses GPU operations ...
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Explicitly uses GPU 0
      a = tf.random.normal((1024, 1024))
      b = tf.random.normal((1024, 1024))
      c = tf.matmul(a, b)

except Exception as e:
  print(f"TensorFlow GPU operation failed: {e}")
  print(os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH'))  #check LD_LIBRARY_PATH value

```

* **Commentary:** This example attempts more precise control over GPU usage and adds explicit handling of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.  Setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` can isolate the issue to a specific GPU. Manipulating `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` directly is generally discouraged, and incorrect values can negatively affect the system. This example is intended for diagnostic purposes only in controlled environments. Always revert changes to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` after debugging to avoid system-wide problems.  The print statement for the environment variable aids in confirming whether the expected path is set correctly.


**Example 3:  Checking CUDA and cuBLAS versions:**

This isn't strictly TensorFlow code, but crucial for diagnosis.

```bash
nvcc --version  #Check NVCC compiler version (CUDA toolkit version)
ldd /path/to/your/tensorflow/lib/libtensorflow_framework.so.2 | grep libcublas  # examine tensorflow dependencies to see actual libcublas version.
```

* **Commentary:**  These commands are executed from the terminal (bash or zsh). The first command verifies the installed CUDA toolkit version.  The second utilizes `ldd` (a Linux utility) to inspect the dependencies of the TensorFlow shared library (replace `/path/to/your/tensorflow/lib/libtensorflow_framework.so.2` with the actual path to your TensorFlow library). The output shows which version of `libcublas` TensorFlow is attempting to link to at runtime.  A mismatch between the reported `libcublas` version and your system's installed version is a key indicator of the problem.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuBLAS.  Review the CUDA installation guide to ensure all components (including cuBLAS) are correctly installed and configured.  Examine the system's dynamic linker configuration and environment variables, paying close attention to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and its possible conflicts.  Use the system's package manager (like `apt` or `yum`) to manage CUDA and TensorFlow installations. Carefully review the output of `ldd` on relevant TensorFlow libraries.   Troubleshooting guides specific to CUDA and TensorFlow should also be consulted for additional information on specific distribution issues.  Remember to always create virtual environments for software development projects to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.



By systematically addressing these points, meticulously examining your environment, and applying the code examples provided for debugging, the root cause of the `libcublas.so.9.0` error with TensorFlow and CUDA 10.0 should be identifiable and resolved.  Remember that maintaining consistent and well-managed installations of CUDA and TensorFlow is crucial for avoiding these dependency-related issues.
