The `keras.layers.Input` layer, typically used within TensorFlow's Keras API, does not directly use `InputShape`. Instead, `InputShape` is a parameter passed to `Input`, which establishes the expected tensor shapes of the data fed into the first layer of a model. It's crucial for static graph construction and subsequent tensor manipulation during training and inference. I've spent considerable time working on image classification models where inconsistent input shapes lead to runtime errors, so I've developed a robust understanding of its nuances.

The `Input` layer in Keras is a symbolic placeholder. It doesn’t process actual data; instead, it describes the structure of incoming tensors. When you create a model, you define the input layer using `keras.layers.Input`, and the `shape` argument—or more precisely, `input_shape`—specifies the expected shape of the input tensors that your model will accept during training and inference. This specification is critical because TensorFlow needs this information during graph building to allocate resources and ensure data is processed correctly throughout the model architecture. This `input_shape` parameter should match the shape of your actual input data, excluding the batch size.

For instance, if you're dealing with grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, your `input_shape` would be `(28, 28, 1)`. The first two values represent the height and width respectively, while the third represents the number of channels (1 for grayscale). If you were working with color images in the RGB space, your shape would then be `(28, 28, 3)`. It’s essential to note that this doesn't indicate the number of examples the model processes at a time; that's determined at runtime during training using the `batch_size` parameter in the `model.fit` method or when loading a dataset using the `tf.data` API.

The `Input` layer with its defined `input_shape` establishes the entry point of your network. Each subsequent layer you add to your model receives the output tensor dimensions of the previous layer, ensuring the shapes are compatible. TensorFlow automatically computes the output shape of subsequent layers based on their internal operations (e.g., convolution, pooling, dense layers) and their own configured parameters. An incorrectly specified `input_shape` in the initial `Input` layer will cascade through the network, generating errors during training or inference as shapes become misaligned.

When working with sequences, such as text, the `input_shape` would represent the sequence length and the feature dimensionality. For a sequence of length 100 with an embedding dimension of 32, the `input_shape` would be `(100, 32)`. If your input sequences have variable lengths you’ll often want to pad them to a specific length before feeding them into a deep learning model. The padding dimension itself is not handled by `Input`, instead it is specified through preprocessing outside of the model.

It's also important to understand that while you provide an `input_shape` to the `Input` layer, you can also define an `input_tensor`. This parameter takes a pre-existing TensorFlow tensor that is already shaped in the way you need for your network. Instead of creating a placeholder with `Input`, you can direct the input towards a specific named tensor. When building complex models or functional API models that take different outputs or inputs in other part of a pipeline, providing the input as a tensor is incredibly useful.

Here are a few examples demonstrating usage:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Example 1: Image classification with a convolutional neural network (CNN)

input_shape_cnn = (28, 28, 1)  # Grayscale images 28x28
input_layer_cnn = keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape_cnn)

conv_1 = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer_cnn)
pool_1 = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv_1)

conv_2 = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(pool_1)
pool_2 = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv_2)

flatten = keras.layers.Flatten()(pool_2)
dense = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten)

model_cnn = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer_cnn, outputs=dense)

model_cnn.summary() # Displays the model architecture
```
In the first example, I define an input layer for grayscale images using the shape (28, 28, 1) to work with the model. Convolutional and Maxpooling layers follow, leading to a flattening layer and then a fully connected layer. The `summary()` call helps to verify that the shape of tensors after each operation are compatible. This code defines a fully functional convolutional network capable of handling single channel images.

```python
# Example 2: Sequence classification with a recurrent neural network (RNN)

input_shape_rnn = (100, 32) # Sequence length 100, embedding dimension 32
input_layer_rnn = keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape_rnn)

lstm = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=False)(input_layer_rnn)
dense = keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(lstm)

model_rnn = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer_rnn, outputs=dense)
model_rnn.summary()
```

In the second example, the input shape `(100, 32)` denotes a sequence length of 100 and a feature size of 32, which is common for text embeddings. An LSTM layer processes the sequence and feeds the output to a dense layer with 2 output classes. The `return_sequences` parameter of the LSTM ensures that the returned output is the final sequence output instead of a per-step output.

```python
# Example 3: Input as a tensor

input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(tensor=tf.ones(shape=(None, 64)), dtype=tf.float32)

dense_1 = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
dense_2 = keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(dense_1)
model_tensor = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=dense_2)

model_tensor.summary()
```

In the final example, I demonstrated the use of `input_tensor`. Here, a specific tensor is passed to the Input layer, which defines the starting dimensions of the tensors going through the model. This approach is very useful for reusing tensors calculated in different parts of a network architecture. Note that the first dimension of the shape is `None`, which allows this input to handle variable batch sizes.

Several resources can aid in further exploration of the Keras API and TensorFlow. The official TensorFlow documentation provides a comprehensive guide for layers, especially on `Input` layer functionalities, along with many examples and tutorials for using and creating different model architectures. The Keras API documentation is a critical reference since it is closely integrated with TensorFlow and explains many of the concepts in an easy-to-understand manner. A book dedicated to practical applications of deep learning, especially using TensorFlow and Keras, will provide helpful context on how these principles are applied in real-world models, offering detailed explanations and examples to reinforce learning. Finally, engaging with online courses and tutorials focused on deep learning and TensorFlow will help solidify understanding.
