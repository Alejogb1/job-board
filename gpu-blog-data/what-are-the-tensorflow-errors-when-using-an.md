TensorFlow performance on an RTX 3090, while generally excellent, is not without its potential pitfalls.  My experience troubleshooting this stems from several years working on large-scale image recognition projects, initially hampered by unexpected TensorFlow behavior tied to GPU resource management.  The key issue often lies not in the card itself, but in the interaction between TensorFlow's memory allocation strategies and the CUDA runtime environment.  Specifically, exceeding available GPU memory or improper configuration of CUDA visibility are common culprits.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The RTX 3090 possesses significant GPU memory (typically 24GB), but TensorFlow applications can still encounter out-of-memory (OOM) errors if not carefully managed.  These errors manifest in various ways, including abrupt program termination, cryptic error messages referencing memory allocation failures, or slower-than-expected performance due to excessive swapping between GPU and system RAM.  Furthermore, CUDA-related errors can arise if TensorFlow isn't properly configured to access the RTX 3090's capabilities.  This typically involves ensuring the correct CUDA toolkit version is installed and that TensorFlow is compiled with appropriate CUDA support.  Finally, improper use of TensorFlow's memory management APIs, particularly `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth()` and `tf.data.Dataset.prefetch()`, can significantly impact performance and lead to seemingly random OOM errors.  Effective error handling necessitates understanding the underlying TensorFlow execution model and the CUDA driver's interaction with the GPU.  Debugging often involves systematically investigating GPU memory usage, analyzing TensorFlow's logs for specific error codes, and verifying CUDA driver and library versions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Handling OOM Errors with `set_memory_growth()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be created before physical devices are visible
        print(e)

# Subsequent TensorFlow operations...
```

**Commentary:** This code snippet demonstrates the crucial step of enabling memory growth.  By setting `set_memory_growth(gpu, True)`, TensorFlow dynamically allocates GPU memory as needed, preventing premature OOM errors.  The `try-except` block handles potential runtime errors that may occur if memory growth is configured incorrectly.  The code first checks for available GPUs, then iterates through them, applying the setting to each. This robust approach addresses the potential for multiple GPUs and provides informative output about physical and logical GPU counts.  This was a critical component in resolving unpredictable OOM issues in my past projects involving very large datasets.


**Example 2: Data Preprocessing for Efficient Memory Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data) # data is your input data
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
dataset = dataset.cache() # Cache data in memory if possible
dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Subsequent TensorFlow operations using the dataset...
```

**Commentary:** This example focuses on optimizing data loading and preprocessing.  `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` enables parallel processing of data transformations, improving throughput.  `cache()` stores the processed dataset in memory (if sufficient memory is available), reducing repeated processing.  `prefetch()` buffers data in advance, ensuring the model doesn't wait for data loading during training, which is particularly important for large datasets.  Proper use of `AUTOTUNE` allows TensorFlow to dynamically adjust the level of parallelism based on system resources, maximizing efficiency.  Ignoring these optimizations often results in performance bottlenecks and intermittent OOM errors, especially when working with high-resolution images or extensive datasets.  I found this crucial for processing terabyte-sized datasets.


**Example 3:  Checking CUDA Visibility and Version Compatibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA path: {os.environ.get('CUDA_PATH')}")

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    print("GPU is available.")
    #Further checks on CUDA version compatibility against TensorFlow could be added here.
else:
    print("GPU is not available.")

```

**Commentary:** This code snippet verifies the installation and availability of CUDA and checks for GPU presence. Printing the TensorFlow version and CUDA path helps in identifying mismatches between the TensorFlow version and the CUDA toolkit.  Checking if GPUs are visible to TensorFlow is a fundamental step before undertaking any GPU-accelerated computation.  Failure at this stage often points towards issues with CUDA driver installation or environment variables.  In previous projects, inadequate attention to this step resulted in TensorFlow defaulting to CPU execution, drastically slowing down training times.  Adding version checks against the documentation of the specific TensorFlow version can prevent conflicts.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and the NVIDIA deep learning SDK documentation provide comprehensive information on installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.  Consult these resources for detailed information on CUDA driver installation, environment variable setup, and advanced TensorFlow API usage, focusing on the memory management and performance tuning sections.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics such as TensorBoard for performance profiling and memory visualization is highly recommended for effective debugging of TensorFlow applications running on the RTX 3090.
