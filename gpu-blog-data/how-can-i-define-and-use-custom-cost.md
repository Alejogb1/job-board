Implementing custom cost functions within Keras, especially when utilizing R, requires a careful understanding of TensorFlow's backend and its interaction with R's data structures. I've encountered this frequently while developing bespoke deep learning models for time-series forecasting. Specifically, the challenge isn’t simply defining a function, but ensuring it integrates smoothly within the computational graph that Keras builds. The core of the issue is the necessity to operate on TensorFlow tensors, not R objects, while maintaining R’s function definition paradigm.

Fundamentally, Keras cost functions, often termed loss functions, are mathematical representations of the error between predicted and actual values. They guide the optimization process during model training. Customizing these functions permits us to tailor the learning process to specific problem characteristics that pre-built options might not adequately address. For instance, a dataset with imbalanced classes may benefit from a cost function that penalizes misclassifications differently across classes. Alternatively, a forecasting scenario might require a cost that emphasizes the direction of prediction over magnitude.

The difficulty in defining such custom loss functions in R-based Keras lies in bridging the gap between R’s functional environment and TensorFlow’s symbolic tensor manipulation. We cannot directly pass a conventional R function to Keras. Instead, the function must operate with TensorFlow tensors as input and output, which means operating directly within the backend. This requires two key steps: first, expressing the desired loss calculation using TensorFlow operations and second, encapsulating it in an R function wrapper that Keras can recognize during model compilation. These wrapper functions also need to be callable using `tf$keras$losses$Loss` class in order to be passed into Keras model compile method.

Let's delve into concrete examples. The simplest illustration is implementing a custom Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss, but with a twist – we’ll introduce an adjustable weighting factor. While Keras provides its own MAE, this demonstrates the principle.

```R
library(keras)
library(tensorflow)

custom_mae <- function(weight_factor = 1) {
  
  function(y_true, y_pred) {
    
    tf$reduce_mean(tf$abs(y_true - y_pred)) * weight_factor
  }
  
}

weight_mae <- tf$keras$losses$Loss(custom_mae(weight_factor = 2))

# Sample usage within a Keras model definition (example)

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 5) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1)

model %>% compile(
    optimizer = 'adam',
    loss = weight_mae
)
```

In the provided code, I defined `custom_mae` as a higher-order function, accepting `weight_factor` as an argument. It then returns a function that takes `y_true` and `y_pred` as input, which is how a custom loss function takes inputs. Inside this inner function, we’re using `tf$reduce_mean` and `tf$abs`, which operate on TensorFlow tensors, not directly on R objects. The key here is the `weight_factor`. This demonstrates how we can introduce custom hyperparameters into our custom loss functions. Finally, `tf$keras$losses$Loss` allows us to make the function callable during model compile.

Now, consider a more nuanced scenario. Suppose we're working with a multi-output model, but we want a specialized cost function that only considers the prediction of one specific output. Here’s how that could be achieved:

```R
custom_output_loss <- function(output_index) {

  function(y_true, y_pred) {

    y_true_subset <- tf$gather(y_true, indices = output_index, axis = 1L)
    y_pred_subset <- tf$gather(y_pred, indices = output_index, axis = 1L)
    
    tf$reduce_mean(tf$square(y_true_subset - y_pred_subset))
  }
}


specific_output_mse <- tf$keras$losses$Loss(custom_output_loss(0))


# Example multi-output model
model_multi <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 12, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 5) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 2)

model_multi %>% compile(
    optimizer = 'adam',
    loss = specific_output_mse
)

```

Here, `custom_output_loss` takes the output index as an argument. The inner function then uses `tf$gather` to extract the desired output based on the given `output_index` from both `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors, and then calculates Mean Squared Error on just that output. Again, wrapping with `tf$keras$losses$Loss` makes the function usable during compilation. This highlights the flexibility possible with the tensor manipulation capabilities of TensorFlow’s backend.

Finally, let's examine a more sophisticated example, which involves defining a Huber loss, a less sensitive alternative to MSE when dealing with outliers.

```R
custom_huber <- function(delta = 1) {
  
    function(y_true, y_pred) {

        error <- tf$abs(y_true - y_pred)
        
        smaller_error <- 0.5 * tf$square(error)
        larger_error <- delta * (error - 0.5 * delta)
        
        tf$where(error <= delta, smaller_error, larger_error) %>%
            tf$reduce_mean()
    }
}

huber_loss <- tf$keras$losses$Loss(custom_huber(delta=2))

# Sample model with huber loss
model_huber <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 5) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1)

model_huber %>% compile(
    optimizer = 'adam',
    loss = huber_loss
)
```

In this instance, `custom_huber` incorporates a conditional logic using `tf$where` to compute different error terms based on the magnitude of the absolute error. This clearly shows how custom loss functions allow for branching based on data characteristics, adding more model flexibility. Again, by passing the function to `tf$keras$losses$Loss`, it can be used during model compilation.

When venturing into custom loss functions, some considerations must be kept in mind. Firstly, always verify that your TensorFlow operations are compatible with the tensor shapes being passed into your custom loss function during training. Shape mismatches can cause cryptic errors. Secondly, avoid overly complicated or computationally expensive operations within the loss function. Since the loss is computed for every batch of data, optimizing performance here is crucial. Thirdly, thorough unit tests of the custom loss function are essential, preferably against equivalent implementations or toy examples. Test cases should check the numerical stability of the function and behavior near the decision boundary if there is a branching condition.

For learning more, review the TensorFlow documentation, especially sections dedicated to operations on tensors and the definition of custom loss functions. It is beneficial to study the mathematical definitions of commonly used cost functions in machine learning. Also, research best practices for numerical stability of loss functions when dealing with floating-point operations within tensor manipulations is beneficial. Furthermore, consider inspecting source code of example custom loss functions that may be present in GitHub repos of other open source neural network frameworks.
