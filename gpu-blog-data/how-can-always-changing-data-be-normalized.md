The core challenge in normalizing always-changing data lies not in the dynamism itself, but in managing the inherent trade-off between consistency and recency.  My experience working on high-frequency trading systems highlighted this acutely;  we needed real-time market data accuracy, yet maintaining referential integrity across constantly updating price feeds and order books presented significant hurdles.  Effective normalization in such scenarios necessitates a shift away from traditional, static schemas towards approaches that embrace temporal aspects of the data.

**1. Explanation: Temporal Normalization Strategies**

Traditional normalization techniques, such as Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) or 5NF, are predicated on a relatively stable data model.  They aim to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity within a fixed structure. However, with perpetually shifting data,  these approaches become unwieldy and ultimately inefficient.  Instead, incorporating time as a fundamental aspect of the schema becomes crucial.  This involves shifting the focus from representing the *current* state of data to tracking its *evolution* over time.

Several strategies facilitate this temporal normalization:

* **Snapshotting:**  This involves periodically capturing the entire dataset or relevant portions at specific points in time.  Each snapshot represents a consistent view of the data at a particular moment. This is analogous to taking a "photograph" of the database at regular intervals.  This approach is best suited for situations where complete consistency is prioritized over absolute recency.  The frequency of snapshots determines the trade-off between consistency and the latency in reflecting changes.

* **Versioning:**  This strategy tracks changes to individual records by assigning versions.  Each update generates a new version, preserving the history of modifications.  This approach is particularly well-suited for situations where understanding the evolution of individual data points is critical, such as tracking price changes or revisions to product specifications.  Efficient versioning typically requires specialized database features or careful implementation using techniques like temporal tables or change data capture.

* **Delta-based updates:** Rather than storing full records, only the changes (deltas) between consecutive states are stored.  This method is highly efficient in terms of storage, especially when dealing with large datasets where only a small fraction changes frequently.  Reconstructing the complete state at any point in time requires applying the delta updates sequentially.  However, this approach demands careful error handling and potentially complex algorithms for merging concurrent updates.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate these techniques using Python and a simplified representation of a financial data scenario.  Note that these examples abstract away database interactions for clarity, focusing on the core logic of temporal normalization.

**Example 1: Snapshotting**

```python
import datetime

class StockPrice:
    def __init__(self, symbol, price, timestamp):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.price = price
        self.timestamp = timestamp

snapshots = []

# Simulate data updates
snapshots.append([StockPrice("AAPL", 150.00, datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0)),
                  StockPrice("GOOG", 2500.00, datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0))])

snapshots.append([StockPrice("AAPL", 152.50, datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 1, 10, 30, 0)),
                  StockPrice("GOOG", 2480.00, datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 1, 10, 30, 0))])

# Accessing a specific snapshot
snapshot_time = datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 1, 10, 30, 0)
for snapshot in snapshots:
    if snapshot[0].timestamp == snapshot_time:
        for stock in snapshot:
            print(f"Symbol: {stock.symbol}, Price: {stock.price}, Timestamp: {stock.timestamp}")
        break

```

This demonstrates a simple snapshotting mechanism.  Each snapshot is a list of `StockPrice` objects, representing the market state at a given time.  Access to historical data is achieved by iterating through the `snapshots` list.


**Example 2: Versioning**

```python
import uuid

class StockPriceVersion:
    def __init__(self, symbol, price, version_id, timestamp):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.price = price
        self.version_id = version_id
        self.timestamp = timestamp

stock_data = {}

#Simulate updates with versioning
stock_data["AAPL"] = [StockPriceVersion("AAPL", 150.00, uuid.uuid4(), datetime.datetime.now())]
stock_data["AAPL"].append(StockPriceVersion("AAPL", 152.50, uuid.uuid4(), datetime.datetime.now()))
stock_data["AAPL"].append(StockPriceVersion("AAPL", 151.75, uuid.uuid4(), datetime.datetime.now()))

#accessing version history
for version in stock_data["AAPL"]:
    print(f"Symbol: {version.symbol}, Price: {version.price}, Version ID: {version.version_id}, Timestamp: {version.timestamp}")

```
This example uses UUIDs to uniquely identify each version of a stock price.  The `stock_data` dictionary stores the version history for each stock symbol.  Retrieving a specific version or the entire history is straightforward.


**Example 3: Delta-Based Updates**

```python
class StockPriceDelta:
    def __init__(self, symbol, change, timestamp):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.change = change
        self.timestamp = timestamp

deltas = []
base_prices = {"AAPL": 150.00, "GOOG": 2500.00} #Initial state

# Simulate delta updates
deltas.append(StockPriceDelta("AAPL", 2.50, datetime.datetime.now()))
deltas.append(StockPriceDelta("GOOG", -20.00, datetime.datetime.now()))

#Reconstructing the current state
current_prices = base_prices.copy()
for delta in deltas:
    current_prices[delta.symbol] += delta.change

print(f"Current Prices: {current_prices}")

```
This example focuses on storing only the price changes.  `base_prices` represents the initial state, and subsequent changes are applied sequentially to reconstruct the current state.  This is an extremely simplified example, omitting crucial aspects of concurrency handling and error management which are vital in real-world applications.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further study, I recommend exploring literature on temporal databases, specifically focusing on the functionalities of temporal tables and change data capture.  Consulting texts on database design and normalization principles will enhance your understanding of the underlying concepts and their limitations in dynamic environments.  Finally, examining works on data warehousing and ETL processes will provide valuable insights into managing large volumes of evolving data and ensuring its consistency.  These resources offer a comprehensive approach to handling the complexities of normalization within a constantly changing data landscape.
