TensorFlow Estimators, while deprecated in favor of the Keras API, remain relevant for understanding foundational TensorFlow concepts and offer a structured approach to model training, particularly when dealing with complex scenarios like weighted example training.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems heavily leveraged Estimators for their scalability and ease of distributed training, and I encountered weighted examples frequently in addressing class imbalance issues.  The core principle lies in leveraging the `input_fn` to feed weights directly to the model during training.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Standard TensorFlow training implicitly assumes all examples contribute equally to the loss function.  However, scenarios such as imbalanced datasets necessitate assigning different weights to examples based on their class or other relevant attributes.  Higher weights amplify the influence of certain examples, guiding the model to pay more attention to under-represented classes or crucial data points.  This is achieved within the Estimator framework by incorporating example weights into the `features` dictionary passed to the `input_fn`.  The model then uses these weights to calculate a weighted loss function, adjusting the gradient updates accordingly.  This ensures that the model's training process accurately reflects the relative importance of different data points. Critically, the choice of weighting scheme—whether it's inversely proportional to class frequency, based on domain expertise, or derived from other metrics—significantly impacts model performance and should be carefully considered.  Improper weighting can lead to overfitting or skewed predictions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Weighted Regression with `tf.estimator.LinearRegressor`**

This example demonstrates weighted training for a linear regression model. We'll use a synthetic dataset for clarity.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data with weights
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2*X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.5
weights = np.random.rand(100)  # Random weights for demonstration

# Input function with weights
def weighted_input_fn(features, labels, batch_size=32):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels, weights))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=100).batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

# Create and train the model
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column("x")]
estimator = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(feature_columns=feature_columns)

estimator.train(
    input_fn=lambda: weighted_input_fn({"x": X}, y, batch_size=32),
    steps=1000
)

# Evaluation (omitted for brevity, but crucial in practice)
```

**Commentary:** The key here is the `weighted_input_fn`.  It bundles features, labels, and weights into a single dataset. The `tf.estimator.LinearRegressor` automatically handles the weights during training by incorporating them into the loss calculation.  Note the use of a lambda function to create the input function dynamically.  The random weights are for illustrative purposes; in real applications, these would be derived from domain knowledge or data analysis.


**Example 2:  Weighted Classification with `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier`**

This example showcases weighted training for a deep neural network classifier.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Synthetic classification data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
weights = np.where(y == 0, 2, 1) # Weight minority class (y=0) more heavily


def weighted_input_fn(features, labels, weights, batch_size=32):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels, weights))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=100).batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

# Feature columns
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key="x", shape=[10])]

# Model creation and training
estimator = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    hidden_units=[10, 5],
    n_classes=2,
    weight_column='weights' # Explicitly define weight column
)

estimator.train(
    input_fn=lambda: weighted_input_fn(X, y, weights, batch_size=32),
    steps=1000
)
```

**Commentary:**  This example uses a `DNNClassifier` for a multi-layer perceptron.  Crucially, we explicitly define the `weight_column` argument in the `DNNClassifier` constructor to specify the name of the column containing weights in the input data.  This differs slightly from the regression example.  The weighting scheme assigns double the weight to the minority class (assuming `y=0` is the minority). This is a common strategy for handling class imbalances.


**Example 3:  Custom Estimator with a Weighted Loss Function**

For more control, a custom estimator allows defining a bespoke weighted loss function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def weighted_loss(labels, predictions, weights):
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=predictions) * weights)
    return loss

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # ... (model definition using tf.layers) ...
    predictions = tf.layers.dense(net, 1)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)

    weights = features['weights']
    loss = weighted_loss(labels, predictions, weights)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=params['learning_rate'])
        train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, tf.train.get_global_step())
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)

    eval_metric_ops = {'accuracy': tf.metrics.accuracy(labels, tf.round(tf.sigmoid(predictions)))}
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)

# ... (data generation and input_fn as in previous examples) ...

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn, params={'learning_rate': 0.01})

estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: weighted_input_fn({"x":X, "weights":weights}, y, batch_size=32), steps=1000)
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates maximum control by creating a custom `model_fn`. The `weighted_loss` function explicitly incorporates example weights into the loss calculation, enabling flexible weighting strategies.  This approach is advantageous when dealing with sophisticated loss functions or non-standard weighting schemes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (specifically sections on Estimators and custom estimators),  a comprehensive machine learning textbook covering loss functions and optimization techniques, and advanced resources on handling imbalanced datasets are highly beneficial for further study.  Understanding gradient descent and its variants is crucial for grasping how weighted examples influence the training process.  Familiarity with various regularization techniques is also valuable to mitigate overfitting issues that can arise from weighted training.
