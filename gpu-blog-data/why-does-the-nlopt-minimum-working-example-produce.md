The `RoundoffLimited` error in the NLopt minimum working example typically stems from the interplay between the optimizer's tolerance settings and the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic in representing real numbers.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-dimensional optimization problems within geophysical inversion projects taught me the critical role of numerical precision in achieving convergence.  The error doesn't necessarily indicate a flaw in the algorithm itself, but rather a situation where the optimizer cannot reliably distinguish between further improvement and the inherent noise associated with the finite precision of floating-point computations.

**1. Explanation:**

NLopt, a powerful nonlinear optimization library, employs various algorithms, each with its own sensitivity to numerical precision.  Algorithms like the Nelder-Mead simplex method, while robust, are susceptible to this issue when dealing with functions exhibiting flat regions or those where the gradient is ill-conditioned. In such scenarios, tiny changes in the variables produce negligible changes in the objective function value, falling below the machine epsilon â€“ the smallest representable difference between two floating-point numbers. The optimizer interprets this as reaching a minimum, even if a more precise solution might exist beyond the limitations of the machine's representation.  The `RoundoffLimited` error flags this situation, indicating that further optimization is unlikely to yield significant improvement due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.

Several factors contribute to the likelihood of encountering this error:

* **Function Characteristics:**  Functions with very flat regions near the minimum, or those with high-order derivatives near zero, are prone to this.  The optimizer struggles to accurately discern the direction of descent.  Ill-conditioned problems, where small changes in input lead to large changes in output, also amplify the effect of roundoff errors.

* **Optimizer Choice:** Different NLopt algorithms have varying sensitivities to roundoff errors.  The Nelder-Mead simplex method, known for its robustness in handling non-smooth functions, is more prone to this error than gradient-based methods like L-BFGS, which are more sensitive to noise but can be more efficient if the gradient is well-behaved.

* **Tolerance Settings:** The `xtol_rel` and `ftol_rel` parameters in NLopt define the relative tolerance for variable changes and objective function value changes, respectively.  Setting these tolerances too tight can force the optimizer to attempt improvements beyond the capabilities of floating-point precision, leading to the `RoundoffLimited` error.

* **Problem Scaling:** Poorly scaled variables can significantly amplify roundoff errors.  If the variables have drastically different magnitudes, numerical instability arises, making it difficult to determine the correct direction of descent.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of this problem and demonstrate potential solutions.  These are simplified examples but highlight the key concepts.

**Example 1: Nelder-Mead and Tight Tolerance**

```c++
#include <nlopt.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

double myfunc(const std::vector<double> &x, std::vector<double> &grad, void *my_func_data) {
    return pow(x[0] - 1.0, 2) + pow(x[1] - 2.0, 2); //Simple quadratic function
}

int main() {
    nlopt::opt opt(nlopt::LN_NELDERMEAD, 2); //Nelder-Mead
    std::vector<double> lb(2, -100.0), ub(2, 100.0);
    opt.set_lower_bounds(lb);
    opt.set_upper_bounds(ub);
    std::vector<double> x(2, 0.0); //Initial guess
    opt.set_min_objective(myfunc, nullptr);
    opt.set_xtol_rel(1e-16); //Very tight tolerance likely to trigger RoundoffLimited
    opt.set_ftol_rel(1e-16);

    double minf;
    try {
        nlopt::result result = opt.optimize(x, minf);
        std::cout << "Minimum found at: " << x[0] << ", " << x[1] << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Minimum function value: " << minf << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Result code: " << result << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::runtime_error &e) {
        std::cerr << "NLopt error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This example uses a simple quadratic function and an extremely tight tolerance, making it highly likely to encounter the `RoundoffLimited` error due to exceeding the floating-point precision limits.

**Example 2:  L-BFGS and Relaxed Tolerance**

```c++
#include <nlopt.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

//Same myfunc as before

int main() {
    nlopt::opt opt(nlopt::LD_LBFGS, 2); //L-BFGS
    std::vector<double> lb(2, -100.0), ub(2, 100.0);
    opt.set_lower_bounds(lb);
    opt.set_upper_bounds(ub);
    std::vector<double> x(2, 0.0); //Initial guess
    opt.set_min_objective(myfunc, nullptr);
    opt.set_xtol_rel(1e-6); //More relaxed tolerance
    opt.set_ftol_rel(1e-6);

    double minf;
    try {
        // ... (same as Example 1) ...
    } catch (const std::runtime_error &e) {
        std::cerr << "NLopt error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This example switches to the L-BFGS algorithm and utilizes a more relaxed tolerance, significantly reducing the likelihood of the error.  L-BFGS is generally less prone to this specific issue than Nelder-Mead.

**Example 3: Scaling Variables**

```c++
#include <nlopt.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

double myfunc_scaled(const std::vector<double> &x, std::vector<double> &grad, void *my_func_data) {
    return pow(1000.0 * x[0] - 1.0, 2) + pow(x[1] - 2.0, 2); //x[0] scaled
}

int main() {
    nlopt::opt opt(nlopt::LN_NELDERMEAD, 2);
    std::vector<double> lb(2, -100.0), ub(2, 100.0);
    opt.set_lower_bounds(lb);
    opt.set_upper_bounds(ub);
    std::vector<double> x(2, 0.0);
    opt.set_min_objective(myfunc_scaled, nullptr);
    opt.set_xtol_rel(1e-6);
    opt.set_ftol_rel(1e-6);

    double minf;
    try {
        // ... (same as Example 1) ...
    } catch (const std::runtime_error &e) {
        std::cerr << "NLopt error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

```
This demonstrates a scenario where one variable is significantly scaled differently than the other.  This can lead to numerical instability and may trigger the `RoundoffLimited` error even with reasonable tolerances. Rescaling the variables to have similar magnitudes is often a crucial step in mitigating such issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the NLopt documentation, focusing on the specifics of different optimization algorithms and tolerance settings.  A numerical analysis textbook covering floating-point arithmetic and its limitations would prove invaluable in understanding the underlying mathematical reasons for this error.  Finally, examining the source code of the NLopt library (if you possess the necessary programming expertise) can provide insights into the error-handling mechanisms.  Careful study of these resources will equip you to tackle more complex optimization challenges with greater confidence.
