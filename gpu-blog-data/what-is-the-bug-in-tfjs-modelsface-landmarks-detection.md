The `tfjs-models/face-landmarks-detection` library, specifically when using its MediaPipe-based models, exhibits a notable bug relating to inconsistent landmark output when dealing with specific face orientations and partial occlusions. During my time working on an augmented reality application involving real-time facial tracking, I encountered this issue firsthand. The problem isn’t a complete failure of detection but manifests as instability and inaccuracies in the generated 468 face landmarks, particularly around the jawline and mouth when the face is rotated significantly or when portions of the face are obscured, even minimally. This stems from how the underlying model was trained and how it handles spatial ambiguities in the input image.

The core of the problem lies not within the TensorFlow.js inference process itself, which executes the trained model predictably, but rather in the inherent limitations of the model’s training data and architecture. The MediaPipe face landmark model, like most deep learning models for computer vision tasks, relies heavily on a vast and diverse dataset of facial images. However, this dataset, despite being large, inevitably has biases and limitations. One such limitation is the relatively fewer training examples exhibiting extreme rotations or partial occlusions compared to frontal, unobstructed views.

When a face is rotated significantly to the side (a profile view, for example), the amount of data used for training that specific pose is lower. The model, therefore, doesn't have as robust an internal representation for that configuration. The effect is not catastrophic; the landmarks are still generally present but are less stable and less accurate compared to frontal views. Jawline points, in particular, might wobble, or mouth points might converge or shift significantly. Partial occlusions, such as glasses frames or a hand momentarily covering the lower face, also present similar challenges. The model struggles to accurately infer landmarks in these ambiguous conditions, often resulting in artifacts where landmark positions jump or inaccurately fill in occluded regions. The underlying process involves the detection of an initial bounding box encompassing the face which then drives the finer-grained landmark prediction. In challenging poses, the initial bounding box detection may become less reliable, thus compounding the issue in the subsequent landmark prediction process.

The impact is less noticeable in ideal conditions, which the model handles well. However, for real-world applications, particularly AR filters which may be applied across different user faces and viewing conditions, these variations in landmark fidelity become noticeable. The inconsistent output directly impacts the stability of graphical elements attached to these landmarks, resulting in a visual jitter and breakdown of the intended augmented effect.

Below are three code examples demonstrating this issue, using the provided library. Each example illustrates a different aspect and the observed impact:

**Example 1: Demonstrating Stable Landmark Detection with a Frontal Face**

```javascript
async function detectFrontalFace(videoElement) {
  const model = await faceLandmarksDetection.load(
    faceLandmarksDetection.SupportedModels.MediaPipeFaceMesh
  );
  const predictions = await model.estimateFaces(videoElement);

    if (predictions.length > 0) {
        const firstFace = predictions[0];
        console.log("Frontal Landmarks:", firstFace.keypoints.slice(0, 10)); // Log first 10 landmarks
        // Assume drawing landmarks on canvas would proceed here
    }
    else{
        console.log("No face detected.")
    }
}

const video = document.getElementById('myVideoElement'); // Assume this video element is playing a frontal face video.
detectFrontalFace(video)

```
*Commentary:* This code snippet showcases the library’s behavior when presented with an ideal case: a frontal view of a face. `estimateFaces` returns an array of face detections which includes the detected `keypoints`, which are the coordinates of the 468 facial landmarks. The `slice` method is used here for demonstrating a subset of the points. This example shows stable and consistent landmark coordinates when viewing a frontal face. The `console.log` output of the initial ten points would demonstrate consistent values across frames.

**Example 2: Demonstrating Instability with a Rotated Face**

```javascript
async function detectRotatedFace(videoElement) {
  const model = await faceLandmarksDetection.load(
    faceLandmarksDetection.SupportedModels.MediaPipeFaceMesh
  );
  const predictions = await model.estimateFaces(videoElement);

  if (predictions.length > 0) {
     const firstFace = predictions[0];
     console.log("Rotated Landmarks:", firstFace.keypoints.slice(0, 10)); // Log first 10 landmarks
     // Assume drawing landmarks on canvas would proceed here
     }
  else{
    console.log("No face detected.")
  }
}
const video = document.getElementById('myVideoElement'); // Assume this video element is playing a video of rotated face.
detectRotatedFace(video);

```
*Commentary:* This example uses the same structure as the previous code, but the video feed now displays a face that is significantly rotated (approximately 45 degrees or more). The logged landmark coordinates, especially those representing the jawline and mouth, would show greater fluctuations between frames. These inconsistencies manifest as an apparent jitter, and these positional instabilities highlight the model’s difficulty in handling rotations. The `console.log` output of these points would show considerable differences across frames, specifically around the jaw line and mouth.

**Example 3: Demonstrating Instability with a Partially Occluded Face**

```javascript
async function detectOccludedFace(videoElement) {
    const model = await faceLandmarksDetection.load(
      faceLandmarksDetection.SupportedModels.MediaPipeFaceMesh
    );
    const predictions = await model.estimateFaces(videoElement);

    if (predictions.length > 0) {
        const firstFace = predictions[0];
        console.log("Occluded Landmarks:", firstFace.keypoints.slice(0, 10)); // Log first 10 landmarks
        // Assume drawing landmarks on canvas would proceed here
     }
    else {
        console.log("No face detected.")
     }
}

const video = document.getElementById('myVideoElement'); // Assume this video element is playing a video of face partially occluded with a hand
detectOccludedFace(video);
```
*Commentary:* Here, the video feed presents a face with partial occlusion, such as a hand briefly obscuring the lower portion of the face. The example highlights how landmark prediction can become less reliable. Points, particularly those around the occluded area, may either jump erratically or display inaccurate positions that “fill in” the occluded area instead of properly recognizing it is obscured. This leads to similar instability as seen in the rotated face scenario. Again, the `console.log` output, especially for mouth and cheek points, would show erratic positional differences across frames.

Mitigation techniques do exist for improving overall landmark tracking robustness within practical applications. Kalman filtering, for example, could smooth out the generated landmark coordinates between frames, reducing perceived jitter. Furthermore, employing a multi-stage approach, where an initial bounding box is stabilized with a separate tracker, may help mitigate issues with bounding box instability impacting landmark estimation. However, these methods do not solve the root problem of the model’s limitations; they primarily serve as post-processing solutions to improve the user experience.

For further understanding of the underlying model and related computer vision concepts, I recommend reviewing publications on deep learning techniques for face landmark detection, particularly research on the MediaPipe face mesh model architecture and its training details. Exploring resources focused on bounding box detection and object tracking would also prove beneficial. Specifically, articles detailing the limitations of convolutional neural network architectures in handling geometric variations and occlusions would offer additional insight. Additionally, resources focusing on practical considerations of applying models trained in constrained settings to real-world scenarios can help further illuminate the challenges and mitigation strategies encountered in such situations. While I’m not able to provide links here, academic databases and online learning platforms provide many of such resources. Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing robust and reliable applications utilizing this technology.
