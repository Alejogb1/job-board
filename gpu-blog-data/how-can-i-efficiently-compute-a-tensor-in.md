Efficient tensor computation in PyTorch hinges on understanding and leveraging its underlying capabilities for automatic differentiation and optimized operations. My experience optimizing deep learning models has repeatedly shown that naive tensor manipulation often leads to significant performance bottlenecks.  The key is to minimize explicit loops and utilize PyTorch's vectorized operations, exploiting its inherent ability to offload computations to optimized libraries like cuBLAS and OpenBLAS.

**1.  Understanding PyTorch's Tensor Operations:**

PyTorch's strength lies in its ability to perform operations on entire tensors simultaneously, avoiding explicit Python loops.  This vectorization is crucial for performance.  Consider a simple element-wise addition:  performing this operation element by element in Python would be drastically slower than PyTorch's built-in `+` operator, which leverages optimized low-level routines.  This principle extends to all common mathematical operations, matrix multiplications, and more sophisticated functions.

Furthermore, understanding the data type of your tensors is critical. Using lower-precision data types like `torch.float16` (half-precision) can significantly reduce memory usage and improve computation speed on compatible hardware (GPUs supporting FP16).  However, reduced precision can also lead to numerical instability in some cases, requiring careful consideration and potentially necessitating the use of mixed-precision training techniques.

Finally, efficient memory management is paramount.  PyTorch employs automatic memory management, but understanding its mechanisms can help avoid memory leaks and fragmentation.  Techniques like using `torch.no_grad()` context manager within appropriate sections of code can prevent unnecessary computation graph construction and reduce memory consumption.  Pre-allocating tensors with appropriate sizes can also mitigate runtime allocation overheads.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Vectorized vs. Loop-based Computation:**

This example compares calculating the square of each element in a tensor using a loop versus PyTorch's built-in squaring operation.

```python
import torch
import time

# Tensor size
n = 1000000

# Generate a random tensor
x = torch.rand(n)

# Loop-based squaring
start_time = time.time()
x_squared_loop = torch.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    x_squared_loop[i] = x[i] * x[i]
end_time = time.time()
loop_time = end_time - start_time

# Vectorized squaring
start_time = time.time()
x_squared_vec = x * x  # PyTorch's vectorized squaring
end_time = time.time()
vec_time = end_time - start_time

print(f"Loop-based squaring time: {loop_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Vectorized squaring time: {vec_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Speedup: {loop_time / vec_time:.2f}x")
```

This code demonstrates the significant speed advantage of vectorized operations.  The `x * x` operation leverages PyTorch's optimized backend, resulting in much faster execution than the explicit Python loop. The speedup will be particularly noticeable with larger tensors.

**Example 2:  Utilizing `torch.no_grad()`:**

This example showcases the use of `torch.no_grad()` to disable gradient computation for a specific section of code, saving memory and computation time.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1000)

# Computation with gradient tracking
start_time = time.time()
with torch.no_grad():
    z = x + y
end_time = time.time()
no_grad_time = end_time - start_time

# Computation with gradient tracking
start_time = time.time()
z_grad = x + y
end_time = time.time()
grad_time = end_time - start_time

print(f"Time without gradient tracking: {no_grad_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Time with gradient tracking: {grad_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Disabling gradient tracking with `torch.no_grad()` significantly speeds up computation when gradients are not needed.  This is particularly beneficial during inference or when performing operations on intermediate results that don't require backpropagation.


**Example 3:  Memory-Efficient Tensor Operations:**

This example demonstrates how to efficiently compute a large tensor's element-wise square root using `torch.sqrt()` and avoiding unnecessary memory allocation.

```python
import torch

# Size of the tensor (adjust as needed)
n = 1000000

# Pre-allocate the output tensor to avoid repeated allocations
x = torch.rand(n)
x_sqrt = torch.empty_like(x)  # Pre-allocate with the same size and type as x

# Compute the square root in-place to minimize memory usage
torch.sqrt(x, out=x_sqrt)

#Alternative, less memory-efficient method
#x_sqrt2 = torch.sqrt(x) # This allocates a new tensor

# Verify the results (optional)
#print(torch.allclose(x_sqrt, x_sqrt2))

```

Pre-allocating the output tensor `x_sqrt` avoids the creation and subsequent garbage collection of temporary tensors during the operation, promoting memory efficiency. Using the `out` parameter of `torch.sqrt()` directly writes the result into the pre-allocated tensor, eliminating an extra memory allocation step.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation for comprehensive details on tensor operations and optimizations.  Familiarize yourself with the PyTorch's autograd system for a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation.  Studying examples of optimized deep learning models can provide valuable insights into efficient tensor manipulation techniques within the context of a larger application.  Finally, exploration of PyTorch's profiling tools can help pinpoint performance bottlenecks in your own code.
