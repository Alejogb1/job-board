The core issue with scaling errors impacting information criteria (IC) in `lmfit` stems from the inherent sensitivity of these criteria – AIC, BIC, etc. – to the magnitude of the likelihood function.  Improperly scaled data, or models producing likelihoods on vastly different scales, lead to inaccurate comparisons and potentially flawed model selection.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale spectroscopic fitting, where subtle scaling differences between datasets can dramatically skew IC values.  This isn't simply a matter of arbitrary units; it directly affects the penalty terms within the IC calculations.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

Information criteria, like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are used to compare the goodness of fit of different statistical models.  They balance model complexity (penalizing the number of parameters) against the likelihood of the data given the model.  The general form is:

IC = -2 * log-likelihood + k * penalty

where 'k' represents a penalty factor dependent on the specific IC (e.g., 2 for AIC, log(N) for BIC where N is the number of data points), and the log-likelihood is a measure of how well the model fits the data.  Crucially, the log-likelihood is directly influenced by the scale of the data and the model's predicted values.

If the data or model outputs are improperly scaled (e.g., one dataset is in nanometers while another is in meters), the log-likelihood values will differ significantly, not because of a superior model fit, but purely due to the scaling discrepancy.  This throws off the IC comparison.  Even subtle scaling issues, particularly in cases with high-precision data and complex models, can lead to incorrect model selections.  Therefore, ensuring consistent and appropriate scaling across datasets and model outputs is paramount for reliable IC-based model selection in `lmfit`.

Proper normalization or standardization of data before fitting is a crucial preprocessing step.  Standardizing to zero mean and unit variance often helps but isn't universally applicable.   The optimal scaling strategy depends entirely on the nature of the data and the underlying model being used.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the impact of scaling on IC values using `lmfit`.  I've intentionally kept them simple for clarity.

**Example 1: Unscaled Data Leading to Misleading IC Values**

```python
import numpy as np
from lmfit import Model, Parameters, report_fit

# Define a simple model
def gaussian(x, amplitude, center, sigma):
    return amplitude * np.exp(-((x - center) ** 2) / (2 * sigma ** 2))

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y1 = gaussian(x, 10, 0, 1) + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, 100)  #Data set 1
y2 = gaussian(x, 1000, 0, 1) + np.random.normal(0, 2, 100) #Data set 2 - different scale

# Fit the model to each dataset
model = Model(gaussian)
params = Parameters()
params.add('amplitude', value=1, min=0)
params.add('center', value=0)
params.add('sigma', value=1, min=0)


result1 = model.fit(y1, params, x=x)
result2 = model.fit(y2, params, x=x)


print("Fit 1 Report:\n", report_fit(result1))
print("\nFit 2 Report:\n", report_fit(result2))

```

Here, `y2` is simply a scaled-up version of `y1`.  However, the vastly different likelihood values due to the scaling will result in AIC and BIC values that do not accurately reflect the comparative goodness of fit. Both datasets follow the same underlying model, and the only difference is the scale of the amplitude.


**Example 2: Data Scaling using Standardization**

```python
import numpy as np
from lmfit import Model, Parameters, report_fit
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# ... (gaussian function definition remains the same) ...

# Generate data (same as before)
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y1 = gaussian(x, 10, 0, 1) + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, 100)
y2 = gaussian(x, 1000, 0, 1) + np.random.normal(0, 2, 100)


# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
y1_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(y1.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
y2_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(y2.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

# Fit the model to the scaled data
# ... (fitting process as in Example 1 but with y1_scaled and y2_scaled) ...

print("Scaled Fit 1 Report:\n", report_fit(result1))
print("\nScaled Fit 2 Report:\n", report_fit(result2))
```

This example demonstrates standardization using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`. By standardizing `y1` and `y2`, we bring them to a common scale, improving the reliability of IC comparisons.  Note that this is one of many possible approaches; the best approach needs to be tailored based on your prior knowledge of the data.


**Example 3: Model Output Scaling**

This example is less common but important.  If your model inherently produces outputs on drastically different scales depending on parameter values, the IC might again be unreliable.  This scenario might occur if you are fitting composite models or those involving exponents or other non-linear functions with potentially large ranges.

```python
import numpy as np
from lmfit import Model, Parameters, report_fit

# Example Model Producing outputs on different scales
def exponential_gaussian(x, amplitude, center, sigma, decay_rate):
    return amplitude * np.exp(-((x - center)**2)/(2*sigma**2)) * np.exp(-decay_rate*x)

# ... (data generation and parameter initialization) ...
#Let's assume decay_rate can influence scaling significantly.

model = Model(exponential_gaussian)
params = Parameters()
params.add('amplitude', value=1, min=0)
params.add('center', value=0)
params.add('sigma', value=1, min=0)
params.add('decay_rate', value=0.1) # small decay_rate

result_low_decay = model.fit(y1, params, x=x)

params['decay_rate'].value = 5 #Large decay_rate

result_high_decay = model.fit(y1, params, x=x)

print("Low decay Report:\n", report_fit(result_low_decay))
print("\nHigh decay Report:\n", report_fit(result_high_decay))

```

In this case, altering the `decay_rate` parameter significantly changes the scale of the model output. Comparing IC values directly across fits with different `decay_rate` values would be unreliable.  Careful consideration of model output scaling is necessary here and may require reparameterization or data transformation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of information criteria and their application in model selection, I recommend consulting standard statistical textbooks focusing on model selection and likelihood-based inference.  Furthermore, the `lmfit` documentation itself provides valuable information on the underlying fitting algorithms and the interpretation of results.  Finally, resources on numerical analysis and data preprocessing will aid in handling scaling issues effectively.  These resources will provide far more comprehensive background and detail than I can provide here.
