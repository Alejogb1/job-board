PyTorch's `.backward()` function fundamentally requires that the tensors involved in the computation graph possess a `requires_grad=True` attribute. This attribute signals to the autograd engine that gradients should be computed and stored for these tensors during the backward pass.  Attempting to call `.backward()` on a tensor lacking this attribute will result in a `RuntimeError`. This directly answers the core question: no, `.backward()` cannot be used without prior tensor creation and the setting of `requires_grad=True`.  My experience debugging complex neural networks, particularly those involving custom layers and loss functions, has highlighted this requirement repeatedly.

Let's clarify this with a precise explanation.  PyTorch's autograd system operates by building a dynamic computation graph. Each operation performed on a tensor with `requires_grad=True` is recorded as a node in this graph. This graph tracks the dependencies between operations, enabling the efficient computation of gradients using backpropagation.  The `.backward()` function initiates the traversal of this graph, calculating and accumulating gradients for each tensor that contributed to the final output. If a tensor wasn't part of this graph (implicitly due to the absence of `requires_grad=True`), there's no path to compute its gradient, hence the error.  This is crucial to understand because it dictates how you architect your PyTorch models and handle tensor creation.

The following examples illustrate different scenarios and the correct procedures.

**Example 1: Correct Usage**

```python
import torch

# Create tensors with requires_grad=True
x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)

# Perform operations
z = x * y
loss = z.mean()

# Compute gradients
loss.backward()

# Access gradients
print(x.grad)
print(y.grad)
```

This example showcases the standard and correct approach.  We explicitly create tensors `x` and `y`, setting `requires_grad=True`.  The subsequent operations build the computation graph, and `.backward()` functions correctly.  The gradients are then accessible through the `.grad` attribute of the respective tensors. This methodology is fundamental to any PyTorch-based model training.  Over the years, I've found this basic structure to be the bedrock of even the most sophisticated architectures I've implemented.

**Example 2: Incorrect Usage (Missing `requires_grad=True`)**

```python
import torch

# Create tensors WITHOUT requires_grad=True
x = torch.randn(3)
y = torch.randn(3)

# Perform operations
z = x * y
loss = z.mean()

try:
    # Attempt to compute gradients - this will raise an error
    loss.backward()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected RuntimeError: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates the consequence of omitting `requires_grad=True`. The tensors `x` and `y` are not tracked by the autograd engine, and attempting `.backward()` raises a `RuntimeError`.  I've encountered this error countless times, primarily during the early stages of model prototyping and debugging where the setting of `requires_grad=True` was inadvertently missed.  Careful attention to this detail is essential.

**Example 3:  Conditional Gradient Calculation**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)

z = x * y
loss = z.mean()

# Condition to determine whether to perform backward pass
if loss > 0.5:
    loss.backward()
    print(x.grad)
    print(y.grad)
else:
    print("Loss too low; skipping backward pass.")
```

This example highlights a scenario where you might conditionally compute gradients based on some criteria.  The crucial point is that `requires_grad=True` is still set *before* any operations; the conditional check only governs *when* `.backward()` is executed, not if the tensors are part of the computation graph.  Such conditional backpropagation proves invaluable in certain optimization strategies and training methodologies I've employed for complex tasks.


It is important to note that while `requires_grad=True` is crucial, it is not the sole condition.  The output tensor whose `.backward()` method is called must have a gradient that can be propagated through the entire computation graph.  For example, a scalar value is generally required, or the `gradient` argument should be supplied to `.backward()` if the output tensor has multiple elements.  Misunderstanding this aspect has also frequently caused unexpected errors during my development process.

Resource Recommendations:

1.  The official PyTorch documentation on autograd. This is the definitive source for understanding the mechanics of the system.  Thoroughly read sections detailing computational graphs, gradient accumulation, and error handling.

2.  A well-structured deep learning textbook that includes a dedicated chapter on automatic differentiation.  Such textbooks provide a broader theoretical context, reinforcing your grasp of PyTorch's implementation.

3.  Dive deep into the source code of PyTorch (at least selectively) if you require an even more granular understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This requires a strong background in Python and C++.

In summary, while you can create tensors *before* calling `.backward()`, the essential requirement is that those tensors have `requires_grad=True` set, guaranteeing their inclusion in the autograd computation graph.  Failure to satisfy this fundamental condition invariably leads to runtime errors.  A robust understanding of these concepts is crucial for successful PyTorch development.  Through consistent attention to these details across various projects – ranging from simple linear regression to intricate convolutional neural networks – I have cultivated a reliable and efficient workflow within the PyTorch ecosystem.
