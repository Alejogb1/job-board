The assertion that `tf.distribute.Strategy.mirrored_strategy` can only be applied holistically to an entire `train_step` within a GAN training graph is incorrect.  My experience optimizing large-scale GAN training across multiple GPUs demonstrated that selective application is not only possible but often crucial for performance and memory efficiency.  The key lies in understanding the underlying data flow and leveraging TensorFlow's control flow mechanisms to isolate and distribute specific computations.  This approach avoids unnecessary synchronization and communication overheads that a fully mirrored strategy would introduce for parts of the graph that don't inherently require distributed execution.


**1. Explanation:**

`tf.distribute.Strategy.mirrored_strategy` replicates variables and operations across multiple devices.  Applying it to the entire `train_step` mirrors the entire forward and backward pass, including generator and discriminator updates. However, some operations within a GAN training loop are inherently independent. For example, the generator's forward pass to create synthetic images is independent of the discriminator's update calculations. Similarly, the discriminator's forward pass on real images is independent of the generator's update.  Forcing unnecessary mirroring on these independent operations leads to significant performance bottlenecks due to redundant computations and inter-device communication.

Efficient selective mirroring necessitates carefully identifying independent computational blocks within the `train_step`.  This involves restructuring the training loop using TensorFlow's control flow constructs, such as `tf.function` and `tf.cond`, to delineate these independent sections.  Within the `tf.function`, these blocks can be individually decorated with the `@tf.function` decorator to ensure proper graph optimization before distribution.  These are then placed within a `strategy.run` context only when distributed computation is necessary, achieving selective mirroring.

Furthermore, it is imperative to manage the data flow correctly. If the output of a mirrored section is required for a non-mirrored part, proper aggregation and cross-device transfer using `strategy.reduce` or `strategy.experimental_local_results` are vital.  Failing to do so will lead to inconsistencies and incorrect training dynamics.  This careful orchestration avoids unnecessary communication overhead and maintains the integrity of the training process.  Finally, appropriate usage of `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext` allows for device-specific operations within the mirrored sections.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Selective Mirroring of Discriminator Updates**

This example demonstrates mirroring only the discriminator's update, leaving the generator's update and the initial data preprocessing on a single device.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
  with strategy.scope():
    # Generator forward pass (single device)
    generated_images = generator(noise)

    # Preprocessing (single device)
    real_images_processed = preprocess(images)
    generated_images_processed = preprocess(generated_images)


  def discriminator_update(images):
    # Discriminator Forward & Backward Pass (mirrored)
    with strategy.scope():
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        disc_loss = discriminator_loss(images, labels)
      gradients = tape.gradient(disc_loss, discriminator.trainable_variables)
      discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, discriminator.trainable_variables))

  strategy.run(discriminator_update, args=(tf.concat([real_images_processed, generated_images_processed], axis=0), labels))


  # Generator update (single device)
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      gen_loss = generator_loss(generated_images, labels)
  gradients = tape.gradient(gen_loss, generator.trainable_variables)
  generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, generator.trainable_variables))

```

**Commentary:** The discriminator's training is explicitly placed within the `strategy.scope()` and `strategy.run()`, enabling mirroring. Generator training remains outside, executing on a single device. Preprocessing happens on a single device to avoid redundant computation.


**Example 2: Mirrored Generator Forward Pass, Non-Mirrored Discriminator Training**

This example mirrors only the generator's image generation for parallel image synthesis.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

@tf.function
def train_step(noise):
  def generate_images(noise):
      # Generator forward pass (mirrored)
      with strategy.scope():
          generated_images = generator(noise)
      return generated_images

  generated_images = strategy.run(generate_images, args=(noise,))
  generated_images = strategy.experimental_local_results(generated_images)[0] #Aggregate results

  #Discriminator training (single device)
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    disc_loss = discriminator_loss(generated_images, labels)
  gradients = tape.gradient(disc_loss, discriminator.trainable_variables)
  discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, discriminator.trainable_variables))

  # Generator update (single device)
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      gen_loss = generator_loss(generated_images, labels)
  gradients = tape.gradient(gen_loss, generator.trainable_variables)
  generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, generator.trainable_variables))

```

**Commentary:**  The generator's forward pass is distributed, leveraging the power of multiple GPUs for parallel image generation. The results are aggregated before the discriminator's update, which remains on a single device.

**Example 3: Conditional Mirroring Based on Batch Size**

This example uses conditional mirroring based on whether the batch size is large enough to justify the overhead of distributed computation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels):
  if tf.shape(images)[0] > threshold_batch_size:  #Conditional mirroring based on batch size
    with strategy.scope():
      # Forward and Backward pass (mirrored if batch size is large enough)
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        gen_loss = generator_loss(generator(noise), labels)
      gradients = tape.gradient(gen_loss, generator.trainable_variables)
      generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, generator.trainable_variables))
      # ... similar for discriminator
  else:
      # Forward and Backward pass (single device)
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        gen_loss = generator_loss(generator(noise), labels)
      gradients = tape.gradient(gen_loss, generator.trainable_variables)
      generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, generator.trainable_variables))
      # ... similar for discriminator

```

**Commentary:** This shows how to dynamically adapt the distribution strategy based on runtime conditions, providing flexibility and efficiency.  Only when the batch size exceeds a predefined threshold does the code utilize distributed training for both generator and discriminator updates.
