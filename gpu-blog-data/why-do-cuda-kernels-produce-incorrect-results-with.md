Incorrect results from CUDA kernels at larger grid sizes typically stem from insufficient consideration of memory access patterns and potential synchronization issues within the kernel, exacerbated by the increased complexity of managing a larger number of threads.  My experience debugging such issues across numerous high-performance computing projects has highlighted three primary culprits: bank conflicts, insufficient shared memory usage, and race conditions.

**1. Bank Conflicts in Shared Memory:**

Shared memory, while offering significant speedups, is organized into banks.  Concurrent access to the same memory bank by multiple threads within a warp can lead to serialized access, negating the performance benefits and potentially corrupting data.  This problem becomes considerably more prevalent with larger grid sizes, as more warps concurrently access shared memory. The likelihood of multiple threads within a warp attempting to access the same bank increases proportionally with the number of threads and the memory access pattern within the kernel.  Furthermore, the impact of these bank conflicts is not always immediately apparent; subtle performance degradation might initially go unnoticed, only manifesting as incorrect results with larger datasets processed by larger grids.

Consider a simple example of calculating a running sum within a kernel.  If each thread accesses memory locations that fall within the same memory bank, the access becomes serialized.

**Code Example 1: Illustrating Bank Conflicts**

```c++
__global__ void runningSumKernel(int* data, int* result, int N) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256]; // Assume 256 threads per block

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[threadIdx.x] = data[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronization crucial for correctness

    int sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j <= threadIdx.x; ++j) {
      sum += sharedData[j]; // Potential bank conflict here
    }
    if (threadIdx.x == blockDim.x -1){
        result[blockIdx.x] = sum;
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, if `threadIdx.x` values accessed by threads within a warp lead to accesses within the same memory bank (e.g., all threads access memory locations divisible by 32), a significant slowdown and potential data corruption will arise.  The solution involves careful memory layout design.  Optimally, data should be accessed in a strided manner to avoid bank conflicts, or data structures like arrays of structs should be used to spread access across memory banks.


**2. Insufficient Shared Memory Usage:**

Using global memory extensively within a kernel significantly reduces performance.  Global memory access is much slower than shared memory access.  For larger grid sizes, this performance bottleneck becomes particularly acute, as more threads contend for access to global memory.  When insufficient shared memory is utilized, threads spend a disproportionate amount of time waiting for global memory access, leading to potential race conditions and ultimately incorrect results.  This issue often surfaces with larger datasets that exceed the capacity of efficiently managed shared memory.

**Code Example 2: Inefficient Global Memory Access**

```c++
__global__ void inefficientKernel(float* input, float* output, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    // Inefficient global memory access
    output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f; 
  }
}
```

This code directly accesses global memory for both input and output.  For larger `N`, the global memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. The solution involves reorganizing the kernel to maximize the use of shared memory.  A common technique is to load data from global memory into shared memory, process it locally within the shared memory, and then write the results back to global memory.  This reduces the number of global memory accesses significantly.


**3. Race Conditions and Synchronization:**

Race conditions emerge when multiple threads concurrently access and modify the same memory location without proper synchronization mechanisms.  With larger grid sizes, the probability of such concurrent accesses increases dramatically.  The absence of appropriate synchronization primitives like `__syncthreads()` or atomic operations can result in data corruption and unpredictable behavior.  This is a pervasive issue, often subtle and difficult to debug.

**Code Example 3: Race Condition in Atomic Operations**

```c++
__global__ void atomicRace(int* data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    // Potential race condition without proper atomic operation
    data[i]++; // Multiple threads could update simultaneously
  }
}
```

This code, without atomic instructions, results in a race condition as multiple threads try to increment the same locations concurrently. The correct approach necessitates employing atomic functions such as `atomicAdd()` to ensure thread-safe updates.  For more complex synchronization needs, explicit synchronization primitives, such as barriers, should be employed.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official CUDA programming guide and the CUDA best practices guide.  Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of parallel algorithms and data structures is crucial for designing efficient and correct CUDA kernels. Studying existing high-performance computing codebases and participating in relevant online forums can be beneficial in developing debugging strategies for large-scale CUDA applications.  Analyzing profiling data using tools like NVIDIA Nsight can help pinpoint performance bottlenecks and identify memory access patterns.  Finally, familiarity with memory management techniques and understanding the underlying hardware architecture is vital.
