The NVIDIA CUDA compiler, nvcc, possesses a degree of control over the target PTX instruction set architecture (ISA) version, but this control is not absolute and is subject to several constraints.  My experience optimizing CUDA kernels for embedded systems, where power efficiency and compatibility with older hardware were paramount, has shown that while directly specifying an arbitrary PTX ISA version isn't always possible, effective strategies exist to achieve compatibility with older architectures.  The key lies in understanding the interplay between compiler flags, target architecture capabilities, and the inherent limitations of the PTX specification itself.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The PTX ISA is a virtual instruction set that allows for code portability across different NVIDIA GPUs.  However, new GPUs introduce architectural improvements and extensions to the ISA.  While nvcc strives for backward compatibility,  it primarily optimizes for the latest architecture available.  Directly specifying an older PTX ISA version using a single flag doesn't exist.  The compiler's optimization process inherently takes the target compute capability into account, which dictates the maximum PTX ISA level supported. Attempting to force a much older PTX ISA version onto a compiler targeting a significantly newer architecture will likely lead to compilation errors or suboptimal performance, as the compiler may not be able to map the desired instructions to the target hardware.

The primary mechanism for controlling the PTX ISA level is indirectly achieved through the `-arch` flag.  This flag specifies the target compute capability, a numerical representation of the GPU architecture. Older compute capabilities implicitly restrict the compiler to generating PTX code compatible with those capabilities' ISA.  Therefore, selecting an older compute capability indirectly targets an older PTX ISA.  However, remember that this approach isn't about explicitly selecting a PTX ISA version; rather, it's about selecting a compute capability that supports a compatible ISA.  The compiler internally determines the appropriate PTX ISA based on the selected compute capability.

Furthermore, any advanced features used in your kernel (e.g., specific instructions introduced in later ISA versions) will restrict the lowest achievable compute capability.  The compiler will report errors if it encounters instructions unsupported by the target architecture.  Therefore, code optimization for older architectures requires careful consideration of the instructions used and often involves rewriting portions of the kernel to leverage only the features present in the older ISA.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Targeting Compute Capability 3.5 (Indirect PTX ISA Version Control):**

```cuda
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation and data initialization) ...
  myKernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(dev_data, N);
  // ... (memory copy back and cleanup) ...
  return 0;
}
```

Compilation: `nvcc -arch=sm_35 myKernel.cu -o myKernel`

Commentary: This example compiles the kernel targeting the sm_35 architecture.  This implicitly restricts the generated PTX code to the ISA level supported by compute capability 3.5.  Any attempt to utilize features introduced after 3.5 will result in compilation errors.  This is the most practical method for ensuring compatibility with older hardware.


**Example 2:  Illustrating Instruction Set Limitations:**

```cuda
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void advancedKernel(float *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    // This instruction may not be available in older ISAs
    data[i] = __fmaf_rn(data[i], 2.0f, 1.0f);
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation and data initialization) ...
  advancedKernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(dev_data, N);
  // ... (memory copy back and cleanup) ...
  return 0;
}
```

Compilation Attempt (for older architecture): `nvcc -arch=sm_20 advancedKernel.cu -o advancedKernel` (likely to fail)

Commentary: This example demonstrates a scenario where compiling for an older architecture (sm_20) will likely fail.  The `__fmaf_rn` instruction (fused multiply-add) might have been introduced in a later ISA version than supported by sm_20.  The compiler will report an error indicating the instruction’s incompatibility.


**Example 3:  Manual ISA-Level Optimization (Code Rewriting):**

```cuda
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void optimizedKernel(float *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    // Equivalent operation without __fmaf_rn
    data[i] = data[i] * 2.0f + 1.0f;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (memory allocation and data initialization) ...
  optimizedKernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(dev_data, N);
  // ... (memory copy back and cleanup) ...
  return 0;
}
```

Compilation: `nvcc -arch=sm_20 optimizedKernel.cu -o optimizedKernel` (should succeed)

Commentary: This example shows a workaround for the previous problem.  By replacing the `__fmaf_rn` instruction with an equivalent sequence of operations (multiplication and addition), we eliminate the dependency on a potentially unavailable instruction, enabling successful compilation for older architectures.  This process may require significant code restructuring and optimization to maintain performance.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide;  The PTX ISA specification;  NVIDIA's CUDA samples and examples;  Relevant chapters in advanced GPU programming textbooks.  Thorough examination of compiler warning and error messages is also crucial for identifying ISA compatibility issues.  Understanding the differences in capabilities between compute capabilities is paramount for targeted code optimization.


In conclusion, while precise control over the PTX ISA version isn’t directly offered through a single nvcc flag, targeting older ISAs is achievable by employing the `-arch` flag to specify older compute capabilities.  This necessitates understanding the instructions used within the kernel and, if necessary, rewriting sections of code to use only instructions present in the target ISA.  Careful consideration of the hardware limitations and thorough testing are essential for ensuring compatibility and achieving optimal performance on older GPU architectures.
