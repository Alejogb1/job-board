The most frequent reason for an LSTM failing to learn time-series predictions in PyTorch stems from improper data preprocessing and feature engineering, specifically concerning data scaling and stationarity.  In my experience debugging numerous LSTM implementations across diverse time-series datasets – from financial market indices to sensor readings in industrial applications – neglecting these aspects consistently leads to poor performance, regardless of model architecture hyperparameter tuning.


**1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**

An LSTM, like other recurrent neural networks, struggles with features possessing widely varying scales or exhibiting non-stationarity.  Non-stationary data means the statistical properties, like mean and variance, change over time.  This violates the core assumption of many machine learning models, including LSTMs, which implicitly expect relatively consistent statistical behavior across the training data.  The consequence is that the network becomes overwhelmed by the varying scales and trends, making it difficult to discern the underlying patterns.

Therefore, the first step is to ensure your time-series data is stationary.  This typically involves applying differencing (subtracting consecutive data points) or transformations like logarithmic transformations to stabilize the variance and remove trends.  The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is a valuable tool to statistically assess stationarity.  After achieving stationarity,  normalization is critical.  Methods like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling ensure all features fall within a similar range, preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.  Improper scaling can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients during training.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three code examples illustrating key aspects of data preprocessing for LSTM time-series prediction in PyTorch.


**Example 1: Data Loading and Standardization**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array of shape (samples, timesteps, features)
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1, data.shape[-1])).reshape(data.shape)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
data_tensor = torch.tensor(data_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)
```

This snippet demonstrates loading time-series data and standardizing it using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`.  Reshaping is crucial to ensure compatibility with the `StandardScaler`, which expects a 2D array.  The reshaped data is then converted to a PyTorch tensor for processing by the LSTM.  This ensures consistent scaling across all features, preventing features with larger values from dominating gradient updates.


**Example 2: Differencing for Stationarity**

```python
import numpy as np

def difference(data, order):
    diff_data = data.copy()
    for i in range(order):
        diff_data = np.diff(diff_data, axis=0)
    return diff_data

# Example usage: first-order differencing
differenced_data = difference(data, 1)

# Subsequently scale the differenced data
```

This function performs differencing of a specified order.  First-order differencing (order=1) subtracts consecutive data points. Higher-order differencing can be applied to remove more complex trends. The differenced data, now more likely stationary, should then undergo scaling, as in Example 1, before feeding to the LSTM.  The choice of differencing order needs careful consideration and may require experimentation to find an optimal level of stationarity without losing critical information.


**Example 3: LSTM Model Implementation with Proper Handling of Data**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) #Take the last timestep output
        return out

# Example usage:
input_size = data_tensor.shape[-1]  # Number of features
hidden_size = 64
num_layers = 2
output_size = 1  # Assuming single-step prediction

model = LSTMModel(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size)
```

This code demonstrates a basic LSTM model. Crucially, `batch_first=True` is set in the LSTM layer. This ensures the input tensor has the format (batch_size, sequence_length, features), aligning with the standard PyTorch LSTM expectation.  The output of the LSTM, representing the entire sequence, then passes through a fully connected layer.  Notice the selection of `out[:, -1, :]`, which extracts only the output from the last timestep; for multi-step ahead prediction, this would need adjustment.  Careful consideration of hyperparameters (hidden size, number of layers) remains critical but is secondary to data preprocessing.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of time series analysis, I recommend consulting "Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control" by Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel.  For a more practical, PyTorch-focused perspective, a good reference is "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.  Finally, a thorough grasp of statistical concepts related to time-series data (stationarity, autocorrelation, etc.) is essential and can be gained from any solid introductory statistics textbook.


In conclusion, while architectural choices and hyperparameter optimization undoubtedly play a role, the foundation of successful LSTM time-series prediction lies in meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering.  Addressing stationarity and scaling through techniques like differencing and standardization is crucial and often overlooked.  Addressing these issues, even with a relatively simple LSTM architecture, will generally yield far better results than focusing solely on sophisticated model variations.
