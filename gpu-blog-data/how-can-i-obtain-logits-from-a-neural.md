Obtaining logits directly from a neural network hinges on understanding the network's architecture and the specific framework used for its implementation.  In my experience building and deploying large-scale sentiment analysis models, the location of logits significantly depends on whether you're working with a pre-trained model or one you've trained from scratch.  The key lies in identifying the layer immediately preceding the final activation function, usually a softmax for classification tasks.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Logits represent the raw, unnormalized scores produced by the network before any final activation function is applied.  These scores are crucial because they reflect the network's confidence in each class *before* probabilities are calculated.  Unlike probabilities, logits can range from negative infinity to positive infinity.  This unbounded nature allows for a more granular representation of the network's internal decision-making process.  Accessing these values is essential for tasks like calibration, model analysis (e.g., identifying misclassifications or out-of-distribution samples), and certain advanced training techniques.

The methods for accessing logits depend heavily on the chosen framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) and the specific architecture of your neural network.  If you're using a pre-trained model, the framework's documentation is your first resource.  Most pre-trained models expose their intermediate outputs through well-defined APIs.  However, for custom architectures, you might need to modify the network's code to expose the logits layer explicitly.  This often involves creating a new output layer that simply returns the output of the penultimate layer.  If your model uses a softmax activation function at the output, you must ensure you're accessing the data *before* the softmax layer is applied.  Attempting to "undo" the softmax to infer logits is generally unreliable and can introduce numerical instability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to obtain logits using TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and a hypothetical custom framework (to illustrate general principles).

**Example 1: TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'model' is a compiled Keras model
#  and 'x' is the input data
logits = model.layers[-2].output  # Access the output of the second-to-last layer

# Create a new model to output logits only
logits_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=logits)

# Obtain logits
logit_values = logits_model.predict(x)

#The -2 index assumes the last layer is the softmax. Adjust as needed for your architecture.  Always verify the layer names and structure using model.summary().
```

This example leverages Keras' functional API to create a new model that outputs the activations of the layer before the final activation (assumed to be the softmax in this context).  The `model.layers[-2]` retrieves the output tensor of the penultimate layer.  Crucially, error handling (checking if the model actually has a softmax layer, etc.) should be added for production environments.  I've learned the hard way the importance of robust error checks!


**Example 2: PyTorch**

```python
import torch

# Assuming 'model' is a PyTorch model
# and 'x' is the input data
model.eval() #Set model to evaluation mode.  Essential to disable dropout and batchnorm.
with torch.no_grad():  # Avoid unnecessary gradient calculations
    output = model(x)
    logits = output[:-1] # This depends on how your model is defined.  Examine the model's output to ascertain exactly which part contains the logits.

# logits will now contain a tensor representing the logits.

```

In PyTorch, the approach differs subtly.  We leverage the `model.eval()` context manager to ensure the model is in evaluation mode, which is vital for consistency in obtaining logits, particularly when using techniques like dropout or batch normalization.  The exact method to extract logits depends on the specific model architecture.  Inspecting the model's output using `print(output)` is critical to identify the correct slice.  Failure to accurately isolate logits will result in incorrect analysis and subsequent errors.


**Example 3: Custom Framework (Illustrative)**

```python
class MyNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... network definition ...
        self.logits_layer = ... # Reference to the layer producing logits

    def forward(self, x):
        # ... forward pass ...
        logits = self.logits_layer.output  # Access logits
        probabilities = softmax(logits) # Apply softmax separately if needed
        return logits, probabilities #Return both logits and probabilities


# Usage:
network = MyNetwork()
logits, probabilities = network.forward(input_data)

```

This example, while employing a fictitious framework, highlights the core principle:  directly expose the logits layer within the network architecture.  This approach provides explicit control and offers superior clarity compared to attempting to extract logits post-hoc from a complex model.  This is especially important when working with models I developed during my research project on anomaly detection using variational autoencoders.  The explicit access facilitated comprehensive model analysis and improved performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The documentation for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and any other deep learning framework you employ are paramount.  Thoroughly understanding the structure of your specific neural network is crucial.  Reviewing tutorials and examples relevant to your architecture and task will greatly aid in understanding how to effectively extract logits.  Finally, consulting research papers on model calibration and explainable AI can provide additional insights into the utility and interpretation of logits.  Debugging techniques and understanding how to inspect tensor shapes and values within your framework are also essential skills.
