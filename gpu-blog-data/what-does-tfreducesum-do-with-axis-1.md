The behavior of `tf.reduce_sum` with `axis=-1` hinges on the fundamental understanding of NumPy-style array broadcasting and negative axis indexing within TensorFlow.  In my experience working on large-scale image classification models and recurrent neural networks, misinterpreting negative axis specifications frequently led to subtle, yet impactful, debugging challenges.  The key takeaway is that `axis=-1` consistently selects the last dimension of a tensor, regardless of the tensor's rank (number of dimensions).

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`tf.reduce_sum` is a TensorFlow operation designed to compute the sum of elements across specified dimensions of a tensor.  A tensor, in essence, is a multi-dimensional array. The `axis` argument dictates along which dimension(s) the summation occurs.  A positive integer `axis` value denotes the dimension index starting from zero (the first dimension).  However, a negative integer `axis` value, such as `-1`, refers to the dimension index counting from the end.  Therefore, `axis=-1` always targets the last dimension.

Consider a tensor `T` with shape `(d1, d2, ..., dn)`. Applying `tf.reduce_sum(T, axis=-1)` will perform the summation along the nth dimension (the last dimension). The resulting tensor will have a shape `(d1, d2, ..., dn-1)`.  Crucially, the summation collapses the last dimension, reducing its size from `dn` to 1.  If the original tensor is already one-dimensional, `axis=-1` will reduce it to a scalar representing the sum of all elements.

This contrasts with, say, `axis=0`, which would sum across the first dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape `(1, d2, ..., dn)`. The choice of `axis` profoundly impacts the resulting tensor's shape and its semantic interpretation.  I've encountered situations where improperly specifying the `axis` resulted in incorrect loss calculations during model training, a problem readily diagnosed by carefully examining the shape transformations during the forward and backward passes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  2D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
result_2d = tf.reduce_sum(tensor_2d, axis=-1)
print(tensor_2d)
print(result_2d)
```

Output:

```
tf.Tensor(
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]], shape=(3, 3), dtype=int32)
tf.Tensor([ 6 15 24], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
```

Commentary: The `tensor_2d` is a 3x3 matrix. `axis=-1` specifies summation along the last dimension (columns). The output `result_2d` is a 1D tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding row. The shape changes from (3, 3) to (3,).

**Example 2: 3D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
result_3d = tf.reduce_sum(tensor_3d, axis=-1)
print(tensor_3d)
print(result_3d)
```

Output:

```
tf.Tensor(
[[[1 2]
  [3 4]]

 [[5 6]
  [7 8]]], shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=int32)
tf.Tensor(
[[3 7]
 [11 15]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)
```

Commentary:  `tensor_3d` is a 2x2x2 tensor.  `axis=-1` sums along the last dimension (innermost dimension). The shape changes from (2, 2, 2) to (2, 2).  Each element in the resultant tensor represents the sum of elements within the corresponding 2-element inner arrays.


**Example 3: 1D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_1d = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result_1d = tf.reduce_sum(tensor_1d, axis=-1)
print(tensor_1d)
print(result_1d)
```

Output:

```
tf.Tensor([1 2 3 4 5], shape=(5,), dtype=int32)
tf.Tensor(15, shape=(), dtype=int32)
```

Commentary:  With a 1D tensor, `axis=-1` sums all elements, resulting in a scalar (a 0-dimensional tensor). The shape changes from (5,) to (). This behavior is crucial when dealing with single-feature vectors or calculating overall metrics.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive explanations of all TensorFlow operations, including `tf.reduce_sum`. Thoroughly reviewing the documentation and examples within is essential for mastering its capabilities.  Furthermore,  a strong understanding of linear algebra and multidimensional array manipulation (as exemplified in NumPy) is paramount for effectively utilizing TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions.  Exploring NumPy's `sum()` function and its `axis` argument can offer valuable insight into the underlying concepts. Finally, working through practical examples involving diverse tensor shapes and dimensions will solidify your understanding.  Focus particularly on how the shape transformations correlate with the chosen `axis` value.  This hands-on experience is invaluable in developing intuition and avoiding common pitfalls.
