Profiling Java applications with VisualVM can be resource-intensive, particularly with complex systems or when monitoring for extended periods. The overhead introduced by the profiler can skew performance measurements and, in extreme cases, destabilize the target application. Controlling the scope and duration of VisualVM's profiling activities is thus crucial for obtaining reliable data and minimizing disruption. My experience in diagnosing a memory leak in a high-throughput messaging service underscored the necessity of fine-grained profiling controls; I initially overwhelmed the test environment by attempting full-application, all-thread profiling, necessitating a more targeted approach.

Limiting profiling in VisualVM centers primarily on two dimensions: limiting the data collected (scope) and limiting the duration of collection. The scope limitation involves narrowing the focus to specific areas of the application. This includes selecting particular threads, limiting the monitored method calls, and filtering the data presented. Duration limitation concerns controlling when and for how long profiling occurs, encompassing the overall profiling session duration and the specific time window for capturing samples. The combination of these two strategies provides the necessary control to make profiling a targeted, rather than a brute-force, technique.

VisualVM provides several mechanisms to control profiling scope. First, instead of profiling the entire application, it allows the user to select specific threads for monitoring. This is particularly effective in multithreaded applications where only a subset of threads might be of interest or suspected to cause bottlenecks. Second, VisualVM offers filters for method calls. The user can define regular expressions to include or exclude specific method calls or package hierarchies from the collected data. For example, one might choose to profile only methods within a particular business logic module while excluding low-level library calls or third-party dependencies. Third, during memory profiling, one can select the object allocation types to be tracked, further refining the collected data by focusing on specific classes or packages. Finally, sampling frequency adjustments can also serve to limit collection; a lower sampling rate will result in less granular but also less intrusive data collection.

Here's a code example demonstrating how to structure Java code to facilitate more specific profiling:

```java
// Example: Targeted method calls for specific profiling

package com.example.profiling;

public class DataProcessor {

  private final AnalyticsService analyticsService;

  public DataProcessor(AnalyticsService analyticsService) {
    this.analyticsService = analyticsService;
  }

  public void processData(DataRecord record) {
    long startTime = System.nanoTime();

    performCoreProcessing(record);

    analyticsService.logProcessingTime(System.nanoTime() - startTime);
  }

  private void performCoreProcessing(DataRecord record) {
    // CPU intensive operation or potential bottleneck
    String formatted = String.format("Processed: %s", record.getData());
    // more code...
    try {
      Thread.sleep(50); // Simulate some work
    } catch(InterruptedException e){
      Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
  }

}

class DataRecord{
  private final String data;
  public DataRecord(String data){
    this.data = data;
  }
  public String getData(){
    return data;
  }
}

interface AnalyticsService {
    void logProcessingTime(long processingTime);
}
```

In this example, `performCoreProcessing` could be the primary area of interest for profiling. Within VisualVM, one could specifically target methods contained within `DataProcessor` or even just `performCoreProcessing`, filtering out calls to `AnalyticsService.logProcessingTime`. This focus can pinpoint performance issues specifically arising from the core processing logic and isolate potential bottlenecks. Without this filtering, the profiler might collect data from the whole application, potentially obfuscating the critical information.

The second aspect is limiting the duration of profiling. VisualVM's profilers can be started and stopped manually or configured to automatically stop after a certain duration. This provides control over the amount of data collected. The ability to start and stop profiling on demand allows one to focus on specific code paths, such as transaction execution, by triggering profiling just before a transaction begins and ceasing it immediately after. This transient capture allows us to profile critical sections more efficiently. Additionally, during memory profiling, using a "snapshot" rather than continuously tracking objects is a powerful method to control the amount of data to be inspected.

Here's an example showcasing how to use JMX MBeans to control profiling programmatically, simulating a control over starting/stopping via an external system:

```java
// Example: Using JMX to control profiling scope and duration

package com.example.profiling;

import javax.management.*;
import javax.management.remote.*;
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;

public class ProfilingController implements ProfilingControllerMBean {

  private boolean isProfiling = false;

    public ProfilingController(){
        try{
             MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
             ObjectName name = new ObjectName("com.example.profiling:type=ProfilingController");
             mbs.registerMBean(this, name);
        }catch (Exception e){
            System.err.println("Error registering MBean: " + e);
        }

    }


  @Override
  public void startProfiling() {
    if (!isProfiling) {
      System.out.println("Profiling started");
      // Logic to trigger profiling via VisualVM API (if available)
      // Otherwise, might indicate via console or external system
      isProfiling = true;
    }
  }

  @Override
  public void stopProfiling() {
    if (isProfiling) {
      System.out.println("Profiling stopped");
      // Logic to stop profiling via VisualVM API (if available)
      // Otherwise, might indicate via console or external system
      isProfiling = false;
    }
  }

    @Override
    public boolean isProfiling(){
        return isProfiling;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{
        ProfilingController pc = new ProfilingController();
        DataProcessor processor = new DataProcessor(processingTime -> System.out.println("Time taken:" + processingTime));
        DataRecord record = new DataRecord("Sample");
        Thread.sleep(2000);
        pc.startProfiling();
        processor.processData(record);
        Thread.sleep(2000);
        pc.stopProfiling();
        System.out.println("Finished");
    }

  // JMX MBean interface
  public interface ProfilingControllerMBean {
    void startProfiling();
    void stopProfiling();

    boolean isProfiling();
  }
}
```

This JMX example illustrates a system which can be used to control profiling from outside the target Java application. While VisualVM itself does not provide a direct JMX interface for controlling profiling, this code demonstrates how the profiling can be triggered/stopped on the basis of an external command. By leveraging custom JMX MBeans, applications can expose specific profiling controls that can be accessed by VisualVM or other JMX clients (not included in the example). It can be enhanced by writing code to signal to VisualVM to start/stop the profiler (if such functionality is exposed) or by combining it with JMX notification to signal when profiling has started/stopped. In practice, such programmatic controls provide a much more precise way to isolate and target specific performance-sensitive code sections. This level of control is essential when attempting to diagnose specific performance events.

Here's a final example showcasing how to limit profiling duration programmatically, without relying on manual starting and stopping in VisualVM.

```java
// Example: Programmatic limiting of profiling using timed capturing.

package com.example.profiling;

import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class TimedProfilingExample {
    private static final int PROFILING_DURATION_SECONDS = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();

        // Start profiling (manually in VisualVM) before this
        System.out.println("Profiling setup, start profiling now");
        Thread.sleep(5000);

        System.out.println("Starting to run the profiled code for " + PROFILING_DURATION_SECONDS + " seconds");

        scheduler.schedule(() -> {
            System.out.println("Timed profiling stop now");
        }, PROFILING_DURATION_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

      DataProcessor processor = new DataProcessor(processingTime -> System.out.println("Time taken:" + processingTime));
      DataRecord record = new DataRecord("Sample");
       for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
         processor.processData(record);
        }

        scheduler.awaitTermination(PROFILING_DURATION_SECONDS + 2 , TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        System.out.println("Program Finished");
    }
}
```

In this example, the profiling duration is indirectly controlled by the `PROFILING_DURATION_SECONDS` variable. The processing loop continues to execute, but the profiling data will be primarily generated from during the period before the `scheduler` has completed its task. This code requires starting profiling manually in VisualVM before the application begins to execute. The key idea here is to understand and delimit the timeframe when profiling data is meaningful, thus reducing the overall amount of data gathered. This allows for more targeted analysis, focused within a short time window, reducing the overall impact of profiling.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring several resources. For a deep understanding of JVM performance, examine books on Java performance tuning and garbage collection. For advanced JMX concepts, refer to resources on JMX and Java management APIs. Finally, while specific documentation on programmatic VisualVM control may be sparse, focusing on general JMX and performance monitoring APIs will prove invaluable. In conclusion, limiting profiling in VisualVM involves a combination of carefully chosen scopes, precise start and stop times, and a solid understanding of the application under observation. This level of control is not just desirable; it's often essential to glean accurate and actionable performance data.
