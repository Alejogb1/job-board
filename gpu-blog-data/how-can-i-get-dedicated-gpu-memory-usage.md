Obtaining precise dedicated GPU memory usage per Windows process requires navigating the complexities of the Windows Driver Model and the limitations of publicly available APIs.  While no single function directly provides this data, a combination of techniques, leveraging performance counters and potentially requiring kernel-level access (with appropriate caution and ethical considerations, naturally), can yield a close approximation. My experience working on a low-level graphics debugging tool for a proprietary game engine solidified this understanding.

**1. Explanation:**

The challenge stems from the nature of modern GPU scheduling.  The GPU driver, not the operating system directly, manages memory allocation.  While the OS can track overall GPU memory consumption, attributing specific amounts to individual processes is indirect. The driver employs sophisticated memory management strategies, including virtual memory, shared resources, and dynamic allocation.  DirectX and Vulkan APIs offer tools for monitoring overall GPU utilization and memory, but lack granular process-specific allocation information readily available to user-mode applications.

Performance counters offer a potential pathway.  These counters, accessible via the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interface, provide system-level metrics.  While not directly exposing per-process GPU memory allocation, they provide data on GPU utilization and memory usage which, when correlated with process activity, can be used to infer approximate dedicated usage.  The accuracy depends heavily on the workload and driver implementation.

Another, more complex, approach involves utilizing the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) to create a custom driver.  A carefully designed driver could potentially hook into the GPU driverâ€™s internal memory management routines, providing extremely precise data.  However, this method presents significant challenges, requires deep understanding of the Windows driver architecture, and carries inherent risks.  Improperly designed drivers can destabilize the entire system, hence should only be undertaken by exceptionally experienced developers.  I personally wouldn't recommend this unless absolutely necessary due to the elevated privilege required and the potential instability this approach introduces.

Finally, profiling tools often integrated into GPU development suites (such as those provided by NVIDIA or AMD) provide detailed GPU memory usage analysis, although again, this is typically aggregated rather than broken down precisely per process.  These are superior to working with WMI for accurate measurement, but usually have the caveat of being application-specific.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Utilizing WMI to Gather GPU Usage Metrics:**

This example utilizes WMI to retrieve overall GPU memory usage.  It does not provide per-process allocation but gives a system-wide perspective, which can be helpful contextually.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Management;

public class GPUUsageMonitor
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher("SELECT * FROM Win32_VideoController");

        foreach (ManagementObject obj in searcher.Get())
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Adapter Name: " + obj["Name"]);
            Console.WriteLine("Adapter Memory: " + obj["AdapterRAM"] + " MB");
            //Note: This is the total adapter memory, not per-process
            Console.WriteLine("Current Usage (may not be directly attributable to a specific process): " + GetGPUUtilization(obj["Name"].ToString()) + "%");
        }
    }

    private static int GetGPUUtilization(string adapterName)
    {
        //Implementation to get utilization (requires additional WMI queries, omitted for brevity)
        //This would ideally incorporate performance counters and requires more detailed logic.
        //This would give a overall GPU utilization - it is not directly process specific, as desired
        //Returning a placeholder for illustration only.
        return 50; 
    }
}
```

**Example 2:  (Illustrative) Hypothetical Kernel-Level Driver Snippet (Conceptual):**

This is a highly simplified, conceptual representation, illustrating the complexity of a kernel-level approach.  It's crucial to emphasize that this is **not production-ready code** and should not be attempted without extensive WDK experience.  Error handling, synchronization, and other critical elements are omitted for brevity.

```c++
//Illustrative and incomplete - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
//This is for illustrative purposes only and omits crucial error handling, synchronization etc.
//This example should not be interpreted as practical or safe.

NTSTATUS MyDriverEntry(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath) {
    // ... Driver initialization ...

    //Hypothetical function to get per-process memory usage (this would require deep interaction with the GPU driver, which is significantly more complex than indicated here)
    //This would require significantly more advanced knowledge of the WDK and the GPU driver architecture.
    auto memoryUsage = GetProcessGPUAllocation(ProcessId); //Placeholder function

    // ... further processing ...
    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}


//Placeholder function - actual implementation is extremely complex and depends on the specific GPU driver.
size_t GetProcessGPUAllocation(ULONG ProcessId){
    // Implementation heavily reliant on undocumented GPU driver internals and therefore highly risky.
    // Omitted for brevity and because detailed implementation depends on the underlying driver.
    return 0; // Placeholder for illustration only.
}
```

**Example 3:  Leveraging Profiling Tools (Conceptual):**

Many modern GPU profiling tools (Nvidia Nsight, AMD Radeon Profiler, RenderDoc, etc.) offer detailed insights into GPU memory usage during application execution.  Analyzing the profiling output might allow inferring per-process allocations (or at least a close approximation) based on timestamps and other correlated data.  However, such tools rarely expose raw data in a directly usable format for programmatic access.  The analysis would mostly be manual and require thorough understanding of the tool's output format.  Detailed illustration is omitted as it is specific to the chosen profiling tool.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation:**  Essential for understanding the intricacies of driver development.
* **Advanced Windows Debugging:**  A comprehensive guide to debugging techniques at the kernel level.
* **GPU Architecture and Programming books/documentation:** To fully understand GPU memory management.
* **Books on Operating System internals:** Understanding memory management is key to interpreting the data.  Specifically, knowledge of virtual memory techniques is crucial.
* **Performance monitoring and analysis tools documentation**: Gain insights into performance counters and their interpretation.


This response provides a foundational understanding of the challenges involved in obtaining per-process dedicated GPU memory usage. While readily available solutions are lacking, the combination of approaches discussed, if implemented cautiously and with a deep understanding of the underlying technologies, can provide valuable insights, though an absolutely precise measurement may remain elusive due to dynamic allocation and internal GPU driver optimization strategies.  Remember that kernel-level access should only be undertaken by experienced developers with a thorough grasp of the inherent risks.
