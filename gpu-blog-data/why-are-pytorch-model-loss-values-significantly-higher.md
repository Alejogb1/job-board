The discrepancy between training loss and loss observed immediately after loading a PyTorch model is a common and often frustrating issue, typically stemming from differences in the model's operational context pre and post-saving. Specifically, the primary cause is the unintentional persistence of model layers or operations in training mode rather than evaluation mode when saving or loading.

During training, models frequently employ techniques that modify internal state or introduce stochasticity, crucial for optimization but detrimental to evaluation. Dropout layers randomly deactivate neurons, batch normalization layers maintain running statistics, and certain data augmentation transforms modify input data on-the-fly. These mechanisms, while essential for learning and generalization, introduce variance and are inappropriate when the model is used for inference. When a model is saved in training mode, this state is inadvertently preserved and reactivated upon loading. Consequently, the loaded model, despite possessing the same weights, operates under these training-specific configurations, leading to inflated loss values compared to the expected performance in evaluation mode. It is not an issue of model corruption or weight decay. The weights are maintained; it’s the runtime environment that is amiss.

The most immediate solution involves explicitly setting the model to evaluation mode before any inference or loss calculation after loading. This switches off dropout, batch norm, and other training specific mechanisms. This transformation is critical for obtaining reliable post-load loss values comparable to those observed during the final stages of training.

Here's the first code example demonstrating a common but flawed saving and loading procedure:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.batchnorm = nn.BatchNorm1d(1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.dropout(x) # Dropout during training
        x = self.batchnorm(x) # BatchNorm during training
        return self.linear(x)

# Training loop (simplified)
model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(1, 1)

model.train() # Set the model to training mode
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(dummy_input)
    loss = criterion(output, dummy_target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Training Loss: {loss.item()}") # Loss at end of training

# Save the model (flawed, as still in train mode)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")

# Load the model (flawed example, will produce inflated loss)
loaded_model = SimpleModel()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))

loaded_output = loaded_model(dummy_input)
loaded_loss = criterion(loaded_output, dummy_target)
print(f"Loaded Model Loss: {loaded_loss.item()}") # Loss after loading (often higher than the training loss)
```

In this first example, the model is saved while still in training mode, causing the dropout and batchnorm layers to operate using training distributions when the loaded model is used. The loaded model’s loss, despite having the same weights, will almost certainly be much higher. Notice, there was no setting to evaluation mode before saving. The model was implicitly saved in ‘train’ mode. Likewise, the loaded model operates in ‘train’ mode by default unless explicitly set to ‘eval’.

The following code illustrates the correct way to switch a model into evaluation mode after loading:

```python
# Load the model correctly
loaded_model = SimpleModel()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))

loaded_model.eval() # Crucial step: set to evaluation mode

with torch.no_grad(): # Disable gradient tracking during evaluation
    loaded_output = loaded_model(dummy_input)
    loaded_loss = criterion(loaded_output, dummy_target)

print(f"Loaded Model Loss (Correct): {loaded_loss.item()}") # Loss should be similar to training loss
```

By calling `loaded_model.eval()`, I instruct PyTorch to set the model’s layers to operate in evaluation mode. Batchnorm layers will not update statistics, and dropout is effectively switched off. The addition of `torch.no_grad()` removes the unnecessary overhead of calculating gradients during inference, further enhancing efficiency during post-load evaluation. Crucially, after this change, the loss output from the loaded model will more closely match the training loss value as it is now operating in the environment of inference, not the environment of training.

Sometimes, these discrepancies are not only introduced by explicit training layers. In particular, when working with libraries like Hugging Face, models can possess attributes that control model behavior such as `training` or `is_training` which must also be correctly set after loading. When these attributes are missed the model will often produce unexpected results. The code below demonstrates this common pitfall:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Load a model, commonly from Hugging Face
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)
dummy_input = torch.randint(0, 2000, (1, 512))

# Model is in training mode by default
output = model(dummy_input, labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (1,)).reshape(1,1))
train_loss = output.loss
print(f"Hugging Face train Loss: {train_loss.item()}")

torch.save(model.state_dict(), "hf_model.pth")

# Load the model
loaded_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("hf_model.pth"))
output = loaded_model(dummy_input, labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (1,)).reshape(1,1))
loss = output.loss
print(f"Hugging Face loaded Loss: {loss.item()}")

# Proper loading process for complex models
loaded_model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    output = loaded_model(dummy_input, labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (1,)).reshape(1,1))
    eval_loss = output.loss

print(f"Hugging Face eval Loss: {eval_loss.item()}")
```

This last example highlights that even when working with highly optimized and streamlined libraries the same principles apply. Failure to set to ‘eval’ before inference will cause significant discrepancies in the loss output and the model may also provide unexpected results during inference. In this case the Hugging Face model is saved implicitly in training mode, and reloads implicitly into training mode; only after explicitly calling `eval()` does the loss begin to reflect values similar to those observed during training.

In summary, discrepancies in loss values after loading a PyTorch model are overwhelmingly attributable to the model being loaded and operated in training mode instead of evaluation mode, primarily through incorrectly maintaining state such as dropout or batch normalization. This issue applies across different model implementations, whether explicitly defined or from more complex, high-level libraries. The solution is consistently to invoke the `.eval()` method after loading a model to avoid unexpected behavior. Additionally, using a `torch.no_grad()` context is a useful practice to eliminate unnecessary gradient calculations during inference, increasing efficiency.

For further understanding of model states in PyTorch, it’s recommended to consult the official documentation on `torch.nn.Module.train()` and `torch.nn.Module.eval()`. Research papers that discuss the impact of dropout and batch normalization on training vs. inference, including the original publications of both techniques, can also deepen comprehension. Resources that detail the implementation of these techniques in frameworks, such as the PyTorch documentation or tutorials, can also prove to be highly informative. Finally, exploring community forums and open-source repositories can showcase real-world use cases and help troubleshoot this issue in specific applications.
