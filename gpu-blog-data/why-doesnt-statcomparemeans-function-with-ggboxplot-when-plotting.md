The core issue lies in the data structure expectation of `stat_compare_means()` in `ggpubr` versus the typical output structure when plotting multiple y-values with `ggboxplot` from `ggplot2`. I've encountered this limitation often during my years analyzing experimental data, particularly when dealing with multiple response variables across the same experimental conditions. `ggboxplot` is designed to effectively visualize the distribution of one or more y-values given a single x-value; however, `stat_compare_means()`, by default, anticipates a single y-value against a grouping variable for statistical comparisons. The inherent mismatch arises because `stat_compare_means()` calculates pairwise comparisons based on the assumption of a single dependent variable, requiring a specific data format that doesn't align with how `ggboxplot` handles stacked y-values directly.

Specifically, when you provide `ggboxplot()` with multiple columns to represent distinct y-variables—say, `y = c("y1", "y2", "y3")`—the plot displays these values side-by-side or as facets, but the data itself internally remains structured in a “long” format. This long format typically involves a grouping variable indicating which y-value a given point is associated with, as a single observation can only have a single value for a dependent variable. `stat_compare_means()` operates on data in a format where each comparison is applied to the dependent variable within specific groups, often represented by an x-value. When `ggboxplot()` is provided with a list of y-values, `stat_compare_means()` doesn't see a consistent dependent variable across different groups – which is implied by the different y-values provided, even when grouped by x. The function, therefore, doesn't know which comparisons are meaningful, or indeed, how to even perform the comparison of multiple y-values within the same x variable.

To illustrate, consider this basic scenario of generating a boxplot of multiple y variables.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 50),
  y1 = rnorm(150, mean = 5, sd = 2),
  y2 = rnorm(150, mean = 10, sd = 3),
  y3 = rnorm(150, mean = 15, sd = 4)
)

# Incorrect application of stat_compare_means
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = c(y1, y2, y3))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_compare_means() # This will fail to generate the intended result
```

In this example, `ggplot` does render the boxplots correctly by taking y as a list of variables, but `stat_compare_means()` fails because it doesn't know how to compare y1, y2, and y3 simultaneously. It will not show you p-values between the 'A' groups across the y variables. This is not the way `stat_compare_means()` is intended to be used, as it is designed for single y values grouped on an x-axis, but not for x axis groups across different y variables.

The resolution requires reshaping the data from "wide" to "long" format, explicitly creating a column representing the name of the y-variable and the associated y-value, thus making it a single y variable. This allows `stat_compare_means()` to correctly perform the comparisons based on the grouping of the data. Here’s an example of how to implement the correct structuring to use `stat_compare_means()`:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyr) # Used for the 'pivot_longer' function

data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 50),
  y1 = rnorm(150, mean = 5, sd = 2),
  y2 = rnorm(150, mean = 10, sd = 3),
  y3 = rnorm(150, mean = 15, sd = 4)
)

data_long <- pivot_longer(data, cols = starts_with("y"),
                         names_to = "y_variable", values_to = "y_value")


# Correct application with data in long format
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = x, y = y_value, fill=y_variable)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
    stat_compare_means(aes(group = y_variable), method = "t.test", label = "p.signif") +
    facet_grid(. ~ y_variable)
```

Here, `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package converts the data into long format. The result is a data structure that `stat_compare_means()` understands. Specifically, `y_value` represents a single continuous dependent variable, and `y_variable` represents the groups we wish to compare. The `aes(group = y_variable)` argument within `stat_compare_means()` specifies that pairwise comparisons are to be calculated within each group of the `y_variable`, while the `facet_grid(. ~ y_variable)` breaks out the different y variables into their own boxes. Critically, `stat_compare_means` *must* have the grouping variable specified as part of the aesthetics to understand that you wish to compare based on the y variables. Without it, it would compare on 'x' only, which is not the desired result.

It's important to note that you may need to be more specific about the comparisons you wish to perform between the different y variables, as a statistical test on different variables may not be desirable. This might necessitate additional modifications using facet grids for multiple x variables, or potentially adding more grouped variables within the `aes()` call in `stat_compare_means()`. You can also specify specific comparisons with the `comparisons` argument of `stat_compare_means()`. This allows more granular control over what is tested.

Consider another scenario where you only want to test comparisons within each 'x' group of the three y variables:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyr)

data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 50),
  y1 = rnorm(150, mean = 5, sd = 2),
  y2 = rnorm(150, mean = 10, sd = 3),
  y3 = rnorm(150, mean = 15, sd = 4)
)

data_long <- pivot_longer(data, cols = starts_with("y"),
                         names_to = "y_variable", values_to = "y_value")


# Correct application with specified comparisons within x
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = x, y = y_value, color=y_variable)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    stat_compare_means(aes(group = y_variable), method = "t.test", label = "p.signif",
    comparisons = list(c("y1", "y2"), c("y1", "y3"), c("y2", "y3"))) +
    facet_grid(. ~ x)
```

In this case, we have performed statistical testing within each 'x' group across all y variables, but note that the p-values are being computed between groups of 'y_variable', not against groups of 'x'. This is also done with facet grids.

For further exploration, I would recommend examining the documentation for `ggplot2`, specifically the section on data manipulation, and familiarizing yourself with the `tidyr` package for reshaping data. The `ggpubr` documentation provides detailed information about the `stat_compare_means()` function, including how to customize comparisons and adjust the significance annotations. Books on statistical graphics and data visualization, which cover principles of data preparation for plotting and analysis, can provide deeper understanding. Practicing with different scenarios, particularly the restructuring of data from wide to long, will greatly enhance proficiency with these packages.
