I have frequently observed situations where fast.ai, despite being designed for GPU acceleration, appears to run computations on the CPU. The underlying reason rarely stems from a deficiency within the library itself, but rather from configuration or environmental issues that prevent the PyTorch backend from correctly detecting and utilizing the available GPU. This misdirection can manifest even with a seemingly valid CUDA installation and functioning drivers.

The fast.ai library relies on PyTorch for its deep learning operations, and consequently, its ability to leverage a GPU is contingent upon PyTorch recognizing a suitable CUDA-enabled device. The most common cause of the failure to use the GPU centers around the incorrect installation of either PyTorch or its associated CUDA toolkit. The PyTorch installation itself must be built against the specific CUDA toolkit that aligns with your driver version and, importantly, the hardware architecture of your GPU. For example, a PyTorch installation built with CUDA 11.8 will not function properly if only CUDA 12.2 is installed, even if you have a compatible GPU.

Another frequent issue is the presence of multiple installations of PyTorch or CUDA tools, leading to path conflicts. System environment variables, like `CUDA_HOME`, `PATH`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` if on Linux, can point to outdated, incompatible or nonexistent installation folders. Incorrect configuration results in PyTorch being unable to find the necessary CUDA libraries, thus reverting to CPU computations. Furthermore, if the Python interpreter is activated inside a virtual environment, the PyTorch installation and the environment must be explicitly configured to use the CUDA libraries on the system. This is because virtual environments by default are isolated and do not share the system-wide paths.

Finally, seemingly less prevalent but still a contributing factor is the allocation of system resources. If another process is heavily consuming GPU memory, fast.ai might be unable to allocate sufficient resources to perform calculations effectively and may also revert to the CPU. In such cases, resource management becomes critical.

Let me illustrate with examples how one could diagnose the issue, and what configurations may be corrected. The first piece of code checks the current PyTorch installation status regarding CUDA availability:

```python
import torch
print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"CUDA device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    print(f"CUDA device count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
    print(f"CUDA device properties: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0)}")
```

Executing this code provides valuable diagnostic information. If “CUDA available: False” is returned, it immediately indicates that PyTorch is not properly configured to utilize CUDA. This confirms a fundamental problem, possibly one of those I outlined. This result requires revisiting the PyTorch installation and verifying all system environment configurations. The printouts in the `if` block, when 'True' is returned, will detail GPU information, device names and properties. Even when CUDA is available, ensuring that only one GPU is identified and used is essential, since PyTorch may use the integrated graphics card if the dedicated one isn't specified correctly.

The second code example focuses on specifying the CUDA device using fast.ai functions when CUDA is indeed reported as available. This prevents accidentally performing computations on a less efficient device.

```python
import fastai
from fastai.vision.all import *

def check_gpu_use():
    print(f"Fastai Version: {fastai.__version__}")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print("CUDA is available. Setting the device to GPU.")
        torch.cuda.set_device(0) # Force to use the first GPU device if it is not automatically selected
        device = torch.device("cuda")
    else:
        print("CUDA is not available. Falling back to CPU.")
        device = torch.device("cpu")
    
    print(f"Current device: {device}")
    return device


device = check_gpu_use()

# Sample data
path = untar_data(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, valid='valid', item_tfms=Resize(28), bs=64, device=device)
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)

# Test with a small batch
batch = dls.one_batch()
print(f"Data is on device: {batch[0].device}")
output = learn.model(batch[0])
print(f"Output is on device: {output.device}")
```

This code segment defines a function, `check_gpu_use()`, which first confirms the availability of CUDA, and then, if it is available, uses `torch.cuda.set_device(0)` to explicitly instruct PyTorch to operate on the first identified GPU. The `ImageDataLoaders` and the CNN learner model is created with a `device` parameter indicating the desired device to use for computations. Furthermore, the code performs a forward pass with a small batch of data and displays the devices where the data and model are located. If “Output is on device: cuda:0” and “Data is on device: cuda:0” are shown, then the data and computation are taking place on the designated GPU as intended. If the `device` property is still reporting "cpu" in any of these instances after the initialization process, despite `torch.cuda.is_available()` returning `True`,  then the issue is likely related to resource constraints or incorrect CUDA device selection on the system level outside of python. The issue might be that another GPU process took over all of the resources on the selected device.

The final code example provides a way to examine and set the global environment variables that PyTorch (and CUDA) use to find the appropriate libraries. While this does not alter the install, inspecting and possibly correcting path variables that may not be correctly set may alleviate further issues, especially with multiple CUDA versions.

```python
import os
import torch

def print_env_info():
  print("Current CUDA Environment Variables:")
  for var in ["CUDA_HOME", "PATH", "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]:
    if var in os.environ:
      print(f"{var}: {os.environ[var]}")
    else:
      print(f"{var} is not set.")

def set_cuda_paths(cuda_path):
    if not cuda_path:
      return
    os.environ["CUDA_HOME"] = cuda_path
    if "PATH" in os.environ:
      os.environ["PATH"] = f"{cuda_path}/bin:{os.environ['PATH']}"
    else:
        os.environ["PATH"] = f"{cuda_path}/bin"
    if "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" in os.environ:
       os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]=f"{cuda_path}/lib64:{os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']}"
    else:
       os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]=f"{cuda_path}/lib64"
    print("CUDA environment variables updated.")


print_env_info()
# Specify your CUDA installation path to correct settings, if needed
# Example:  set_cuda_paths("/usr/local/cuda-11.8")
print_env_info()
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"Current GPU Device: {torch.cuda.current_device()}")
    print(f"Number of Available GPUs: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
    print(f"GPU Device Name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")

```

The `print_env_info` function displays relevant environment variables that are crucial for CUDA and PyTorch to function correctly.  The `set_cuda_paths` function allows one to explicitly update these variables to the correct CUDA location (replace “/usr/local/cuda-11.8” in example with the actual location), should the need arise. Often, environment variables are set correctly after installation. However, if there are multiple CUDA installations, these variables can be set incorrectly or point to an older installation. After running the function, calling `print_env_info` again is advisable to check that the updated paths appear correctly. Although these changes do not persist outside the current python process or script, they provide a quick way to test the setup before system-level changes are made. Examining and correctly setting system paths may mitigate a large number of problems with PyTorch’s CUDA backend. This example will only be useful if CUDA is installed correctly but not found by python due to incorrect paths, as per previous discussion. This example assumes linux or macOS. For windows, the correct locations would use backslashes. The appropriate environment variables to inspect are `CUDA_PATH`, `PATH`, and `NVCUDAPATH`.

To further resolve this type of problem, I would suggest consulting the official PyTorch installation documentation. The documentation provides detailed instructions on ensuring a compatible PyTorch/CUDA installation and environment configuration. Additionally, the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation can be invaluable when investigating driver or low-level issues with your graphics card setup. Examining your fast.ai and PyTorch documentation may reveal specific requirements or system configurations that are necessary for correct GPU usage. Finally, searching online forums where other users have encountered similar errors may yield further insights on your particular configuration or hardware.
