Loading a TensorFlow 1.x `.pb` file for inference within TensorFlow 2 requires a specific approach due to the significant architectural changes between the two versions.  The key fact to remember is that TensorFlow 2 fundamentally shifted away from the `tf.Session()` paradigm central to the graph-based execution model of TensorFlow 1.x.  My experience porting several large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x to a TensorFlow 2.x inference pipeline highlights the necessity of understanding this shift.  Directly attempting to load a `.pb` file using TensorFlow 2's eager execution mode will fail.  The solution lies in leveraging TensorFlow's `SavedModel` format, or through a careful reconstruction of the graph.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.x models were defined as static computation graphs, serialized into `.pb` files.  These graphs encapsulated the model's architecture and weights.  TensorFlow 2, in contrast, defaults to eager execution, where operations are executed immediately.  To bridge this gap, one must convert the `.pb` file into a format compatible with TensorFlow 2's inference capabilities.  The most straightforward approach involves converting the `.pb` file into a `SavedModel`.  This involves loading the graph from the `.pb` file, identifying input and output tensors, and then exporting the model as a `SavedModel`.  Alternatively, if the `.pb` file is relatively small and well-documented, manual reconstruction within TensorFlow 2 may be feasible, but this is generally less efficient and prone to errors.

A `SavedModel` encapsulates the model's graph, variables, and metadata, providing a self-contained and portable representation.  TensorFlow 2 provides the necessary tools to load and utilize `SavedModels` for inference, offering a more robust and maintainable solution compared to directly working with the raw graph definition in the `.pb` file.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the conversion and loading process.  I've used placeholder names for tensors and operations to maintain generality, reflecting best practices from years of working on similar projects.


**Example 1: Conversion using `tf.compat.v1.Session` (Recommended):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_io
from tensorflow.compat.v1 import saved_model as saved_model_lib
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf1

# Load the frozen graph
with tf1.Session() as sess:
    with tf.gfile.FastGFile("my_model.pb", "rb") as f:
        graph_def = tf1.GraphDef()
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        tf1.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')

    # Identify input and output tensors.  Replace with your actual names
    input_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name("input_tensor:0")
    output_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name("output_tensor:0")


    #Export to SavedModel.  Ensure correct path is set.
    builder = saved_model_lib.builder.SavedModelBuilder("my_saved_model")
    builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
        sess,
        [tf1.saved_model.SERVING],
        signature_def_map={
            tf1.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY:
                tf1.saved_model.signature_def_utils.build_signature_def(
                    inputs={'input': tf1.saved_model.utils.build_tensor_info(input_tensor)},
                    outputs={'output': tf1.saved_model.utils.build_tensor_info(output_tensor)},
                    method_name=tf1.saved_model.signature_constants.PREDICT_METHOD_NAME
                )
        }
    )
    builder.save()

```

This example uses the `tf.compat.v1` module to maintain compatibility with the TensorFlow 1.x style of graph manipulation.  It loads the `.pb` file, retrieves the input and output tensor names (crucial and often requiring investigation of the original model's structure), and subsequently saves the model as a `SavedModel`.  This is a robust method handling potential errors more gracefully than attempting direct usage of the `.pb` file within TensorFlow 2's environment.

**Example 2: Loading the `SavedModel` for Prediction:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the SavedModel
model = tf.saved_model.load("my_saved_model")

# Define inference function.  This assumes a single input and output tensor.
def predict(input_data):
    return model.signatures["serving_default"](input_data)["output"]

# Sample input data
sample_input = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])

# Perform prediction
predictions = predict(sample_input)
print(predictions)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the loading and usage of the `SavedModel` created in the previous example. The `tf.saved_model.load` function simplifies loading, making it easy to use the model for inference. The prediction function uses the model's signature to apply input and get output, streamlining the process.


**Example 3: (Less Recommended) Partial Graph Reconstruction (for very simple models only):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the graph (risky without complete understanding of the graph structure)
with tf.io.gfile.GFile("my_model.pb", "rb") as f:
    graph_def = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())

with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name="")

    # Manually identify and retrieve tensors (highly error-prone)
    input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name("input_tensor:0")
    output_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name("output_tensor:0")

    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        # ... (Inference logic, prone to errors without thorough graph analysis)...
```

This approach is generally discouraged unless the `.pb` file represents a very small and thoroughly understood model.  Manually identifying tensors and reconstructing the inference process is extremely fragile and prone to errors, and may not be compatible with newer TensorFlow versions unless careful attention is paid to the underlying graph's structure.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on SavedModels and the `tf.compat.v1` module.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution and eager execution modes is also essential.  Finally, familiarity with TensorFlow's model building APIs (particularly `tf.keras`) will improve the workflow of adapting older models to newer TensorFlow versions.  Careful review of the model architecture from its original design will provide needed context on inputs and outputs for accurate conversion.
