A common reason for BERT model non-convergence, particularly after fine-tuning, stems from insufficient adaptation of the pre-trained weights to the specific nuances of the downstream task. I've personally encountered this frequently while working on custom NLP applications, observing that the generic language understanding encoded in the pre-trained BERT is sometimes too distant from the targeted dataset. This disconnect requires careful configuration to bridge.

The pre-trained BERT architecture, optimized on vast text corpora, provides a strong foundation of general linguistic knowledge. However, the subsequent fine-tuning process, where the model is adapted to a specific task, often involves significant adjustments to the network’s parameters. If these adjustments are not properly guided, the model may fail to converge, oscillating around a suboptimal loss value without ever reaching a satisfactory performance level. This failure manifests as an unchanging or slowly improving loss during training, often accompanied by poor evaluation metrics.

Several factors can contribute to this non-convergence. First, the learning rate might be inadequately set. A learning rate that is too high can cause the optimization algorithm to overshoot the optimal parameter values, leading to instability and preventing convergence. Conversely, a learning rate that is too low can lead to excessively slow progress, making the training process computationally inefficient and effectively stalling convergence. Second, the batch size can have a substantial impact. Too small of a batch size introduces noise and instability, while too large a batch can diminish the model's generalization capabilities. Third, insufficient training data for the target task is also a major impediment. If the fine-tuning dataset is small or not sufficiently representative of the task, the model might overfit the training data or simply fail to learn a robust mapping between input and output. Fourth, the choice of the optimizer can also play a role. Standard gradient descent optimizers may not be as effective as more advanced optimizers, such as Adam or AdamW, particularly when fine-tuning very deep neural networks like BERT. Regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, are also critical. When these techniques are not properly tuned, they may induce under-fitting or over-fitting issues. Furthermore, the initialization of the model’s final layers plays a role. Random initialization might be suboptimal for the fine-tuning task.

To illustrate, let's examine specific scenarios.

**Example 1: Incorrect Learning Rate**

In this case, the learning rate is set too high, causing divergence. I often see such instances when a default learning rate used in pre-training is applied without careful consideration for the fine-tuning phase.

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, AdamW
from torch.optim import Adam
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class SimpleDataset(Dataset):
  def __init__(self, encodings, labels):
      self.encodings = encodings
      self.labels = labels

  def __getitem__(self, idx):
      item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
      item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx])
      return item

  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.labels)


tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
texts = ["This is a positive sentence.", "This is a negative sentence.", "Another positive example.", "Another negative example."]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]
encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
dataset = SimpleDataset(encodings, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)

#Incorrect learning rate setting
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-3) #Too high
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```

*Commentary:* Here, the learning rate `lr=5e-3` is significantly larger than optimal for fine-tuning BERT. This value often results in loss values that fluctuate erratically and fail to converge towards minimal values. This is a common error if the learning rate for fine-tuning is based on values that worked well during initial pre-training.

**Example 2: Insufficient Training Data**

This example demonstrates a scenario where the training dataset is too small to fine-tune the model effectively, leading to poor performance. This often occurs when adapting a general pre-trained model for a highly specialized task.

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, AdamW
from torch.optim import Adam
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class SimpleDataset(Dataset):
  def __init__(self, encodings, labels):
      self.encodings = encodings
      self.labels = labels

  def __getitem__(self, idx):
      item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
      item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx])
      return item

  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.labels)

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
texts = ["This is a positive sentence.", "This is a negative sentence."] #Very small dataset
labels = [1, 0]
encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
dataset = SimpleDataset(encodings, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)


num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```
*Commentary:* Here, the dataset contains only two examples. Consequently, the model easily overfits to the training data. The loss during training might appear to decrease but the model fails to generalize to new, unseen data. The problem here is not the learning rate, but rather, the lack of enough examples to learn a robust function.

**Example 3: Suboptimal Optimizer and Lack of Regularization**

This example demonstrates how a simple optimizer such as standard stochastic gradient descent might fail to converge as efficiently as an adaptive method and how lack of regularization may contribute to issues.

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, AdamW
from torch.optim import SGD
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class SimpleDataset(Dataset):
  def __init__(self, encodings, labels):
      self.encodings = encodings
      self.labels = labels

  def __getitem__(self, idx):
      item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
      item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx])
      return item

  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.labels)

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
texts = ["This is a positive sentence.", "This is a negative sentence.", "Another positive example.", "Another negative example.", "Another positive sentence.", "Another negative sentence.", "Even more positive.", "Even more negative"]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
dataset = SimpleDataset(encodings, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)
optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5) #Not as effective for BERT
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)


num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```
*Commentary:* The code uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which does not perform as well with models such as BERT as more sophisticated optimization methods like AdamW, which includes weight decay. Further, the lack of regularization could also induce over-fitting, particularly with larger datasets. The combination of this factors could hinder convergence.

To address these issues, I would recommend systematically tuning hyperparameters, especially the learning rate, through methods like learning rate scheduling or grid search. It is also crucial to increase the training dataset size when it is insufficient, and use stratified sampling when dealing with imbalanced class distributions. Regarding optimizers, using AdamW over SGD typically yields better results. Additionally, incorporating dropout or other regularization techniques should improve generalization. The correct learning rate also needs to be chosen using a combination of heuristics and experimentation.

When debugging, the use of TensorBoard or similar tools for monitoring training progress can be invaluable. Inspecting the loss curve, metrics like accuracy and F1-score will provide a much better insight into whether a model is truly converging, or if performance has plateaued.

To learn more on these topics, I suggest reviewing research papers and tutorials on topics such as fine-tuning BERT, optimization algorithms for neural networks, and regularization techniques, with specific focus on implementation in deep learning libraries. Exploring the documentation of transformers library, which contains numerous examples of how to properly fine-tune models, is also a good direction to learn more.
