Saving the output of a Keras custom layer requires a nuanced understanding of the layer's internal workings and the Keras execution flow.  The critical fact to remember is that Keras layers are inherently stateless; they process input and produce output without maintaining persistent internal state across different calls.  Therefore, directly saving the output isn't a built-in feature; instead, we need to employ techniques that leverage Keras's functionalities and potentially external libraries.  My experience implementing custom layers for complex image processing pipelines has highlighted the importance of this careful approach.

**1. Explanation:**

The difficulty in directly saving a custom layer's output stems from its transient nature within the Keras model's computation graph. The output is generated during the forward pass, used for subsequent layer calculations, and then discarded by the garbage collector unless explicitly retained.  To save this output, we must intercept it before it's consumed by the next layer or lost. There are three primary methods:

* **Method 1:  Overriding the `call` method:** This is the most direct and generally preferred approach. By modifying the `call` method of the custom layer, we can explicitly store the output in a designated attribute within the layer object itself.  This approach requires modification to the custom layer's definition.

* **Method 2: Using a Keras callback:**  For scenarios where modifying the layer itself is impractical or undesirable, a Keras callback provides an elegant alternative. Callbacks allow intercepting events during model training or prediction.  We can define a callback that accesses the layer's output during a forward pass.

* **Method 3:  Manual extraction during inference:** If the primary goal is saving outputs during inference (rather than training), a simpler approach involves directly accessing the output of the custom layer from the model's output tensor during prediction. This approach is straightforward but less flexible for situations requiring access during training.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Overriding the `call` method:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.output_history = [] # Initialize an empty list to store outputs

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Perform custom layer operations
        x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
        output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

        self.output_history.append(output) #Append output to history
        return output

#Model instantiation and usage
model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    keras.layers.Activation('softmax')
])

#Simulate a batch of inputs
input_data = tf.random.normal((32, 128))
model.predict(input_data)

#Access stored outputs (Note: This will contain output from the last batch)
saved_output = model.layers[0].output_history[-1]
print(saved_output.shape) # Verify the shape of the saved output
```

*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates how to directly append the output tensor to a list within the layer.  This list persists as long as the layer object exists.  The crucial modification is the addition of `self.output_history` and appending the output within the `call` method.  Note that this stores the entire output history, which might require managing memory efficiently for large datasets.



**Example 2: Using a Keras Callback:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class OutputSaverCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, layer_index):
        self.layer_index = layer_index
        self.outputs = []

    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        layer_output = self.model.layers[self.layer_index].output
        self.outputs.append(layer_output)

# Model definition (assuming you have a model with a custom layer)
model = keras.Sequential([...your custom layer..., ...other layers...])

# Callback instantiation and training
callback = OutputSaverCallback(layer_index=1) # Replace 1 with the index of your custom layer
model.fit(..., callbacks=[callback])

# Access saved outputs
saved_outputs = callback.outputs
print(len(saved_outputs)) #Verify number of batches saved
```

*Commentary:* This approach uses a custom callback to access the output tensor directly from the layer object during training. The `on_train_batch_end` method intercepts the model's execution after each batch.  The layer index must be provided accurately.  This example only saves the outputs during training; modifications would be needed for inference.


**Example 3: Manual Extraction During Inference:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Assume model with custom layer is defined) ...

# Get the output of the custom layer
custom_layer_output = model.layers[1].output  #replace 1 with correct layer index

# Create a new model that outputs from the custom layer
inference_model = keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=custom_layer_output)

#Perform prediction
input_data = tf.random.normal((32,128))
layer_output = inference_model.predict(input_data)

#Save or process layer_output
print(layer_output.shape)
```

*Commentary:* This is the most straightforward method, creating a new model whose output is the specific layer's output.  This is efficient for inference but not suitable for tracking outputs during training epochs.  Accurate layer indexing is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource for understanding Keras layers and callbacks.  Explore the documentation on custom layers, model building, and callbacks for a thorough grasp of the concepts presented here.  Additionally, consult relevant chapters in introductory and intermediate-level deep learning textbooks focusing on TensorFlow/Keras.  Consider exploring more advanced topics like TensorFlow's graph manipulation utilities if further control over the computational graph is required for complex scenarios.  Finally, refer to publications and articles on efficient memory management in deep learning frameworks, especially if dealing with substantial output tensors.
