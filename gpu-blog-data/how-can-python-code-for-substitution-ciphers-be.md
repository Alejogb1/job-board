Substitution ciphers, while conceptually simple, can become computationally expensive when dealing with large datasets or complex key structures.  My experience optimizing such ciphers for high-throughput applications in natural language processing has highlighted the critical role of efficient data structures and algorithmic choices.  The core bottleneck often lies in the repeated lookups and substitutions within the cipher's core logic.  Careful selection of dictionaries and the avoidance of redundant computations significantly impact performance.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Optimizing Python code for substitution ciphers hinges on minimizing the time complexity of the encryption and decryption processes.  Naive implementations often use nested loops or inefficient string manipulations, resulting in O(n*m) time complexity, where 'n' is the length of the plaintext and 'm' is the length of the key alphabet.  Optimizations focus on reducing this to O(n) by leveraging Python's built-in data structures and optimized functions.

The primary strategy involves pre-processing the key into a suitable data structure for rapid lookup. Instead of iterating through the key alphabet for each character, we create a dictionary mapping each character to its substituted counterpart.  This allows for constant-time O(1) lookups during encryption and decryption.  For decryption, a reverse mapping (inverse dictionary) is equally crucial.  Furthermore, employing efficient string manipulation techniques, specifically vectorized operations where possible, prevents unnecessary iterations.

Another area ripe for optimization is handling special characters.  The simplest approach is to exclude them; however, a more robust solution encompasses them within the key mapping, explicitly defining their substitutions or maintaining a separate handling mechanism (e.g., preserving them unchanged).  This decision affects the overall key size and complexity but can substantially impact the cipher's strength and efficiency.  Careful consideration must be given to how edge cases are handled â€“ for example, uppercase versus lowercase letters and handling of characters outside the ASCII range.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Substitution Cipher (Inefficient)**

```python
def basic_substitution_encrypt(plaintext, key):
    ciphertext = ""
    for char in plaintext:
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            index = ord(char) - ord('a')
            ciphertext += key[index]
        else:  #Handles only lowercase letters; inefficient for diverse character sets
            ciphertext += char
    return ciphertext

def basic_substitution_decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    #Inversion of the encryption logic; also inefficient
    plaintext = ""
    key_map = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(key)}  #Partial key mapping
    for char in ciphertext:
        if char in key_map.keys():
            index = key_map[char]
            plaintext += chr(ord('a') + index)
        else:
            plaintext += char
    return plaintext

key = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm"
plaintext = "hello world"
ciphertext = basic_substitution_encrypt(plaintext, key)
decrypted_text = basic_substitution_decrypt(ciphertext, key)
print(f"Plaintext: {plaintext}")
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")
print(f"Decrypted text: {decrypted_text}")
```

This example demonstrates a naive approach.  The repeated character-by-character processing and conditional statements within the loop lead to poor performance. The partial key mapping for decryption further compounds this inefficiency.

**Example 2: Optimized Substitution Cipher using Dictionaries**

```python
def optimized_substitution_encrypt(plaintext, key_map):
    return "".join([key_map.get(char, char) for char in plaintext])

def optimized_substitution_decrypt(ciphertext, reverse_key_map):
    return "".join([reverse_key_map.get(char, char) for char in ciphertext])

key = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm"
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
key_map = dict(zip(alphabet, key))
reverse_key_map = dict(zip(key, alphabet))

plaintext = "hello world! 123" #Handling various characters
ciphertext = optimized_substitution_encrypt(plaintext, key_map)
decrypted_text = optimized_substitution_decrypt(ciphertext, reverse_key_map)
print(f"Plaintext: {plaintext}")
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")
print(f"Decrypted text: {decrypted_text}")

```

This version utilizes dictionaries for O(1) lookups.  The list comprehension combined with `"".join()` provides a concise and efficient string manipulation.  The `get()` method handles characters not present in the key, preserving them as is.  Crucially, the inverse mapping is pre-calculated for decryption, eliminating redundant computation.

**Example 3:  Handling Extended Character Sets with Unicode**

```python
import string

def unicode_substitution_encrypt(plaintext, key_map):
    return "".join([key_map.get(char, char) for char in plaintext])

def unicode_substitution_decrypt(ciphertext, reverse_key_map):
    return "".join([reverse_key_map.get(char, char) for char in ciphertext])

key_alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits + " "
shuffled_key = ''.join(random.sample(key_alphabet,len(key_alphabet))) #Randomized Key
key_map = dict(zip(key_alphabet, shuffled_key))
reverse_key_map = dict(zip(shuffled_key, key_alphabet))

plaintext = "Hello, world! This is a test. 123"  # Unicode support
ciphertext = unicode_substitution_encrypt(plaintext, key_map)
decrypted_text = unicode_substitution_decrypt(ciphertext, reverse_key_map)
print(f"Plaintext: {plaintext}")
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")
print(f"Decrypted text: {decrypted_text}")

import random
```

This code extends the previous example to support a broader range of Unicode characters.  The key now includes letters, punctuation, digits, and spaces. The randomized key generation further enhances security.  The core logic remains similar, highlighting the adaptability of the dictionary-based approach.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of algorithm optimization and data structures in Python, I would suggest exploring the official Python documentation, particularly sections on dictionaries, list comprehensions, and time complexity analysis.  Furthermore, texts on algorithm design and analysis offer invaluable insights into optimizing code for performance.  Finally, studying the source code of established cryptography libraries can provide practical examples of efficient cipher implementations.  These resources collectively provide a strong foundation for tackling such optimization challenges.
