The discrepancy between C++ compilation during an image build process and successful compilation within a container's runtime environment often stems from inconsistencies in the build-time and runtime environments' toolchains and dependencies.  My experience troubleshooting this issue over several large-scale projects has shown this to be a surprisingly common problem, particularly when dealing with complex build systems and cross-compilation scenarios. The core reason is a mismatch in the availability and versions of libraries, compilers, and header files between the build system and the containerized runtime.

**1. Explanation:**

During the image build, the build system uses the tools and libraries available on the *builder* machine. This might be a developer's workstation, a CI/CD server, or a dedicated build agent.  The container image, however, contains its *own* isolated filesystem, including its own toolchain and libraries.  If the image does not accurately reflect the dependencies utilized during the compilation phase on the builder, or contains incompatible versions, compilation will fail during the runtime execution within the container. This mismatch can manifest in several ways:

* **Missing Headers:** The builder machine may have header files installed that aren't included in the container's image.  This is a frequent cause of compilation errors related to unresolved symbols.  The build system can successfully locate headers during the build, but the compiler within the container cannot.

* **Incompatible Library Versions:**  The builder and the runtime container may use different versions of libraries, resulting in ABI (Application Binary Interface) mismatches. The code might compile with one version but fail to link or function correctly with another.  Even if the header files are present, the actual library implementations might differ significantly enough to cause runtime crashes or unexpected behavior.

* **Incorrect Toolchain:**  The build process may use a different compiler (e.g., g++-11 on the builder and g++-9 within the container) or a different set of standard library implementations (libc++, libstdc++). This often leads to subtle differences in code generation, ultimately resulting in compilation or linking errors within the container.

* **Build System Issues:** The complexity of modern build systems (CMake, Bazel, Meson) can sometimes obscure dependency problems.  A build system might be correctly configured for the builder but not properly translate those dependencies into the container's environment.

* **Dynamic vs Static Linking:**  Using dynamic linking (shared libraries) can lead to issues if the runtime environment doesn't contain the correct shared libraries. Using static linking can resolve this, but at the cost of increased image size and potential version conflicts within the image itself if multiple components use statically linked versions of the same library.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these scenarios with hypothetical examples.  Assume we're working with a simple C++ project using a third-party library called `libmylib`.

**Example 1: Missing Header Files**

```c++
// myprogram.cpp
#include <mylib.h>

int main() {
    mylib_function(); // Calls a function from libmylib
    return 0;
}
```

If `mylib.h` is present on the builder machine but missing from the container's `/usr/include` (or wherever the system includes headers are), compilation will fail within the container with an "unresolved symbol" error.  The solution involves ensuring `libmylib`'s headers are correctly installed and copied into the container's image.

**Example 2: Incompatible Library Versions**

```c++
// myprogram.cpp
#include <mylib.h>

int main() {
    auto result = mylib_complex_function(10); // Uses a complex function with potential ABI changes
    return 0;
}
```

This example showcases a more insidious issue.  `mylib_complex_function` may have undergone ABI changes between the version used during the build and the version in the container. Even if compilation succeeds on the builder, linking or runtime execution might fail within the container, causing segmentation faults or other unpredictable behavior. The solution is to ensure consistent versions of `libmylib` are used throughout the build and runtime environments.

**Example 3: Build System Misconfiguration (CMake)**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

find_package(mylib REQUIRED)

add_executable(myprogram myprogram.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myprogram mylib::mylib)
```

This CMakeLists.txt file attempts to find and link `libmylib`. If the `find_package` command's search paths within the container environment don't correctly point to where `libmylib` is installed, the build will fail inside the container. Correctly setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or using appropriate environment variables within the Dockerfile to locate `libmylib` is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To effectively address these issues, a thorough understanding of your build system's configuration is paramount.  Consult the documentation for your specific build system (CMake, Bazel, Meson, etc.)  Pay close attention to environment variable settings within your containerization scripts (Dockerfiles, build scripts).  Familiarize yourself with the concepts of dependency management and version control.   Utilize tools designed for dependency analysis and static analysis to detect potential issues during the development phase.  Mastering the intricacies of cross-compilation techniques will also be highly beneficial in more complex scenarios involving diverse architectures. Through meticulous attention to these points, you can streamline your workflow and reduce the likelihood of encountering compilation discrepancies between image builds and containerized runtime environments.
