In my experience debugging deep learning models, an often-encountered frustration involves inconsistent results from a PyTorch Lightning model after loading it from a checkpoint. This is rarely due to an inherent flaw in the framework itself; rather, it stems from subtle issues in model saving, loading, or the environment's state. The key fact to recognize is that a checkpoint captures the model's *parameters* at a particular point in training, but not necessarily the complete *state* required for deterministic behavior.

A primary cause of variability, and the one I've most frequently encountered, is the improper handling of random number generators. Both PyTorch and Python’s `random` module utilize internal state that, if not controlled, leads to non-deterministic operations when used within the model’s forward pass or during data processing. PyTorch Lightning does not automatically handle this state beyond saving the model parameters; it assumes the user has implemented strategies to ensure consistency. Without this, even with identical model weights, shuffling or dropout during evaluation can differ from when the model was saved. This results in outputs that diverge from expectations. These state issues are not necessarily manifested in training, as small fluctuations tend to average out over large numbers of samples, but when running just one or two input samples after loading it is much more obvious.

The discrepancy typically arises from not setting the random seed at the beginning of training and inference, or when there are different processes using different seeds. Seeds should be set for random, numpy, and torch. The state of the CUDA device can also be non-deterministic. Specifically, convolutional algorithms may utilize different implementations based on hardware. To make results consistent across systems, even with CUDA, operations should be made deterministic using an environment variable to force a certain convolutional algorithm.

Another source of inconsistent results can stem from data loading and preprocessing. If the data pipeline changes after the model is saved, even subtly, the model will encounter different input distributions. This is particularly problematic when using data augmentations that include randomness, such as crops, rotations, or jittering, which can be non-deterministic across different runs and data loader configurations. Saving the state of the augmentation pipeline alongside the model weights can alleviate this issue if augmentation randomness is needed at inference. However, keeping the pipeline fixed and not relying on such random changes is more reliable in general.

Let's consider a few code examples to illustrate this.

**Example 1: The Random Seed Issue**

This example shows what can happen when random seeds are not correctly handled. Initially the model will be trained, and a seed is set when the model is created and during training. Then, the trained weights are loaded into a new model for inference. Without resetting the seed before inference, the model’s outputs can differ.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import random
import numpy as np


class SimpleModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.dropout(x)
      return self.layer(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
      x, y = batch
      y_hat = self(x)
      loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(y_hat,y)
      return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
      return optim.Adam(self.parameters())

# Setup the seeds
def set_seeds(seed):
  random.seed(seed)
  np.random.seed(seed)
  torch.manual_seed(seed)
  torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
  torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
  torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Training phase (with seeding)
    seed = 42
    set_seeds(seed)

    model = SimpleModel()
    trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=5, enable_checkpointing=True)

    train_data = torch.randn(100, 10), torch.randn(100, 1)
    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader([train_data], batch_size=1)

    trainer.fit(model, train_loader)
    trainer.save_checkpoint("model.ckpt")

    # Inference phase (incorrectly, without setting seeds again)
    loaded_model = SimpleModel.load_from_checkpoint("model.ckpt")
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
    output_incorrect = loaded_model(input_data)


    # Correct inference phase (with seeding)
    set_seeds(seed)
    loaded_model_2 = SimpleModel.load_from_checkpoint("model.ckpt")
    output_correct = loaded_model_2(input_data)

    print("Incorrect output: ", output_incorrect)
    print("Correct output:   ", output_correct)
    assert torch.equal(output_correct, loaded_model(input_data))
```

In this first example, the `set_seeds` function is a critical component. Setting random seeds at the beginning ensures that operations such as dropout, data shuffling, and even weight initialization (in the case of a new model), are deterministic. The output of `output_incorrect` differs from that of `output_correct`, even though the same weights have been loaded. The difference is due to the dropout layer.

**Example 2: Data Loading Changes**

Here, a small change in how data is preprocessed during training and inference changes the output. In the example, the data is normalized differently, leading to a change in the result.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pytorch_lightning as pl


class SimpleModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layer(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
      x, y = batch
      y_hat = self(x)
      loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(y_hat,y)
      return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
      return optim.Adam(self.parameters())


def normalize_train(data):
    return (data - 0.5) / 2.0

def normalize_infer(data):
    return (data - 0.3) / 1.0

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Training phase
  model = SimpleModel()
  trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=5, enable_checkpointing=True)

  train_data = torch.randn(100, 10), torch.randn(100, 1)
  train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader([ (normalize_train(x),y) for x,y in [train_data]], batch_size=1)

  trainer.fit(model, train_loader)
  trainer.save_checkpoint("model2.ckpt")

  # Inference phase (incorrectly, with different normalization)
  loaded_model_incorrect = SimpleModel.load_from_checkpoint("model2.ckpt")
  input_data_infer = torch.randn(1, 10)
  input_data_incorrect_preprocess = normalize_infer(input_data_infer)
  output_incorrect = loaded_model_incorrect(input_data_incorrect_preprocess)

  # Inference phase (correctly, with matching normalization)
  loaded_model_correct = SimpleModel.load_from_checkpoint("model2.ckpt")
  input_data_correct_preprocess = normalize_train(input_data_infer)
  output_correct = loaded_model_correct(input_data_correct_preprocess)


  print("Incorrect output: ", output_incorrect)
  print("Correct output:   ", output_correct)
  assert not torch.equal(output_incorrect, output_correct)
```

In this example, the normalization function differs between training and inference, highlighting that data preprocessing methods must be consistent between training and inference. The output from a model loaded using correct preprocessing will differ from a model loaded using an incorrect preprocessing method.

**Example 3: CUDA Determinism**

This last example shows how a CUDA non-deterministic setting can lead to variable results. While the seed is set properly, the use of CUDA can still cause problems.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import os
import random
import numpy as np

class SimpleModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
      return self.layer(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
      x, y = batch
      y_hat = self(x)
      loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(y_hat,y)
      return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
      return optim.Adam(self.parameters())

def set_seeds(seed):
  random.seed(seed)
  np.random.seed(seed)
  torch.manual_seed(seed)
  torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Training phase (with CUDA)
  if torch.cuda.is_available():
    os.environ["CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG"]=":4096:8"
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False


  seed = 42
  set_seeds(seed)

  model = SimpleModel()
  trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=5, enable_checkpointing=True, accelerator="gpu" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

  train_data = torch.randn(100, 10), torch.randn(100, 1)
  train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader([train_data], batch_size=1)

  trainer.fit(model, train_loader)
  trainer.save_checkpoint("model3.ckpt")

  # Inference phase (incorrectly, without env variable)
  loaded_model_incorrect = SimpleModel.load_from_checkpoint("model3.ckpt")
  input_data_infer = torch.randn(1, 10)

  if torch.cuda.is_available():
      loaded_model_incorrect = loaded_model_incorrect.cuda()
  output_incorrect = loaded_model_incorrect(input_data_infer.cuda() if torch.cuda.is_available() else input_data_infer)

  # Inference phase (correctly, with same env variable)
  if torch.cuda.is_available():
    os.environ["CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG"]=":4096:8"
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

  set_seeds(seed)

  loaded_model_correct = SimpleModel.load_from_checkpoint("model3.ckpt")
  if torch.cuda.is_available():
    loaded_model_correct = loaded_model_correct.cuda()

  output_correct = loaded_model_correct(input_data_infer.cuda() if torch.cuda.is_available() else input_data_infer)


  print("Incorrect output: ", output_incorrect)
  print("Correct output:   ", output_correct)
  assert torch.equal(output_incorrect, output_correct)
```

In this final example, it is clear that the random seed alone is not sufficient for consistency. Using a CUDA device introduces another layer of non-determinism. The setting of the `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG` variable and other environment settings ensures that the model performs the same way on different platforms.

To address inconsistent results, I recommend a structured approach: First, ensure random seeds are correctly set for random, numpy, and torch at the beginning of both training and inference. Second, verify that the data preprocessing pipeline remains consistent, including normalization methods and augmentations, throughout the entire process. Third, if using CUDA, force deterministic behavior by setting the `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG` environment variable along with setting `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic` to `True` and `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark` to `False`. Resources discussing best practices in deterministic training for PyTorch and scientific reproducibility in machine learning more generally are readily available. I would highly recommend exploring these. A more advanced approach is to look into recording the state of any random functions and restoring that state, although this requires more advanced knowledge of each library. Finally, thorough testing of the inference pipeline to verify that results remain consistent across different runs is a great idea and will catch subtle issues as well as give a higher degree of confidence when using a model.
