The interaction between sigmoid and ReLU activation functions within a TensorFlow neural network is non-trivial, significantly impacting gradient flow and network performance depending on their placement within the architecture.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for image classification tasks has shown that naive combinations often lead to suboptimal results, primarily due to the inherent limitations of each activation.

**1. Explanation:**

The sigmoid function, defined as 1/(1 + exp(-x)), outputs values between 0 and 1, squashing the input into a probability-like range.  However, its primary drawback is the vanishing gradient problem.  For large positive or negative inputs, the derivative approaches zero, hindering effective backpropagation and preventing weight updates in deeper layers.  ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), defined as max(0, x), alleviates this issue by having a constant derivative of 1 for positive inputs and 0 for negative inputs.  This prevents vanishing gradients for positive activations, but introduces the "dying ReLU" problem where neurons become inactive if their weights are updated such that the input consistently remains negative.

Combining these activations necessitates a careful consideration of their respective strengths and weaknesses.  Placing sigmoid after ReLU mitigates the vanishing gradient problem to some extent, as the ReLU pre-processes the data, ensuring the sigmoid receives mostly positive inputs, lessening the impact of its diminishing gradients.  However, it still introduces the sigmoid's inherent saturation issue which could again restrict gradient flow if the inputs become very large or very small after passing through the ReLU layer.  Conversely, placing ReLU after sigmoid can lead to a significant proportion of neurons having zero activations, particularly in the initial layers where the sigmoid outputs values near zero or one more frequently. This arises because the ReLU will essentially clip the majority of the sigmoid's output to zero, potentially hampering the model's learning capacity.  The most effective arrangement depends strongly on the specific architecture and dataset.

Furthermore, the choice of combining these activations frequently indicates a potential architectural flaw. The need for such a combination might suggest that the network architecture is not well-suited to the problem, and exploring alternative architectures, such as using a different activation function entirely (e.g., ELU, Leaky ReLU, or variations thereof), or adjusting the network depth or width may yield far better results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the different placements of sigmoid and ReLU within a simple TensorFlow model.  Note that these examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and may not represent optimal network configurations.

**Example 1: ReLU followed by Sigmoid**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training and evaluation...
```

This example demonstrates a typical scenario.  The ReLU layer attempts to learn non-linear features, while the sigmoid layer maps the activations to a probability distribution suitable for multi-class classification (assuming a 10-class problem, like MNIST digit recognition).  The ReLU layer alleviates some issues associated with the sigmoid's vanishing gradients but doesn't entirely remove them if the inputs are extensively saturated at the lower or upper bounds.

**Example 2: Sigmoid followed by ReLU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training and evaluation...
```

In this setup, the initial sigmoid layer might significantly reduce the variance of its output, and many outputs may be near zero.  These values, when passed to the ReLU layer, often result in a substantial number of dead neurons, limiting the model's representational power and potentially leading to poor performance. This configuration is generally less desirable than the previous example.

**Example 3:  Separate branches with Concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(784,))

relu_branch = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
sigmoid_branch = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid')(input_layer)

merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([relu_branch, sigmoid_branch])
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training and evaluation...
```

This example explores a more sophisticated approach. Here, both ReLU and sigmoid branches process the input independently, before being concatenated.  This allows the network to learn features using both activation functions without the direct dependencies and limitations of sequential stacking.  This approach offers flexibility and often performs better than simple sequential combinations.  However, careful consideration must be given to the dimensionality of the features learned in each branch to avoid redundancy and ensure efficient merging.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville;  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen.  These texts provide comprehensive background on activation functions, neural network architectures, and optimization techniques.  Furthermore, reviewing relevant research papers on activation function selection and their influence on network performance would provide valuable insights into advanced applications and techniques.
