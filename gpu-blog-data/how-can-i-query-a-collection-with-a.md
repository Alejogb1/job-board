The core challenge lies in dynamically constructing a query based on a variable subset of criteria, all drawn from the same data source.  My experience working on large-scale data processing pipelines for e-commerce platforms highlighted this exact issue when handling complex product filtering based on user-selected attributes.  A rigid, pre-defined query structure simply wouldn't scale. The solution necessitates a flexible approach leveraging dynamic query building, generally achieved through programmatic manipulation of query language elements or utilizing abstract query representations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The most robust solution involves decoupling the filter criteria definition from the query execution.  First, represent your filters as a structured data object, ideally a list of dictionaries or similar. Each dictionary within this list represents a single filter, mapping a field name to its corresponding value and optionally, a comparison operator. This allows for arbitrary filter combinations and easily manages a variable number of filters.  The query itself is then constructed based on the content of this filter object.  This separates the *what* (the filter criteria) from the *how* (the query execution).

To implement this, I typically employ a procedural approach.  I iterate over the filter object, constructing query clauses (WHERE, AND, OR, etc.) programmatically.  This avoids the rigidity of a hard-coded query, allowing for adaptability to varying filter conditions.  Database-specific considerations like escaping special characters and handling data types must be addressed during this construction phase.  This dynamic approach guarantees scalability and maintainability in scenarios with fluctuating filtering requirements.  For instance, adding a new filter type only necessitates modifying the filter object structure and the code handling its translation into a query clause; the core query generation logic remains unaffected.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Python with SQL Alchemy**

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text, and_, or_

engine = create_engine('your_database_url') #Replace with your database URL

def build_query(filters, table_name):
    """Builds a SQL query dynamically based on the provided filters."""
    clauses = []
    for filter_item in filters:
        field = filter_item['field']
        value = filter_item['value']
        operator = filter_item.get('operator', '=') # Default to '=' if operator not specified

        if operator == '=':
            clauses.append(getattr(table_name, field) == value)
        elif operator == '>':
            clauses.append(getattr(table_name, field) > value)
        elif operator == '<':
            clauses.append(getattr(table_name, field) < value)
        # Add more operators as needed...
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported operator: {operator}")

    if not clauses:
        return text(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}") # No filters, return all
    else:
        return text(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE {' AND '.join(str(clause) for clause in clauses)}")


filters = [
    {'field': 'price', 'value': 100, 'operator': '>'},
    {'field': 'category', 'value': 'Electronics'}
]

with engine.connect() as connection:
    query = build_query(filters, "products") # products is your table name
    result = connection.execute(query).fetchall()
    print(result)

```
This example demonstrates using SQL Alchemy in Python to dynamically generate SQL queries based on a list of filters. Error handling for unsupported operators is crucial.


**Example 2:  JavaScript with MongoDB**

```javascript
function buildQuery(filters) {
  const query = {};
  filters.forEach(filter => {
    const { field, value, operator } = filter;
    if (operator === '$eq') {
      query[field] = value;
    } else if (operator === '$gt') {
      query[field] = { $gt: value };
    } else if (operator === '$lt') {
      query[field] = { $lt: value };
    } // Add more operators as needed
    else {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported operator: ${operator}`);
    }
  });
  return query;
}

const filters = [
  { field: 'price', value: 100, operator: '$gt' },
  { field: 'category', value: 'Electronics', operator: '$eq' }
];

const query = buildQuery(filters);
db.collection('products').find(query).toArray((err, result) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(result);
});

```
This JavaScript example shows how to construct a MongoDB query dynamically.  MongoDB's query language naturally supports this type of dynamic construction.  The use of the `$gt`, `$lt`, etc. operators is inherent to the MongoDB query syntax.


**Example 3:  C# with LINQ**

```csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Product
{
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    // ... other properties
}

public static class QueryBuilder
{
    public static List<Product> FilterProducts(List<Product> products, List<Filter> filters)
    {
        var query = products.AsQueryable();
        foreach (var filter in filters)
        {
            switch (filter.Operator)
            {
                case Operator.Equals:
                    query = query.Where(p => filter.Field.Invoke(p).Equals(filter.Value));
                    break;
                case Operator.GreaterThan:
                    query = query.Where(p => (decimal)filter.Field.Invoke(p) > (decimal)filter.Value);
                    break;
                // Add more operators
                default:
                    throw new ArgumentException("Unsupported operator.");
            }
        }
        return query.ToList();
    }
}

// Example usage:
List<Product> products = new List<Product> { /* ... your product data ... */ };
List<Filter> filters = new List<Filter>
{
    new Filter { Field = p => p.Price, Value = 100, Operator = Operator.GreaterThan },
    new Filter { Field = p => p.Category, Value = "Electronics", Operator = Operator.Equals }
};
List<Product> filteredProducts = QueryBuilder.FilterProducts(products, filters);
```
This C# example uses LINQ for dynamic query building.  The use of delegates allows for flexible field selection, improving code maintainability.  Error handling is crucial.  Note that this example works on in-memory collections.  Adapting this to a database context would require integration with an ORM (like Entity Framework).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Database documentation:** Consult your specific database system's documentation for details on query syntax, escaping special characters, and optimizing query performance. This is fundamental.
* **ORM documentation (if applicable):**  If using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), understand its API for constructing dynamic queries effectively.
* **Books on database design and query optimization:**  A strong understanding of database principles enhances your ability to construct efficient and maintainable queries.


This layered approach—structured filter representation, dynamic query construction, and error handling—ensures a robust and scalable solution for handling a variable number of filters derived from a single source.  Consistent adherence to these principles is vital for building reliable data processing systems.
