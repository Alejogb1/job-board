The "You must feed a value for placeholder tensor" error in Keras arises from a fundamental mismatch between the model's expected input shape and the data provided during training.  This discrepancy often stems from neglecting to explicitly define input shapes within the model architecture or supplying training data that deviates from the anticipated dimensions. My experience debugging this across several large-scale image recognition projects has consistently highlighted the importance of meticulous input shape management.  I've encountered this issue frequently when transitioning between different datasets or when refactoring model architectures.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras models, at their core, operate on tensors.  These tensors represent the input data (images, text, time series, etc.) and are processed through layers defined within the model.  Each layer expects input tensors of a specific shape (number of samples, height, width, channels for images, for example). The "placeholder tensor" error signifies that Keras has encountered a layer attempting to operate on a tensor where one or more dimensions are undefined or inconsistent with the defined model. This typically happens during the `fit()` or `train_on_batch()` methods, when Keras attempts to feed the training data to the model.

The root causes can be categorized as follows:

* **Missing Input Shape Declaration:** The model architecture might lack explicit definitions for input shapes.  Keras may then infer shapes from the training data, but if the training data is incorrectly formatted or pre-processed, it can lead to inconsistencies and the error.  Explicitly defining input shapes provides a robust check against these errors.

* **Data Shape Mismatch:**  The dimensions of the training data (e.g., NumPy arrays or TensorFlow tensors) might not align with the dimensions expected by the model's input layer. This can stem from issues with data loading, preprocessing, or batching strategies.  Discrepancies in the number of samples, channels, or other dimensions are common culprits.

* **Incorrect Data Type:** While less frequent, supplying data of an incompatible type (e.g., a list instead of a NumPy array) can also trigger this error. Keras requires structured data for efficient processing.

Addressing these causes requires a careful examination of the model's architecture, the training data's format, and the data preprocessing steps.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Missing Input Shape Declaration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect: No input shape specified
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))  #Shape (100 samples, 10 features)
y_train = tf.random.normal((100,10))

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) # Will likely throw the error
```

This example omits the `input_shape` parameter in the first Dense layer.  Keras may attempt to infer it from `x_train`, but inconsistencies or unexpected data could lead to the error.  The corrected version is shown below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), #Input shape added
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100,10))

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) # Should now run without error
```

Adding `input_shape=(10,)` explicitly informs Keras about the expected input dimension.


**Example 2: Data Shape Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Incorrect: Incorrect data shape
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28) #Missing channel dimension
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) # Error due to missing channel dimension

```

This example uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The model expects images with shape (28, 28, 1), representing 28x28 pixel images with a single channel (grayscale).  The `x_train` data is missing the channel dimension, leading to the error.  The correction involves reshaping `x_train`:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Corrected: Added channel dimension
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 1)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) #Should now work correctly
```


**Example 3: Incorrect Data Type**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Incorrect: Using lists instead of numpy arrays
x_train = [[i] * 10 for i in range(100)] #List of lists
y_train = [i % 10 for i in range(100)]

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) #Error due to incorrect data type
```

Here, `x_train` and `y_train` are lists, which Keras cannot directly handle.  The fix involves converting to NumPy arrays:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Corrected: Using NumPy arrays
x_train = np.array([[i] * 10 for i in range(100)])
y_train = np.array([i % 10 for i in range(100)])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) #Should execute without error
```

This conversion ensures the data is in a format Keras can process.  Notice how `y_train` also needs to be an array for proper one-hot encoding (or alternative labelling as appropriate for your specific problem).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation, particularly sections on model building and data preprocessing, are invaluable.  A strong grasp of NumPy array manipulation is crucial for effective data handling in Keras.  Furthermore, understanding TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities will aid in debugging complex data flow issues within the model.  Exploring tutorials focused on CNNs and sequential models provides practical experience handling diverse data shapes and input formats.  Finally, proficient use of a debugger will allow for precise tracking of data transformations through each layer in the network.
