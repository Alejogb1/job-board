The `tf.keras.Model.summary()` method, by default, only displays the architecture of the top-level model.  This presents a challenge when dealing with nested models, common in scenarios involving feature extraction, transfer learning, or complex model compositions.  My experience working on a large-scale image recognition project, involving a hierarchical model for object detection, highlighted this limitation. To effectively visualize the internal structure of child models within a parent model, one must leverage the model's internal structure and employ techniques to recursively traverse and print the layer information.

The key to displaying the layers of a child model lies in understanding that `tf.keras.Model.summary()` operates on the layers directly accessible to the parent model.  Child models, when added as layers within the parent, become essentially treated as single, opaque layers unless explicitly handled.  Therefore, a manual traversal and summary generation are required.  This involves recursively accessing each layer's constituent sub-models and repeating the process until all layers are documented.

**1.  Explanation of the Recursive Approach**

The approach centers on a recursive function that iterates through the layers of a Keras model. When it encounters a layer that is itself a `tf.keras.Model` instance (a child model), the function calls itself, passing this child model as input. This recursive call ensures that all layers, even deeply nested ones, are explored and summarized. The output is then formatted to clearly show the hierarchical structure of the models.  Error handling is crucial to manage scenarios where a layer might not possess the `layers` attribute, safeguarding against potential exceptions.  My experience with this problem involved debugging models with unexpectedly structured sub-components, reinforcing the importance of robust exception management.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Recursive Summary**

```python
def recursive_model_summary(model, indent=0):
    print("  " * indent + f"Model: {model.name}")
    for layer in model.layers:
        print("  " * (indent + 1) + f"Layer: {layer.name} ({layer.__class__.__name__})")
        if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.Model):
            recursive_model_summary(layer, indent + 2)

# Example usage:
parent_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.Model([tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

recursive_model_summary(parent_model)
```

This example demonstrates a basic recursive function. It iterates through the layers of a model. If a layer is a child model, it recursively calls itself to print the child model's layers. The indentation ensures a clear visual representation of the hierarchy.  This method provides a basic, human-readable summary, sufficient for many use cases.  However, it lacks detailed information such as the number of parameters, which is often important.


**Example 2: Summary with Parameter Counts**

```python
def recursive_model_summary_detailed(model, indent=0):
    print("  " * indent + f"Model: {model.name}")
    total_params = 0
    for layer in model.layers:
        params = layer.count_params()
        print("  " * (indent + 1) + f"Layer: {layer.name} ({layer.__class__.__name__}), Parameters: {params}")
        total_params += params
        if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.Model):
            child_params, _ = recursive_model_summary_detailed(layer, indent + 2)
            total_params += child_params
    print("  " * indent + f"Total Parameters: {total_params}")
    return total_params, model.name

# Example usage (using the same parent_model from Example 1)
total_params, model_name = recursive_model_summary_detailed(parent_model)
print(f"\nTotal parameters for {model_name}: {total_params}")
```

This enhanced example adds parameter counting to each layer and recursively sums them up. The function returns the total number of parameters in the sub-model, allowing for comprehensive accounting at each level of the hierarchy.  This is particularly valuable for large models where parameter efficiency is a critical consideration.


**Example 3: Handling Exceptions and Variable Layer Types**

```python
def robust_recursive_summary(model, indent=0):
  try:
    print("  " * indent + f"Model/Layer: {model.name if hasattr(model, 'name') else type(model).__name__}")
    if hasattr(model, 'layers'):
      for layer in model.layers:
        robust_recursive_summary(layer, indent + 1)
  except AttributeError:
    print("  " * (indent + 1) + f"Could not process layer: {type(model).__name__}")
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"  " * (indent + 1) + f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage (potentially including non-Model layers that lack .layers)
parent_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.Model([tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')]),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2), #Adding a layer without a 'layers' attribute.
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
robust_recursive_summary(parent_model)
```

This example incorporates robust error handling.  It accounts for layers that might not have a `layers` attribute and handles potential `AttributeError` exceptions gracefully.  This is essential when dealing with heterogeneous model architectures.  Furthermore, a generic `Exception` block catches any other unforeseen issues, ensuring the function's stability.  During my project, handling unexpected layer types was crucial for a smooth and reliable visualization process.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a more in-depth understanding of Keras model architecture and manipulation, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and exploring the Keras API reference.  Additionally, I found several well-regarded textbooks on deep learning and neural networks invaluable in understanding the underlying concepts.  Finally, practical experience building and debugging complex models is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding.  These combined resources will provide a solid foundation for advanced model comprehension and manipulation.
