TensorFlow.js, while powerful for numerical computation and machine learning tasks, isn't directly designed for data manipulation like CSV parsing and duplicate row removal.  Its strength lies in tensor operations, not string processing or relational database functionalities.  Therefore, a direct TensorFlow.js solution for this problem is inefficient and impractical.  The most effective approach involves leveraging JavaScript's built-in capabilities for data handling, preprocessing the CSV data *before* engaging TensorFlow.js for any subsequent machine learning model training.  This separation of concerns ensures optimal performance and maintainability.

My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems frequently involved preprocessing massive datasets, and this task always necessitated a clear distinction between data cleaning and model training phases.  Attempting to embed duplicate row removal within a TensorFlow.js workflow would invariably introduce complexity and slowdown.

The optimal strategy involves three steps:

1. **CSV Parsing and Data Loading:**  Utilize a JavaScript library like Papa Parse to efficiently load and parse the CSV file into a JavaScript array of objects or an array of arrays.  Papa Parse handles various CSV dialects and offers excellent performance, particularly with larger files.

2. **Duplicate Row Detection and Removal:**  Implement a JavaScript function to identify and remove duplicate rows.  Several methods exist, depending on the definition of "duplicate."  Simple row-wise comparison using stringification is suitable for simple cases.  More sophisticated methods involve hashing or comparing specific columns.

3. **Tensor Conversion:** Once the cleaned data is obtained, convert it into a TensorFlow.js tensor for use in your machine learning model.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Duplicate Removal (String-based)**

This example demonstrates duplicate removal based on string comparison. It's efficient for smaller datasets but can become slow for very large datasets.

```javascript
const Papa = require('papaparse');

Papa.parse('./data.csv', {
  complete: function(results) {
    const rows = results.data;
    const uniqueRows = [];
    const seenRows = new Set();

    for (const row of rows) {
      const rowString = JSON.stringify(row); //Convert row to string for comparison
      if (!seenRows.has(rowString)) {
        seenRows.add(rowString);
        uniqueRows.push(row);
      }
    }

    // Convert to TensorFlow.js tensor (assuming numerical data)
    const tensorData = tf.tensor2d(uniqueRows.map(row => row.map(parseFloat)), [uniqueRows.length, uniqueRows[0].length]);

    //Proceed with TensorFlow.js operations
    console.log(tensorData);
  }
});
```

This code leverages Papa Parse for CSV parsing.  The core logic involves converting each row to a string using `JSON.stringify`, which is then checked for uniqueness using a `Set`.  Finally, the cleaned data is converted into a TensorFlow.js tensor using `tf.tensor2d`.  Note the assumption of numerical data for tensor conversion; adjustments would be needed for non-numeric data.


**Example 2: Duplicate Removal Based on Key Columns**

This refined approach focuses on duplicate detection based on specific columns, improving efficiency and accuracy when dealing with partial duplicates.

```javascript
const Papa = require('papaparse');

Papa.parse('./data.csv', {
  complete: function(results) {
    const rows = results.data;
    const header = rows.shift(); // Extract header row (assuming it exists)
    const keyColumns = [0, 2]; // Indices of columns to consider for duplicate detection.
    const uniqueRows = [];
    const seenRows = new Map();

    for (const row of rows) {
      const key = keyColumns.map(i => row[i]).join(','); //create key from selected columns
      if (!seenRows.has(key)) {
        seenRows.set(key, row);
        uniqueRows.push(row);
      }
    }
    uniqueRows.unshift(header); //add back the header row.

    // Convert to TensorFlow.js tensor (assuming numerical data in relevant columns)
    const tensorData = tf.tensor2d(uniqueRows.slice(1).map(row => keyColumns.map(i => parseFloat(row[i]))), [uniqueRows.length -1, keyColumns.length]);

    console.log(tensorData);
  }
});

```

Here, the duplicate check relies on a subset of columns (specified by `keyColumns`).  This prevents false negatives arising from variations in non-key columns. The `Map` data structure offers improved performance compared to `Set` for this approach. The header row is handled separately for better data integrity.


**Example 3: Handling Large CSV Files**

For extremely large CSV files, the in-memory processing demonstrated above becomes problematic.  Streaming is necessary.  This approach uses a simplified illustration; a robust implementation would require more sophisticated error handling and buffering.

```javascript
const fs = require('node:fs');
const { Transform } = require('node:stream');
const Papa = require('papaparse');

const keyColumns = [0,2]; // Indices of columns to consider for duplicate detection
const seenRows = new Map();
let uniqueRows = [];

const uniqueRowsStream = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    const rows = Papa.parse(chunk.toString(), { header: true, dynamicTyping: true }).data;
    for(const row of rows){
      const key = keyColumns.map(i => row[i]).join(',');
      if(!seenRows.has(key)){
        seenRows.set(key, row);
        uniqueRows.push(row);
      }
    }
    callback(null, '');
  }
});

fs.createReadStream('./large_data.csv').pipe(uniqueRowsStream).on('finish', () => {
  const tensorData = tf.tensor2d(uniqueRows.map(row => keyColumns.map(i => parseFloat(row[i]))), [uniqueRows.length, keyColumns.length]);
  console.log(tensorData)
});
```


This demonstrates a streaming approach utilizing Node.js's `fs` and `stream` modules.  Data is processed in chunks to avoid memory exhaustion.  The example requires a suitable CSV parser that can handle streaming.  Remember that this is a simplified example and would need adjustments for a production environment.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   **Papa Parse documentation:**  Thorough documentation on CSV parsing capabilities, including advanced features and performance considerations.
*   **TensorFlow.js API reference:**  Comprehensive documentation of TensorFlow.js functions and APIs for tensor manipulation and model building.
*   **JavaScript data structures and algorithms:**  Resources explaining efficient data structure choices for large-scale data processing.
*   **Node.js stream documentation:**  Information on using Node.js streams for efficient handling of large files.


Remember to install the necessary packages (`papaparse` and `@tensorflow/tfjs`) before running the code examples.  The choice of method for duplicate removal depends significantly on the nature and size of your dataset, and the definition of "duplicate" within the context of your problem.  Always prioritize efficient data preprocessing strategies for optimal performance in your TensorFlow.js workflow.
