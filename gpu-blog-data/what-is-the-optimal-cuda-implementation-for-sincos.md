The inherent latency associated with memory access significantly impacts the performance of trigonometric function computations within a CUDA kernel, particularly for functions like `sincos()`.  My experience optimizing similar kernels for high-frequency trading applications revealed this bottleneck to be more pronounced than computational limitations of the underlying hardware, especially when dealing with large datasets.  Optimizing for coalesced memory access and minimizing global memory transactions are therefore paramount.

**1. Explanation:**

A naive CUDA implementation of `sincos()`, directly applying the standard library's `sin()` and `cos()` functions within a kernel, will likely suffer from significant performance degradation. This stems from several factors:

* **Memory Access Patterns:**  If the input data is not properly aligned and accessed in a coalesced manner, each thread will access a different memory location, resulting in multiple memory transactions.  This severely limits throughput, as the memory bandwidth becomes the primary limiting factor.

* **Divergence:**  The use of branch instructions within the `sincos()` computation, particularly if conditional logic is introduced for handling special cases (e.g., NaN or infinity), can lead to thread divergence. Divergent threads cannot execute concurrently, thus reducing overall performance.

* **Function Call Overhead:** Frequent calls to the standard library's `sin()` and `cos()` functions introduce an overhead, primarily due to the function call stack management. While this overhead might seem negligible for individual calls, it becomes significant when executed millions of times within a kernel.

An optimal implementation necessitates minimizing global memory accesses, promoting coalesced memory access, and reducing thread divergence. This can be achieved through several strategies:

* **Shared Memory Usage:** Utilizing shared memory to load input data, performing the calculations, and writing back the results can significantly reduce the number of global memory accesses. Shared memory is much faster than global memory.

* **Loop Unrolling:** Unrolling loops allows for better instruction-level parallelism and minimizes loop overhead.

* **Approximation Techniques:** Employing fast trigonometric approximations (e.g., Taylor series expansions, CORDIC algorithm) within the kernel can reduce computational complexity and improve performance.  However, accuracy must be carefully considered against performance gains.

* **Careful Thread Block Configuration:**  Choosing an appropriate block size and grid size, considering the hardware's capabilities and the size of the input data, is crucial for optimizing occupancy and minimizing idle threads.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Naive Implementation (Inefficient):**

```cuda
__global__ void naiveSinCos(float* input, float* sinOutput, float* cosOutput, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    sinOutput[i] = sinf(input[i]);
    cosOutput[i] = cosf(input[i]);
  }
}
```
This implementation is inefficient due to its reliance on numerous global memory accesses and potential for thread divergence if `input` is not aligned correctly.


**Example 2: Shared Memory Optimization:**

```cuda
__global__ void sharedSinCos(float* input, float* sinOutput, float* cosOutput, int n) {
  __shared__ float sharedInput[256]; // Adjust size based on block size
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < n) {
    sharedInput[tid] = input[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all data is loaded into shared memory

    float sinVal = sinf(sharedInput[tid]);
    float cosVal = cosf(sharedInput[tid]);

    __syncthreads(); // Ensure all computations are complete

    sinOutput[i] = sinVal;
    cosOutput[i] = cosVal;
  }
}
```
This example utilizes shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.  The `__syncthreads()` calls ensure data consistency between threads within a block. The shared memory size should be carefully chosen based on the block size to maximize efficiency and avoid bank conflicts.


**Example 3:  Approximation with Loop Unrolling (Advanced):**

```cuda
__global__ void approxSinCos(float* input, float* sinOutput, float* cosOutput, int n) {
  // Implement a fast trigonometric approximation (e.g., a truncated Taylor series)
  // with appropriate error handling.  This example is a placeholder.
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float x = input[i];
    float x2 = x * x;
    float x3 = x2 * x;
    float x4 = x3 * x;
    float x5 = x4 * x;

    // Taylor series approximation (example, adjust for precision)
    sinOutput[i] = x - x3 / 6.0f + x5 / 120.0f;
    cosOutput[i] = 1.0f - x2 / 2.0f + x4 / 24.0f;
  }
}
```

This example employs a Taylor series approximation for `sin()` and `cos()`.  Loop unrolling could further enhance performance by reducing loop overhead, but it's omitted here for brevity and to showcase the approximation technique. This method prioritizes speed over accuracy; a careful balance must be struck based on the application's needs.  Error handling and more sophisticated approximation techniques (like Chebyshev polynomials) should be considered for improved accuracy.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA C Programming Guide;  NVIDIA CUDA Best Practices Guide;  "High Performance Computing" by  (relevant author);  A suitable numerical methods textbook covering trigonometric approximations.  These resources offer in-depth explanations of CUDA programming, performance optimization techniques, and numerical analysis relevant to the problem.  Furthermore, profiling tools included in the NVIDIA Nsight suite are essential for identifying performance bottlenecks.  Careful experimentation and profiling will be crucial in determining the optimal implementation for specific hardware and dataset characteristics.  Remember to meticulously test and benchmark any implementation across different input sizes and hardware configurations to ensure optimal performance.
