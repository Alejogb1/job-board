The unreliability of USR1 signals sent from background jobs to their parent Bash process stems fundamentally from the asynchronous nature of signal handling within the shell and the limitations of process inter-process communication (IPC) when background processes aren't explicitly designed for robust signal propagation.  My experience debugging high-throughput data pipelines has repeatedly highlighted this issue; relying on simple USR1 signals for inter-process communication in complex scripts is often a recipe for missed signals and inconsistent behavior.

**1.  Explanation:**

When a background job (e.g., launched with `&`) receives a USR1 signal, the shell manages its delivery. However, the shell's signal handling is not guaranteed to seamlessly propagate that signal to the parent process.  Several factors contribute to this unreliability:

* **Shell Job Control:** The shell employs job control mechanisms to manage background processes.  The signal might be handled by the shell itself, resulting in the parent process never receiving it.  This is especially true if the shell is busy executing other commands or if the signal arrives at a point where the parent process isn't actively waiting for signals.

* **Signal Queuing and Masking:**  The operating system's signal handling mechanism involves queuing and masking of signals. If the parent process's signal mask blocks USR1 signals, or if the signal queue overflows before the parent can process it, the signal will be lost.  This behavior is highly dependent on the system load and the timing of events.

* **Process Termination:**  If the background job terminates before it can send the USR1 signal, the signal is never sent, naturally leading to failure in the parent process.  Errors or unexpected exits in the child process are frequent causes of this.

* **Signal Delivery Semantics:** The way signals are delivered isn't strictly guaranteed to be instantaneous. There is a small, albeit usually negligible, amount of time between the child sending the signal and the parent receiving it, which may cause issues during periods of high system activity.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the problem and approaches to mitigate it, based on my experience building robust logging systems within Bash.

**Example 1:  Naive Approach (Unreliable):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

(sleep 5; kill -USR1 $$) &  # Background job sends USR1 after 5 seconds

trap 'echo "USR1 received by parent!"' USR1

echo "Parent process running..."
sleep 10
echo "Parent process exiting."
```

This simple example demonstrates the core problem. The background process attempts to send a USR1 signal to its parent (identified by `$$`), but there's no guarantee the parent will receive it. The timing is crucial, and even a slight delay can lead to a missed signal.

**Example 2:  Using a Pipe for Communication (More Reliable):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkfifo /tmp/mypipe  # Create a named pipe for communication

(sleep 5; echo "USR1 signal simulated" > /tmp/mypipe) &

trap 'read -r message < /tmp/mypipe; echo "Message received: $message"' USR1

echo "Parent process running..."
sleep 10
echo "Parent process exiting."
rm /tmp/mypipe  # Clean up the pipe
```

This approach avoids direct signal handling between processes. The background job writes a message to a named pipe, and the parent process uses a trap to read from the pipe when the USR1 signal is "simulated."  This provides better reliability compared to direct signal delivery, although it introduces the overhead of pipe creation and I/O.

**Example 3:  Improved Pipe Handling with Error Checking (Most Reliable):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkfifo /tmp/mypipe || exit 1  # Robust pipe creation

(sleep 5; echo "USR1 signal simulated" > /tmp/mypipe; exit 0) &
PID=$!

trap '
  if read -r message < /tmp/mypipe; then
    echo "Message received: $message"
  else
    echo "Error reading from pipe. Background job might have failed."
    exit 1
  fi' USR1

echo "Parent process running..."
sleep 10

# Check child process exit status
wait $PID
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Background job exited with error."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Parent process exiting."
rm /tmp/mypipe
```

This example refines the previous one by incorporating error handling. It checks the pipe for successful communication, and importantly, it verifies the exit status of the background process using `wait`. This approach provides a more robust mechanism to detect failures in the background job and prevents spurious messages or missed signals, representing a significant improvement over Example 1.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Consult the `signal(7)` man page for details on signal handling in Unix-like systems. Understanding signal masking and queuing is crucial for reliable inter-process communication.
*   Study advanced Bash scripting resources, emphasizing process management and inter-process communication techniques.
*   Explore the documentation for your specific shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.) to understand its unique handling of signals and background processes.  There might be subtle variations in behavior across different shells.  Consider adopting consistent shell usage practices.

In conclusion, while USR1 signals might seem a convenient mechanism for inter-process communication, their unreliability in the context described necessitates a more robust approach. Utilizing named pipes with comprehensive error checking, as illustrated in Example 3, is a considerably more reliable method for ensuring communication between a parent Bash process and its background child processes.  Relying on signal delivery alone without additional mechanisms to check success is likely to result in unpredictable behavior and potential failures in your scripts.
