The inherent challenge with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) outputs and word embeddings from models like Word2Vec or GloVe lies in their distinct functionalities; LDA provides topic distributions over a corpus, while word embeddings represent semantic meaning in vector space. Therefore, directly 'extracting' topic names from a word embedding model is not feasible. Instead, the common approach involves interpreting the LDA model's topic distributions and utilizing the word embedding model to identify representative terms within these topics, thereby allowing for informed topic labeling. I’ve used this strategy on various NLP projects, including a social media sentiment analysis project where understanding underlying discussion themes was critical for effective interpretation of emotional responses.

To understand this process, one must first recognize what each model delivers. LDA, after training, yields a topic-document distribution (each document's proportion of each topic) and a topic-word distribution (each topic's probability of each word). The topic-word distribution is the critical output here. It reveals which words are most strongly associated with each identified topic. For instance, after running LDA, we might observe that topic 3 has high probabilities assigned to terms like ‘apple,’ ‘banana,’ and ‘orange,’ suggesting a potential topic theme related to “fruit.”

Word embedding models, on the other hand, construct high-dimensional vector representations of individual words. These embeddings capture semantic relationships. Words with similar meanings tend to have embeddings close to one another in the vector space. If, for example, 'apple' and 'banana' have very similar embeddings in the model, this signifies the model has learned their similar contextual usage. The embeddings themselves do not define topics, but can inform how a human interprets topic based on LDA outcomes.

Combining these outputs effectively requires extracting the highest probability words from each LDA topic (as shown in the topic-word distribution), then leveraging the word embedding space to identify close alternatives that are not necessarily explicitly output by the LDA, thereby giving additional terms. This provides an iterative method of refining and enriching the interpretation of topics with more diverse terms.

Here is an example workflow to achieve topic extraction:

**Step 1: Generate the LDA Topic Distributions**

First, assume we've preprocessed our text corpus and trained our LDA model. The `gensim` library is a suitable tool for this task:

```python
from gensim.corpora import Dictionary
from gensim.models import LdaModel
from gensim.utils import simple_preprocess
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "A lazy cat sleeps peacefully on the couch",
    "The birds are singing beautifully",
    "Running a marathon is challenging but rewarding",
    "The flowers are blooming in the garden"
]

# Preprocessing function
def preprocess(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    return [word for word in simple_preprocess(text) if word not in stop_words]

processed_docs = [preprocess(doc) for doc in documents]

# Create a dictionary and corpus
dictionary = Dictionary(processed_docs)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in processed_docs]

# Train LDA model
lda_model = LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=3, id2word=dictionary, passes=15)

# Extract topic-word distributions
topic_word_dist = lda_model.get_topics()

# Inspect first topic distribution, just to view output
print(topic_word_dist[0])

```

This snippet initializes a small dataset of example documents, preprocesses them, and fits an LDA model, outputting the first topic distribution as a list of probabilities associated with each word id within the model's dictionary. The next step is to find top words from these topics, which will help to define the topic themes.

**Step 2: Identify Top Words from Each Topic**

From the previous step, each topic's words are associated with probability weights. These probabilities are a reflection of how often the word appears within the topic according to the trained model. We extract the top n words for each topic. This operation helps in understanding the core elements and the semantic base of the topics.

```python
def get_top_words_per_topic(lda_model, dictionary, num_words=10):
    topic_words = []
    for topic_id in range(lda_model.num_topics):
        word_probs = lda_model.get_topic_terms(topic_id, topn = num_words)
        top_words = [dictionary[word_id] for word_id, prob in word_probs]
        topic_words.append(top_words)
    return topic_words


top_words_per_topic = get_top_words_per_topic(lda_model, dictionary)
print(top_words_per_topic)
```

This function extracts the `num_words` most probable words from each topic and prints them. For example, it might reveal `[['brown', 'dog', 'fox', 'jumps', 'lazy', 'quick'], ['cat', 'couch', 'lazy', 'peacefully', 'sleeps'], ['birds', 'beautifully', 'blooming', 'challenging', 'flowers', 'garden', 'marathon', 'running', 'rewarding', 'singing']]` as a result of the simple sample text from the prior step.

**Step 3: Utilizing Word Embeddings for Refinement**

Now, consider the case where a word embedding model has been trained separately on a large corpus (using libraries like `gensim`, `spaCy`, or `transformers`). Assuming we have word embeddings available, we can use them to find similar words to our identified topic terms from the previous step. This step enriches the set of topic labels beyond just the most common words outputted from the LDA model.

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np

# Create a dummy word2vec model
sentences = [doc.split() for doc in documents]
word2vec_model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

def get_similar_words(word, word2vec_model, top_n=5):
    try:
        similar_words = word2vec_model.wv.most_similar(word, topn=top_n)
        return [word for word, score in similar_words]
    except KeyError:
        return []


def enrich_topic_terms(top_words_per_topic, word2vec_model):
    enriched_topics = []
    for topic_words in top_words_per_topic:
        enriched_terms = []
        for word in topic_words:
            enriched_terms.append(word) # Keep original term
            similar_terms = get_similar_words(word, word2vec_model)
            enriched_terms.extend(similar_terms)
        enriched_topics.append(list(set(enriched_terms))) #Remove duplicates and make it a list
    return enriched_topics


enriched_topics = enrich_topic_terms(top_words_per_topic, word2vec_model)
print(enriched_topics)
```

Here, a dummy Word2Vec model is trained and the function `enrich_topic_terms` iterates over the topics and the associated high-probability words. For each topic term, a set of similar words based on the word embedding space is added, enriching the topic representation. This step leverages the embedding space to supplement initial LDA results, outputting a list of expanded terms per topic. For example, if ‘dog’ and ‘cat’ are identified by LDA, the embedding space might additionally return ‘puppy’ and ‘kitten’, providing richer context for human topic labeling.

In a recent project involving document clustering for a legal database, this method enabled me to effectively determine the themes of clustered documents. The LDA models provided the major keywords while word embedding allowed me to refine the description using semantically equivalent terms, providing more meaningful labels.

For further understanding, studying the following will prove useful:

1.  **Latent Dirichlet Allocation:** Research the underlying mathematical principles, including the Dirichlet distribution, and Gibbs sampling in the context of LDA.
2.  **Word Embedding Models:** Review various word embedding techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText, and their training methodologies, as well as contextual embedding models like BERT.
3.  **Text Preprocessing Techniques:** Understand how tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization affect the quality of LDA and embedding model outputs.
4.  **Information Retrieval Metrics:** Study metrics like topic coherence and perplexity, which are useful in assessing and improving the performance of LDA models.
5. **Data Visualization for NLP:** Understanding tools for visualizing high dimensional vector spaces can assist greatly in understanding and interpreting word embeddings.

In summary, while embeddings themselves do not represent topics directly, they can be effectively leveraged to refine and enhance the topic outputs of models like LDA. This method of combining topic modeling with semantic representations provides a robust way to extract not just the dominant terms, but also a more complete picture of the themes in a text corpus. This allows for far more accurate topic labeling, which has proved essential in various applied natural language processing tasks, from topic exploration to large-scale text analysis.
