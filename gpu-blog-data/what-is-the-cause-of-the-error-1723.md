The error "172:3: Message type 'object_detection.protos.TrainConfig' has no field named 'fine_tune_checkpoint_version'" specifically arises during the configuration of object detection models, often within frameworks like TensorFlow Object Detection API. It indicates a mismatch between the expected structure of the `TrainConfig` protocol buffer message, as defined in your configuration file (typically a `pipeline.config`), and the version of the protocol buffer definitions (the `.proto` files) your system is utilizing. This occurs when a configuration attempts to set the `fine_tune_checkpoint_version` field, but that specific field is not defined within the `TrainConfig` message of the protoc compiler and library being used.

The root cause is usually one of the following scenarios:

1.  **Incompatible Protocol Buffer Definitions:** The `.proto` files that define the `TrainConfig` message might not align with the version expected by the TensorFlow Object Detection API installation you're using. Specifically, `fine_tune_checkpoint_version` was added in later versions of the Object Detection API. If you're using older `.proto` files, or a version of the API that predates its introduction, this field will not be available in the message definition, resulting in the observed error.

2.  **Stale Installation:** An outdated version of the TensorFlow Object Detection API might be employed, particularly the `object_detection` module in TensorFlow's models repository. The necessary protocol buffer definitions may not have been updated to include the `fine_tune_checkpoint_version` field during your setup. The installed version is not aligned with the configuration file.

3.  **User Configuration Error:** Although less likely, there is a chance that a typo exists when setting up the config file. A user error could lead to referencing the 'fine_tune_checkpoint_version' in configuration file when not intending to.

To resolve this, I've typically found myself needing to address the underlying protocol buffer definition issue or the installation state. Here are some examples that illustrate the problem and possible solutions:

**Example 1: Identifying the Error**

Let's assume a user has a `pipeline.config` file that includes the following relevant section:

```protobuf
train_config {
  batch_size: 32
  optimizer {
    momentum_optimizer {
      learning_rate {
        cosine_decay_learning_rate {
          learning_rate_base: 0.03
          total_steps: 100000
          warmup_learning_rate: 0.001
          warmup_steps: 1000
        }
      }
      momentum_optimizer_value: 0.9
    }
  }
  fine_tune_checkpoint: "path/to/checkpoint"
  fine_tune_checkpoint_type: "detection"
  fine_tune_checkpoint_version: V2  // This line causes the error
  num_steps: 100000
  data_augmentation_options {
    random_horizontal_flip {
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration includes `fine_tune_checkpoint_version: V2`, which, if used with an older Object Detection API, will throw the error. The `fine_tune_checkpoint_version` field was not present in earlier versions. Upon launching a model training job using this configuration, the "172:3" error would appear during the parsing and validation phase of the configuration. The system is trying to find the field in the protobuffer object and cannot.

**Example 2: Resolution by Removing the Field**

A quick fix, if the fine-tune checkpoint version is not a critical requirement for your specific use case, is to remove the problematic line:

```protobuf
train_config {
  batch_size: 32
  optimizer {
    momentum_optimizer {
      learning_rate {
        cosine_decay_learning_rate {
          learning_rate_base: 0.03
          total_steps: 100000
          warmup_learning_rate: 0.001
          warmup_steps: 1000
        }
      }
      momentum_optimizer_value: 0.9
    }
  }
  fine_tune_checkpoint: "path/to/checkpoint"
  fine_tune_checkpoint_type: "detection"
  // fine_tune_checkpoint_version: V2    // Removed
  num_steps: 100000
  data_augmentation_options {
    random_horizontal_flip {
    }
  }
}
```

By deleting the line with  `fine_tune_checkpoint_version`, the parser is no longer looking for that specific field and can load the configuration correctly. This solution is effective if you are not concerned about specifying the version of the checkpoint used for fine-tuning, in most standard object detection tasks. However, the better way is to resolve the actual mismatch.

**Example 3: Resolving by Updating the Object Detection API**

The ideal approach involves updating the TensorFlow Object Detection API to its latest version. The following steps assume a Python environment setup with `pip`. I generally start by checking the current version:

```python
import object_detection

print(object_detection.__version__)
```

Let's say the current version printed is an older version, like `0.1`. After verifying the current installation, I'd upgrade it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-object-detection-api
```

This command will update the object detection package including it's proto definitions which resolves the mismatch.  After this step, it is important to ensure that the protocol buffers are compiled.  This is done using protoc. A complete command I tend to use is:

```bash
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
```

This step is crucial for the changes made to the protocol buffer definition files to be reflected. Following the update and re-compilation, the original `pipeline.config` file from Example 1 (with `fine_tune_checkpoint_version`) should now function correctly. This fixes the underlying cause of the error by aligning the config and definitions. It allows the user to select the checkpoint version they are looking for.

**Recommendation:**

If faced with "172:3," I strongly recommend starting by **verifying the version** of your TensorFlow Object Detection API installation. Often, simply updating to the latest available release is sufficient. Second, ensure that **the protocol buffers have been recompiled** after making version changes, this ensures that the necessary message definitions are available.  Lastly, be aware of **typos in config files** when defining the parameters.

For further reference, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow Object Detection API documentation available on the TensorFlow website. Also, examine the `object_detection/protos` directory within the source of the Object Detection API, as these `.proto` files define the structure and contents of messages like `TrainConfig`. Additionally, consulting the change logs of the TensorFlow Models repository can provide insight into when specific features, like `fine_tune_checkpoint_version`, were introduced. The protocol buffer documentation is also an important resource to understand the structure of protobuffer messages and how to properly define them in config files.
