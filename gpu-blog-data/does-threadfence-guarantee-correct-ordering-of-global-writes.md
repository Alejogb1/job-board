The `__threadfence()` instruction, while crucial for managing memory access in multithreaded environments, does *not* guarantee the globally consistent ordering of all writes across all threads.  My experience debugging concurrent data structures in high-performance C++ applications has highlighted this subtlety repeatedly.  It provides ordering guarantees *only* within the scope of the memory model it operates under;  it's fundamentally a synchronization primitive for a specific memory location's visibility, not a total ordering solution for all global memory.  A thorough understanding requires examining both the hardware memory model and the compiler's handling of memory fences.

**1. Explanation:**

The behavior of `__threadfence()` (or similar intrinsics like `atomic_thread_fence` in C++11 and later) hinges on the underlying hardware's memory model. These fences act as barriers, enforcing ordering constraints on memory operations *before* and *after* the fence.  Crucially, however, this ordering is generally limited to memory operations *visible* to the same thread.  Different threads might observe writes in different orders, even if fences are present in each thread's execution path.

The compiler, too, plays a significant role. Optimizations like instruction reordering can scramble the apparent order of memory operations unless explicitly prevented by fences.  The compiler is permitted, under the C++ memory model (and similar models in other languages), to reorder instructions, as long as the observed behavior remains consistent with a sequentially consistent execution.  A fence constrains the compiler's freedom to reorder certain instructions, but not those outside its reach.

To ensure globally consistent ordering of all global writes, stronger synchronization mechanisms are necessary, such as mutexes, atomic operations with stronger ordering semantics (e.g., `std::atomic<T>::store` with `std::memory_order_seq_cst`), or explicit barriers that coordinate multiple threads.  `__threadfence()` provides a level of control within a single thread's memory operations, but it does not provide global synchronization across threads.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the limitations of `__threadfence()`**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> global_a(0);
std::atomic<int> global_b(0);

void thread_func() {
    global_a = 1;
    __threadfence(); // Fence after writing to global_a
    global_b = 2;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(thread_func);
    t.join();
    // The following check might fail:
    if (global_a.load() != 1 || global_b.load() != 2) {
        std::cerr << "Unexpected order of writes!\n";
    }
    std::cout << "global_a: " << global_a.load() << ", global_b: " << global_b.load() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates a potential ordering issue. Even with the `__threadfence()`, another thread might observe `global_b` as 2 *before* `global_a` as 1, because the fence only affects ordering within the `thread_func` thread.  Another thread observing these global variables lacks the same ordering constraint.


**Example 2: Achieving correct ordering with atomic operations and stronger ordering semantics**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> global_a(0);
std::atomic<int> global_b(0);

void thread_func() {
    global_a.store(1, std::memory_order_seq_cst);
    global_b.store(2, std::memory_order_seq_cst);
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(thread_func);
    t.join();
    if (global_a.load() != 1 || global_b.load() != 2) {
        std::cerr << "Unexpected order of writes!\n";
    }
    std::cout << "global_a: " << global_a.load() << ", global_b: " << global_b.load() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** Using `std::memory_order_seq_cst` (sequentially consistent) ensures that all threads observe the same order of writes to the atomic variables. This achieves global ordering, something `__threadfence()` alone cannot guarantee.


**Example 3: Using mutexes for mutual exclusion**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

int global_a = 0;
int global_b = 0;
std::mutex mtx;

void thread_func() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    global_a = 1;
    global_b = 2;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(thread_func);
    t.join();
    if (global_a != 1 || global_b != 2) {
        std::cerr << "Unexpected order of writes!\n";
    }
    std::cout << "global_a: " << global_a << ", global_b: " << global_b << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example uses a mutex (`std::mutex`) to serialize access to the global variables.  The `std::lock_guard` ensures that only one thread can modify `global_a` and `global_b` at a time, guaranteeing consistent ordering.  This is a more robust approach than relying solely on memory fences for global ordering.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of memory models and synchronization primitives, I strongly recommend consulting the relevant sections of the C++ standard (particularly concerning the memory model and atomic operations).  Furthermore, a comprehensive text on concurrent programming and multithreading would prove invaluable.  Finally, detailed documentation specific to your compiler's handling of memory fences and atomic operations is crucial for practical application.  Understanding the nuances of your target architecture's memory model will significantly aid in correctly utilizing these synchronization techniques.
