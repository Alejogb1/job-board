The prevalence of NaN (Not a Number) values during training with ReLU activations, while comparatively rare with tanh, stems from a fundamental difference in their behavior across the input domain, specifically in relation to extreme values and subsequent gradient propagation. ReLU's unbounded positive range, coupled with its zero-output for negative inputs, creates conditions conducive to exploding activations and vanishing gradients which, when coupled, can lead to NaN outputs. Tanh's bounded nature, however, mitigates such issues.

ReLU, defined as *f(x) = max(0, x)*, introduces a sharp discontinuity at *x = 0*. For any input less than zero, the output is precisely zero, while for any input greater than zero, the output equals the input. During backpropagation, the gradient for inputs less than zero is zero. This creates a "dead ReLU" problem where the neuron ceases to learn, as its weights are no longer updated by gradients. While problematic, this alone does not directly cause NaNs. However, consider what happens when a neuron receives a large positive input, potentially due to poor initialization, or an overly large learning rate. Given the ReLU is unbounded for positive values, this can result in exploding activations as these large values propagate through the network. When these exploding activations are subsequently multiplied by weights during forward passes, or combined with large gradients during backpropagation, numerical overflows can occur. If, during backpropagation, this overflow combines with another numerically unstable operation such as division or the logarithm of zero, NaN outputs can arise.

In contrast, the hyperbolic tangent function, *tanh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)*, produces an output bounded between -1 and 1. This bounded output has two direct consequences. First, the magnitudes of activations cannot explode indefinitely, mitigating one of the primary drivers for NaN production in ReLU networks. Secondly, the derivative of tanh, *1 - tanh^2(x)*, is never exactly zero, and will always propagate a gradient, albeit it does decrease towards zero as the input approaches ±∞ . This helps to avoid the 'dead neuron' issue that plagues ReLU networks. Furthermore, numerical instability is less likely since all values, including activation outputs and gradients, stay within a limited range.

My experience building image classification models taught me that the choice of activation function was crucial. Early attempts using ReLU resulted in a large portion of the training batches returning NaN, particularly during the early epochs. Conversely, training the exact same network with tanh produced stable, albeit often slower, results. Further debugging pointed towards a combination of very large initial weight values alongside the ReLU's unbounded nature as a primary cause.

To illustrate, consider a simplified dense layer with a single neuron and a single input, and the application of both activation functions. Assume that the initial weight is a large value, and we'll examine the forward and backward pass.

**Example 1: ReLU Behavior**

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def relu_derivative(x):
    return np.where(x > 0, 1, 0)

# Simulation of a single neuron and a large initial weight
input_value = 1  # Input value
weight = 1000     # Large Initial Weight
bias = 0
learning_rate = 0.01

# Forward pass
z = (input_value * weight) + bias  # Pre-activation
activation = relu(z)             # Activation function

print(f"Forward Pass with ReLU:")
print(f"  Pre-activation (z): {z}")
print(f"  Activation Output: {activation}")

# Backpropagation (Simplified)
gradient_activation = 1  # Assume some gradient coming from a later layer (simplified for the demo)
gradient_z = gradient_activation * relu_derivative(z) # Gradient of the preactivation
gradient_weight = input_value * gradient_z
weight -= learning_rate * gradient_weight

print(f"Backpropagation Pass with ReLU:")
print(f" Gradient of the pre-activation: {gradient_z}")
print(f" Updated weight: {weight}")

# Hypothetical repeat forward pass, note that the value will continue to grow
z = (input_value * weight) + bias
activation = relu(z)
print(f"Next Forward Pass Pre-activation: {z}")
print(f"Next Forward Pass Output: {activation}")
```

This example demonstrates the large outputs arising from the ReLU function, with very small values only when the preactivation is negative. As the training loop continues, and the gradients become larger, the potential for even larger activations becomes evident. As noted previously, such large numbers can eventually trigger numerical overflow and NaN outputs if they are handled improperly.

**Example 2: Tanh Behavior**

```python
import numpy as np

def tanh(x):
    return np.tanh(x)

def tanh_derivative(x):
  return 1 - np.tanh(x)**2

input_value = 1
weight = 1000
bias = 0
learning_rate = 0.01

# Forward pass
z = (input_value * weight) + bias
activation = tanh(z)

print(f"Forward Pass with Tanh:")
print(f"  Pre-activation (z): {z}")
print(f"  Activation Output: {activation}")

# Backpropagation pass (Simplified)
gradient_activation = 1
gradient_z = gradient_activation * tanh_derivative(z)
gradient_weight = input_value * gradient_z
weight -= learning_rate * gradient_weight

print(f"Backpropagation Pass with Tanh:")
print(f" Gradient of the pre-activation: {gradient_z}")
print(f" Updated weight: {weight}")

# Hypothetical repeat forward pass
z = (input_value * weight) + bias
activation = tanh(z)
print(f"Next Forward Pass Pre-activation: {z}")
print(f"Next Forward Pass Output: {activation}")
```

This example highlights the bounded output of the tanh function. Note that despite the large weight, the activation output is constrained between -1 and 1. Consequently, the gradient, and consequently the weight updates, will be less susceptible to numerical overflow. The tanh function's behavior means that each calculation is more likely to produce a stable number and thus reduces the chance of NaN values.

**Example 3: A Case of Initial Weights**

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def relu_derivative(x):
    return np.where(x > 0, 1, 0)

def simulate_nan_potential(initial_weight, input_value):
    weight = initial_weight
    bias = 0
    learning_rate = 0.01
    z = (input_value * weight) + bias
    activation = relu(z)
    gradient_activation = 1
    gradient_z = gradient_activation * relu_derivative(z)
    gradient_weight = input_value * gradient_z
    weight -= learning_rate * gradient_weight
    z = (input_value * weight) + bias
    return z

initial_weights = [1, 100, 1000]
input_value = 1
for weight in initial_weights:
    result = simulate_nan_potential(weight, input_value)
    print(f"Resulting z after a single pass, with initial weight = {weight}: {result}")
```

This code block illustrates how a single forward and backward pass can cause a large change to the pre-activation value when combined with a larger weight, and by extension the activation value, if the initial weight is poorly initialized. If we imagine the forward pass of a large neural network, it is easy to see how this situation could arise, and if the result of this preactivation or activation becomes too large, then it can become an infinite, or NaN, and propagate throughout the network.

Based on my experience, to mitigate ReLU's propensity for producing NaNs, several practical steps can be implemented. Primarily, using proper weight initialization techniques like Xavier or He initialization can significantly reduce the likelihood of overly large initial activations. Secondly, careful selection of the learning rate is essential; if too large, the gradients might cause weights to rapidly explode to very high or very low values. Experimenting with batch normalization can also help regularize the activation magnitudes. Finally, if ReLU is essential for the model, then one may opt to use a different variant of ReLU that limits unbounded activations, such as Leaky ReLU or ELU. These variants prevent the "dead neuron" problem while also limiting the potential for large activations.

Regarding resource recommendations for further study, I found "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville provides an excellent theoretical background on activation functions. "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen offers a more practical perspective. Additionally, many open-source deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, have extensive documentation that further outlines optimal use cases for each function. Consulting these references can provide a deeper understanding of activation functions and their impact on training stability.
