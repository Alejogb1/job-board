The `tf.estimator.Estimator` class, and by extension, the `tf.learn` module's core functionality, is designed to maintain a strict separation between the *TensorFlow graph* and the *Python environment* within which the graph is constructed and executed. Direct access to graph-level attributes through a `python` attribute, though seemingly intuitive, circumvents this separation and can lead to significant issues related to graph re-creation, resource management, and portability across different execution environments, including distributed setups. Instead, the intended approach involves utilizing the `Estimator`'s API for data access, model evaluation, and exporting.

The primary problem arises when developers attempt to directly access attributes of the underlying `ModelFnOps` (or similar internal objects) constructed during the estimator's `model_fn` execution. These internal objects are fundamentally TensorFlow graph elements, and the Python side of the `Estimator` should not directly interact with them in a way that assumes a persistent, single instance. For example, attempting to store the result of an intermediate operation within a tensor inside an attribute after the `model_fn` has been executed does not maintain the correct structure of TensorFlow's execution pattern, potentially causing the graph to become invalid or produce unexpected results when the estimator's `train`, `evaluate`, or `predict` methods are used.

The `Estimator` pattern instead encourages a declarative approach. The developer should specify within the `model_fn` the various tensors required for training, evaluation, and prediction, and rely on the `Estimator`'s mechanisms to properly fetch, execute, and output these tensors during the respective phases of model lifecycle. Data is fed into the graph through `tf.data.Dataset` objects (or other input function mechanisms) and these tensors are accessed via dictionary outputs of the functions. Thus, if, for instance, you need the loss tensor for some custom reporting during training, you should declare it as part of the `ModelFnOps`' return dictionary. I have seen attempts to access those elements outside the execution context with the expectation that those values are Python values associated to some class property. This misses the mark: TensorFlow values are managed under-the-hood and are only extracted as concrete values when they are executed within a TensorFlow session.

Consider a scenario where I wanted to access the output of a specific layer inside of my custom model function. A common pitfall is attempting to retrieve that tensor as if it was an available Python object as shown in the first code snippet below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # Assume a simple linear model
    dense = tf.layers.dense(features, units=10, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    output = tf.layers.dense(dense, units=1)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        predictions = {'output': output}
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)

    loss = tf.losses.mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=output)
    optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())

    eval_metric_ops = {"mse": tf.metrics.mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=output)}
    
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op,
                                        eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)

# Invalid pattern
class MyEstimator(tf.estimator.Estimator):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.dense_output = None  # Attempt to store a tensor.

    def _call_model_fn(self, features, labels, mode, config):
        model_ops = super()._call_model_fn(features, labels, mode, config)
        if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN: # Incorrect condition: will only be done once.
            self.dense_output = model_ops.predictions['output']  # Attempt to capture the tensor.
        return model_ops

# Fictitious data
def my_input_fn(mode, batch_size):
    features = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 5))
    labels = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 1))
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels))
    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
       dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10).batch(batch_size).repeat()
    else:
       dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

estimator = MyEstimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, model_dir="./model_test")
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: my_input_fn(mode=tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN, batch_size=32), steps=100)

# This is an error: self.dense_output has not been assigned
#print("Example output:", estimator.dense_output)
```

This approach *seems* to work on the surface, because the `_call_model_fn` is executed, and `self.dense_output` is assigned. But this is misleading. `model_ops.predictions['output']` contains a TensorFlow tensor that will need to be fetched from a TensorFlow graph inside of a session. It's not accessible directly through the `self.dense_output` attribute. The tensor is a symbolic representation of the underlying computation and does not contain numeric values until it is evaluated within a session. The assignment of the tensor to `self.dense_output` won't perform any session execution; we would need a `Session.run` operation, which is outside the scope of the Estimator API. The `_call_model_fn` is called internally as part of the training operation, but it's only called once, therefore this is a mistake in design.

The proper way of obtaining internal values from the `model_fn` involves leveraging the `EstimatorSpec` output. The second code snippet demonstrates a correct approach to retrieve a tensor from the model output during the prediction phase, using the Estimator's `predict` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
   # Assume a simple linear model
    dense = tf.layers.dense(features, units=10, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    output = tf.layers.dense(dense, units=1)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        predictions = {'output': output, 'dense_output': dense}
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)

    loss = tf.losses.mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=output)
    optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())

    eval_metric_ops = {"mse": tf.metrics.mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=output)}

    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op,
                                        eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, model_dir="./model_test")
# Fictitious data
def my_input_fn(mode, batch_size):
    features = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 5))
    labels = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 1))
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels))
    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
       dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10).batch(batch_size).repeat()
    else:
       dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: my_input_fn(mode=tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN, batch_size=32), steps=100)
# This is correct, as the output of the prediction is a numpy iterator.
predictions_iterator = estimator.predict(input_fn=lambda: my_input_fn(mode=tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT, batch_size=1))

for prediction in predictions_iterator:
    print("Example output of the last layer:", prediction['dense_output'])
```

In this corrected version, the intermediate layer's output is included in the `predictions` dictionary within the `PREDICT` mode. Instead of attempting to capture the tensor during model construction, the tensor is retrieved as a concrete value during the predict operation, as it provides an iterator of numpy arrays of the output tensors defined within the `predictions` dictionary.

Another common scenario involves attempting to obtain a training metric. The evaluation metrics are similarly not intended to be captured through a separate attribute of the estimator. Instead, they are accessible through the `evaluate` method. The third code example demonstrates a basic evaluation call:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
def my_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
   # Assume a simple linear model
    dense = tf.layers.dense(features, units=10, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    output = tf.layers.dense(dense, units=1)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        predictions = {'output': output, 'dense_output': dense}
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)

    loss = tf.losses.mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=output)
    optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())

    eval_metric_ops = {"mse": tf.metrics.mean_squared_error(labels=labels, predictions=output)}

    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op,
                                        eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, model_dir="./model_test")

# Fictitious data
def my_input_fn(mode, batch_size):
    features = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 5))
    labels = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 1))
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels))
    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
       dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10).batch(batch_size).repeat()
    else:
       dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset
    
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: my_input_fn(mode=tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN, batch_size=32), steps=100)
evaluation_result = estimator.evaluate(input_fn=lambda: my_input_fn(mode=tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL, batch_size=32))
print("Evaluation Results:", evaluation_result)
```

Here, the evaluation results, including the MSE, are returned as a dictionary by the `evaluate` function. This is consistent with the intended design of the `Estimator` where data is extracted through designated methods. Attempting to obtain these results via a class attribute will not correctly capture the required session execution required.

For a more in-depth understanding of best practices regarding TensorFlow estimators, I would recommend examining the official TensorFlow documentation on Estimators. Additionally, studying examples of custom `model_fn` implementations from trusted sources will solidify a good grasp on this concept. Finally, exploring the official tutorials on datasets can clarify the best practices on feeding input data to the `Estimator`.
