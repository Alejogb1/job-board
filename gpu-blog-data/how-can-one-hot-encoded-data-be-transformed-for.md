One-hot encoding, while ideal for representing categorical variables for many machine learning models, presents a challenge when integrating with datasets that utilize numerical, ordinal, or otherwise non-one-hot features. The core issue arises from the dimensional mismatch; one-hot encoded data drastically expands the feature space compared to its categorical source, creating an incompatibility for direct concatenation or joint processing with other features. My experience building a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform highlighted this difficulty when combining user demographics (initially encoded categorically) with product purchase history (represented numerically as frequency). A simple concatenation led to severely imbalanced feature importance and model instability. The solution required transforming the one-hot data into a representation that aligns with the characteristics of the non-one-hot features.

The key to transforming one-hot encoded data lies in understanding that the essence of one-hot encoding is representation, not a data type in itself. It's a way of encoding categorical information into a format that can be consumed by algorithms that typically expect numerical input. This means we have options beyond simply combining features and dealing with the resulting dimensionality issues. The correct transformation depends heavily on the context and the specific goals of the application. Generally, we're aiming to extract useful numerical information from the categorical encoding and make it compatible for use alongside other numerical features. The most common approaches include aggregation, projection, and embedding.

**1. Aggregation:** Aggregation involves combining the one-hot encoded columns into a single, more meaningful, numerical representation. The type of aggregation chosen depends on the specific categorical feature. For instance, if you have one-hot encoded geographic regions (e.g., "Region_North," "Region_South," "Region_East," "Region_West"), and you also have numerical user purchase totals, one could group user purchases by the region using the one-hot encoded region indicators. The result of this grouping operation produces a series of numerical values. Consider the following scenario using Python and Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample one-hot encoded data and numerical data
data = {
    'user_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'Region_North': [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    'Region_South': [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    'Region_East':  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    'Region_West':  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    'purchase_total': [150, 220, 80, 300, 180, 110, 450, 250, 90, 200]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a 'region' column using one-hot encoded columns
region_columns = ['Region_North', 'Region_South', 'Region_East', 'Region_West']
df['region'] = df[region_columns].idxmax(axis=1).str.replace('Region_', '')

# Aggregate purchase totals by region
region_purchase_data = df.groupby('region')['purchase_total'].agg(['sum', 'mean', 'count']).reset_index()
print(region_purchase_data)
```

This snippet showcases how to transform one-hot regional data into aggregated purchase information like total spending, average spending, and user count per region. This provides meaningful numerical information derived from one-hot encoding which is readily used alongside features such as age, income, or the like. I found this type of aggregation crucial in my project for creating feature vectors representing user behavior within different categories. The `idxmax` function is particularly effective in identifying the active category.

**2. Projection:** Another method involves projecting the high-dimensional one-hot encoded data into a lower-dimensional numerical space, effectively creating new features that capture most of the variance in the one-hot encoded data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a standard technique to achieve this. The idea is that the PCA will capture the most variance in the original one hot encoded columns, reducing the number of features while still preserving informative data.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assuming we have the same dataframe 'df' from the previous example
one_hot_columns = ['Region_North', 'Region_South', 'Region_East', 'Region_West']

# Scale the one-hot data before applying PCA (generally recommended)
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_one_hot = scaler.fit_transform(df[one_hot_columns])

# Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality
pca = PCA(n_components=2) # Reduces to 2 components
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(scaled_one_hot)

# Convert the PCA components to a dataframe and join it back to the original data
pca_df = pd.DataFrame(data = principal_components, columns = ['pca_1', 'pca_2'])
df = pd.concat([df, pca_df], axis = 1)

print(df[['user_id', 'pca_1', 'pca_2']])
```

Here, we use `StandardScaler` before `PCA` to ensure all one-hot encoded features have zero mean and unit variance. This normalization step is crucial for algorithms such as PCA that are based on calculating variance. The `n_components` parameter controls the dimensionality of the reduced data. I utilized this technique to reduce a very high number of product categories into a more digestible low-dimensional representation, preventing 'curse of dimensionality' issues. The resulting 'pca_1' and 'pca_2' columns can be treated like any other numeric feature.

**3. Embedding:** Embedding techniques are often used with high-cardinality categorical data but can also be applied to one-hot encoded features. The core concept involves learning a dense vector representation for each unique category. This can involve neural network-based approaches (like autoencoders) or simpler techniques, such as dimensionality reduction with non-linear algorithms. The output is a lower dimensional dense vector for each category, that can be used as a representation. This is extremely helpful, since instead of a binary presence or absence of a given category, we now have a more nuanced numerical value. Here's an example using a simple autoencoder:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Using our dataframe with region data
X = torch.tensor(df[one_hot_columns].values, dtype=torch.float32)

# Define a simple autoencoder
class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, encoding_dim):
        super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(input_dim, encoding_dim)
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(encoding_dim, input_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        encoded = torch.relu(self.encoder(x))
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return decoded, encoded

# Initialize model, loss function, optimizer
input_dim = X.shape[1]
encoding_dim = 2
model = Autoencoder(input_dim, encoding_dim)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Create dataset and dataloader
dataset = TensorDataset(X, X)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 2000
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_x, _ in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs, encoded_output = model(batch_x)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch_x)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Extract the embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    _, embeddings = model(X)
embeddings_np = embeddings.numpy()
embedding_df = pd.DataFrame(embeddings_np, columns=['embedding_1','embedding_2'])
df = pd.concat([df, embedding_df], axis=1)
print(df[['user_id', 'embedding_1', 'embedding_2']])

```
This approach constructs an autoencoder and trains it to reconstruct the input data. The intermediate layer ('encoding_dim') in the model provides a compressed, numerical embedding. In my previous project, I used autoencoder embeddings to convert one-hot encoded product attributes into dense vectors for similarity calculations. This provided a more flexible and contextually rich representation compared to one-hot vectors.

These three methods—aggregation, projection, and embedding—represent a range of transformations for adapting one-hot encoded data. The choice of method should be based on the characteristics of the data, the specific problem being addressed, and the desired outcome. I have found that experimentation with multiple methods is usually required to determine the best approach for a specific problem.

For further reading, I would suggest exploring resources detailing feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and representation learning. Books covering machine learning in general will discuss the role of one-hot encodings and the need for appropriate feature transformations. Textbooks that focus on statistical learning will provide the theoretical framework for methods like PCA. Finally, deep learning resources cover concepts like autoencoders and other neural-network-based embedding techniques. These should offer a solid base for building a deeper understanding.
