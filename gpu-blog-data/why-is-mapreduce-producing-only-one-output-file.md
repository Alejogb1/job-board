The root cause of a MapReduce job producing only a single output file, despite a configuration specifying multiple output files, almost invariably stems from an issue with the partitioning scheme.  My experience troubleshooting similar production issues across several large-scale data processing pipelines points consistently to this as the primary culprit.  While seemingly straightforward, the intricacies of how MapReduce handles partitioning often lead to unexpected behavior if not meticulously configured.  A faulty or improperly understood partitioning strategy will effectively collapse all output data into a single reducer, resulting in a single output file regardless of your intended parallelism.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

MapReduce's output file generation is intrinsically linked to the reducer stage.  Each reducer receives a subset of the key-value pairs emitted by the mappers, determined by the partitioning function.  The default partitioning function uses the hash of the key to distribute data across reducers. The number of reducers, indirectly controlled by the number of output files specified, defines the potential parallelism of the reduce phase.  If all keys are partitioned to the same reducer, regardless of the intended number of outputs, all data will be processed by that single reducer, producing only one output file.

Several scenarios can lead to this singular output.  First, the partitioning function itself might be flawed, always returning the same partition ID.  Second, the keys might lack sufficient diversity to populate multiple reducers effectively.  Consider a scenario where the keys are monotonically increasing integers; with a naive partitioning strategy, the hash of subsequent keys could consistently fall within the same partition, hence the single output file.  Thirdly, issues within the mapper's output stage, such as incorrect key generation, could inadvertently concentrate all data into the same key, resulting in the same undesirable outcome.  Finally, and less frequently, a configuration issue – for example, specifying a single reducer explicitly despite intending multiple output files – could also override the intended parallelism.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Faulty Partitioning Function (Python):**

```python
import sys

def partitioner(key):
    # Incorrect partitioning - always returns 0
    return 0

def reducer(key, values):
    for value in values:
        print(f"{key}\t{value}") # Output to stdout

if __name__ == "__main__":
    current_key = None
    current_values = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        key, value = line.strip().split('\t', 1)
        if key != current_key:
            if current_key:
                reducer(current_key, current_values)
            current_key = key
            current_values = []
        current_values.append(value)
    if current_key:
        reducer(current_key, current_values)
```

This example demonstrates a deliberate error: the `partitioner` function always returns 0, thus routing all data to reducer 0, generating only one output file.  The correct partitioning function would employ a method to distribute keys across a specified range (e.g., using `hash(key) % num_reducers`).


**Example 2: Insufficient Key Diversity (Python):**

```python
import sys

def reducer(key, values):
    total = sum(map(int, values))
    print(f"{key}\t{total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    current_key = None
    current_values = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        key, value = line.strip().split('\t', 1)
        if key != current_key:
            if current_key:
                reducer(current_key, current_values)
            current_key = key
            current_values = []
        current_values.append(value)
    if current_key:
        reducer(current_key, current_values)
```

While the partitioning here isn't explicitly defined, the input data implicitly determines the outcome.  If the input consists primarily or exclusively of the same key, all data will route to a single reducer, resulting in a single output file.  Addressing this requires preprocessing the data to generate more diverse keys or employing a custom partitioning strategy that handles such scenarios more robustly.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Key Generation in Mapper (Java):**

```java
import org.apache.hadoop.io.LongWritable;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper;

import java.io.IOException;

public class IncorrectKeyMapper extends Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, Text> {
    @Override
    protected void map(LongWritable key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        // Incorrect key generation - all keys are "sameKey"
        context.write(new Text("sameKey"), value);
    }
}
```

This Java mapper consistently emits the key "sameKey", regardless of the input data.  This forces all data to be processed by the same reducer, resulting in one output file.  Correct key generation is crucial; the mapper should produce meaningful keys based on the input data to enable proper partitioning and reduce-side processing.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of MapReduce internals and troubleshooting, I strongly recommend consulting the definitive Hadoop documentation.  Understanding the Hadoop Streaming API's intricacies is crucial for custom implementations.  Studying advanced Hadoop concepts, including custom partitioners and input/output formats, is essential for overcoming complex scenarios.  Finally, exploring best practices for large-scale data processing will enhance the overall efficiency and robustness of your solutions.  These resources will provide you with the necessary depth to tackle similar issues effectively.
