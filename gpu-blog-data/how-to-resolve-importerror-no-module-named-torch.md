The `ImportError: No module named torch` arises from the absence of the PyTorch library within your Python environment's accessible modules.  This is a common issue stemming from either a missing installation or a problem with your environment's configuration.  I've encountered this numerous times over the years while working on deep learning projects, and the solution invariably involves verifying installation and ensuring proper environment setup.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `torch` library, the foundation of many PyTorch-based applications, needs to be explicitly installed and accessible to your Python interpreter.  The interpreter searches for installed packages within its designated path, usually specified in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or within virtual environments.  If `torch` isn't found in these locations, the `ImportError` is raised.  This can result from several factors:

* **No installation:**  The most straightforward reason is that PyTorch hasn't been installed in your current Python environment.
* **Incorrect installation:**  PyTorch might be installed, but not correctly configured, resulting in the interpreter failing to locate it. This often happens when using multiple Python versions or conflicting package managers.
* **Environment mismatch:** The Python interpreter you're using might be different from the one used to install PyTorch. This is common when using virtual environments incorrectly.
* **System PATH issues:**  The system's `PATH` environment variable, which dictates where the operating system searches for executables, might not include the directory containing the PyTorch binaries.  This is less common but can lead to import issues.
* **Conflicting package versions:** Incompatible versions of PyTorch, CUDA (if using GPU acceleration), or other dependencies can lead to installation failure or import errors.

Addressing this requires a systematic approach, starting with verification of installation and progressing to environment diagnostics.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying Installation with `pip`**

```python
import subprocess

try:
    result = subprocess.run(['pip', 'show', 'torch'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    print("PyTorch is installed:")
    print(result.stdout)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"PyTorch is NOT installed. Error: {e}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("pip command not found. Ensure pip is installed and in your PATH.")
```

This code snippet uses the `subprocess` module to run the `pip show torch` command.  This command checks if `torch` is installed and prints its details if found.  Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle scenarios where `pip` isn't found or `torch` is not installed.  This provides a more robust solution than simply trying to `import torch` directly, which would immediately throw the error.  I've found this approach particularly useful in automated build and testing environments.


**Example 2: Installing PyTorch using `conda` (within a conda environment)**

```bash
conda create -n pytorch_env python=3.9  # Create a new conda environment (adjust Python version as needed)
conda activate pytorch_env         # Activate the environment
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.8 -c pytorch # Install PyTorch with CUDA support (adjust CUDA version as required)
```

This example demonstrates installing PyTorch using `conda`, a package and environment manager popular within the data science community. I prefer `conda` for its ability to manage dependencies and create isolated environments, preventing conflicts between different projects. The `-c pytorch` argument specifies the PyTorch channel on conda.  The `cudatoolkit` specification is only necessary if you intend to utilize a GPU for acceleration; ensure the CUDA version aligns with your GPU's capabilities.  Incorrect version matching is a frequent cause of PyTorch installation failures.  Always remember to activate the environment before attempting to import the package.


**Example 3: Checking Environment Variables (Linux/macOS)**

```bash
import os

print("PYTHONPATH:", os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH', 'Not set'))
print("PATH:", os.environ.get('PATH', 'Not set'))
```

This concise script displays the `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` environment variables.  `PYTHONPATH` should include the directory containing your Python installation's `site-packages` folder (where installed packages reside).  If PyTorch is installed outside the standard location, you might need to adjust `PYTHONPATH` accordingly. I've encountered instances where a misconfigured `PYTHONPATH` obscured a correctly installed PyTorch.  The `PATH` variable's relevance lies in ensuring the correct Python interpreter is called when executing scripts.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch website's installation instructions provide comprehensive guidance for various operating systems and hardware configurations. Consult their documentation for specific installation commands and troubleshooting steps tailored to your setup.  The Python documentation on environment variables and package management will further assist in understanding how Python handles modules and dependencies.  Finally, reviewing the CUDA toolkit documentation (if using GPU acceleration) can be crucial for resolving GPU-related issues.  Thoroughly reviewing these resources ensures a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of PyTorch setup.
