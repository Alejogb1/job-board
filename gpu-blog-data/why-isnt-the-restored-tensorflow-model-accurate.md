The discrepancy between a trained TensorFlow model's initial accuracy and the accuracy observed after restoration from a saved checkpoint often stems from inconsistencies in the execution environment or an incomplete restoration process. I've encountered this in numerous projects, especially when working with complex models involving intricate training procedures. The core issue frequently revolves around not just saving the model's weights but also its computational graph, the optimizer's state, and any specific preprocessing steps unique to the training pipeline.

The primary challenge lies in understanding that TensorFlow models are more than just weight matrices. They encompass the network architecture (the operations and connections between layers), the input pipeline (data preprocessing and augmentation), the training configuration (the optimizer, loss function, and metrics), and the associated state variables for all these components.  A failure to fully restore any one of these aspects can lead to a reduction in accuracy or even a completely non-functional model. Saving and loading weights is necessary, but far from sufficient.

Specifically, several factors contribute to this problem:

1.  **Incomplete Optimizer State Restoration:** During training, optimizers like Adam, SGD with momentum, etc., maintain internal state information (e.g., momentum values, variance estimates) that influence parameter updates. When only weights are restored, this state is lost. The restored model starts learning as if from a random initialization, even though the weights are pre-trained. This state is critical because it provides context for how those weights should be updated on subsequent data points during retraining or even just inference after loading. Failure to restore this results in an effective reset of the training trajectory which may result in suboptimal performance.

2.  **Data Preprocessing Discrepancies:**  The training process frequently incorporates data normalization, augmentation, or feature engineering steps. If these steps are not consistently applied during inference or retraining after loading the model, the model will receive inputs with a distribution significantly different from what it was trained on. Even slight shifts in mean or variance can substantially affect performance because the model's weights are tuned specifically to the distribution encountered during training. The preprocessing steps may be buried in the data pipeline and thus easily overlooked.

3. **Graph-Related Issues:**  The TensorFlow computational graph can be influenced by placeholder configurations, tensor shapes, or conditional logic within the model definition.  If the graph constructed at loading time doesn't precisely match the one used during training—e.g., due to changes in input shapes, missing or extra layers, or different operating conditions (e.g. using `tf.function` in one context but not another)—it can lead to unexpected errors, and will likely compromise performance.  This can be due to changes in the model architecture or even the tensorflow API and not just model weights. This is most likely the reason when the model is not only inaccurate but does not even work.

4. **Version Skew Issues:**  Discrepancies between TensorFlow versions used for training and restoration can introduce incompatibilities. While backward compatibility is often maintained, subtle changes in API behavior, especially around numerical operations or data handling can impact the model. Changes in Tensorflow versions across different environments should always be considered as a possible cause.

5.  **Regularization Parameter Inconsistencies:** If using regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization, these parameters must be properly restored and implemented consistently. Using different dropout rates for training and restoration, or even neglecting dropout during inference when the model was trained with dropout, will certainly impact performance. The same goes for L2 regularization which needs to be considered during inference as it adds to the total loss during training.

To illustrate these issues and their resolutions, consider the following code examples.

**Example 1:  Saving and Loading Weights Only**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define and train a simple model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = create_model()
dummy_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

model.fit(dummy_data, dummy_labels, epochs=2)  # Train for a few epochs

model.save_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Load the model again, but only the weights
restored_model = create_model() # IMPORTANT: Need to rebuild the architecture
restored_model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')
restored_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) # Important: Need to compile again.

# Predict with restored model
test_data = np.random.rand(20, 10)
test_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)

original_loss, original_acc = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=0)
restored_loss, restored_acc = restored_model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=0)


print(f"Original accuracy:{original_acc}")
print(f"Restored accuracy:{restored_acc}")
```

This code demonstrates that while the restored model has the original trained weights, it has lost all the information related to the optimizer state. I observed in past projects that the performance of the restored model is significantly inferior to that of the original after training, especially for a couple of epochs after loading. The restored model has to effectively retrain itself to regain its original accuracy.

**Example 2: Saving and Restoring the Complete Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define and train a simple model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = create_model()
dummy_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

model.fit(dummy_data, dummy_labels, epochs=2)


model.save('full_model')

# Load the entire model
restored_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('full_model')

test_data = np.random.rand(20, 10)
test_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)

original_loss, original_acc = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=0)
restored_loss, restored_acc = restored_model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=0)


print(f"Original accuracy:{original_acc}")
print(f"Restored accuracy:{restored_acc}")
```

In this revised example, we save the entire model using `model.save('full_model')`. This method stores not only the weights but also the model's architecture, optimizer state, and training configuration. Upon loading using `tf.keras.models.load_model('full_model')`, the restored model retains a more accurate representation of the original, as seen by similar accuracy on the same data.

**Example 3: Data Preprocessing and Consistent Inference**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define and train a simple model with a preprocessing layer
def create_model():
    input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
    normalized_layer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization()(input_layer)
    hidden_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(normalized_layer)
    output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(hidden_layer)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = create_model()
dummy_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

model.fit(dummy_data, dummy_labels, epochs=2)
model.save('full_model_with_prep')


# Load the entire model
restored_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('full_model_with_prep')

test_data = np.random.rand(20, 10)
test_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)


original_loss, original_acc = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=0)
restored_loss, restored_acc = restored_model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=0)

print(f"Original accuracy:{original_acc}")
print(f"Restored accuracy:{restored_acc}")
```

Here, we have a `Normalization` layer inside the model itself. This ensures the data is normalized before entering the main network.  By saving the entire model as in example 2, the preprocessing is now an inseparable part of the loaded model. The restored model now is guaranteed to perform similarly to the original model.

In summary, the key to maintaining accuracy after restoring a TensorFlow model is ensuring the entire training environment is replicated. This includes the architecture, the weights, the optimizer state, and the data preprocessing steps. Saving the complete model, instead of just the weights, can mitigate many issues.

To further understand TensorFlow model saving and loading practices I would recommend researching the following topics:  TensorFlow's official documentation on model saving, TensorFlow Hub for pre-trained models and their associated saving/loading procedures,  and practices surrounding custom layers and how to define their saving and loading behaviours. Furthermore, I have personally found it helpful to study the usage of `tf.train.Checkpoint`  for complex training scenarios and its importance when dealing with complex models.
