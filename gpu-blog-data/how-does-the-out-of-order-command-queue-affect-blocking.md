The core difference in OpenCL write behavior between blocking and non-blocking operations hinges on the interaction with the out-of-order command queue.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications, particularly within the realm of real-time image processing, has highlighted the crucial role this interplay plays.  Specifically, a non-blocking write to a buffer submitted to an out-of-order queue doesn't guarantee immediate data visibility to subsequent kernels.  This contrasts sharply with blocking writes, ensuring data synchronization before proceeding.

**1.  Explanation: Out-of-Order Execution and its Implications**

OpenCL's command queues, by default, operate in an out-of-order fashion.  This means the order of command execution by the device doesn't strictly adhere to the order in which they were enqueued.  The OpenCL runtime employs sophisticated scheduling algorithms to maximize performance by exploiting parallelism and hardware capabilities.  While advantageous for overall throughput, this out-of-order execution significantly affects the semantics of blocking and non-blocking write operations.

A blocking write, denoted by `clEnqueueWriteBuffer` with a `blocking_write` flag set to `CL_TRUE`, forces the host thread to wait until the data transfer to the device memory is complete.  The runtime guarantees that the data is visible to subsequent kernels that access the same buffer.  This synchronization comes at the cost of performance, as the host remains idle until the transfer concludes.

Conversely, a non-blocking write, using `clEnqueueWriteBuffer` with `blocking_write` set to `CL_FALSE`, immediately returns control to the host thread without waiting for the data transfer.  The host can continue executing other tasks while the transfer occurs asynchronously.  However, in the context of an out-of-order queue, there's no guarantee that a kernel enqueued *after* the non-blocking write will see the updated data.  The kernel might execute before the data transfer completes, leading to incorrect results.

To ensure data consistency with non-blocking writes in an out-of-order queue, explicit synchronization mechanisms are necessary.  This typically involves using events.  Events mark the completion of a command, allowing you to create dependencies between commands.  By making a kernel dependent on the completion of a non-blocking write event, you enforce the correct execution order.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the differences using a simple vector addition.  We'll assume a buffer `inputA`, `inputB`, and `output` are already created and allocated.


**Example 1: Blocking Write**

```c++
// ... OpenCL initialization ...

cl_event writeEvent;
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, inputA, CL_TRUE, 0, sizeof(float)*N, inputDataA, 0, NULL, &writeEvent);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, inputB, CL_TRUE, 0, sizeof(float)*N, inputDataB, 0, NULL, NULL); // No event needed here as it's blocking

//Kernel execution (vector addition) - no event dependency needed
// ... Kernel execution code ...

clWaitForEvents(1, &writeEvent); //This line is redundant for blocking write but included for comparison with example 2

// ... Read back results ...
```

In this example, both writes are blocking. The host waits for both buffers to be written before the kernel executes, guaranteeing data consistency.  The `clWaitForEvents` call is redundant but included for comparison.


**Example 2: Non-blocking Write with Event Synchronization**

```c++
// ... OpenCL initialization ...

cl_event writeEventA, kernelEvent;
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, inputA, CL_FALSE, 0, sizeof(float)*N, inputDataA, 0, NULL, &writeEventA);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, inputB, CL_FALSE, 0, sizeof(float)*N, inputDataB, 0, NULL, NULL);

// Kernel execution with dependency on write event
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, kernel, 1, NULL, &globalWorkSize, &localWorkSize, 1, &writeEventA, &kernelEvent);

clWaitForEvents(1, &kernelEvent); //Wait for kernel completion before reading back
// ... Read back results ...
```

This example uses non-blocking writes.  Crucially, the kernel execution (`clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`) is made dependent on `writeEventA` using the `event_wait_list` parameter.  This ensures the kernel won't start until the data in `inputA` is transferred to the device.  `inputB` being written non-blockingly doesn't affect this execution flow as the kernel only has a dependency on `inputA` because of the event `writeEventA` that is set by the write operation to buffer `inputA`.  The `clWaitForEvents` call is necessary here to wait for the kernel completion before reading the results.


**Example 3: Non-blocking Write without Proper Synchronization (Illustrative)**

```c++
// ... OpenCL initialization ...

clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, inputA, CL_FALSE, 0, sizeof(float)*N, inputDataA, 0, NULL, NULL);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, inputB, CL_FALSE, 0, sizeof(float)*N, inputDataB, 0, NULL, NULL);

// Kernel execution – NO event synchronization!
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, kernel, 1, NULL, &globalWorkSize, &localWorkSize, 0, NULL, NULL);

// ... Read back results – Potentially incorrect! ...
```

This example demonstrates the potential pitfalls of non-blocking writes without proper synchronization.  The kernel might execute before either data transfer is complete, resulting in incorrect computation.  This highlights the necessity of events for managing dependencies in out-of-order queues.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The OpenCL specification, particularly sections covering command queues, events, and buffer operations, is essential reading.  Understanding the concepts of synchronization primitives in parallel programming is also crucial.  Studying advanced OpenCL programming guides, focusing on performance optimization techniques, will provide deeper insight into managing asynchronous operations and data dependencies.  Finally, a strong understanding of underlying hardware architectures – specifically how memory access and command scheduling work on GPUs – aids significantly in efficient OpenCL development.  Careful consideration of these resources will allow developers to effectively manage and optimize performance in scenarios involving out-of-order execution of commands.
