Segmentation fault 11 in a Python 2.7.10 TensorFlow model typically arises from memory access violations, often stemming from incorrect pointer usage within TensorFlow's C++ backend or interactions with external libraries.  My experience debugging these issues in large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the criticality of understanding TensorFlow's memory management and the potential pitfalls of interacting with NumPy arrays, especially when dealing with custom operators or extensions.  This response will detail potential causes and illustrative code examples to help diagnose and resolve these faults.


**1.  Explanation:**

Segmentation fault 11 indicates an attempt to access memory that the process is not allowed to access.  In the context of TensorFlow, this frequently manifests when:

* **NumPy Array Mismanagement:**  Improper handling of NumPy arrays is a common culprit.  Passing arrays with incorrect data types, shapes, or memory layouts to TensorFlow operations can lead to segmentation faults.  Issues arise if you create a NumPy array and then modify its underlying memory in a way that TensorFlow doesn't expect. This is especially problematic with in-place operations (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) on arrays passed to TensorFlow.  TensorFlow's internal memory management might not be aware of these changes, leading to corruption and segmentation faults.

* **TensorFlow Operator Errors:**  Custom TensorFlow operators written in C++ are a frequent source of segmentation faults. Even seemingly minor errors in memory allocation, deallocation, or pointer arithmetic within these operators can trigger the fault. Incorrectly managing the lifetime of allocated memory within these operators is critical.  A memory leak, or worse, a dangling pointer, can lead to unpredictable behavior including segmentation faults.

* **External Library Conflicts:**  Interactions between TensorFlow and other libraries, especially those performing low-level memory manipulation, can introduce conflicts.  Incompatible memory management strategies between these libraries might lead to memory corruption, ultimately resulting in a segmentation fault.  This can be exacerbated by libraries that aren't thread-safe, potentially leading to race conditions that corrupt TensorFlow's internal state.

* **GPU Memory Issues:**  When using TensorFlow with GPUs, exceeding the available GPU memory or improper handling of GPU memory allocation and deallocation can lead to segmentation faults.  This is often signaled by out-of-memory errors preceding the segmentation fault, or by seemingly random crashes.  Insufficient pinned memory or incorrect memory synchronization can contribute to these issues.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect NumPy Array Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect: Modifying the array after passing it to TensorFlow
x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float32)
tf_x = tf.constant(x)

x += 10  # Modifying the underlying array after it's been passed to TensorFlow

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # This might lead to a segmentation fault
    y = sess.run(tf_x)
    print(y)
```
This example demonstrates a dangerous practice: modifying a NumPy array `x` after it has been passed to TensorFlow as a constant (`tf_x`). TensorFlow creates a copy of the data, but unexpected behavior can occur due to shared memory regions. Best practice is to create new NumPy arrays for any operations instead of modifying the original arrays.


**Example 2: Problematic Custom Operator (C++)**

```c++
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"

using namespace tensorflow;

REGISTER_OP("MyCustomOp")
    .Input("input: float")
    .Output("output: float");

class MyCustomOpOp : public OpKernel {
 public:
  explicit MyCustomOpOp(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {}

  void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {
    // Incorrect: potential memory leak or dangling pointer
    float* input_data = (float*) context->input(0)->flat<float>().data();
    float* output_data = new float; // Memory leak; allocation not handled
    *output_data = *input_data * 2.0f; 
    context->set_output(0, Tensor(DT_FLOAT, TensorShape({}))); //Output tensor is created, but data is not properly copied.
    delete output_data;  // Correct, but doesn't prevent the issue

    context->set_output(0, Tensor(DT_FLOAT, TensorShape({}))); //Output tensor is created, but data is not properly copied.
  }
};

REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("MyCustomOp").Device(DEVICE_CPU), MyCustomOpOp);
```
This C++ code for a custom TensorFlow operator showcases a potential memory leak (`new float`) and a failure to correctly manage output tensor data. The crucial step is missing, which is copying the computed value to the output tensor.  Correct memory management and proper usage of TensorFlow's tensor allocation mechanisms are paramount within custom operators.


**Example 3:  TensorFlow with GPU Memory Exhaustion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Simulating large tensor creation
with tf.device('/gpu:0'): # Force GPU usage
    a = tf.random_normal([1024, 1024, 1024, 1024], dtype=tf.float32)  #Huge tensor
    b = tf.random_normal([1024, 1024, 1024, 1024], dtype=tf.float32)  #Another huge tensor
    c = tf.matmul(a,b) #Matrix Multiplication

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(c) #Segmentation fault may occur if GPU memory is exhausted.
```
This example uses a large tensor calculation to potentially exhaust GPU memory.  Depending on the available GPU memory, attempting to run this code could lead to a segmentation fault.  Monitor GPU memory usage using tools provided by your GPU vendor.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation provides in-depth guides on memory management and best practices.  Additionally, the C++ documentation for TensorFlow's core libraries provides the necessary information for correctly writing custom operators.  Consult advanced debugging tools for understanding memory leaks and errors like Valgrind. Mastering NumPy's array operations and understanding its memory layout is crucial for avoiding unexpected behaviors when interfacing with TensorFlow.  Thorough testing, including unit testing of custom operators and rigorous stress testing of models, is essential for mitigating these issues.
