TensorFlow Probability (TFP) leverages the power of TensorFlow's computational graph to represent a variety of probability distributions. A critical but often nuanced aspect is how to effectively model distributions whose parameters themselves possess a structure beyond a simple scalar or vector. Instead of merely defining a mean and standard deviation as independent variables, we may need to model structured dependencies within those parameters. This is frequently required when dealing with hierarchical models, mixture models, or scenarios where parameter values must adhere to specific constraints. In essence, we need to transform the unconstrained space of the parameters into the constrained space required by the distribution's definition.

A fundamental challenge is that TFP distributions generally expect parameters in the domain their definitions dictate. For instance, the `Normal` distribution expects a real-valued mean and a positive-valued standard deviation. Directly optimizing unconstrained variables and passing them as parameters may violate these constraints, leading to errors or instability during training. Thus, we require mechanisms to ensure the parameters are valid according to the specified distribution. This can involve applying transformations to the parameters.

The process of modeling structured parameters generally proceeds in two stages: first, defining the unconstrained parameters that will be optimized, and second, transforming these unconstrained parameters into the constrained parameters required by the target distribution. TFP provides built-in bijectors that enable this transformation. A bijector is essentially a differentiable, invertible function that maps between spaces. We will explore different bijectors through concrete examples.

**Example 1: Log-Normal Distribution with Structured Parameters**

Consider a log-normal distribution. It is commonly defined with parameters `loc` (mean of the underlying normal distribution) and `scale` (standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution). While the `loc` parameter can be any real number, `scale` must be positive. Let's assume we desire that the `scale` parameter itself follows a Gamma distribution, forcing it to always be positive and allowing for more nuanced modeling of the scale's uncertainty.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions
tfb = tfp.bijectors

# Define unconstrained parameters for optimization.
unconstrained_loc = tf.Variable(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)  # Mean of underlying normal
unconstrained_gamma_alpha = tf.Variable(2.0, dtype=tf.float32) #Shape of gamma for the scale
unconstrained_gamma_beta  = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32) #Rate of gamma for the scale

# Define bijectors for transformation to constrained space.
bijector_scale_to_positive = tfb.Softplus()
bijector_loc_to_real = tfb.Identity() # No transformation needed for the mean


# Create the gamma distribution for the scale
gamma_dist = tfd.Gamma(
    bijector_scale_to_positive(unconstrained_gamma_alpha), 
    bijector_scale_to_positive(unconstrained_gamma_beta))

# Sample the scale from the gamma
scale = gamma_dist.sample()

# Transform the unconstrained loc to its valid domain
loc = bijector_loc_to_real(unconstrained_loc)


# Finally, create the log-normal distribution with structured scale parameter
log_normal_dist = tfd.LogNormal(loc=loc, scale=scale)

# Example Usage
samples = log_normal_dist.sample(1000)

# During Optimization the unconstrained parameters (unconstrained_loc, unconstrained_gamma_alpha, unconstrained_gamma_beta) would be adjusted
# while the parameters for the log_normal are obtained through bijectors.
```

In this example, the `scale` parameter is not directly optimized. Instead, we optimize two unconstrained variables which correspond to the shape and rate of a gamma distribution, that is then sampled from. These are then transformed into valid domains using `Softplus`, ensuring the resulting `scale` parameter for `LogNormal` is positive.  The `Identity` bijector is used for the `loc` parameter since it's a real number.

**Example 2: Beta Distribution with Parameterized Mean and Variance**

Consider a situation where we need a Beta distribution for modeling proportions. Beta distribution is defined with `concentration1` (alpha) and `concentration0` (beta) parameters. However, sometimes it is more natural to think about parameterizing Beta in terms of its mean and variance instead. This can be achieved by parameterizing the `alpha` and `beta` parameters using mean and variance. But here's the catch: neither the mean nor the variance are independent and variance itself must be positive and less than a certain value determined by the mean.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions
tfb = tfp.bijectors

# Unconstrained parameters
unconstrained_mean = tf.Variable(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)
unconstrained_variance = tf.Variable(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)


# Bijectors for transformation
bijector_mean_to_unit_interval = tfb.Sigmoid() # Mean should be within (0,1)
bijector_variance_to_positive = tfb.Softplus() # Variance is always positive

#Transform the parameters
mean = bijector_mean_to_unit_interval(unconstrained_mean)
variance = bijector_variance_to_positive(unconstrained_variance)

# Ensure variance is valid (it depends on the mean)
# Maximum possible variance is mean*(1-mean)/4
max_variance = mean*(1-mean) / 4 # Beta variance formula
variance = tf.minimum(variance, max_variance)

# Parametrize the alpha and beta
alpha = ((1-mean)/variance - 1/mean) * mean**2
beta = alpha * (1/mean - 1)

# Use these alpha and beta for the Beta distribution
beta_dist = tfd.Beta(concentration1 = alpha, concentration0 = beta)

# Example Usage
samples = beta_dist.sample(1000)
```

Here, the unconstrained `mean` and `variance` are transformed using `Sigmoid` and `Softplus`, respectively. Since mean for the beta distribution must be between (0,1) and variance must be positive, this bijector pair ensures validity. We also add a constraint on variance, ensuring that it is within a valid range according to the formula for variance based on the mean. The resulting `alpha` and `beta` are then used to construct the `Beta` distribution. Note that calculating the alpha and beta this way does not require any additional bijectors.

**Example 3: Hierarchical Normal Distribution with Shared Parameter**

Consider a hierarchical model where we want to model the means of multiple Normal distributions. Let's say the mean of each of the Normal distributions depends on a shared parameter.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions
tfb = tfp.bijectors


# Unconstrained Parameters
unconstrained_mu_0 = tf.Variable(0.0, dtype=tf.float32) # shared mu
unconstrained_sigma_0 = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32) #shared sigma
unconstrained_mus = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(3), dtype=tf.float32) # array of offsets


# Bijectors
bijector_sigma_to_positive = tfb.Softplus()


# Transform parameters
mu_0 = unconstrained_mu_0
sigma_0 = bijector_sigma_to_positive(unconstrained_sigma_0) #Ensure that sigma is positive

# Calculate individual mus
mu_list = mu_0 + unconstrained_mus

# Generate distributions
normal_dist_list = []
for mu in mu_list:
    normal_dist_list.append(tfd.Normal(loc = mu, scale = sigma_0))


# Example Usage
samples = [dist.sample(100) for dist in normal_dist_list]

# During optimization the unconstrained_mu_0, unconstrained_sigma_0, and unconstrained_mus would be adjusted.

```

In this hierarchical model, several normal distributions share a common `mu_0` and `sigma_0` but have their means offset by individual `unconstrained_mus`. These `unconstrained_mus` are added to the base `mu_0` to obtain the final means. The `sigma_0` parameter is transformed using `Softplus` bijector to ensure positiveness. This illustrates using a shared parameter while retaining individual parameters which is common in hierarchical Bayesian modeling.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To delve deeper into this topic, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow Probability documentation, particularly the sections on bijectors and distribution construction. Several academic resources discuss hierarchical Bayesian modeling and its parameterization, which will provide conceptual backing. Furthermore, consider reviewing examples of variational inference or Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementations with TFP, as these often rely heavily on structured parameterization. Finally, focusing on probability theory books can offer a solid mathematical understanding of distributions and their characteristics, which will make their use in TFP more intuitive.
