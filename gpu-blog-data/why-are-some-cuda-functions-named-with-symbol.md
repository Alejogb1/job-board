The presence of "symbol" in the naming convention of certain CUDA functions stems from their fundamental role in managing the symbolic representation of kernel launches and memory allocations within the CUDA runtime.  This isn't immediately obvious from a casual inspection of the CUDA API; it becomes apparent only after working extensively with low-level CUDA driver APIs and custom memory management strategies.  In my experience optimizing high-performance computing applications – specifically, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations – I've encountered this naming convention numerous times, particularly when dealing with advanced profiling and debugging techniques that necessitate interacting directly with the CUDA driver.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The CUDA runtime manages kernel execution and memory through an abstraction layer. While the user interacts with kernels via function calls (e.g., `<<<...>>>`), the underlying mechanism involves creating and manipulating symbolic representations of these kernels and their associated memory regions.  These symbolic representations are not directly visible within the high-level CUDA programming model; however, accessing and manipulating them is crucial for advanced features.  The "symbol" in function names signifies that the function operates on these symbolic representations, rather than directly on the compiled kernel code or the allocated memory itself.

For example, consider the process of loading a dynamically linked library (.so file on Linux, .dll on Windows) containing a CUDA kernel.  The CUDA runtime doesn't immediately execute the kernel.  First, it needs to locate and interpret the kernel within the library – this is where the symbolic representation comes in.  The kernel's entry point, its parameters, and its associated metadata are all encapsulated in a symbolic structure.  Functions named with "symbol" (e.g., `cuModuleGetFunction`, `cuCtxCreate`, etc.) provide the means to access, inspect, and manipulate these symbolic structures, allowing fine-grained control over kernel loading, execution, and memory management.  This is particularly relevant in scenarios involving dynamic kernel loading, custom memory allocation strategies (such as using pinned memory or managing memory pools), and detailed performance analysis using tools that interact with the CUDA driver at a lower level.

It's important to differentiate this from the simpler, higher-level CUDA API functions where the user works directly with the kernel's function pointer.  The "symbol" functions bypass that abstraction, offering access to metadata and controls at a much lower level – a level where the kernel is represented symbolically rather than as directly executable code.  This level of access is essential for tools designed for detailed performance analysis and debugging, and allows developers to handle scenarios that are not easily addressed using the higher-level CUDA API.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Retrieving Kernel Symbol**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  CUmodule module;
  CUfunction kernelFunc;
  CUresult result;

  // Load the CUDA module (equivalent to loading a .cu file)
  result = cuModuleLoad(&module, "myKernel.cubin");
  if (result != CUDA_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cuModuleLoad failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(result));
    return 1;
  }

  // Get the symbol (kernel function) from the module
  result = cuModuleGetFunction(&kernelFunc, module, "myKernel"); // "myKernel" is the kernel function name
  if (result != CUDA_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cuModuleGetFunction failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(result));
    cuModuleUnload(module);
    return 1;
  }

  // ... further kernel launch operations ...

  cuModuleUnload(module);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the use of `cuModuleGetFunction`, a function explicitly named with "symbol" (implicitly through the concept of "symbol table" within the loaded module).  The function retrieves a handle (`kernelFunc`) to the kernel named "myKernel" within the loaded module, allowing subsequent launch configurations.  Note the use of error checking—crucial for robust CUDA development.

**Example 2:  Managing Context Creation**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  CUcontext context;
  CUresult result;

  // Create a CUDA context – note that this function implicitly handles symbol tables internally.
  result = cuCtxCreate(&context, 0, 0); // Creating context, managing symbol table internally
  if (result != CUDA_SUCCESS) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cuCtxCreate failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(result));
    return 1;
  }

  // ... CUDA operations using the context ...

  cuCtxDestroy(context);
  return 0;
}
```

While `cuCtxCreate` doesn't have "symbol" explicitly in its name, its internal operations rely heavily on the concept. The context creation implicitly manages the symbol tables that map kernel names and other resources to their underlying representations within the CUDA driver.

**Example 3:  Working with Global Memory**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    CUdeviceptr devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024;
    CUresult result;

    // Allocate memory on the device. The underlying driver handles symbolic representation.
    result = cuMemAlloc(&devPtr, size);
    if (result != CUDA_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cuMemAlloc failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(result));
        return 1;
    }

    // ... operations on device memory ...

    cuMemFree(devPtr);
    return 0;
}
```

Similarly, `cuMemAlloc` and `cuMemFree`, though not containing "symbol" in their names, operate at a level where the allocated memory is ultimately represented symbolically within the CUDA driver’s internal structures.  These structures facilitate tracking and management of the allocated memory regions on the device.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the CUDA programming guide, the CUDA driver API documentation, and a comprehensive text on high-performance computing with GPUs.  Furthermore, thoroughly studying the source code of established CUDA profiling tools and debuggers would provide invaluable insight into the practical applications of these "symbol" functions.  These resources offer a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of CUDA and the role of symbolic representations in its runtime environment.  Careful examination of error handling practices in example codes is also essential.  Understanding CUDA error codes and debugging strategies forms a fundamental component of robust CUDA development.  Finally, practical experience developing and optimizing CUDA applications is paramount.
