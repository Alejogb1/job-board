GPU memory allocation for dynamic, multi-dimensional arrays presents unique challenges compared to CPU-based approaches.  The key lies in understanding that direct, arbitrary resizing of arrays on the GPU is generally inefficient and often impossible.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving large-scale simulations has reinforced this.  Effective solutions require careful planning, leveraging GPU-specific data structures, and a deep understanding of the application's memory access patterns.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Dynamic array allocation on a CPU relies on the operating system's memory management, allowing for resizing through reallocation and data copying.  GPUs, however, operate differently.  Their memory (typically global memory) is a limited, managed resource.  Direct reallocation akin to `realloc` on a CPU is significantly slower on a GPU due to the overhead of data transfer and potentially fragmented memory. Consequently, a strategy of pre-allocation coupled with careful memory management is almost always preferred.

The most efficient approach involves determining the maximum potential size of the multi-dimensional array at the outset. This maximum size is then used to allocate a contiguous block of GPU memory.  This pre-allocation minimizes the number of memory transfers between the CPU and GPU, a crucial factor impacting performance.  The actual array dimensions are managed through indexing and, critically, within a well-defined, allocated space.

In practice, this often necessitates using a single, large one-dimensional array to represent the multi-dimensional structure. This one-dimensional array is then indexed according to the desired multi-dimensional structure using appropriate calculations. This strategy leverages the GPU's strengths: efficient linear memory access.  Attempts to use inherently multi-dimensional data structures often lead to less-efficient access patterns and consequently slower performance.

Further optimization can involve employing techniques like texture memory or shared memory for frequently accessed portions of the array, but careful analysis of memory access patterns is critical to determine their efficacy.  Improper use can negate the performance benefits.  My experience implementing a fluid dynamics solver highlighted the importance of optimizing memory access for a significant speedup.  Incorrectly utilizing shared memory resulted in performance degradation compared to using only global memory.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to manage multi-dimensional arrays on the GPU using CUDA, a common platform for GPU programming.  These examples focus on pre-allocation and linear indexing.

**Example 1:  Simple 2D Array Allocation and Access**

```cuda
__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int rows, int cols) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (i < rows && j < cols) {
    int index = i * cols + j; // Linear index calculation
    data[index] = i + j;     // Accessing element
  }
}

int main() {
  int rows = 1024;
  int cols = 1024;
  int size = rows * cols * sizeof(int);

  int *h_data = (int *)malloc(size); // Host-side allocation
  int *d_data;
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_data, size); // GPU-side allocation

  // ... Kernel launch ...

  cudaFree(d_data); // Free GPU memory
  free(h_data);     // Free host memory
  return 0;
}
```

This example shows a basic 2D array represented as a 1D array on the GPU.  The linear index calculation `i * cols + j` is crucial for accessing elements correctly.  The `main` function demonstrates the necessary steps for allocating and freeing memory on both the host (CPU) and the device (GPU).

**Example 2:  Dynamic Sizing with Pre-allocation**

```cuda
__global__ void processArray(float *data, int max_size, int current_rows, int current_cols) {
    // ...similar to Example 1, but current_rows and current_cols determine the active area...
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (i < current_rows && j < current_cols) {
        int index = i * max_cols + j; //Always uses max_cols for indexing
        data[index] = some_calculation(i,j);
    }
}

int main() {
    int max_rows = 2048;
    int max_cols = 2048;
    int size = max_rows * max_cols * sizeof(float);
    float *h_data = (float *)malloc(size);
    float *d_data;
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_data, size);

    int current_rows = 1024;
    int current_cols = 1024;

    // ...Kernel launch with current_rows, current_cols, max_cols...

    cudaFree(d_data);
    free(h_data);
    return 0;
}
```

Here, `max_rows` and `max_cols` define the pre-allocated size, while `current_rows` and `current_cols` represent the actual used portion.  The kernel accesses the data using `max_cols` in the index calculation to ensure consistent addressing, preventing out-of-bounds access even if the active data is smaller than the pre-allocated memory.  Note:  the indexing uses the maximum allocated cols, not the current number of cols, to avoid memory access errors.



**Example 3:  3D Array Handling**

```cuda
__global__ void threeDKernel(float *data, int x_dim, int y_dim, int z_dim) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int k = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;

  if (i < x_dim && j < y_dim && k < z_dim) {
    int index = k * (x_dim * y_dim) + j * x_dim + i; //Linear index for 3D
    data[index] = i * j * k;
  }
}

int main() {
    // ... similar allocation as before, but with x_dim, y_dim, z_dim ...
    int x_dim = 512;
    int y_dim = 512;
    int z_dim = 512;
    int size = x_dim * y_dim * z_dim * sizeof(float);

    // ...similar kernel launch ...

    // ...similar deallocation ...
}
```

This illustrates a 3D array's linear indexing.  The index calculation extends naturally to accommodate the third dimension.  The core principle of pre-allocation and linear indexing remains.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would suggest consulting the CUDA Programming Guide and the relevant documentation for your chosen GPU platform (e.g., ROCm for AMD GPUs).  A thorough exploration of memory management in parallel programming would also prove invaluable.  Finally, studying examples of parallel algorithms and their implementations can significantly enhance your understanding of effective GPU programming practices.  Understanding the differences between global, shared, and constant memory is also crucial.
