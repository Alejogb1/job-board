TensorFlow/Keras model attribute errors stemming from undefined input shapes often arise from inconsistencies between the data you intend to feed the model and the expected shape dictated by its initial layers. Specifically, the error surfaces when a tensor with an ambiguous or absent shape is passed to a layer that requires explicit dimension information. I've personally encountered this issue numerous times, particularly when dealing with dynamically generated datasets or constructing custom network architectures.

The core problem resides in how TensorFlow/Keras infers shape. During model construction, especially when using the Sequential API or functional API without clearly specifying an `input_shape` or `input_tensor`, the framework sometimes struggles to deduce the expected shape for the first layer automatically. This usually affects layers that perform operations based on input dimensionality, such as dense layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers. These operations require a predefined input shape to determine the size of the weight and bias tensors.

If the first layer doesn't receive an explicit input shape, TensorFlow will attempt to infer it during the first forward pass using a batch of data. If the shape of that input is itself not fully defined (e.g., due to preprocessing steps that create variable-length tensors or using placeholder tensors without concrete dimensions) or not provided, TensorFlow cannot allocate the correct tensors internally and the attribute error occurs, informing you that the shape is undefined for a subsequent layer. This mismatch causes the framework to raise an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'` or a variant of it, which often occurs not on the layer which receives undefined shape, but on the layer that requires it to be already defined by the prior layer.

Let's examine a few scenarios where this might arise and how to correct them.

**Scenario 1: Omitting `input_shape` in a Sequential Model**

Consider a simple case where you intend to build a basic feedforward network using the Sequential API. Without explicitly specifying the input shape for the first `Dense` layer, you might encounter this error.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

# Incorrect - No explicit input_shape provided
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # This can cause the error
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


dummy_input = np.random.rand(10,5) #10 Samples, 5 features
try:
    model.predict(dummy_input) #Error triggers on first forward pass due to undefined input_shape
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, the first `Dense` layer has no idea about the dimensionality of the input, and therefore cannot define its weight matrix. The error occurs the first time the model is called using `predict` or `fit`. We have provided a dummy input of shape `(10, 5)` but the model has not been constructed with a pre-defined shape to expect.

To rectify this, you must specify `input_shape` during the instantiation of the first layer. Note that `input_shape` should not include batch size and it’s provided as a tuple.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

# Correct - input_shape is specified
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),  # input_shape is now specified
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


dummy_input = np.random.rand(10,5)
try:
    model.predict(dummy_input) #No error now that the model was constructed with input_shape
    print("Prediction successful, no error raised.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
By providing `input_shape=(5,)`, we explicitly inform the `Dense` layer that it should expect an input with a shape where number of features is 5. TensorFlow can now allocate the weight matrix dimensions correctly and avoid the error.

**Scenario 2: Using Keras Functional API with Ambiguous Input Tensors**

The same issue can occur with the Keras Functional API when input tensors are not fully defined. This often happens when using `tf.placeholder` directly or attempting to use an input tensor without specifying its shape.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Incorrect - Input tensor shape not explicitly defined
input_tensor = Input(shape=(None,)) #input shape is None
hidden = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(hidden)

model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)

dummy_input = np.random.rand(10, 5)
try:
    model.predict(dummy_input)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this instance, the input shape `(None,)` indicates an unspecified dimension, meaning it can accept any number of features on input but we never define this number. Therefore, when trying to construct the `Dense` layer that requires a particular number of nodes, it cannot use this undefined shape. This leads to the same undefined shape attribute error.

To resolve this, you must provide a concrete dimension to the input tensor when defining it.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Correct - Input tensor shape specified
input_tensor = Input(shape=(5,))
hidden = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(hidden)

model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)

dummy_input = np.random.rand(10, 5)
try:
    model.predict(dummy_input)
    print("Prediction successful, no error raised.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

By changing the input shape to `(5,)`, we resolve the ambiguity and ensure the model can construct all required tensors correctly. This allows it to operate on provided sample data.

**Scenario 3: Data Preprocessing with Inconsistent Shapes**

The attribute error can also emerge from incorrect data preprocessing. If, for example, you are using padding sequences for natural language processing and don’t pad the sequences to the maximum length before feeding them to the model, you can trigger this error.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
import numpy as np

# Incorrect - inconsistent padding
max_len = 10
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_dim = 10
lstm_units = 32

sentences = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6,7,8], [9]] #Variable length sequences
padded_sentences = pad_sequences(sentences)  #Pads to the maximum length in a batch, but not defined
input_tensor = Input(shape=(None,)) #input shape is None
embedded = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_tensor)
lstm = LSTM(lstm_units)(embedded)
output = Dense(10, activation="softmax")(lstm)

model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)

try:
    dummy_input = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6,7,8], [9]])
    model.predict(padded_sentences)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
In the code above, while sequences are padded, the input shape is still provided as `(None,)` so there is ambiguity about the maximum length expected on input and when the model is called `model.predict(padded_sentences)`, the batch data shape is inconsistent. The embedding layer expects a particular input dimension and will not be able to define its weight matrix.
The correct approach is to explicitly pad all sequences to the pre-defined maximum length and provide this information during the definition of the input tensor and embedding layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
import numpy as np

# Correct - Consistent padding and explicit input shape
max_len = 10
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_dim = 10
lstm_units = 32

sentences = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6,7,8], [9]] #Variable length sequences
padded_sentences = pad_sequences(sentences, maxlen=max_len)  #Pads to the maximum length which has been pre-defined
input_tensor = Input(shape=(max_len,))
embedded = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_tensor)
lstm = LSTM(lstm_units)(embedded)
output = Dense(10, activation="softmax")(lstm)

model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)

try:
    model.predict(padded_sentences)
    print("Prediction successful, no error raised.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
By providing `maxlen=max_len` during the padding operation and then providing the input shape of `max_len`, the error is resolved. The embedding layer now can correctly create its weight matrix with the correct dimensionality.

**Recommendations**

To mitigate this `AttributeError`, always pay close attention to the input shapes expected by your model's initial layers. When using the `Sequential` API, ensure the first layer has an explicitly defined `input_shape` parameter. With the Functional API, rigorously define the input tensors using `Input` with a concrete shape parameter. Double-check any preprocessing steps for inconsistencies in the shape of the data being fed into the network. Employing these strategies should greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the occurrence of such errors.

Refer to TensorFlow's documentation on:

- Keras API layers, specifically `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `LSTM`, and `Embedding`.
- Keras `Input` layer for the Functional API.
- TensorFlow's shape handling and broadcasting rules.

Reviewing these resources will provide a deeper understanding of how shape inference works in TensorFlow and equip you to address similar problems efficiently. By always being explicit with the required dimensions you ensure smooth model operation and error-free training.
