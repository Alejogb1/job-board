The interaction between `tf.RunMetadata` and `tf.contrib.learn`'s summary writers isn't directly supported through a simple method call.  `tf.contrib.learn` (now largely superseded by `tf.estimator`) primarily focuses on high-level API abstractions, abstracting away much of the lower-level graph construction and session management where `tf.RunMetadata` finds its utility. My experience working on large-scale TensorFlow deployments for image recognition revealed this limitation early on.  Successfully integrating these two requires a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internal mechanisms and a slightly more manual approach.


**1.  Explanation:**

`tf.RunMetadata` proto buffers encapsulate details about a TensorFlow graph's execution, including profiling information such as operator execution times, memory usage, and step statistics.  `tf.contrib.learn`'s `SummaryWriter` (and its successor in `tf.estimator`, the `tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter`) is designed to log scalar, histogram, and image summaries, primarily focused on model performance tracking.  The critical difference lies in their purpose: summaries describe model outputs and training metrics; metadata describes the execution itself.  They aren't designed for direct interoperability.

To use `tf.RunMetadata` with `tf.contrib.learn`, one needs to explicitly manage the session, run the graph, obtain the metadata, and then serialize and incorporate it into the summary writer's output in a custom manner. This typically involves creating custom summary ops that encode relevant metadata fields, which requires careful consideration of data types and serialization.  This necessitates departing from the pure `tf.contrib.learn` abstraction and taking more control over the TensorFlow session.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Metadata Capture and Serialization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming a simple tf.contrib.learn estimator (replace with tf.estimator equivalent)
# ... estimator definition ...

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    run_options = tf.compat.v1.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.compat.v1.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
    run_metadata = tf.compat.v1.RunMetadata()

    # Run a training step with metadata capture
    _, summary = sess.run([estimator.train_op, estimator.summary_op],
                          options=run_options, run_metadata=run_metadata)


    # Serialize the RunMetadata
    serialized_metadata = run_metadata.SerializeToString()

    #Write the serialized metadata to a file.  This requires custom handling,
    #it won't be automatically handled by the SummaryWriter.
    with open('run_metadata.pb', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(serialized_metadata)

    #Write the standard summaries as usual.  These are separate from the metadata.
    #... standard summary writing using estimator.summary_op ...
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental steps: setting up `RunOptions` for tracing, capturing metadata during execution, serializing the metadata using `SerializeToString()`, and writing it to a separate file. Note that this is not integrated with the summary writer directly; itâ€™s a separate file.

**Example 2:  Embedding Metadata in a Custom Summary:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... estimator definition ...

def create_metadata_summary(metadata):
    #Convert the metadata proto to a string representation suitable for the summary.
    metadata_str = metadata.SerializeToString()
    return tf.compat.v1.summary.text('run_metadata', metadata_str)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    run_options = tf.compat.v1.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.compat.v1.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
    run_metadata = tf.compat.v1.RunMetadata()

    _, summary = sess.run([estimator.train_op, estimator.summary_op],
                          options=run_options, run_metadata=run_metadata)

    #Create the custom summary op
    metadata_summary_op = create_metadata_summary(run_metadata)

    #Merge the custom summary with the existing summaries (potentially using tf.summary.merge_all)
    merged_summary = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge([estimator.summary_op, metadata_summary_op])

    #Write the merged summaries to the writer
    summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter("path/to/logs", sess.graph)
    summary_writer.add_summary(sess.run(merged_summary), global_step)
    summary_writer.close()
```

Here, we create a custom summary operation (`create_metadata_summary`) that converts the serialized `RunMetadata` into a text summary. This allows embedding the metadata information within the standard TensorBoard summaries, though accessing and interpreting this within TensorBoard would require custom tooling or parsing.

**Example 3:  Extracting Specific Metadata Fields:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... metadata capture as in Example 1 ...

#Parse the run metadata to access specific fields like the step statistics.
step_stats = run_metadata.step_stats

for dev_stats in step_stats.dev_stats:
  print(f"Device: {dev_stats.device}")
  for node_stats in dev_stats.node_stats:
    print(f"  Node: {node_stats.node_name}, Exec time: {node_stats.all_end_rel_micros}")

#Further processing and potentially writing specific fields into separate summaries
#would require custom logic for extracting and presenting the relevant data.
```

This example shows how to access specific fields from the `RunMetadata` directly, allowing for more targeted extraction of performance information.  One could then create custom summary ops to log these individual fields separately for more granular analysis in TensorBoard.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on `tf.RunOptions`, `tf.RunMetadata`, and the `tf.compat.v1.summary` module is crucial.  A strong understanding of protocol buffers is necessary for handling the serialized `RunMetadata` efficiently.  Furthermore, proficiency in using TensorBoard and potentially extending its capabilities through custom plugins would significantly aid in visualizing the extracted metadata information.  Finally, familiarity with TensorFlow's session management and graph construction mechanics is essential to successfully implement the outlined methods.
