The `on_epoch_end` callback in Keras' `fit_generator` (now deprecated, but the underlying issue remains relevant to `fit`) is not guaranteed to be called precisely after the specified `steps_per_epoch` due to potential exceptions or early stopping within a generator's iteration. My experience debugging large-scale image classification models highlighted this behavior repeatedly.  The `steps_per_epoch` parameter dictates the number of batches the generator should yield *before* the epoch is considered complete.  However, the generator itself may raise exceptions or encounter conditions causing premature termination of an epoch, thus preventing `on_epoch_end` from triggering. This contrasts with `fit` using a pre-loaded dataset, where `on_epoch_end` reliability is substantially higher.

The primary reason for this unreliability stems from the asynchronous nature of `fit_generator`.  The method relies on a user-provided generator function to continuously supply batches of data.  This generator runs independently, and any error within it – be it an `OutOfMemoryError`, a problem with data loading, or a custom exception within the data preprocessing pipeline – will halt the epoch before completing `steps_per_epoch` iterations.  The `fit_generator` method catches these exceptions but doesn't guarantee execution of `on_epoch_end` in these scenarios.  Instead, it signals epoch termination, often leading to confusion if the user expects certain post-epoch operations (such as model saving or evaluation) to execute reliably.


This behavior has implications beyond simple debugging.  Consider scenarios involving complex data augmentation pipelines embedded within the generator.  A single image might trigger an unexpected error within the augmentation process, causing the entire epoch to terminate prematurely without reaching `steps_per_epoch`. The consequences vary depending on the application; for instance, in a real-time monitoring system this can lead to a loss of data and inaccurate model updates.  In my work on a medical imaging project, this problem surfaced when a corrupted image file within a large dataset halted training, requiring careful investigation and dataset cleanup.


To illustrate, let's consider three code examples.  The first demonstrates a basic generator that simulates a potential error condition:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def error_prone_generator(batch_size, num_batches):
    for i in range(num_batches):
        try:
            # Simulate potential error (e.g., division by zero)
            if i == 3:
                result = 1/0
            yield np.random.rand(batch_size, 10), np.random.rand(batch_size, 1)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Error in generator at batch:", i)
            raise

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
try:
    model.fit_generator(error_prone_generator(32, 10), steps_per_epoch=10, epochs=1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Training stopped due to: {e}")
```

This example showcases how a deliberate error halts the generator before `steps_per_epoch` is reached. The `on_epoch_end` callback (if defined) will not be invoked.  Observe the error message and the incomplete epoch.

Next, we examine a case where the generator produces inconsistent batch sizes. This situation, though less dramatic than an exception, can also lead to premature epoch termination.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def inconsistent_generator(batch_size, num_batches):
    for i in range(num_batches):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield np.random.rand(batch_size, 10), np.random.rand(batch_size, 1)
        else:
            yield np.random.rand(batch_size // 2, 10), np.random.rand(batch_size // 2, 1) #Smaller batch

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit_generator(inconsistent_generator(32, 10), steps_per_epoch=10, epochs=1)
```

In this scenario, while no exception is raised, the inconsistent batch sizes can confuse the `fit_generator` and potentially lead to a premature termination before `steps_per_epoch` is fully completed, although the effects might be less pronounced than in the previous example.  The key is that the generator doesn't strictly adhere to the batch size, causing `steps_per_epoch` to become unreliable.

Finally, consider a scenario involving early stopping within the generator. This might involve a custom check inside the generator function to stop the data stream based on some condition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def early_stopping_generator(batch_size, num_batches, stop_condition):
    for i in range(num_batches):
        if i >= stop_condition:
            break
        yield np.random.rand(batch_size, 10), np.random.rand(batch_size, 1)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit_generator(early_stopping_generator(32, 10, 5), steps_per_epoch=10, epochs=1)
```

Here, the generator introduces an early stop mechanism, simulating a scenario where external factors trigger premature termination.  Again, `on_epoch_end` will likely not be invoked after the intended `steps_per_epoch`.

To reliably manage post-epoch operations, I'd suggest avoiding reliance on `on_epoch_end` alone when using generators. Instead, implement custom logic within the generator itself or use Keras' `Callbacks` system alongside a more robust check of the actual steps processed versus `steps_per_epoch`. This ensures that operations are executed at the correct time, regardless of generator behavior.


For further reading, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation on callbacks and data generators, along with texts on advanced TensorFlow and deep learning practices.  A thorough understanding of exception handling in Python and the nuances of asynchronous programming is also beneficial for troubleshooting these types of issues.  Additionally, the Keras source code itself provides valuable insights into the inner workings of `fit_generator`.  Focusing on robust generator design and meticulous error handling greatly mitigates the risk of unpredictable `on_epoch_end` behavior.
