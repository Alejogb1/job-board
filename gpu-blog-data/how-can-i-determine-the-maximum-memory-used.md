The efficient monitoring of memory consumption during Keras model training is critical, particularly when working with large datasets or complex architectures, and can prevent unexpected resource limitations and slowdowns. Iâ€™ve personally encountered situations where seemingly minor modifications to a model resulted in memory usage that exceeded available resources, necessitating a robust approach to identifying peak memory utilization.

The straightforward method of directly measuring memory consumption within the Keras `fit` loop presents challenges. Keras, operating atop TensorFlow or other backends, handles memory allocation dynamically and, therefore, traditional system monitoring tools might not provide a fine-grained, model-specific view. Instead, effective memory measurement relies on hooks and callbacks within the Keras framework, coupled with specific backend functionalities.

Essentially, peak memory usage during model fitting isn't constant; it fluctuates as the training progresses. The initial phase, often involving data loading and the creation of computational graphs, usually corresponds to a significant memory allocation. Subsequent epochs and batches might show less significant changes if the graph remains stable. Thus, measuring memory once at the start or end of fitting is inadequate to capture the actual peak. To address this, we need to probe memory consumption at critical points within the training process. Specifically, we aim to query memory utilization before and after each batch processing step or within carefully placed callbacks.

The backend implementation of the Keras framework influences the specific methodology. TensorFlow, for example, maintains its own internal memory management system which needs to be queried directly, not via typical Python memory-monitoring libraries. The key to accurately gauging peak memory during Keras fitting lies in utilizing hooks exposed by the underlying TensorFlow session combined with custom Keras callbacks.

The first approach involves leveraging `tf.compat.v1.Session` and memory tracing functionalities offered within TensorFlow versions prior to 2.x. This allows for a more direct interrogation of memory use managed by the TensorFlow runtime.

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

tf.disable_v2_behavior()

class MemoryMonitor(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MemoryMonitor, self).__init__()
        self.peak_memory = 0
        self.sess = tf.compat.v1.get_default_session()
        if self.sess is None:
            raise Exception("A TensorFlow session needs to be created before using MemoryMonitor")
        self.graph = tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()
        self.options = tf.compat.v1.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.compat.v1.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE)
        self.run_metadata = tf.compat.v1.RunMetadata()


    def on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.sess.run(tf.compat.v1.assign_add(tf.compat.v1.constant(0,dtype=tf.int64), 0),
                  options=self.options, run_metadata=self.run_metadata)
        memory_usage = self.sess.run(tf.compat.v1.reduce_sum(
            [op.node_def.attr["_allocator_name"].s == b"GPU_0_bfc" or op.node_def.attr["_allocator_name"].s == b"CPU_0_bfc"
             for op in self.graph.get_operations()]),
                                   options=self.options, run_metadata=self.run_metadata) #CPU or GPU
        self.peak_memory = max(self.peak_memory, memory_usage)


    def on_train_end(self, logs=None):
      print(f"Peak Memory Usage: {self.peak_memory} (TensorFlow internal units)")

# Sample Keras Model and Training

model = Sequential([Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)), Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
data = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
labels = np.random.rand(1000, 1)
memory_monitor = MemoryMonitor()
model.fit(data, labels, batch_size=32, epochs=2, callbacks=[memory_monitor], verbose = 0)
```

This implementation defines `MemoryMonitor`, a Keras callback that leverages TensorFlow's tracing mechanism to monitor allocation. It initializes with a session and graph context. The `on_batch_begin` function is crucial. Here, a dummy operation is executed to allow the capture of metadata using `RunOptions` and `RunMetadata`. Then, it scans the operations in the TensorFlow graph using a lambda function, counting allocations to the GPU or CPU, based on their name attribute. The running `peak_memory` is updated at each batch and displayed at the end of training. Notice the need to disable TensorFlow 2 behavior and obtain the active session.  This approach gives us memory usage in some TensorFlow backend specific unit count, not in familiar byte or megabyte units, which is a limitation.

The second approach, applicable to TensorFlow 2.x, utilizes `tf.profiler`'s memory tools and a callback based on the Keras `fit` execution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

class MemoryMonitorTF2(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MemoryMonitorTF2, self).__init__()
        self.peak_memory = 0
        self.current_memory = 0
        self.profiler_result = None

    def on_train_begin(self, logs=None):
        tf.profiler.experimental.start("logdir")

    def on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
         self.profiler_result = tf.profiler.experimental.Profile("logdir")
         memory_usage = tf.profiler.experimental.memory_usage("logdir")
         if memory_usage: #memory_usage could be None if not supported
            self.current_memory = sum(memory_usage.values())
            self.peak_memory = max(self.peak_memory, self.current_memory)

    def on_train_end(self, logs=None):
         tf.profiler.experimental.stop("logdir")
         print(f"Peak Memory Usage: {self.peak_memory} bytes")


model = Sequential([Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)), Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
data = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
labels = np.random.rand(1000, 1)
memory_monitor = MemoryMonitorTF2()
model.fit(data, labels, batch_size=32, epochs=2, callbacks=[memory_monitor], verbose = 0)
```

In this example, `MemoryMonitorTF2`, a Keras callback, leverages TensorFlow 2's profiling capabilities. We start profiling at the beginning of the train loop. During `on_batch_begin`, we explicitly perform a short profile, extracting memory usage information at the batch level. This approach gives memory usage as bytes which is more easily interpreted.  The `memory_usage` dictionary contains several memory information metrics from which we take the sum. We record the peak. The profiler is stopped after the full training completes.  If the device does not support memory profiling, `memory_usage` would be None.  This approach requires more setup but is more portable across different TensorFlow versions.

Finally, for a simpler approach with a slightly higher overhead, one can use system memory monitoring libraries, as an alternative, though this can be less precise:

```python
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np
import psutil
import os
import time

class SystemMemoryMonitor(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SystemMemoryMonitor, self).__init__()
        self.peak_memory = 0
    def on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
         memory_usage = psutil.Process(os.getpid()).memory_info().rss
         self.peak_memory = max(self.peak_memory, memory_usage)
    def on_train_end(self, logs=None):
        print(f"Peak Memory Usage: {self.peak_memory/(1024*1024):.2f} MB")

model = Sequential([Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)), Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
data = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
labels = np.random.rand(1000, 1)
memory_monitor = SystemMemoryMonitor()
model.fit(data, labels, batch_size=32, epochs=2, callbacks=[memory_monitor], verbose = 0)
```

Here, `SystemMemoryMonitor` uses the `psutil` library to fetch the resident set size (RSS) memory consumption of the current process. `psutil` provides an operating-system-level view of memory and is thus less aligned with memory consumption within the TensorFlow framework. This method might include Python interpreter overhead, not just the model's memory footprint, and lacks the fine-grained tracking of the internal memory allocator. However, it's often easier to implement and can be a helpful quick check.

Recommended resources for further exploration include the official TensorFlow documentation covering its profiler and session management and general best practices related to system monitoring. Further exploration of the specific memory allocator options available in TensorFlow (e.g., the use of BFC allocator) could provide further insight when analyzing the results.  Additionally, examining the official Keras documentation pertaining to callbacks can assist in applying these techniques within a broader training framework. These sources will build on this answer and provide a deeper understanding of internal mechanisms.
