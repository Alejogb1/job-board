The core issue, observed frequently in novice data manipulation, stems from a misunderstanding of how array variables are stored and referenced in many programming languages. Instead of directly holding the array's data, variables often store a *reference* (or pointer) to the memory location where the data resides. This crucial difference leads to unintended consequences when 'copying' arrays incorrectly, specifically causing the repetition of the last element, as the question describes.

A typical scenario arises when attempting to assign one array variable to another with a direct assignment operator (e.g., `=`). Instead of creating a distinct copy of the array data, this action copies the reference, resulting in two variables pointing to the same underlying memory location. Subsequent modifications through *either* variable affect the data because both reference the same source. This isn't true data duplication, but rather a shared perspective on the same data. When the last element in one array is modified, and the 'copy' is also viewed, it appears to be a repetition because all elements are referencing the original, modified last element.

To illustrate this, I’ve seen several instances where this caused problems, including in a simulation project where I was responsible for tracking agent positions. Initial naive attempts at copying position arrays led to every agent mirroring the movement of the last agent, a clearly incorrect outcome.

To demonstrate this reference-based behavior, let's consider a JavaScript example, a language where this particular pitfall is encountered often.

```javascript
// Example 1: Reference Assignment and Unexpected Repetition
let sourceArray = [1, 2, 3];
let destinationArray = sourceArray; // Reference is copied, NOT the array itself
sourceArray[0] = 4;  // Modifying the 'source' array
console.log("Source Array:", sourceArray);      // Output: [4, 2, 3]
console.log("Destination Array:", destinationArray); // Output: [4, 2, 3]
destinationArray[2] = 5;
console.log("Source Array:", sourceArray);      // Output: [4, 2, 5]
console.log("Destination Array:", destinationArray); // Output: [4, 2, 5]
```

In this code, `destinationArray = sourceArray;` does *not* copy the array content. It simply makes `destinationArray` another pointer to the same array held by `sourceArray`. Changes made through either variable affect both. Notice how modifications through either variable are reflected in the other because they point to the same location.

The key to creating an independent copy of an array lies in allocating *new* memory and populating it with the values of the original array. Many languages provide built-in methods for this purpose. Here's how to achieve a proper copy using the JavaScript `slice()` method. This method creates a new array and copies the elements from a defined range (or all of them).

```javascript
// Example 2: Proper Array Copy using slice()
let sourceArray = [1, 2, 3];
let destinationArray = sourceArray.slice(); // Creates a *new* array and copies values.
sourceArray[0] = 4; // Modify source only
console.log("Source Array:", sourceArray);      // Output: [4, 2, 3]
console.log("Destination Array:", destinationArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
destinationArray[2] = 5;
console.log("Source Array:", sourceArray);      // Output: [4, 2, 3]
console.log("Destination Array:", destinationArray); // Output: [1, 2, 5]
```
Now, any modification to `sourceArray` will not affect `destinationArray` and vice versa. The `slice()` method successfully created an independent copy of the original data.

However, the simple `slice()` works for one dimensional arrays; deep copies for multi-dimensional or arrays of objects require a slightly different approach. Shallow copies, like that which `slice()` performs, copy the top level of the array and references for nested objects or arrays; modifying the nested items is still modifying shared values. Creating a fully independent copy of each item within a multi-dimensional array (or arrays of objects) demands a technique known as "deep copy".  This usually involves a recursive approach or the use of specific utilities designed for this purpose. Here’s a simple example to illustrate the difference, including a recursive function to perform a deep copy:

```javascript
// Example 3: Handling multi-dimensional arrays and deep copies
let sourceArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];

function deepCopy(arr) {
    if (typeof arr !== 'object' || arr === null) {
      return arr; // Primitive types and null are copied as is.
    }

    let copy = Array.isArray(arr) ? [] : {};

    for (let key in arr) {
      if (arr.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        copy[key] = deepCopy(arr[key]); // Recursive deep copy
      }
    }
    return copy;
  }

let destinationArray = deepCopy(sourceArray); // Use the deepCopy function.

sourceArray[0][0] = 5;
console.log("Source Array:", sourceArray);          // Output: [[5, 2], [3, 4]]
console.log("Destination Array:", destinationArray); // Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

In this example, `deepCopy` ensures that nested arrays are also duplicated, providing an entirely separate object from the original. A simple assignment, or even `slice()` on the top level alone, would not have resulted in a completely independent data structure. The need to create true copies is especially important when dealing with mutable objects (or arrays).

For further understanding, I recommend reviewing resources that specifically focus on memory management in your chosen language. Texts covering data structures and algorithms often dedicate sections to pointer manipulation and memory allocation, providing a more theoretical basis. Examining documentation for array manipulation methods of the specific language will also enhance practical understanding of what these functions do. These sources will also provide guidance on different forms of copying for different data types (primitives, objects), and what methods are appropriate for each. Finally, practicing with examples and observing the outcomes can concretize the understanding of reference vs. value assignment.
