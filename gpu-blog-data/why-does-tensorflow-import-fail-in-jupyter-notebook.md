The discrepancy in TensorFlow import behavior between Jupyter Notebook and the Anaconda Prompt often stems from differing Python environment configurations.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects, the root cause usually lies in inconsistent environment activation or conflicting package installations.  Jupyter Notebook, while leveraging Anaconda's Python distribution, may not automatically inherit the activated environment settings from your terminal, leading to the import failure.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Anaconda manages multiple Python environments, each capable of holding distinct package sets.  When you open Anaconda Prompt and activate a specific environment (e.g., `conda activate my_tensorflow_env`), you're instructing the shell to use that environment's Python interpreter and its associated packages.  Consequently, any `import tensorflow` command within that prompt will succeed if TensorFlow is installed within the activated environment.

However, Jupyter Notebook's environment is independent.  While the kernel you choose for a notebook might be linked to an Anaconda environment,  this link is not always automatic or correctly established. Jupyter may, by default, use a base environment or a different environment than the one you have activated in your terminal.  This is particularly relevant if you've installed TensorFlow in a specific environment but haven't explicitly configured Jupyter to utilize that environment's kernel. Therefore, if TensorFlow is absent from the Jupyter kernel's environment, the import will fail, despite successful execution in the activated Anaconda Prompt.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct Environment Configuration**

This example demonstrates the ideal setup where Jupyter Notebook utilizes the same environment as the Anaconda Prompt.  Assume 'my_tensorflow_env' contains TensorFlow.

```python
# Anaconda Prompt:
conda activate my_tensorflow_env
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"

# Jupyter Notebook (after selecting the 'my_tensorflow_env' kernel):
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

**Commentary:**  The crucial step is activating the correct environment in the Anaconda Prompt *before* launching Jupyter Notebook.  Furthermore, when initiating the notebook, one should ensure that the kernel associated with the 'my_tensorflow_env' is selected.  This consistency guarantees access to the same Python interpreter and package collection in both environments.  Inconsistent versions reported between the Prompt and Notebook would indicate a misconfiguration.


**Example 2: Incorrect Environment (Common Pitfall)**

This demonstrates a common scenario where the import fails in Jupyter because it's not using the correct environment.

```python
# Anaconda Prompt:
conda activate my_tensorflow_env
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"

# Jupyter Notebook (using the base environment):
import tensorflow as tf  # This will likely fail
print(tf.__version__)
```

**Commentary:** The Anaconda Prompt utilizes 'my_tensorflow_env', containing TensorFlow. However, the Jupyter Notebook implicitly uses the base environment, which lacks TensorFlow.  This highlights the critical difference in environment management. The error message will indicate a `ModuleNotFoundError`, directly pointing to the missing TensorFlow package in the Jupyter kernel's environment.


**Example 3:  Manual Kernel Specification (Advanced)**

This involves explicitly configuring Jupyter to use a specific kernel.  This method is useful for managing complex projects or multiple environments.

```python
# Anaconda Prompt:
conda create -n my_tensorflow_env python=3.9 tensorflow
conda activate my_tensorflow_env
ipykernel install --user --name=my_tensorflow_env --display-name="Python (my_tensorflow_env)"


# Jupyter Notebook (after selecting "Python (my_tensorflow_env)" kernel):
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

**Commentary:**  The `ipykernel install` command creates a new kernel in Jupyter, explicitly linking it to the 'my_tensorflow_env'.  This offers precise control over the Jupyter kernels.  Using the `--display-name` flag allows for easily identifiable kernels within the notebook.  This approach eliminates ambiguity about the used environment.  After installing the kernel, restart Jupyter Notebook for the changes to take effect.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official Anaconda documentation for detailed instructions on environment management.  Familiarize yourself with the `conda` command-line interface, including commands like `create`, `activate`, `deactivate`, and `list`.  Understanding how to manage Jupyter kernels is also critical, including methods to create, list, and remove kernels.  Finally, reviewing TensorFlow's installation guide, specifically the section on environment setup, is highly advisable to ensure proper installation within your chosen environment.  Consider exploring dedicated Python environment management tools if you manage numerous projects with varying dependencies.
