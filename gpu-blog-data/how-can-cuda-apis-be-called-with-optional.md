CUDA API calls inherently assume execution on the default device, a behavior often insufficient for managing diverse GPU configurations or maximizing resource utilization in complex applications.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications, specifically within the realm of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, highlights the critical need for explicit device selection.  This response will detail strategies to achieve optional device location specification when invoking CUDA APIs, emphasizing the importance of error handling and resource management for robust code.

**1.  Understanding CUDA Device Management**

The CUDA runtime API offers functions for querying available devices and setting the default device. However, these aren't directly incorporated into the individual kernel launch functions.  To achieve optional device specification, one needs to manage the device context explicitly.  This involves querying the available devices, potentially allowing user input to select a specific device, and then setting that device as the current context before launching any kernels.  Crucially, neglecting this step leads to implicit execution on the default device, potentially causing unexpected behavior or performance bottlenecks if your system has multiple GPUs with varying capabilities.  Failure to properly manage the device context can lead to silent errors or crashes later in the application.

**2.  Code Examples Illustrating Optional Device Selection**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to manage device selection, incorporating error checking and clear separation of concerns for maintainability.

**Example 1:  User-Specified Device with Error Handling**

This example allows the user to select the device from a list of available devices, handling errors gracefully.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int deviceCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

  if (deviceCount == 0) {
    std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  std::cout << "Available devices:" << std::endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; ++i) {
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, i);
    std::cout << i << ": " << prop.name << std::endl;
  }

  int selectedDevice;
  std::cout << "Enter the device number: ";
  std::cin >> selectedDevice;

  if (selectedDevice < 0 || selectedDevice >= deviceCount) {
    std::cerr << "Invalid device number." << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  cudaSetDevice(selectedDevice);
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "Error setting device: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // ... CUDA kernel launch code ...

  return 0;
}
```

This code first checks for the presence of CUDA devices.  It then presents the user with a list of devices and prompts for input.  Crucially, it validates the user input and checks for errors after setting the device.  Any error during device selection is reported to the user, preventing silent failures. The commented section "... CUDA kernel launch code ..." represents where the actual kernel launch would occur after successfully setting the device context.

**Example 2:  Device Selection Based on Properties**

This example demonstrates selecting a device based on specific properties, such as memory size or compute capability.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int deviceCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

  if (deviceCount == 0) {
    std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  int bestDevice = -1;
  int maxMemory = -1;

  for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; ++i) {
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, i);
    if (prop.totalGlobalMem > maxMemory) {
      maxMemory = prop.totalGlobalMem;
      bestDevice = i;
    }
  }

  if (bestDevice == -1) {
    std::cerr << "No suitable device found." << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  cudaSetDevice(bestDevice);
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "Error setting device: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // ... CUDA kernel launch code ...

  return 0;
}

```

This code iterates through the available devices, selecting the one with the largest global memory.  This approach is useful when performance optimization depends on available resources.  The selection criteria can be easily modified to prioritize other properties like compute capability.  Error handling remains a critical component, ensuring robustness.

**Example 3:  Using a Configuration File for Device Selection**

This example illustrates retrieving the device selection from an external configuration file, adding flexibility and avoiding hardcoded values.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream configFile("device_config.txt");
    if (!configFile.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Error opening configuration file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int selectedDevice;
    configFile >> selectedDevice;
    configFile.close();

    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    if (selectedDevice < 0 || selectedDevice >= deviceCount) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid device number in configuration file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    cudaSetDevice(selectedDevice);
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "Error setting device: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ... CUDA kernel launch code ...

    return 0;
}
```

This approach enhances flexibility by allowing external configuration of the device. The `device_config.txt` file should contain a single integer representing the desired device index.  The code rigorously validates the configuration file and handles potential errors arising from file access and invalid device indices.

**3.  Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, consult the CUDA Programming Guide and the CUDA C++ Programming Guide.  Thoroughly review the CUDA runtime API documentation, particularly the sections on device management and error handling.  Familiarize yourself with the `cudaGetDeviceCount()`, `cudaGetDeviceProperties()`, `cudaSetDevice()`, and `cudaGetLastError()` functions.  Furthermore, studying best practices for error handling in CUDA applications is essential for developing robust and reliable HPC applications.  Consider exploring more advanced topics such as CUDA streams and contexts for further performance optimization.  Understanding how these concepts interact with device selection will be crucial when building sophisticated applications.  Always remember to meticulously handle potential errors at each step to guarantee the stability of your code.
