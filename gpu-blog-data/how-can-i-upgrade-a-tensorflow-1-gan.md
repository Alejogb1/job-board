TensorFlow 1's `tf.contrib` modules, heavily relied upon in many early GAN implementations, are absent in TensorFlow 2.  This necessitates a significant restructuring for successful migration.  My experience porting several GAN projects from TensorFlow 1 to 2 on Google Colab highlights the key challenges:  replacing deprecated functions, adapting the graph execution model to the eager execution paradigm, and managing changes in API calls for layers and optimizers.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Upgrade Process:**

The upgrade process involves a multi-step approach. First,  the notebook must be thoroughly examined to identify all TensorFlow 1-specific functionalities.  This includes identifying usage of `tf.contrib` modules, which were removed in TensorFlow 2.  Alternatives must be found within the core TensorFlow 2 API or through compatible third-party libraries.  Second, the code needs to be converted from the static graph execution model of TensorFlow 1 to the eager execution model of TensorFlow 2.  This shift primarily involves removing session management constructs like `tf.Session()` and explicitly running operations within the eager context.  Third, any custom layers or loss functions will require adaptation to the TensorFlow 2 API. Finally, compatibility with Colab's runtime environment must be verified. I've observed frequent conflicts stemming from differing versions of supporting libraries.

The transition from static graphs to eager execution is pivotal.  In TensorFlow 1, operations were defined within a graph and executed later using a session.  TensorFlow 2 operates primarily in eager execution, where operations are evaluated immediately. This simplification drastically alters the workflow.  For instance,  variables are initialized automatically, eliminating the need for explicit `tf.global_variables_initializer()` calls.  Similarly, the way tensors are handled changes, often requiring explicit type casting or reshaping.

Another crucial aspect is the management of custom layers.  TensorFlow 1 allowed for greater flexibility in defining layers, sometimes through a combination of `tf.layers` and custom functions.  TensorFlow 2 encourages the use of the `tf.keras.layers` API, which provides a more structured and standardized approach.  Consequently, existing custom layer implementations often need substantial modification or complete rewriting.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Replacing `tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm`**

```python
# TensorFlow 1 code
import tensorflow as tf
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() # Essential for TF1 compatibility in TF2 environment.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    normalized = tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm(inputs, is_training=True)
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

# TensorFlow 2 equivalent
import tensorflow as tf
normalized = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(inputs, training=True)
```

Commentary:  `tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm` is replaced with `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`. The `is_training` flag is now `training`. The session management is entirely removed, leveraging TensorFlow 2's eager execution.  During my work on a DCGAN project, this single change resolved numerous compatibility errors.


**Example 2:  Converting a custom loss function**

```python
# TensorFlow 1 code
import tensorflow as tf
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
    return loss

# TensorFlow 2 equivalent
import tensorflow as tf
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
    return loss
```

Commentary:  In this instance, the custom loss function remains largely unchanged. TensorFlow 2 maintains backward compatibility for many core functions like `tf.reduce_mean` and `tf.square`.  However, more complex custom losses often require a reassessment of their implementation using `tf.keras.losses` for enhanced integration with Keras models.  I encountered this during the conversion of a conditional GAN where a bespoke loss incorporating label information needed minor adjustments for improved readability and efficiency.

**Example 3: Adapting a generator model**

```python
# TensorFlow 1 code (simplified)
import tensorflow as tf
def generator(z):
    with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope("generator"):
        out = tf.layers.dense(z, 128)
        out = tf.nn.relu(out)
        out = tf.layers.dense(out, 784)
        out = tf.nn.tanh(out)
        return out

# TensorFlow 2 equivalent
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
def generator(z):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(z.shape[1],)),
      Dense(784, activation='tanh')
    ])
    return model(z)

```

Commentary: This illustrates the migration from `tf.layers` to `tf.keras.layers`.  The TensorFlow 1 code uses individual layer calls within a variable scope.  The TensorFlow 2 version employs a `tf.keras.Sequential` model, offering a more structured and reusable approach. This shift, while seemingly minor, significantly improves the code's organization and readability. My experience working with StyleGAN-like architectures demonstrated the benefits of this approach, as the Keras sequential model allowed for easy modification and extension of the generator network.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow migration guide.  The TensorFlow 2 API documentation.  Books on practical TensorFlow 2 implementations focusing on GAN architectures.  Relevant research papers discussing advanced GAN designs within a TensorFlow 2 context.  Numerous tutorials and blog posts specific to GAN implementation in TensorFlow 2 and Colab are readily available.  Careful review of each of these resources is essential for a successful and comprehensive porting.



By carefully addressing these points and employing a systematic approach, the transition of a TensorFlow 1 GAN notebook to TensorFlow 2 for use on Google Colab can be accomplished effectively.  The key is to understand the fundamental differences between the two versions and to utilize the improved tools and functionalities offered by TensorFlow 2. Remember thorough testing and validation are crucial throughout the entire process.
