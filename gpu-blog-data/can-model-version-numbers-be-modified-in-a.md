Model version numbers, within the context of a registry-based system I've extensively worked with, are not directly modifiable in the same manner one might alter a simple configuration value.  This stems from the underlying design principle of maintaining data integrity and version control.  Direct manipulation risks introducing inconsistencies and compromising the system's ability to track model deployments and manage dependencies.  Instead of direct modification, the approach revolves around creating new registry entries for updated versions.

My experience primarily involves a custom-built registry system for machine learning models, integrated with a distributed microservice architecture. This system, which I was instrumental in developing, leveraged a structured approach to versioning that prioritized traceability and rollback capabilities.  We chose this path after experiencing the difficulties associated with directly manipulating version numbers in an earlier iteration. The lessons learned were crucial in establishing the system's current robustness.

The core concept is that a model version number, within our system, isn't just a numerical identifier. It's a unique key associated with a comprehensive metadata record.  This record encompasses not only the version number itself, but also essential attributes like model architecture, training data provenance, performance metrics, and the location of the model artifacts.  Directly altering the version number would necessitate a cascading update across all linked metadata fields, a process highly prone to error and a significant security risk.

Instead, the process of updating a model involves the following steps:  1) Development and testing of the new model version. 2) Generation of a new, incremented version number according to a predefined semantic versioning scheme (e.g., Major.Minor.Patch). 3) Creation of a new entry in the registry with the updated version number and complete metadata.  This ensures the complete history of the model is maintained within the registry.  The old version remains accessible, allowing for rollback capabilities and facilitating A/B testing or other comparative analyses.

Let's examine this through code examples, assuming a Python environment with a hypothetical registry API. This API uses a JSON-like structure for data representation within the registry.  The actual implementation would involve database interactions (likely PostgreSQL or similar) and security measures beyond the scope of this explanation.

**Example 1: Registering a new model version**

```python
import requests

def register_model(model_name, version, metadata):
    url = f"http://registry-service:8080/models/{model_name}"
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    payload = {"version": version, "metadata": metadata}

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
model_metadata = {
    "architecture": "CNN",
    "training_data": "dataset_v3",
    "accuracy": 0.95
}

new_version_data = register_model("image_classifier", "1.0.1", model_metadata)
print(f"New model version registered: {new_version_data}")
```

This example showcases the process of registering a new model version. Note that the `version` parameter is integral to the registry entry but isn't directly mutable post-creation. The `requests` library is used for interacting with the hypothetical registry service.  Error handling is included to ensure robustness.


**Example 2: Retrieving model metadata by version**

```python
import requests

def get_model_metadata(model_name, version):
    url = f"http://registry-service:8080/models/{model_name}/versions/{version}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

# Example usage
metadata = get_model_metadata("image_classifier", "1.0.1")
print(f"Metadata for image_classifier version 1.0.1: {metadata}")

```

This example demonstrates retrieving specific model information based on the model name and its version number, highlighting the registry’s role in version management.  Retrieving the metadata associated with a specific version is key to maintaining traceability and understanding the model’s evolution.

**Example 3: Listing all versions of a model**

```python
import requests

def list_model_versions(model_name):
  url = f"http://registry-service:8080/models/{model_name}/versions"
  response = requests.get(url)
  response.raise_for_status()
  return response.json()

# Example usage
versions = list_model_versions("image_classifier")
print(f"All versions of image_classifier: {versions}")

```

This final example shows how to list all registered versions of a specific model. This is essential for monitoring model deployment history and for making informed decisions about which model versions to utilize or deprecate.


In summary, while you cannot directly modify model version numbers in a well-designed registry, you can manage versions effectively through a process of creating new registry entries for each updated model.  This approach prioritizes data integrity, version control, and the ability to track and manage models throughout their lifecycle.  Direct modification is avoided due to the inherent risks associated with data corruption and the loss of crucial version history.
