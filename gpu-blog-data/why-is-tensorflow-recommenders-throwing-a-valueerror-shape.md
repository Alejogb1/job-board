The `ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 3` encountered when working with TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) indicates a dimensionality mismatch between the expected input shape for certain layers or operations and the actual shape of the tensors being passed. This commonly arises when data preprocessing or model building stages do not correctly prepare the feature data for TFRS model components. Having spent the last five years building various recommendation systems using TensorFlow, I've encountered this error numerous times, each time stemming from a slightly different source of input shape discrepancy. I'll explain the root cause, detail common scenarios leading to this issue, and provide code examples with a focus on how to rectify the shape conflict.

The core of the problem resides in the fact that TFRS, like many other machine learning frameworks, expects tensors with a specific rank (number of dimensions) for certain internal calculations, especially in embedding layers and matrix multiplications within scoring functions. A rank 2 tensor corresponds to a matrix (often representing a batch of vectors) which is a standard input format for many layers. When a tensor with rank 3, which can be visualized as a stack of matrices, is provided to an operation expecting rank 2, a `ValueError` is predictably triggered. This implies that either the data preprocessing is creating too many dimensions or the model architecture is not handling the preprocessed dimensions correctly.

One common cause is incorrect handling of sequence data. In many recommendation problems, especially those involving user history (e.g., viewing history, purchase history), the input often comes in the form of sequences. Let’s assume we're working with user movie viewing history for a content-based recommendation model. If we preprocess each user's history and pass it to the model in a way that preserves the sequence within a batch entry, it’s very likely to result in the rank 3 issue. For example, if we have batches of users, and each user’s sequence of viewed movies is represented as an integer sequence, and then we try to directly use this preprocessed data as an input to an embedding layer (which typically expects rank 2, namely [batch_size, feature_dimension]) we'll face this error. The intended input for such an embedding layer would be an input with shape `[batch_size, feature_dimension]`, where `feature_dimension` is the size of our embedding, but instead it receives something more akin to `[batch_size, sequence_length, 1]` (where each item in a sequence is represented by a single value before embedding).

Here’s a code example that demonstrates the problem, followed by how it’s typically corrected:

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Handling of Sequences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_recommenders as tfrs

# Assume user histories are sequences of movie IDs
user_histories = tf.constant([[[1], [2], [3]], [[4], [5], [6]], [[7],[8], [9]]], dtype=tf.int32) # Shape: (3, 3, 1)
# This is a batch of 3 users each having a history of 3 movies.

# Define embedding layer
embedding_dimension = 8
embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=embedding_dimension)

try:
    # Attempt to pass rank 3 tensor to a layer expecting rank 2
    embedded_histories = embedding_layer(user_histories)
    print(embedded_histories.shape) # This line will not execute, as the error will be raised first
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this initial example, `user_histories` is a rank 3 tensor with shape `(3, 3, 1)`. The embedding layer requires a rank 2 input of shape `(batch_size, some_input_feature)`, but it's receiving `(batch_size, sequence_length, 1)`. This shape mismatch causes a tensor rank error, as the embedding layer isn’t set up to process sequences directly. The embedding layer can't interpret the tensor as a batch of integers that need to be converted into embeddings, instead treats the entire sequence as a single integer feature which is incorrect for our intended use case.

The remedy involves flattening the sequence dimension within the input data, either before passing it through the embedding or by using special techniques within the model architecture, like masking. Here's the corrected example:

**Example 2: Correctly Flattening Input for Embedding Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_recommenders as tfrs

# Assume user histories are sequences of movie IDs
user_histories = tf.constant([[[1], [2], [3]], [[4], [5], [6]], [[7],[8], [9]]], dtype=tf.int32) # Shape: (3, 3, 1)

embedding_dimension = 8
embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=embedding_dimension)


# Correct the input by reshaping:
flattened_histories = tf.reshape(user_histories, shape=(-1, 1))  # Reshape to (9, 1)
embedded_histories = embedding_layer(flattened_histories) # Now shape is (9, embedding_dimension)

print(f"Shape of the embedding output after flattening: {embedded_histories.shape}")

# If we want to work with each user history separately, we have to reshape it back:
embedded_histories_per_user = tf.reshape(embedded_histories, shape=(3, 3, embedding_dimension)) # Reshape back to (3,3, embedding_dimension)

print(f"Shape of the embedded history reshaped back to user level : {embedded_histories_per_user.shape}")

```

Here, we flatten the `user_histories` into a rank 2 tensor using `tf.reshape`, converting it from `(3, 3, 1)` to `(9, 1)`. After passing it through the embedding layer, its shape becomes `(9, 8)`. We can then perform further operations, possibly reshaping it back to its sequence representation later in the architecture. The important part is we successfully avoided passing a tensor with rank 3 to the embedding layer. If, after the embedding is complete, you need to work with a rank 3 output where the second dimension represents the sequence, you can use tf.reshape again.

Another scenario leading to the same error can arise when using TFRS’s pre-built models, particularly during their initialization. Let’s imagine we're using the TFRS retrieval task with a custom query model. We could accidentally process the query data incorrectly such that it’s not in a format suitable for processing by the retrieval task, which requires a rank 2 tensor.

**Example 3: Incorrect Query Input in TFRS Retrieval Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_recommenders as tfrs

# Assume a simplistic query model
class CustomQueryModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, embedding_dimension):
    super().__init__()
    self.embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=embedding_dimension)

  def call(self, query_inputs):
     # Assume that somehow query inputs are of shape (batch_size, 1, 1) instead of (batch_size, 1)
     query_embedding = self.embedding_layer(tf.reshape(query_inputs, shape = (-1,1))) # We need to flatten if the input is (batch_size,1,1)

     return query_embedding

embedding_dimension = 8
query_model = CustomQueryModel(embedding_dimension)

# Simulate some query data with an extra dimension, this could happen if our data loading process adds an unnecessary dimension.
query_data = tf.constant([[[1]], [[2]], [[3]]], dtype=tf.int32) # Shape: (3, 1, 1)

# This will raise a dimension issue
try:
  # Create retrieval task and pass it a query model which is expecting the output of shape (batch_size, embedding_dimension)
  # instead it gets (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension) if no flattening is performed.
    task = tfrs.tasks.Retrieval()
    class Model(tfrs.Model):
      def __init__(self, query_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.query_model = query_model
        self.task = task

      def compute_loss(self, features, training=False):
        query_embeddings = self.query_model(features)
        loss = self.task(query_embeddings, query_embeddings)
        return loss

    model = Model(query_model)

    # Trying to compute the loss will throw the error, since loss calc involves matrix multiplication using the query embeddings
    loss_result = model.compute_loss(query_data) # Error in this line

except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")

```

Here, `query_data` has shape `(3, 1, 1)` and this is not handled correctly by our `query_model` as we are not flattening it before passing to the embedding layer, which would result in a rank 3 tensor with shape `(batch_size, 1, embedding_dimension)`. The retrieval task then tries to use these embedded queries expecting rank 2 tensor but instead it receives a rank 3 tensor, thus causing the `ValueError`. The solution, similar to the previous example, involves ensuring that the output of the `CustomQueryModel` has the correct rank (rank 2 in this case). This might mean adding a reshaping operation or reviewing the custom model’s code to ensure correct tensor manipulation.

In summary, the `ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 3` in TensorFlow Recommenders primarily occurs when the framework encounters tensors with an unexpected number of dimensions, typically when dealing with sequence data or custom model components. The solution involves carefully examining the shapes of the input tensors at different stages of processing, particularly at the embedding layers and the input of scoring functions, ensuring they conform to the dimensionality requirements of the framework. Techniques like `tf.reshape` and using appropriate masking mechanisms are critical to resolve these shape conflicts. Careful attention should be paid to the output shapes of the query model and candidate models and their inputs during training.

To deepen your understanding, I recommend consulting books on TensorFlow and deep learning for recommender systems, specifically chapters addressing sequence modeling and data preprocessing. Additionally, examine the official TensorFlow Recommenders documentation and associated tutorials. The source code for the TFRS framework itself can also be a valuable reference for debugging these sorts of issues. Finally, examining related questions and their accepted answers on StackOverflow and other Q&A platforms often provides insights on how other practitioners have resolved these issues in similar scenarios.
