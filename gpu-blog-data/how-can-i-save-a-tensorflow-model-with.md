The core issue when saving a TensorFlow model containing a `DistributionLambda` layer arises from the serialization process’s inability to inherently capture the custom logic embedded within the lambda function.  `DistributionLambda`, frequently employed to parameterize probability distributions directly within the model, uses a function not naturally recognized during `model.save()`.  Standard serialization of Keras models relies on a pre-defined set of layers and their associated configurations, often serialized using JSON. A lambda function, being arbitrary Python code, falls outside this set of serializable entities. Therefore, attempting a direct `model.save()` leads to errors concerning unrecognised objects during the deserialization (loading) stage.

To save such models, I have consistently found a two-pronged approach necessary: defining a custom layer encapsulating the logic of the `DistributionLambda` and then saving the model utilizing this new layer definition. I experienced this firsthand working on a reinforcement learning project. We used a `DistributionLambda` to parameterize a Beta distribution representing action selection probabilities. Direct saving failed until we transitioned to a custom layer.  This method allows Keras' serialization mechanism to capture the essence of the layer and its logic effectively. The custom layer will explicitly define the operations originally within the lambda function and provide Keras with the necessary information to reconstruct the layer upon loading.

The fundamental difference between a lambda function and a custom layer revolves around the explicit definition of a layer class that inherits from `tf.keras.layers.Layer` and thereby provides Keras’ internal saving mechanism access to both the layer’s computation and its configuration.  This class structure enables Keras to serialize the layer's architecture, necessary for proper reconstruction on loading. By subclassing `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, we explicitly define a `call` method containing the original logic and the `get_config` method for serialization.

The first example demonstrates the typical, problematic, usage of `DistributionLambda`. Consider a scenario where, following a dense layer, we wish to output parameters for a Gaussian distribution:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
from tensorflow.keras import layers
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Incorrectly saving with DistributionLambda directly
inputs = layers.Input(shape=(10,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
mu = layers.Dense(1)(x)
sigma = layers.Dense(1, activation='softplus')(x) # Ensure positive sigma
distribution_lambda = layers.Lambda(lambda params: tfd.Normal(loc=params[0], scale=params[1]))([mu, sigma])
outputs = distribution_lambda
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# This next line will raise an error during loading
# model.save("problematic_model")
```
Attempting to save this model as demonstrated would produce an error upon model loading. `DistributionLambda` is a functional layer, and `model.save` expects layers to be subclassed.

The second code example provides the necessary change: replacing `DistributionLambda` with a custom layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
from tensorflow.keras import layers
tfd = tfp.distributions

class GaussianDistributionLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(GaussianDistributionLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        mu, sigma = inputs
        return tfd.Normal(loc=mu, scale=sigma)

    def get_config(self):
      config = super().get_config()
      return config


inputs = layers.Input(shape=(10,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
mu = layers.Dense(1)(x)
sigma = layers.Dense(1, activation='softplus')(x)
distribution_layer = GaussianDistributionLayer()([mu, sigma])
outputs = distribution_layer
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.save("saved_model")

loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("saved_model", custom_objects={"GaussianDistributionLayer": GaussianDistributionLayer})

print(loaded_model.summary())
```

Here,  `GaussianDistributionLayer` encapsulates the logic of the original lambda function. The `call` method performs the core operation of creating a `tfd.Normal` distribution instance, and `get_config` is necessary for proper serialization. By inheriting from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, we provide Keras with a mechanism to store and reload this layer during `model.save()` and `load_model()`. Observe the `custom_objects` parameter in `load_model`. This parameter specifies how to load a layer that is not part of Keras' built-in layers.  Without the `custom_objects` argument the loading process will fail with the same error that resulted from saving a model with `DistributionLambda` directly. This corrected implementation saves and loads the model without error.

The third example extends the previous case to demonstrate a more generalizable pattern when dealing with any distribution parameterized by a network using `DistributionLambda` :

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
from tensorflow.keras import layers
tfd = tfp.distributions

class CustomDistributionLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, distribution_fn, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDistributionLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.distribution_fn = distribution_fn

    def call(self, inputs):
      return self.distribution_fn(*inputs)


    def get_config(self):
      config = super().get_config()
      config.update({
          "distribution_fn": self.distribution_fn.__name__
      })
      return config
    @classmethod
    def from_config(cls, config):
        distribution_fn_name = config['distribution_fn']
        distribution_fn = getattr(tfp.distributions, distribution_fn_name)
        config.pop('distribution_fn')
        return cls(distribution_fn=distribution_fn,**config)


inputs = layers.Input(shape=(10,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
mu = layers.Dense(1)(x)
sigma = layers.Dense(1, activation='softplus')(x)
distribution_layer = CustomDistributionLayer(distribution_fn=tfd.Normal)([mu, sigma])
outputs = distribution_layer

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.save("flexible_saved_model")

loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("flexible_saved_model", custom_objects={"CustomDistributionLayer": CustomDistributionLayer})

print(loaded_model.summary())
```
This generalized class, `CustomDistributionLayer`, takes a distribution-generating function (`distribution_fn`) as an argument in its constructor, allowing the custom layer to be used for different types of distributions by passing a callable during instantiation. The `get_config` method stores the `distribution_fn` name, and the `from_config` is used during loading. The `CustomDistributionLayer` can be used for any distribution from `tfp` as long as it takes arguments directly computed in the network. The `distribution_fn` could similarly be any function so long as the return value is a tensor or a distribution object. This example underscores the ability to extend the layer definition to include all kinds of custom logic for your `DistributionLambda` needs.

For deeper understanding, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and model saving. The material provided there outlines the best practices and potential pitfalls, while the TensorFlow Probability documentation provides exhaustive details on the distributions that can be used with the `DistributionLambda`. Additionally, research into the differences between functional and subclassed models will help you understand the design choices in Keras and their implications when it comes to saving and reloading models. Specifically, studying the methods `get_config` and `from_config`  in Keras documentation related to custom layers is necessary to master model saving techniques for models containing a `DistributionLambda`. Further exploration into the inner workings of how Keras handles serialization of layer configurations and weights would also contribute to mastering this problem.
