Training a deep learning model, such as one built with PyTorch, effectively requires a substantial amount of data. Using only two images represents a severe data scarcity problem, significantly hindering the model's ability to generalize and learn meaningful features. The challenge isn't simply about execution—it's about generating a model that is anything beyond arbitrary memorization.

The fundamental difficulty arises from the concept of statistical learning. Models, particularly those with numerous parameters like convolutional neural networks, need diverse examples to discern underlying patterns rather than just specific instances. With only two images, the model is essentially being asked to solve a complex equation with an inadequate number of variables. The training process would likely result in the model overfitting massively to the two provided images, leading to very poor performance on any unseen data.

Let's break down the issues and explore how we can approach this scenario, though it's crucial to understand that genuine, effective training with two images is generally not feasible for the majority of meaningful computer vision tasks. It’s more an exercise in showcasing PyTorch functionality under severe constraints than a practical solution.

First, I must address data loading. PyTorch's `DataLoader` expects a dataset capable of providing batches. Therefore, even with two images, we need to structure them within a dataset class. The simplest form is to just repeat the data, but this is ultimately not helpful for generalization. I would rather focus on demonstrating a functional loop, regardless of data quantity, to showcase the required PyTorch mechanics.

Here’s a basic implementation of a custom dataset class:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

class TwoImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_paths, transform=None):
        self.image_paths = image_paths
        self.transform = transform
        self.images = [Image.open(path).convert("RGB") for path in self.image_paths]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.images)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image = self.images[idx]
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, torch.tensor(idx)  # returns image and a pseudo-label based on index

# Example Usage
image_paths = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"] # Replace with your actual image paths
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

dataset = TwoImageDataset(image_paths, transform=transform)
```

This `TwoImageDataset` class loads images, converts them to RGB, and applies a specified transformation. In this case, I have added a basic resize and conversion to Tensor. Note that, unlike more extensive datasets, we return a placeholder "label" which is essentially just the index of the image. In this context, the label's purpose is primarily to prevent an error during the training loop and its value is irrelevant to any sort of classification task.

Second, it’s necessary to have a model. Given that with two images any meaningful training is impossible, it makes sense to pick a small model that still demonstrates the usage of PyTorch functions, e.g. a simple convolutional model:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 64 * 64, 10)  # Assuming 256x256 input -> 64x64 output

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv1(x), 2))
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv2(x), 2))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 64 * 64)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = SimpleCNN()
```
This `SimpleCNN` model has two convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer. This demonstrates the model definition without being unnecessarily complex for our purposes. The final output layer size is set to 10 arbitrarily –  the specific value has no real relevance here.

Third, we establish a basic training loop. Due to the limited data, a meaningful loss function calculation is impossible. Since we're just showcasing the training mechanics rather than aiming for real training, we use a placeholder loss:

```python
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Dummy data
image_paths = ["dummy1.jpg", "dummy2.jpg"]
dummy_image = Image.new('RGB', (256, 256), color='red')
dummy_image.save(image_paths[0])
dummy_image.save(image_paths[1])


transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

dataset = TwoImageDataset(image_paths, transform=transform)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)

# Model, optimizer, loss function
model = SimpleCNN()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for images, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        # dummy labels because of no meaningful classification task
        pseudo_labels = labels.to(torch.long)
        loss = loss_function(outputs, pseudo_labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
In this loop, we iterate through the `DataLoader` (though, in this case, we process both images in a single batch since batch_size is two). We calculate the output, and then a dummy loss. The loss is just a demonstration, as is the choice of CrossEntropyLoss (it's commonly used for classification, but there’s no classification problem here.) The optimizer updates model parameters using backpropagation based on the gradients.

These three examples show the basic structure of data loading, model definition, and training loop that are necessary even with a very small amount of training data. The problem, however, is that the model parameters are essentially changing randomly given the lack of informative gradients.

Given these limitations, I strongly advise against attempting to train a model with two images in most practical scenarios. Instead, focus on strategies like data augmentation (if possible), transfer learning from a model pre-trained on a large dataset, or gathering more data. For those encountering severe data limitations, strategies such as few-shot learning may be of interest, as they try to learn models with less data, but they still require at least several examples per class.

For resources, I recommend: the official PyTorch documentation; books on deep learning for computer vision; university course materials on machine learning; and tutorials focused on PyTorch. A strong theoretical understanding will help in understanding the limitations of training with minimal data.
