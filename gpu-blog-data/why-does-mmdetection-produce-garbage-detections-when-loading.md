MMDetection's failure to produce meaningful detections when loading a custom training checkpoint for inference often stems from inconsistencies between the training and inference configurations, particularly concerning the model architecture, data preprocessing, and post-processing parameters.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects – ranging from pedestrian detection in aerial imagery to object recognition in medical scans – I've identified three primary culprits.


**1. Model Architecture Discrepancies:**  A seemingly minor difference in the model's architecture between training and inference can lead to catastrophic failures. This includes variations in the number of classes, the backbone network, the head configuration (e.g., number of convolutional layers in the classification or regression heads), and the use of auxiliary heads.  The checkpoint file encapsulates the trained weights corresponding to a specific architecture. Loading this checkpoint into a model with a different architecture results in a mismatch, leading to unpredictable and often nonsensical outputs.  This is not merely a matter of having different hyperparameters; the underlying network structure must be identical.


**2. Data Preprocessing Inconsistency:**  The preprocessing pipeline applied during training must be meticulously replicated during inference.  This encompasses normalization parameters (mean and standard deviation), image resizing strategies (including aspect ratio preservation and padding techniques), and any data augmentations that were applied during training.  MMDetection utilizes a configuration file to define these steps. Any divergence between the training and inference configurations regarding these preprocessing stages will cause the input to the model to deviate significantly from the distribution it was trained on, thus generating incorrect or severely degraded detections. Failure to precisely mirror the training-time preprocessing steps is arguably the most frequent source of these problems.


**3. Post-Processing Parameter Mismatch:**  The final stage involves post-processing the raw model outputs.  This crucial step translates the model's raw predictions (bounding boxes and confidence scores) into final detections. Parameters controlling Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), score thresholds, and potentially other post-processing steps (e.g., those related to anchor generation or refinement) must precisely match the configurations used during training.  Inconsistent NMS thresholds, for instance, can drastically alter the number and quality of the detected objects.   Overlooking these subtle but critical details is a common mistake that leads to seemingly inexplicable detection failures.


Let's illustrate these points with concrete examples using Python and the MMDetection framework.  Assume we have a trained model checkpoint saved as `my_model.pth`.

**Example 1: Model Architecture Mismatch**

```python
# Incorrect Inference Configuration
config_file = 'configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py' # Using a different backbone
checkpoint_file = 'my_model.pth'

# ... (rest of the inference code) ...
```

This example demonstrates a common error: using a different backbone network (e.g., ResNet-50 in the config file, but the checkpoint is trained using ResNet-101). Even if the overall architecture appears similar, the mismatch in the backbone's feature extraction capabilities will severely affect performance.  Correcting this requires aligning the inference configuration's backbone definition with the one used during training.


**Example 2: Data Preprocessing Discrepancy**

```python
# Incorrect Inference Configuration
config_file = 'configs/my_custom_config.py' # Configuration with wrong normalization parameters

# ... (within my_custom_config.py) ...
img_norm_cfg = dict(
    mean=[123.675, 116.28, 103.53], # Incorrect mean values
    std=[58.395, 57.12, 57.375], # Incorrect std values
    to_rgb=True)

# ... (rest of the inference code) ...
```

This code snippet shows an incorrect normalization configuration.  If the mean and standard deviation values in the inference configuration differ from those used during training, the model's input will be substantially altered, impacting the detection accuracy drastically.  The solution involves meticulously checking the `img_norm_cfg` and all other preprocessing steps in the configuration file to ensure they perfectly match the training configuration.


**Example 3: Post-Processing Parameter Mismatch**

```python
# Incorrect Inference Configuration
config_file = 'configs/my_custom_config.py'

# ... (within my_custom_config.py) ...
test_pipeline = [
    # ... (other pipeline steps) ...
    dict(type='NMS', iou_threshold=0.7),  # Incorrect NMS threshold
    # ... (other pipeline steps) ...
]

# ... (rest of the inference code) ...
```

This example highlights an erroneous NMS threshold. If this value differs from the training configuration, the results will vary.  A higher NMS threshold might suppress more bounding boxes, leading to missed detections, while a lower threshold may result in numerous false positives. Ensuring consistency in the `test_pipeline` parameters, including NMS thresholds, score thresholds, and any other post-processing steps, is paramount.


**Resource Recommendations:**

To resolve these issues effectively, carefully review the MMDetection documentation, particularly the sections detailing configuration files, data preprocessing, and post-processing.  Thoroughly examine the training configuration file to ensure a perfect replication during inference.  Utilize debugging tools to meticulously analyze the model's intermediate outputs and identify the specific stage where inconsistencies emerge.  Consider leveraging visualization techniques to compare the preprocessed inputs and raw predictions between training and inference. Finally, consult the MMDetection community forums for assistance with specific error messages or troubleshooting strategies.  Systematic and methodical comparison of the configurations at each stage is critical.
