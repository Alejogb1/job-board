When a program terminates due to an unhandled signal, such as a user pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal, or when `exit()` is explicitly called, the standard C++ runtime environment does not guarantee the invocation of destructors for stack-allocated objects within the `main()` function scope, or any scope that has not completed normal execution. This behavior arises because termination, in these cases, is not considered a normal exit flow; it bypasses the usual mechanisms that ensure cleanup. The operating system reclaims the program's memory, including the stack, directly, rendering explicit destructor calls redundant from the OS' perspective.

The core issue stems from the difference between a program's *normal* exit path and its *abnormal* termination. During normal program execution, objects constructed within a function scope undergo automatic destruction when that scope is exited. This destruction is managed via the concept of Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), where objects hold resources, and their destructors are used to release those resources. When a function returns normally, local objects are destroyed in reverse order of construction. However, when a program terminates abruptly, that normal unwinding of the call stack, a process necessary to trigger the destructor, is bypassed, preventing destructors from executing.

Signals, like `SIGINT` (generated by Ctrl+C), are asynchronous notifications that interrupt program execution. When a program receives such a signal and lacks a custom handler, the default action is termination. The operating system steps in to reclaim the process' resources instead of executing code to cleanly exit. System calls like `exit()` also terminate execution immediately; the runtime environment, responsible for managing stack unwinding, is bypassed in favor of a clean OS-level program exit. This prevents the execution of stack objects' destructors. The responsibility for resource deallocation falls to the OS in these cases.

To illustrate this behavior, consider the following example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Resource {
public:
    Resource(const std::string& name) : name_(name) {
        std::cout << "Resource " << name_ << " acquired." << std::endl;
    }
    ~Resource() {
        std::cout << "Resource " << name_ << " released." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string name_;
};

int main() {
    Resource r1("Resource1");
    Resource r2("Resource2");

    // Intentional infinite loop
    while (true) {
        // Simulate processing, preventing clean exit
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this first example, the program enters an infinite loop within `main()`. I’ve specifically omitted any means for a normal exit; pressing Ctrl+C will cause the program to terminate abruptly. The output will only show the construction messages, such as "Resource Resource1 acquired" and "Resource Resource2 acquired." The destructors will not be executed, because the program doesn't complete its natural course and allow stack unwinding to take place.

The next example demonstrates the behavior with a program exit via `std::exit()`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

class Resource {
public:
    Resource(const std::string& name) : name_(name) {
        std::cout << "Resource " << name_ << " acquired." << std::endl;
    }
    ~Resource() {
        std::cout << "Resource " << name_ << " released." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string name_;
};

int main() {
    Resource r1("Resource1");
    Resource r2("Resource2");

    std::cout << "Exiting program." << std::endl;
    std::exit(0); // Explicit program termination

    return 0; // Never reaches
}
```

Here, `std::exit(0)` terminates the program directly after outputting "Exiting program." Again, while the constructor messages are printed, the destructor messages will not be displayed. Because `std::exit` causes the operating system to immediately stop the program, the typical mechanisms for destruction of stack objects are bypassed. It’s important to note that this behavior also extends to scenarios where the program is terminated using `abort()`.

Finally, the third example will demonstrate normal execution, where the destructors *are* called as expected.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Resource {
public:
    Resource(const std::string& name) : name_(name) {
        std::cout << "Resource " << name_ << " acquired." << std::endl;
    }
    ~Resource() {
        std::cout << "Resource " << name_ << " released." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string name_;
};

void function() {
    Resource r3("Resource3");
    // r3 will be destroyed as the scope ends
}

int main() {
    Resource r1("Resource1");
    {
      Resource r2("Resource2");
    }
    function();
    return 0; // normal exit
}
```

In this case, the output will show construction messages for "Resource1," "Resource2," and "Resource3," followed by destruction messages in the reverse order of construction "Resource3 released," "Resource2 released," and "Resource1 released." The destructor of the Resource object declared in `function` is called before the return from that function, while the Resource declared within the inner scope of `main` is called when that inner scope is exited. This example highlights the normal course of object destruction with typical stack unwinding. The last destructor of Resource objects declared in main will only be invoked upon the normal completion of main and subsequent program termination.

Understanding this distinction is critical in resource management and preventing memory leaks, or the unintended loss of data. While stack-allocated object destructors aren’t reliably called during abnormal termination, this does not apply to objects allocated with `new` on the heap. Those resources will leak unless explicit deallocation is performed. Therefore, it is paramount that resource management, particularly for heap allocation, is handled by RAII through class objects (smart pointers) or other mechanisms that ensure resource deallocation via standard library constructs, even if abrupt termination is a possibility.

For resources that must be released prior to termination, custom signal handlers and/or atexit-registered functions can be used to implement specific cleanup routines. However, it should be approached with caution. Unpredictable interactions between cleanup code and a potentially unstable environment during abnormal termination can introduce other issues. Generally, the OS reclaiming the system memory and program resources through a hard shutdown is considered sufficient.

For further exploration of these concepts, I recommend consulting books specializing in advanced C++ programming practices. Textbooks covering exception safety, resource management, and operating systems interaction are particularly useful. Specific documentation on `std::exit()`, `abort()`, and signal handling within the C++ standard libraries and operating system documentation should also be consulted. Finally, reviewing material on RAII can solidify understanding on how to properly handle resource allocation and deallocation throughout the program.
