Storing 100 million 2D bit values in Ruby efficiently, with a primary focus on minimizing memory footprint, necessitates moving away from standard Ruby data structures like arrays of booleans or integers. The core issue resides in the fact that each boolean in Ruby typically consumes far more than a single bit of memory due to object overhead. Instead, bit manipulation at the byte level is crucial for achieving substantial memory savings. I've tackled similar data storage challenges in high-volume sensor data processing, where memory limitations are always a primary design constraint.

The key insight here is to use Ruby's `String` or `Array` of unsigned 8-bit integers (bytes) as a contiguous region of memory, treating each bit within those bytes as individual binary values. Instead of directly storing true/false values, we will map them to specific bit positions within the byte sequence. This approach drastically reduces the memory overhead associated with Ruby's object model.

Let's break this down. For a 2D structure, we can represent this as a single one-dimensional space. Given that we need to store 100 million bits, the total number of bits required is 100,000,000. Since 8 bits equals 1 byte, we need approximately 12,500,000 bytes. We can think of this 1D array of bits as a flattened representation of the 2D grid where one can map the 2D coordinate (x,y) to a single index. I've seen this flattened index being useful in various image manipulation and spatial indexing algorithms.

We can represent this using an `Array` of bytes, where each element represents a byte with eight bits. The key operations then become setting and retrieving individual bits, which is done using bitwise operators.

**Example 1: Setting a bit**

```ruby
class BitGrid
  attr_reader :data, :width, :height

  def initialize(width, height)
    @width = width
    @height = height
    size_in_bits = width * height
    size_in_bytes = (size_in_bits + 7) / 8 # Ceiling division to get bytes
    @data = Array.new(size_in_bytes, 0) # initialize with 0's (all bits off)
  end

  def set_bit(x, y, value)
    if x >= @width || y >= @height || x < 0 || y < 0
      raise ArgumentError, "Coordinates out of bounds"
    end
    index = y * @width + x # Flattened index
    byte_index = index / 8 # Which byte contains the bit
    bit_position = index % 8 # Which bit position within the byte

    if value # Setting the bit
      @data[byte_index] |= (1 << bit_position)
    else # Clearing the bit
      @data[byte_index] &= ~(1 << bit_position)
    end

  end
end

# Example usage
grid = BitGrid.new(10000, 10000) # 100 Million bits total
grid.set_bit(500, 500, true) # Set bit at (500, 500)
```

In this example, `BitGrid` encapsulates the byte array storage. The `set_bit` method calculates the appropriate byte and bit position using integer division and modulo operation based on the flattened index. Bitwise OR operator (`|=`) with a left-shifted 1 sets the bit and bitwise AND operator (`&=`) with a bitwise NOT combined with a left-shifted 1 clears the bit. The initial `Array.new` call with 0 guarantees the bits starts turned off and the size calculation ensures no memory wastage. This is similar to how Iâ€™ve optimized memory usage in custom compression algorithms for real-time data streams.

**Example 2: Retrieving a bit**

```ruby
class BitGrid
  # same as example 1, except adding get_bit method

  def get_bit(x, y)
    if x >= @width || y >= @height || x < 0 || y < 0
      raise ArgumentError, "Coordinates out of bounds"
    end
    index = y * @width + x
    byte_index = index / 8
    bit_position = index % 8

    (@data[byte_index] & (1 << bit_position)) != 0 # Check if the bit is 1
  end
end

# Example Usage
grid = BitGrid.new(10000, 10000)
grid.set_bit(500, 500, true)
puts "Bit at (500, 500): #{grid.get_bit(500, 500)}" # Output: true
puts "Bit at (499, 499): #{grid.get_bit(499, 499)}" # Output: false
```

The `get_bit` method follows a similar process of calculating the byte and bit index. It then uses a bitwise AND operator `&` with a left-shifted 1 to isolate the value of that specific bit. Comparing this result with 0 effectively returns the boolean representation of the bit value. This precise bit-level retrieval was crucial in a project I worked on that involved real-time analysis of binary log files.

**Example 3: Handling large grids with String class**

```ruby
class BitGridString
  attr_reader :data, :width, :height

  def initialize(width, height)
    @width = width
    @height = height
    size_in_bits = width * height
    size_in_bytes = (size_in_bits + 7) / 8
    @data = "\x00" * size_in_bytes #initialize with null characters (all bits off)
  end

  def set_bit(x, y, value)
    if x >= @width || y >= @height || x < 0 || y < 0
      raise ArgumentError, "Coordinates out of bounds"
    end
      index = y * @width + x
      byte_index = index / 8
      bit_position = index % 8
    if value
      @data[byte_index] = (@data[byte_index].ord | (1 << bit_position)).chr
    else
     @data[byte_index] = (@data[byte_index].ord & ~(1 << bit_position)).chr
    end
  end

  def get_bit(x, y)
    if x >= @width || y >= @height || x < 0 || y < 0
      raise ArgumentError, "Coordinates out of bounds"
    end
    index = y * @width + x
    byte_index = index / 8
    bit_position = index % 8
    (@data[byte_index].ord & (1 << bit_position)) != 0
  end
end

# Example usage, identical to the previous Array examples:
grid_string = BitGridString.new(10000, 10000)
grid_string.set_bit(500, 500, true)
puts "Bit at (500, 500): #{grid_string.get_bit(500, 500)}"
puts "Bit at (499, 499): #{grid_string.get_bit(499, 499)}"
```

In this modification, the underlying data structure is now a Ruby `String`. Strings in Ruby are mutable byte sequences, making them viable for such bit manipulations. In this modified example, we use the `ord` method to retrieve the ASCII integer representation of the character at a given index before performing bitwise operations and back to a character using `chr`. This offers the same fundamental approach, but using strings instead of byte arrays. I found String particularly useful when needing to pass the bit representation around in the network as it simplifies the serialization process.

The main distinction between `Array` of integers and the `String` approach often hinges on how the data will be manipulated beyond these core methods, the `String` approach might be better suited for network data. Both approaches significantly improve memory footprint compared to naive boolean array usage.

**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  **Ruby Core Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the `Array` and `String` classes, paying particular attention to their methods dealing with element access and manipulation.
2. **Bitwise Operators in Ruby:** Investigate Ruby's bitwise operators such as `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, and `>>`. Understanding how these operators work is paramount to successful bit manipulation.
3. **Data Structures and Algorithms Textbooks:** Review foundational data structures and algorithms resources which should cover bit manipulation techniques and concepts of sparse data storage. This often provides a broader perspective on data compression strategies.

Through practical application in data-intensive scenarios, I've found this bit-level representation to be essential in reducing memory consumption for large boolean datasets. When dealing with 100 million 2D values, this is a necessity rather than an optimization and the choice between `Array` or `String` depends on specific project requirements.
